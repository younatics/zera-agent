"PORTSMOUTH, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- Sen. John McCain's visit Tuesday to Concord High School proved to be more than the average guest speaker appearance, with the Republican presidential candidate giving and getting a dose of the campaign's trademark ""straight talk."" While campaigning Tuesday with her husband, Cindy McCain uses crutches after twisting her knee. During the question-and-answer session, one student rose and asked a pointed question about McCain's age, 71: ""If elected, you'd be older than Ronald Reagan, making you the oldest president. Do you ever worry that, like, you might die in office or get Alzheimer's or some other disease that might affect your judgment?"" The Arizona senator chuckled slightly as comments of ""Oh my God"" filled the room. In a self-deprecating reference to his memory, McCain said his children have joked about their father ""hiding his own Easter eggs,"" but quickly added that he is a ""24-7"" worker and will out-campaign any of his rivals. McCain ended the exchange in his quintessential style: ""Thanks for the question, you little jerk. ... You're drafted."" Another student then asked McCain a question about what he would do for rights for ""LGBTs"" -- lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. McCain was confused by the question and acknowledged to the audience that he did not know what the initials meant. Once the meaning was clarified, McCain told sophomore William Sleaster he is opposed to any form of discrimination, but he supports the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy and he opposes same-sex marriage. ""I believe that the sanctity of marriage between man and woman is unique and should be preserved, and I understand the controversy that swirls around that issue, and that debate needs to be continued to be held, but I support that position,"" McCain said. ""You want to take away someone's rights because you believe it's wrong,"" Sleaster followed up. ""I don't put that interpretation on my position, but I understand yours,"" McCain responded, seeming to enjoy the back and forth. ""I came here looking to see a good leader. I don't,"" Sleaster said before leaving the microphone to some boos and gasps from the audience and an eventual scolding by a school administrator. ""Listen, I understand,"" McCain told the buzzing crowd. ""I thank you. That's what America is all about, and I appreciate your views."" Asked later at a news conference, McCain said he had never heard the initials ""LGBT"" before, but knew the phrase. Iraq dominated much of McCain's comments before the packed auditorium. He reiterated his support for U.S. strategy there, and played up his criticism of the way the war was handled until recently. ""I was the only one of the major Republican candidates who adamantly, vociferously opposed the [former Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld strategy and fought hard for the strategy [of using more troops] that we're employing today,"" he told reporters. ""The others thought it was fine. That's because they don't have the knowledge or background and experience that I do on issues of national security. That's a clear indication of it.""

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Luge is a dangerous sport in which accidents happen. That was the refrain from athlete after athlete when asked how they felt about the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who was killed when he flew off the Olympic track during training in Whistler on Friday. But luge athletes will be the first  to tell you they are more driving technicians than adrenaline junkies, and when pressed about why they would participate in a sport that's so dangerous, several concede they don't consider the sport to be that risky. Amidst the shock at the death of a young athlete, the fact has been lost that in the hands -- and feet -- of masters, luge is relatively safe. A 1997 paper in the American Journal of Sports Medicine analyzed luge injuries between 1985 and '92 on the Lake Placid, New York, luge course, a track that sliders consider to be technically trickier, though slower, than Whistler. The conclusion was that luge on that difficult track is remarkably safe. With ""injury rates comparable with recreational skiing,"" the study says, ""the sport of luge is quite safe... despite the appearance of danger."" The study analyzed 57,244 runs by competitive, or training to be competitive, men and women from 12- to 35-years-old. It recorded 407 injuries. The vast majority of those were bruises, scrapes and muscle strains. Luge is rough on the back and neck muscles. During the seven years, a mere 10 injuries were serious enough, like a broken bone, to force the athlete to miss a week or more of practice. According to the study, athletes were more likely to get hurt away from the track while carrying their sleds than to suffer a major injury on it. The grand total of concussions recorded was 10. A six-year study of the National Football League found, conservatively, that a concussion happened about every other game. Because 16 games are played on the opening NFL weekend, concussions during pro football should surpass seven years of Lake Placid luge in Week 2 of the season. And never mind boxing, where athletes are occasionally killed, and the actual goal is to physically insult the brain of a competitor until he or she is unable to stand. It's a discrepancy that Canadian luge coach Wolfgang Staudinger, who was angered that the men's race was moved to the lower women's start after Kumaritashvili's death, was quick to address. The speed of race cars is not reduced every time a professional driver crashes and dies, he said.  For that matter, nor are speed limits on roads, where 37,261 people in the United States died in crashes in 2008. That said, nothing would be wrong with reducing speeds at the Whistler course; the sport is just as exciting for fans at 80 mph as at 90 mph. As for the Lake Placid luge analysis, study author Dr. Robert Cummings, an orthopedic surgeon in Concord, New Hampshire, said different tracks have different hazards. (Cummings was a competitive luger himself, and said he never suffered a serious injury.) Much was made of the Whistler track being the world's fastest after a German slider topped 95 mph on it last year. Kumaritashvili was going 88 mph when he crashed. And yet, in the three years of its existence, the Whistler track's crash stats are in line with other tracks around the world, according to officials from the International Luge Federation. Out of more than 30,000 runs in the three sliding sports -- bobsled, luge and skeleton -- Whistler has seen 340 crashes. Lugers and coaches at the Olympics said that they've never seen an athlete fly off the course entirely, as Kumaritashvili did. ""Everything came together at the same time,"" said Tony Benshoof, a U.S. luger who finished eighth on Sunday, ""but there are places on every track where that could feasibly happen."" For another view, click here . But it essentially doesn't happen. This was a terrible, terrible, freak accident. U.S. luge coach Wolfgang Schaedler says he hasn't seen an athlete fly off a course in his 35 years in the sport. That isn't to say that the modifications in Whistler -- the ice on curve 16 was shaved to make it harder for sleds to go up the wall, a new retaining wall was put in place and a lower start is being used -- are not perfectly prudent. Perhaps retaining walls should be put along every curve at every track in the world. Even the athletes who were upset at the change of their starting spots said the luge federation had to show the world how serious it is about safety. What happened to Kumaritashvili was a tragedy so deeply affecting that athletes who should have been basking in the realization of their Olympic dreams were frequently choking back tears. Still, they agreed that the rush to see every luge run as a gambler's game of life and death is a characterization that can only be made by those who started following the sport on that tragic Friday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Epstein.","David Epstein says Georgian luger's death at Whistler track was a freak accident .

"(CNN) -- ""If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be punishment -- as well as the prison."" Fyodor Dostoyevsky . A year after QPR played Chelsea at Loftus Road in an English Premier League game there is no sign of the rancor in the racism case involving John Terry and Anton Ferdinand diminishing. Rancor which has prompted despair from media commentators at the systematic abuse players dish out to one another, their refusal to engage in the pre-match handshake ritual and abusive tweets from players and fans alike. Prior to Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole labeling the FA as a bunch of twats in the saga, players' union chief Gordon Taylor, who is the Professional Footballers' Association chief executive, likened the dispute to a ""mafia feud"", while former English Football Association chairman Lord Triesman believes is is ""unconscionable"" the case has rumbled on for nearly a year. Last month Chelsea captain Terry was handed a four-match ban and a $356,000 fine by the English Football Association after being found guilty of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry's punishment came just days after he announced his retirement from international football, claiming that England's governing body had made his position within the national team ""untenable"". In July, the 31-year-old defender had been found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offense at Westminster Magistrates' Court. However the FA requires a lower burden of proof than an English court and it took the decision to bring Terry before its disciplinary system . Published last week, the FA's 63-page report into the case made for uncomfortable reading as it detailed the dispute and its subsequent fall out over the last year. Racism remains ""significant"" problem in English football . Prior to punishing Terry, the FA also had to deal with another racism case, handing Liverpool striker Luis Suarez an eight-match ban and a Â£64,000 fine after finding the Uruguayan guilty of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The rights and wrongs of Suarez's punishment and of the Terry case -- should the FA, for example, have charged the Chelsea captain after he had been cleared in a court of law -- have been played out endlessly in the media and across social-networking websites like Twitter. But Terry's punishment and his perceived bitterness regarding the way he has been treated also raises questions about the way the FA, indeed all sports organizations, punish players. Why for example does any punitive action taken not incorporate a rehabilitation approach as recently suggested by PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle? With black youth unemployment approaching 50 percent in some areas of London, why doesn't the FA insist that Terry spends a significant number of hours working within an inner-city community project? Likewise why doesn't the FA donate Terry's fine to grassroots projects actively involved in building better community relations? Mourinho defends Terry in racism case . The FA's position is that it is a not for profit organization and all the money that it makes goes directly back into football, either through the professional game structure or directly as investment back into the grassroots structure. ""There doesn't seem to be much appetite for creativity from the Football Association,"" Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe, told CNN, after being asked whether a ""rehabilitation"" approach might be more productive in the long term. ""Rehabilitation is a fundamental principle of British justice and we still believe in it,"" added Powar. ""That is how our justice system works and the idea of rehabilitation should be applied to English football. ""The Terry case has dragged on for so long that it has allowed for some very mixed messages to come out, so I think a rehabilitation sanction is a really good idea. ""What can we think of that allows him to feel that he is not being persecuted?"" Liverpool's Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks . However, one Premier League footballer has reservations about such an approach. ""I think that in principle the idea is a noble one,"" said the Secret Footballer, who writes anonymously about his experiences of playing in the Premier League. ""How would the FA pick an organisation or youth team without being biased? ""It's a bit like politics -- nobody is happy with the current situation but nobody seems to have a practical alternative. ""I think the FA are bound by what they can and can't do from a legal standpoint. Fines and bans are written in to contracts and players agree to the possibility of this action when they sign a specific contract with the FA. ""Most players do this anyway. Every team has a 'in the community' vehicle that it uses mainly to capture the next generation of supporters and players. ""All players take it in turn to meet the kids, answer questions, give out awards and play in a little game with them. ""You won't read about that though because it isn't very interesting. Down the rabbit hole: Depression in the Premier League . ""We're talking about punishment for racist abuse here. I certainly don't feel that coaching a group of kids for a week is a suitable punishment. ""As a parent would you want your Black or Asian child to be coached by a player that is only there because he has been charged and subsequently convicted of racist abuse? I don't think I would."" The Secret Footballer insisted that there was nothing more professional footballers hated than missing games. ""Missing games hurts footballers more than any other punishment, if we are to buy in to a zero tolerance approach, then the punishment needs to fit the crime and we should not be scared to level 10 game bans for players found guilty of racist abuse. Like Suarez."" Sanctions . In recent years it has been argued that leading sports bodies have not always been consistent in the way players, clubs and or federations have been sanctioned. In November 2011, UEFA fined the Bulgarian Football Union $52,000 for its fans' racist abuse of England players during a Euro 2012 qualifier in Sofia in September last year. Fast forward to Euro 2012 and UEFA fined Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner $125,800 for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company as he celebrated scoring against Portugal. Likewise in November, FIFA president Sepp Blatter suggested that players who have been racially abused should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on. A new approach? Over in the United States, various different sports have been testing the water in trying to come up with different ways of punishing miscreant players. Notably the NBA wants to penalize divers or ""floppers"" for repeated violations of an act the league says has ""no place in our game"". Players will get a warning the first time, then be fined $5,000 for a second violation. The fines increase to $10,000 for a third offense, $15,000 for a fourth and $30,000 the fifth time. Six or more could lead to a suspension. However, the players' association plans to file a grievance with the league office and an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, arguing that it should have been consulted first before the new rules were implemented. That NBA approach might win the support of Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, who called for the FA to punish Liverpool striker Suarez for diving after a 0-0 draw at Anfield on Sunday. Major League Soccer's Disciplinary Committee has also been coming down hard on cheating players in the U.S., but retrospectively . Every week the committee -- a body of five people whose names are not public -- announces suspensions and fines for actions that were not caught by the referee in the previous weekend's games. The league owners want to change the culture of the league from being ""physical"" to more ""creative"", but the players are unhappy that the league is ""re-refereeing"" games. Meanwhile, back in England, intriguingly it is understood that a ""rehabilitation"" approach could be considered by the FA in the future. Watch this space.","Fallout from racism case involving John Terry and Anton Ferdinand shows no sign of going away .

"(CNN)  -- On Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted the former director of the liver transplant program at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, for allegedly lying about a liver accepted for one patient but transplanted instead into another patient who was lower on the waiting list. Dr. Richard R. Lopez Jr., 54, of the Cheviot Hills area of West Los Angeles, was named in the eight-count indictment, which accuses him of conspiracy, concealment of a material fact and six counts of falsification of records, the U.S. Attorney's office for the Central District of California said in the indictment. The alleged incident occurred in September 2003, when the hospital was offered a liver for one of its patients, identified as A-H. Patient A-H was second on the match list because of his poor condition, but he was in his home country of Saudi Arabia, the indictment said. The next patient listed for the liver was at another area hospital, it said. Instead of telling the organ procurement organization of the switch and letting the organ be offered to the backup patient, Lopez approved acceptance of the liver and its transplantation into A-B, a patient at St. Vincent, the indictment said. A-B was ranked 52nd on the match list behind nine other St. Vincent patients, it added. After A-B got the liver, Lopez and his co-conspirators falsely told authorities at the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) -- the private, nonprofit organization that contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services to allocate donated organs -- that A-H had received the liver, the 19-page indictment says. Lopez later submitted a falsified pathology report on A-H's removed liver, it added. That led officials to remove the ailing A-H from the wait list, even as Lopez was telling the man that he was still on the list, the indictment said. In April 2004, Lopez told A-H to return from Saudi Arabia to the United States, which he did, it said. But by that time, A-H was too sick to undergo a transplant, so he returned to Saudi Arabia, where he died, the indictment said. The indictment further alleges that Lopez and unnamed co-conspirators asserted in reports filed until 2005 with UNOS that A-H had in fact received the transplant. That year, management at the hospital discovered the switch and cover-up and told authorities, it said. ""It came to light after UNOS did a routine audit,"" said Consuelo S. Woodhead, assistant U.S. attorney, major frauds section, in a telephone interview. A new administrative head of the hospital's transplant program ""basically discovered that he [A-H] had not been transplanted and she reported it to upper management, and upper management reported it to UNOS,"" Woodhead said. Asked what might have motivated Lopez, she said, ""I really can't comment on that."" She noted that the charges stem from the alleged cover-up, ""not from the decision to make the switch."" Though it appears that, in making the switch, Lopez violated UNOS regulations, federal authorities did not address whether those violations rose to the level of a federal crime, she said. ""The system that's in place is a very admirable system, if people would play by the rules, because it is a system designed to ensure equity in the allocation of livers,"" she said. ""It sets us apart from countries where people literally traffic in these organs for money. It is a system very worth protecting, but the integrity of the system depends first and foremost on people being honest with the system. If you actually lie about who got a liver, that's a really fundamental perversion of the system."" St. Vincent cut its ties with Lopez in 2005 and ended its liver transplant program in 2006 as a result of the incident, said Sharon Greengold, director of marketing, in a telephone interview. Lopez's lawyer, James T. Duff, said he had not read the indictment, but denied that his client had falsified any documents and said Lopez's decision to transplant A-B was based on medical need. ""A medical decision was made that that individual was going to die, and if a transplant was not made he would have died. That individual is alive today because of the transplant."" A UNOS spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The hospital has cooperated with authorities in the investigation, the U.S. Attorney's office said. In a written statement, the hospital said it was ""pleased that the federal prosecutors have concluded their investigation, and that the actions of a rogue physician, acting outside of the scope of his duties and hospital policy, were criminal in nature."" Lopez is scheduled to make his initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on January 25. If convicted on all eight counts, he faces a maximum penalty of 130 years in federal prison. The case was investigated by agents from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General and the FBI.","Dr. Richard R.

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of Congress and their staffs would be prohibited from using insider legislative information for investment purposes under legislation filed Tuesday in the wake of a CBS News ""60 Minutes"" report. On Sunday, ""60 Minutes"" aired a report highlighting instances in which congressional officials reportedly bought stocks around the same time Congress was discussing legislation affecting those companies or industries. The show looked at the investments of various lawmakers -- including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Speaker John Boehner and Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama. The bill filed Tuesday by Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown would make it illegal for elected congressional officials, their staffs and executive branch employees to use information about pending bills that's not available to the general public in making investment decisions. It would also forbid them from making such information public for personal gain. Brown's bill, which he called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK Act, would clarify insider trading regulations that do not clearly identify whether the use of inside government information constitutes insider trading. ""Members of Congress should live under the same laws as everyone else. If they trade on inside knowledge to line their own pockets, they should be punished,"" Brown said in a statement, without referencing any of the officials named in the report. ""Serving the public is a privilege and honor, not an opportunity for personal gain."" On Sunday, Pelosi fired back at the report, dismissing claims that her 2008 purchase with her husband of 5,000 shares of the initial public offering of credit card company Visa conflicted with a piece of legislation -- opposed by credit-card companies -- that was making its way through the House. ""It is very troubling that '60 Minutes' would base their reporting off of an already-discredited conservative author who has made a career of out attacking Democrats,"" Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement soon after the report aired. He added that Congress passed even stronger credit card legislation at about the same time. In addition to Pelosi, the CBS report looked at the investments of of Bachus and Boehner. Bachus bought options funds betting financial markets would fall at about the same time he met with with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and lawmakers about the imminent collapse of the global economy, CBS reported. He also traded General Electric stock, and roughly a third of GE's business is in financial services, CBS reported. CBS said Boehner bought health insurance stocks during the health care debate, which increased in value after Republicans succeeded in killing a proposal to allow the government to offer a health insurance plan to compete with private companies. In a statement, Bachus' office said the representative never trades financial services stocks or trades on private information. Boehner said at a news conference that he has not made decisions on his stock portfolio for years.","Bill would prohibit members of Congress, their staffs, from trading on inside information .

"(CNN) -- Salwa Salah was 16 years old when she was arrested by Israeli forces and jailed for seven months. Israeli court minutes said Salwa Salah, 16, had been involved in ""planning military operations."" To this day she says she does not know her crime and is struggling to get her life back on track. She was released shortly before her final school exams but was unable to catch up and now has to re-sit before she can go to university. Salah was held under administrative detention - detention without charge or trial. It is legal under international law which permits its use only in exceptional cases to protect the security of a state. But human rights groups say Israel abuses this right. A report released Wednesday by human rights groups B'Tselem and HaMoked has called on Israel to release the detainees or charge them. They say there are currently 335 Palestinians being held under administrative detention, three of them women, one a minor. When asked about Salah's case, Israeli prosecutors gave CNN the court minutes which read, ""It has been shown that the prisoner was involved in planning military operations very close to the time that she was detained.""  Watch more about the story » . Salah insists she is a schoolgirl and not a terrorist but no further information was given to her lawyer. Much of the evidence in these cases remains secret. Sahar Francis, a lawyer from Ademeer human rights association said: ""It is submitted to the military judge and me as a lawyer. I don't have access to this file so actually I can't defend my clients properly since I don't know what the exact suspicion against my client is."" Talking to CNN about her incarceration, Salah said the prison conditions were fit only for animals and she found her time inside psychologically hard. ""The prisoner does not know if he or she is going to be released or not,"" she said. ""So sitting in a prison confused and weary asking 'am I going to be released?' You are distorted by this one question."" Israel says administrative detention is a valuable pre-emptive tool in its ongoing war on terrorism and often evidence cannot be made public. Lt. Col Maurice Hirsch, Israeli prosecutor, said: ""Most of the evidence is not shown to the detainee but rather is kept a secret in order to protect the lives of the people that provide the information and the technological means by which the information is acquired."" The al-Hidmi family has found itself on the wrong side of administrative detention for many years. One son Islam, 20, was held for twenty one months without charge or trial. Two months ago there was an emotional homecoming for Islam, his mother had not seen him since his arrest. Two weeks ago, Islam was arrested again, again without charge. Islam's brother, Wa'ad is also in prison. Held since April 2008 from the age of 16, his administrative detention has been renewed six times. His father Arafat al-Hidmi tells CNN, ""They arrested him and said this is an administrative detention meaning his file is secret and no-one can look at it except the Israelis."" His mother, Fawzia al-Hidmi says of her 18 year old son, ""I want my son here so he can do his exams and I can be proud like everyone else who celebrated their children's graduation."" Both sons had previously been charged with throwing stones at Israeli troops and affiliation with Islamic Jihad. ""The default should always be towards trial and punishment,"" said Mark Ellis of the International Bar Association. ""These types of administrative detention can never be a substitute for punishment and trials. Based on the numbers of individuals detained, the Israeli military appears to be using it as the default and that is what makes it in my opinion illegal under international standards.""","B'Tselem, HaMoked call on Israel to release the detainees or charge them .

"(Mashable)  -- Google announced Sunday that it has developed cars that drive themselves automatically in traffic, and that it has been testing them on the streets of California for months. It might seem like an unusual project for Google, but it could actually have big benefits. We're not just talking about cars running Google Android. This is the stuff of science fiction. The only accident that has occurred so far: One of the cars was rear-ended by a driver at a stop light. Human error! The vehicles have been tested on 140,000 miles of California road, from Silicon Valley to Santa Monica. Each car is manned during the tests. One person sits in the driver's seat, ready to take control of the vehicle instantly by grabbing the wheel or touch the brake should something go wrong with the system. The person in the passenger's seat is an engineer who monitors the software operations on a computer. Google (Google) hired engineers who previously participated in competitions and races involving automated cars -- important turning points in the development of the technology, which has been coming into its own since around 2005 according to The New York Times. If your first concern is one of safety, Google would argue that you're going about it all wrong. Safety is one of the the project's purposes. Google believes that the technology could nearly half the number of automobile-related deaths because computers are supposedly better at driving than humans in the right circumstances. There are other hypothetical pluses, too. The vehicles' instant reaction time and 360-degree awareness would allow them to drive closer together on the highway than humans can, reducing traffic congestion. They could be more careful when operating the gas, reducing fuel consumption. But the biggest benefit for Google would be the hour or so of daily commute time the car owner would save. Instead of driving, he or she could either be productive or entertained in the vehicle, doing work on a wireless Internet (Internet) connection or watching television. Google doesn't say it explicitly, but TechCrunch was quick to note that this time could be spent using Google products and absorbing Google-run advertising. The most optimistic projections put this technology at least eight years away from market, though. Legal hassles are among the myriad problems; all of the current traffic laws assume that a human driver is present in the vehicle. Do you think this technology will eventually be deployed, or is it just a pipe dream for Sergei and Larry? Let us know in the comments. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley will moderate the second presidential debate, to be held Tuesday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, the first woman to do so in two decades. Crowley, host of CNN's ""State of the Union,"" was asked about the town hall format, her role, her expectations for how she'll manage the face-off between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, and her feelings about being selected for the honor. You can ask Crowley about her experience through iReport. CNN: Does a town hall debate present unique challenges and opportunities for the candidates because it's not your normal debate behind a podium? Candy Crowley: It does, because they are going to have roughly 80 people, as I understand it, looking at them in addition to me. You know and I know it is very easy for politicians to run over a reporter -- they don't care. There is no price to be paid for being rude to a reporter, not answering the question. But 80 undecided voters looking at you, and some of them getting up and going, ""Well, what about this?"" It's just harder to dodge. There's also the whole -- you know, if you want to get into the optics of it, there's the whole wandering around the stage, and feeling their pain, and there's this whole kind of other set of expectations that we've come to want, or at least talk about afterwards, that now goes with modern television debates. CNN: How is a town hall debate different than other debates in terms of challenges and opportunities that presents itself? Crowley: The challenge is that they've got to connect not just with the people looking into the television and watching them, but the people who are on the stage with them. Some 80 or so undecided voters are chosen by Gallup, so they have to keep those folks in mind. It's a much more intimate and up-close adventure with voters than talking through a reporter. CNN: Now, we heard a lot with all these debates about style versus substance. Does it become even more about style because it's a town hall? Crowley: No, I think it's both about substance and style no matter what the debate is, and you don't know which it's going to be most about until it's over. If a voter gets up and says, ""I am unemployed and I haven't had a job in X amount of months and this happened and that to my health care,"" there has to be substance to that answer. You can't just be about, ""Oh my gosh, that's terrible, I'm so sorry to hear your story."" It's got to be, you know, give them something. So I think it's both, and I think there is a lot in common with the debates, in that we're not going to know until after the debates are over -- where this is something where the message came through with style, or in substance, or maybe a little of both, which is generally the case. CNN: I guess with or without the podium and with the audience interaction it seems like you would kind of, everything would carry more weight. Crowley: Well, I think it does in a sense of these are real people that -- the audience doesn't necessarily relate to either presidential candidates or media. They just don't. But they do relate to 80 people sitting on a stage that look like them, and maybe have stories similar to theirs. And so they can kind of see themselves through the town hall meeting participants. And I think that's where a candidate has to make a connection, because the candidate that makes a connection with the person asking the question is also making a better connection with the person back at home. CNN: There is some sense, one of the people I interviewed talked about how a town hall setting is viewed maybe as a little bit more freewheeling, free-flowing, less predictable because of the audience interaction. Do you buy that? Or do candidates always go back to their script and their talking points? Crowley: Whenever candidates get a chance, they will return to their talking points. And I think that's where we come in, like why I said, ""We know this. But the question was not oranges, it was apples, so could you please address apples, that would be good."" So yes, I think the instinct of any politician anywhere is to go back to their comfort zone, which is the talking point. But I think it is more difficult to stay in that zone when you have a person with a story asking you a question that relates to their life. CNN: What past debate moments are the most memorable? Crowley: What's interesting to me is when I look back at the debates, there are things that are kind of monumental. Now, one of them is more history to me than having actually having seen it, and that is when Gerry Ford talked about Poland as being free, and of course it was behind the Iron Curtain. And this was seen as a monumental mistake. But you go from that sort of thing, all the way to George H. W. Bush, the father, looking at his watch. Or Al Gore sighing. It's just, there's something about these debates that magnifies things that perhaps you don't see as the person in the room with them. But remember, George Bush looking at his watch was taken as some sign that he didn't care. Fair? Not fair? It matters, it's television. And so it's not just what you say, but it's how they present themselves. You never know when that moment is. You never know until it happens. You can't set up these moments. But the purpose of the debate is to get beyond what people have already heard, down to what one hopes the viewers and the voters are waiting to hear about. CNN: What is it like to be the first female moderator in 20 years? Crowley: People say, ""Do you think you're going to ask a different question because you're female?"" and I think, ""I'm going to ask different questions because of all the things that I am."" Bob Schieffer and I are different, Jim Lehrer and I are different, we come from different backgrounds, we've had different experiences, and certainly, one of the differences between them and me is that I'm female and they're male, so that's a part of it. And so, I guess I didn't embrace the history of it until women started coming -- and by the way, men as well -- I mean, I have just sons, and they were thrilled and said, ""Mom, did you know you're the first woman, you know, in 20 years?"" So they were excited by it. So I embraced that, kind of, after the fact. I first just embraced it as an amazing chance for a journalist. CNN: How did you get the news? Crowley: I was actually sitting at work. We were booking the show (""State of the Union"") and I was in my office and I got a phone call from the executive director of the presidential debate commission, who said, ""We were wondering if you'd be willing to moderate a debate."" And I said, ""Let me just think -- yes!"" It was a very quick phone call, actually. CNN: What was your reaction? Crowley: Well, understand that they told me not to tell anyone, so that was in some ways the hardest part. I cheated -- I told my children -- but beyond that, I didn't tell anybody. And so it was just this weird sort of ""Cheshire Cat"" thing going on, because I knew something that other people didn't know. But I mean inside, I was thinking, 'Whoa, this is amazing."" I mean, for a journalist, does it get better than that? Not much better that I can think of.","CNN's Candy Crowley is first woman to moderate presidential debate in 20 years .

"(CNN) -- It's not clear if the Boston Marathon bombing suspects -- identified as brothers from the Russian Caucasus who moved to the United States several years ago -- were radicalized as a result of their ethnic Chechen roots. But the question is bound to arise. Whatever emerges about the brothers' ties to Russia's North Caucasus region it's a part of the world that's no stranger to violence or terrorism. The troubled region includes the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia. The suspects' uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, who now lives in Maryland, said they had brought shame on their family and ""on the entire Chechen community."" Tsarni, who said he had last seen his nephews when they were children, told reporters that they were born in Kyrgyzstan but were ethnic Chechens. He attributed their actions to ""being losers"" and harboring ""hatred to those who were able to settle themselves"" -- and insisted it had nothing to do with religion or Islam. READ MORE: Suspects described as brothers from Russian Caucasus . After two separatist wars for independence -- which Russia labeled terrorism -- there is now a pro-Moscow government in Chechnya, but continuing though less intense Islamist violence. The Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia. The infrastructure is less developed while unemployment and infant mortality are high. Tens of thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands of Chechens displaced in the course of years of fighting with Russian military and security forces. Russian forces essentially regained control of Chechnya in 2000, following a long siege of the capital, Grozny. Since then, violence in Chechnya has ebbed, particularly following the death of Islamist militant Shamil Basayev in July 2006, in neighboring Ingushetia. Aiding the rebels' efforts, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, has been an influx of foreign Islamist militants ready to fight for the cause. ""Chechnya's long and violent guerrilla war has attracted a small number of Islamist militants from outside of Chechnya -- some of whom are Arab fighters with possible links to al Qaeda,"" the think tank's website said. Chechen militants have said they carried out several high-profile terrorist attacks in Russia and the North Caucasus region, particularly in Dagestan and Ingushetia, but have not been involved in strikes on the United States. The truth about the Chechen threat . In 2004, gunmen stormed a school in Beslan in the North Ossetia region, taking children hostage. By the time the siege ended in violence and explosions, more than 330 people had died -- half of them children. A Chechen rebel leader took responsibility for deadly bombings on two central Moscow subway stations in March 2010. And in 2002, Chechen rebels held hostage 700 people at a Moscow theater. The theater was eventually stormed by security forces but 120 hostages died. Chechen rebels were also accused of bringing down two Russian airplanes in 2004. Ties between Chechens and other Islamist militant groups will come under closer scrutiny as a result of events in Boston. The Council on Foreign Relations points out that Russian President Vladimir Putin has often stressed that international terrorists operate in Chechnya, adding that Putin seeks to generate Western sympathy for Russia's military campaign there. An International Crisis Group report published in October 2012 warned that continued ethnic, religious, political and economic grievances could bring increased tensions in the North Caucasus region, adding: ""The killing is unlikely to end soon."" Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on Friday distanced his republic from the brothers in Boston. ""Any attempts to link Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs if they are guilty are vain,"" he said via his official Twitter account. ""They grew up in the U.S. and their views and beliefs were formulated there. So you need to look for the roots of the evil in America. ""The world should fight terrorism together. We know it better than anyone. We wish all those suffering to recover soon and we share the grief of Americans."" Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan's state committee for national security said that the two brothers had moved with their family to Dagestan 12 years ago, and from there to the United States. Given that the boys were aged 8 and 15 when they left the country, the committee said, it ""considers it inappropriate to link them to Kyrgyzstan."" An official in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan earlier told CNN the brothers were Kyrgyz passport holders and used those passports when applying for residency Green Cards in the United States. CNN's Barbara Starr, Deborah Feyerick, Ivan Watson, Nick Paton Walsh and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","Uncle of the two suspects says they've brought shame on all Chechens .

"(CNN) -- At least eight people are dead after a bizarre mix of weather across the country spawned tornadoes, ice storms and record-setting warmth this weekend. Four of the deaths involved two vehicle accidents in Kentucky. Three people drowned in the Rolling Fork River near New Hope when a car drove into the water. Two people escaped but were hospitalized with hypothermia. ""Water was out of the banks, considerably up onto the roadway area. They ran their vehicle into the water. Two of the folks were exiting the vehicle as the swift water started pushing the vehicle downstream. The other three occupants of the vehicle were unable to exit,"" said Joe Prewitt, with Nelson County Emergency Management. In the other crash, a rider on an ATV overturned into a creek near Carrollton and was trapped underneath. The Kentucky Emergency Management reported a fifth death because of flood waters, in Ballard County, but did not provide specifics. Authorities did not release the identities of the victims. Several flood warnings remained in effect Sunday along some Kentucky rivers and streams. Two deaths occurred in the Mississippi counties of Coahoma and Jasper, where severe weather damaged homes and knocked down trees, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The eighth fatality came from a traffic accident near Kansas City, said Chris Redline of the Missouri Department of Transportation. ""We also had to close a lot of roads in southeast Missouri because of flooding,"" Redline said. Flooding, extreme cold and unseasonable warmth covered other parts of the country. To make sense of it all, let us take you on a North American tour. Southeast: Thunderstorms, tornadoes and torrential downpours . Heavy rain, damaging winds and lightning continued. These storms were forecast to spread, bringing downpours to Georgia, South Carolina and up the East Coast into Monday. While cooler, the weather is expected to be much quieter and drier Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. On Saturday night, the National Weather Service said a tornado was likely to blame for damage in central Mississippi, including four semi-trucks overturned and five houses heavily damaged. The main trigger for the severe weather is the above-average temperatures farther north. Midwest: Lake-effect snow . Sara Hadley sent CNN iReport photographs Sunday of the aftermath of a storm in Lansing, Michigan. ""It didn't start off too bad until we lost power last night. At that point we knew it was getting bad. Last time we had ice like this was 1998,"" she wrote. Her images showed branches and pine cones covered by thin layers of ice. Moderate to heavy lake-enhanced snow was expected for far western and north central upper Michigan into Monday night. Central Plains: Slammed with ice and snow . Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees colder than normal Monday with a gradual moderation into Christmas Day. In Kansas and southeast Nebraska, snowfalls will total 3 to 6 inches. And those cold temps will keep folks shivering. Whitney Eichinger of Southwest Airlines said the company is trying to offer customers options. ""We are allowing customers to rebook their trip with no penalty through (Sunday),"" she said. ""That has more to do with traveling to the airport, not flight cancellations."" Mid-Atlantic/Northeast: Weirdly warm . If there is one present being handed out on as winter begins, it is the well above-average temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic. New York City broke a record high Sunday, according to Ashley Sears, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. ""(The record) was previously 63 degrees in 1998. And we are currently sitting at 70 degrees, which we've been at for the past couple of hours,"" she said. Farther north, however, the situation has been less cozy. In Maine and across New Hampshire, Vermont and into northern New York, winter warnings -- including ice storm warnings and freezing rain -- were in effect. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a winter ice emergency and activated the state's emergency operations center. The National Weather Service in Buffalo said up to an inch of ice accumulation is expected, and areas near the St. Lawrence and Black Rivers could see even more. Canada: Unusually cold . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford described the winter weather Sunday as one of the worst storms in the city's history. He said he hopes that power will be restored to the more than 250,000 customers currently without it by Christmas Day. Toronto Police Sgt. Jeff Zammit said it has been colder than normal during December, and that freezing rain and fallen trees have brought down many power lines. ""It truly is a catastrophic ice storm that we've had here, probably one of the worst we've ever had,"" Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines told CTV Network. For customers with service, the company asked that they ""share the power"" and consider asking neighbors inside. The city has also opened warming stations. CNN's Jennifer Gray, Morgan Winsor, Nick Valencia, Janet DiGiacomo, Todd Borek and Matt Daniel contributed to this report.","NEW: Eight deaths are reported, including five in Kentucky .

"(CNN) -- Like in a scene from an apocalyptic parable, dark carcasses of cows and steers lie motionless in silent clusters across swaths of South Dakota. An early blizzard caught ranchers off guard this week in the state, killing as many as 20,000 head of cattle, a state official says. But ranchers say they are the real victims. The storm left many of them in ruins, and now Washington is leaving them out in the cold. ""With the government shutdown and no farm bill in place, we need South Dakotans to help their neighbors,"" Gov. Dennis Daugaard said. This year's federal farm legislation got hung up in Congress before the shutdown. There's no money to help the ranchers, and Daugaard is asking for donations. 5 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Carcass fields . South Dakota's civil air patrol did flyovers to take pictures of whole herds that keeled over together, dotting the gaping, snow-covered flatlands with big, black blotches. Ranchers who thought they were doing the right thing were blindsided, said state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven. Now they are dazed by their losses. ""The smart thing to do this time of year is to have cows and calf off to pasture,"" he said. ""Then the storm blew in. We've never seen anything quite like this."" Oedekoven says he may never know the total number of livestock killed. South Dakota has asked ranchers to make lists of the animals they lost to help with the tally. ""It will be two weeks to a month before we have a better idea of the impact,"" Oedekoven said. Pentagon strikes deal with charity to pay military death benefits . Trouble ahead . Only 2,000 have been confirmed dead so far, but crews are out removing more dead cattle blocking roads, where they fell over in their tracks. The state has told drivers to watch out. ""Motorists must be aware that livestock carcasses or stray livestock may be present on or along the roadways at any time,"" the emergency management agency said in a statement. Herds of livestock still alive are wandering aimlessly far from home. ""We have misplaced cattle everywhere,"" Oedekoven said. ""The storm blew them 10 miles or more from where they are normally pastured."" The blizzard didn't necessarily dole out fate justly, rewarding the prudent and punishing the lax, he said. ""Some people were very well prepared and lost 50% of their herd. Some were not prepared and took no losses. There was no rhyme or reason to it. Some ranchers lost everything."" The state has issued ranchers a final, grim and expensive chore to take care of on top of their losses. They must dispose of the carcasses quickly, before they rot, and in accordance with regulations. The ranchers can pay a factory to render them. Or they can burn them themselves, or dig large pits at least four feet deep and bury them by the hundreds.","South Dakota's state veterinarian believes up to 20,000 cattle died in a blizzard .

"Shanghai, China (CNN) -- For more than a decade, television journalist Xuan Kejiong has covered almost every major disaster in China's largest metropolis, from fires and typhoons to robberies and murders. His regular presence on the scenes of misfortune has inspired local viewers to jokingly call him Shanghai's face of tragedy. But it's Xuan's serious investigative reporting and energetic live presentations that have earned him widespread attention and respect. The 34-year-old reporter for Shanghai TV is now arguably the most famous journalist in the city of 20 million residents. Competitors profile him in their newspapers and magazines, while local websites are abuzz over his professional and personal life. One recent Wednesday Xuan raced to the city's northeast during the morning rush hour after a tip that a security guard in a residential compound had died suddenly. ""It could be just natural causes, but security guards are an underprivileged group. I want to do a bit of digging on their living and working conditions,"" he told his cameraman in the car. ""You get the shots first - he died inside the guardhouse at the entrance."" As the car pulled over, Xuan leapt into action, as police and onlookers crowded a rather chaotic scene. Yelling and shoving ensued after employees from the property management office turned hostile to the TV crew. Undeterred, Xuan kept cajoling and probing. The death seemed to have involved no foul play. Xuan filed a live phone report in the car on his way back to the downtown newsroom -- and then it was on to the next case and another chance to tell the stories of the city's less fortunate. ""I feel it's my responsibility to let the truth help promote social progress or solve social problems,"" the Shanghai native said. ""If I can do that, it gives me a sense of accomplishment."" Xuan's coverage of a devastating apartment building fire that killed 58 people last November cemented his journalistic reputation. He was the first reporter to enter the charred high-rise after the fire was put out, capturing some extraordinary pictures of destruction amid the intense heat and smoke. But Xuan -- a Communist Party member -- is guarded in talking about the parameters within which he reports. Like all news outlets in China, Shanghai TV is state-run and falls under the same extensive system of control and censorship, both on air and online. ""In the past few years, the media environment has become more relaxed for us, thanks to the growth of the internet and of public expectations,"" said Xuan, who tweets frequently about his stories and thoughts on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. With the internet blurring the boundary between local news and national or even international news, analysts say the work of reporters like Xuan reflects greater social trends and show the difficulties ordinary people face in their daily life. ""These reports don't usually enrage or embarrass the authorities. That's why they are more appealing to officials -- and make them more willing to acknowledge problems and try to address them,"" said Bu Zhong, an assistant professor in journalism at Pennsylvania State University in the United States and a long-time observer of China's news media. ""Sharp direct criticisms are necessary, but it's often more effective to be gentle critics in China -- and the internal changes they prompt are more profound and long-lasting."" Despite a 24/7 work schedule that has at times strained his marriage, Xuan says he will keep probing, looking for the truth and giving a voice to the voiceless in order to promote social progress. ""An ancient Chinese saying says that a journey of a thousand miles is made up with all the small steps,"" he said. ""And I believe that.""","Xuan's serious investigative reporting, energetic live presentations have earned him respect .

"(CNN) -- The soccer bars in the United States will be jammed on Sunday. The U.S. team will play its second game of the World Cup, following a big win last Monday. Here's what to look for today from Brazil: . 1. The U.S. team faces Portugal as Ronaldo returns . The United States has been, to many, one of the surprise teams of the World Cup, having pulled off a 2-1 win against Ghana last Monday. The Americans face Portugal at 6 p.m. ET Sunday and are virtually certain to advance to the round of 16 with a win. But Cristiano Ronaldo, not only Portugal's best player but one of the best in the world, says he'll play despite a lingering left knee injury. That adds drama to the game and makes the United States' task much more difficult. 2. Who is Ronaldo? He's strong. He's a fast runner. He's the best in the world with the ball. His feet can strike left- or right-footed. He dominates in the air. He has skills never seen before. That's the list of attributes U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard ascribes to Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo. All eyes will be on the star player, who injured his left knee in his World Cup opening game against Germany in which Portugal endured a stunning 0-4 loss. The U.S. team says it doesn't have a special strategy to keep Ronaldo in check. ""Portugal is not only one player,"" said U.S. midfielder Jermaine Jones. ""They have a lot of good players."" 3. Watch the hair and humidity . The U.S.-Portugal match takes place in Manaus, a humid place in the jungle. U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann isn't too worried about the muggy climate. ""When you go through Florida and you play in Miami, it's very similar of what you're experiencing here,"" he told reporters at a press conference Saturday that also featured Tim Howard. One reporter asked Howard what he thought the heat and humidity would do to teammate Kyle Beckerman's full head of dreadlocks. Howard said, ""He's had that hairstyle for quite a while. He plays in the MLS, so he knows what humidity is like in the summer. I don't think it'll be a factor."" The reporter said he was doing a story about hair at the World Cup. 4. Belgium vs. Russia . Belgium hopes it will make a move toward the knockout stages if it can defeat Russia on Sunday. The teams meet at noon ET. In its last game, Belgium sneaked past Algeria with two goals in the last 20 minutes to win 2-1. Russia played to a 1-1 draw with South Korea. Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev will be feeling the pressure. On Monday, he let a South Korean kick slip through his fingers, costing his team a chance for victory. 5. South Korea vs. Algeria . South Korea, the bronze medal winner at the 2012 Olympics, is favored to win this game, which starts at 3 p.m. ET. Algeria doesn't have a powerful offense. In fact, the Algerians scored their first World Cup goal in 28 years in the game against Belgium. South Korea looked lethargic against Russia, but should be able to raise their energy level.

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested two people in connection with a cyber-attack that yielded personal details for 12 million customers of one of South Korea's biggest phone companies. One of the suspects, identified only by the surname Kim, used his own customized hacking program to break into the computer system used by KT Corp, Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency Commissioner Lee Sang-Won said in a statement obtained by CNN Thursday. Kim, whom police said was 29 year old, accessed bank details, home addresses and employment information for three-quarters of KT's 16 million registered users. This data was sold on to a 37-year-old man identified only as Park. The owner of a telemarketing business, Park used this information to sell cell phones posing as a KT representative, police said. The two made 11.5 billion won (US$10.8 million) from the scheme, which dated back to February 2013, police added. A third person initially implicated in the case was released. The investigation is now expanding to other hacking activities and other cell phone sales stores. KT said in a statement that it would actively cooperate with the police investigation to ""minimize the damage to its customers,"" and ""figure out the route of information leakage."" Credit card scam . In January this year, the personal data for 20 million South Korean credit card customers was stolen by a worker at the Korea Credit Bureau -- a company that offers risk management and fraud detection services. The worker, who had access to various databases at the firm, is alleged to have secretly copied data onto an external drive over the course of a year and a half. Clients of three Korean companies -- KB Kookmin Bank, Lotte Card and Nonghyup Bank -- were hardest hit by the data theft. Following this leak, financial regulators have been working to revise legislation to beef up the protection of personal information, the Yonhap news agency reported.","Hackers steal details for 12 million customers of South Korean phone giant .

"(CNN) -- Police in Europe and South America have arrested 25 alleged members of the ""Anonymous"" hacking group, Interpol said, amid a suspected attack on its own website by the group's supporters. The arrests include four people in Spain, 10 in Argentina, six in Chile and five in Colombia as part of a worldwide sweep carried out as part of Interpol operation ""Exposure."" Interpol did not immediately announce charges against the 25. After Interpol announced the attacks, its website failed to load, a fact acknowledged by Anonymous on Twitter with the message ""interpol.int DOWN."" Who or what is Anonymous? The Spanish police website also failed to load after it announced police had arrested four people in the country as part of the international action. Spanish police said the four suspects were accused of carrying out denial of service attacks, defacing the websites of political parties, institutions and companies, as well as publishing personal information relating to high-profile figures. One of those arrested was a 16-year-old girl, who was allegedly part of international ""sector 404,"" a hacking group which is believed to be linked to the attacks claimed by Anonymous. Police said the girl had been released to the custody of her parents. Two of the others had been detained, while the third was released on bail, police said. Anonymous made headlines in 2010 when it carried out distributed denial of service or DDOS attacks targeting MasterCard, Visa and PayPal websites. DDOS is a kind of network stress test in which each attacker gives consent to have his or her computer linked to a bot net. The force of all those computers working together, focused on one site, overwhelms the targeted site's server and consequently disrupts or takes the site down. At the time, Anonymous claimed that it was lashing out at the corporations because they had stopped doing business with WikiLeaks, the publisher huge tranches of confidential information under the leadership of founder and editor Julian Assange. Since then, the group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks, notably claiming that it attacked government websites in Tunisia and Egypt as a way to show support for protesters during Arab Spring uprisings. A video -- laced with Anonymous' typical computer-voiceover -- appeared online during the January 2011 revolution. It threatened Egyptian authorities if they attempted to censor Internet access and other freedoms. ""Anonymous is you. You will not be denied your right to free speech, free press, free association and your universal right to freely access information both in real life and on the Internet,"" the voice said. Anonymous had a hand in organizing and agitating in the Occupy movement throughout 2011. Protesters have been seen at Occupy demonstrations across the globe wearing Anonymous' distinctive Guy Fawkes mask. This year, the group claimed to have posted an internal FBI conference call discussing investigations into Anonymous. It also posted e-mails that it claimed were from an adviser to the Syrian president, suggesting how Bashar al-Assad could downplay violence in the country when he was interviewed by Barbara Walters last summer.

"Washington (CNN) -- Pilot Peter Hertzak, a cosmetic surgeon, took off on a solo flight from Slidell Municipal Airport in Slidell, Louisiana, last Friday in his twin-engine Cessna 421C en route to Sarasota, Florida. Some three hours later, his plane descended in a fatal death spiral into the Gulf of Mexico. What happened in between still has federal investigators looking for clues. The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report on Friday that provided little in the way of explanation as the investigation continues. Hertzak filed instrument flight rules and departed around 6:45 a.m. local time, the NTSB said. Investigators say the pilot contacted the Jacksonville Air Traffic Control Center at approximately 7:15 a.m. to report on his flight altitude. About 20 minutes later, the airplane began to ""deviate from the air traffic control assigned altitude and route."" The NTSB said the air traffic control center tried unsuccessfully to contact Hertzak. The North American Aerospace Defense Command launched military fighter aircraft to intercept the plane. According to the NTSB, the military pilots reported the airplane was ""circling in a left hand turn at a high altitude, low airspeed and the windows were partially frosted over."" They reported Hertzak was ""slumped over in the cockpit and not moving."" The NORAD planes fired flares, but the pilot remained unresponsive. The Cessna circled for about three hours at about 28,000 feet before it made what appeared to be a soft landing. A Coast Guard spokeswoman said the plane was afloat with its tail sticking out of the water before it soon sank, about 190 miles southeast of Mobile, Alabama. Three days prior to the incident, Hertzak had been placed on probation and permanently banned from performing plastic surgery, according to Rita Arceneaux, spokeswoman for the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners. When asked if the NTSB had any reason to believe the incident could have been a suicide, NTSB spokesman Eric Alleyne told CNN that was ""beyond the scope of my investigation.""","Safety board report offers no explanation of what caused pilot Peter Hertzak's fatal crash .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has dismissed a suggestion that a withdrawal by UK troops from their base in the southern Iraqi city of Basra was a defeat, insisting it was an ""organized"" move. A British army corporal lowers the Union Flag during a ceremony in Basra on Monday. Brown, speaking as 500 British troops completed their withdrawal from Basra Palace, said Monday troops would still be able to intervene in the city in ""certain circumstances."" Asked if the move was a ""pull-out in defeat ... a retreat,"" Brown told the BBC: ""Let me make this very clear. This is a pre-planned, and this is an organized move from Basra Palace to Basra Air Station."" The move consolidates most of Britain's 5,500-strong force at Basra airport, which has been hit daily by mortar attacks. The move does not represent a major shift nor does it represent a pullout, the British Ministry of Defence said. A British military spokesman in Basra said there were no major incidents during the withdrawal, although a British vehicle was damaged and two soldiers suffered non-serious wounds in an attack. People in Basra cheered the British departure. The pullout happened at a ""snail's pace"" as the convoy checked for roadside explosives, Tom Newton Dunn, Defence Editor for The Sun and the only British journalist with UK forces in the area, told Sky News. Iraqi Army Lt. General Mohan, commander of operations in Basra, said he had told Shiite militants who have been fighting the British troops that Iraqis were now in charge of the Basra palace. He said the militants ""have behaved except for some simple violations."" Basra will be the last of four provinces in southern Iraq that Britain has handed over to Iraqi control. The other three were Muthanna, Maysan and Dhi Qar. British forces will remain in Basra to train and supervise Iraqi forces. The withdrawal from the southern Iraqi city is part of a plan announced in February by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, British Embassy spokeswoman Rosie Tapper told CNN. During their time in Basra, British forces have helped the Iraqis take more responsibility for governing Basra, she said. Previously, the British had handed over two other bases to the Iraqis. The palace was the third. CNN correspondent Michael Ware said he believed the move would have little effect on Basra's security. ""The Brits have had no control for years,"" he said from Baghdad. ""From the moment the British forces were deployed in the south, they didn't have enough troops.

""The British presence has been merely token. As British military intelligence officers told me two years ago, all they are doing there is trying to stay alive."" The withdrawal from Basra comes at the same time retired Major General Tim Cross, the most senior British officer involved in postwar planning, criticized former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a British newspaper for dismissing warnings that Iraq could fall into chaos. ""Right from the very beginning we were all very concerned about the lack of detail that had gone into the postwar plan, and there is no doubt that Rumsfeld was at the heart of that process,"" Cross said in the Sunday Mirror. Cross' comment came on the heels of similar published remarks by retired British General Mike Jackson, the head of the British Army during the invasion, who said U.S. policy was ""intellectually bankrupt.""

"Rome (CNN) -- An Italian court says it convicted Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend of murdering her onetime roommate in part because of evidence showing that more than one person killed the British student. The Florence appeals court released its explanation Tuesday, less than three months after it convicted Knox and Raffaele Sollecito in Meredith Kercher's 2007 death in a retrial. In the more than 300-page document, the court said that a third person convicted in the murder, Rudy Guede, did not act alone, and cited the nature of the victim's wounds. Ruling Judge Alessandro Nencini, who presided over the second appeal in the case, said Kercher, 21, and Knox disagreed over the payment of the rent in the house they shared in Perugia and that ""there was an argument, then an elevation and progression of aggression."" The Florence court in January said that Knox, who also was convicted of slander, was sentenced in absentia to 28Â½ years in prison. Sollecito's sentence was 25 years. They were first convicted of murder in 2009, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal in 2011. Through her attorney, Knox released a statement proclaiming her innocence. ""I have stated from the beginning of this long ordeal that I am innocent of the accusations against me. I was found innocent by the only court in Italy that retained independent forensic experts to review my case. ""I want to state again today what I have said throughout this process: I am innocent of the accusation against me, and the recent Motivation document does not -- and cannot -- change the fact of my innocence,"" she said. Now that the explanation of the verdict has been released, defense lawyers have 90 days to appeal to Italy's high court. In the document, Nencini focuses on the perceived errors of the appellate court that set Knox and Sollecito free, accusing it of the ""absence of logic rigor"" when evaluating evidence. He wrote that some evidence, including a prison diary Knox wrote in the early days of her incarceration, was used to support her innocence when it was ""convenient, but at the same time devalued when she incriminated herself."" The judge also reasoned that Knox's false accusation of her former boss, Patrick Lumumba, whom she accused of the killing the night she was arrested, proved her guilt. Lumumba spent nearly two weeks in prison without Knox correcting her false accusation. He was released when Guede was arrested after his fingerprints were found in at the murder scene. Nencini wrote that the accusation against Lumumba was ""indispensable in understanding the crime"" and that the accusation ""cannot be separated from the murder."" Nencini also considered credible forensic testimony that the first appellate court dismissed, including traces of mixed blood and DNA belonging to both Knox and Kercher that were identified in the bathroom that the women shared. ""Guede, Knox and Sollecito left traces of their movements in the blood of the victim that was flowing profusely from her wounds,"" the judge wrote. Nencini excluded the idea that Guede climbed into the apartment through a window after breaking it with a rock as the Knox and Sollecito defense teams presented in earlier trials. He also excluded the idea put forth by Guede's defense that Kercher let him in for a prearranged meeting. Instead, he wrote: ""The court accepts the position that only Amanda Knox was in possession of the other key to the apartment"" and that she let him in. Nencini dismissed all theories related to a sex game gone wrong. Prosecutors had argued Kercher was stabbed to death after she rejected attempts by Knox, Sollecito and Guede to involve her in a sex game. Instead, Nencini wrote that the suspects did not need to ""share a motive."" He said a knife with Knox's DNA on the handle found in Sollecito's apartment was the weapon that killed Kercher and that Knox left her DNA on the handle when she ""plunged the knife into the left side of Kercher's neck, causing the fatal wound."" In the initial trial, a tiny spot of DNA identified on the blade of that knife was attributed to Kercher, but the sample was too small to double test. Nencini nonetheless considered it the primary weapon. He reasoned that Sollecito used another knife and took it with him when he left. ""The English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy Hermann Guede,"" Nencini wrote. Guede is the only person in jail for the slaying, and many aspects of the crime remain unexplained. Knox and Sollecito have maintained their innocence, and their 2009 convictions led to questions about the effectiveness of Italy's justice system. The trial revealed widespread doubts over the handling of the investigation and key pieces of evidence. But in March 2013, Italy's Supreme Court overturned their acquittals and ordered a retrial. That proceeding resulted in the convictions being reinstated. Knox's conviction has raised questions about her possible extradition to Italy to serve her sentence; she was in the United States and did not attend the retrial.

"(CNN) -- Georgia -- with its tumultuous past of discrimination -- is following Arizona's recently failed attempt to pass what amounts to anti-gay legislation with the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act. The state may shift from the cradle of the civil rights movement to the vanguard of legalized 21st-century bigotry with the consideration of this legislation, modeled on Arizona's, that would allow businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian customers on the basis of alleged religious conviction. The measure, whose fringe supporters contend is couched in the First Amendment, would provide a legal avenue for business operators to ignore existing local nondiscrimination protections that even ""indirectly inhibit"" the ""free exercise"" of their faith. Like the controversial Arizona bill, this broadly written proposal has profound implications -- not only for the aggrieved minority it would directly affect but also for the social reputation of the state at large. Those implications will permanently stain us, cementing the lasting ignominy of Jim Crow. One of us is the Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives and the other an adviser to two conservative Republican governors and national party committees. Despite our policy disagreements, we're both Georgians, and we stand together in opposition to these bills. The fact that we can overcome our severe political differences and agree that this legislation would be wrong and bad for the state demonstrates the growing bipartisan opposition to legislation of this sort. Two bills exist, one in each chamber: Boosters of the House measure, House Bill 1023, have soft-pedaled the issue, but the sponsor of the Senate proposal, Senate Bill 377, griped this week that the only opponents to his legislation are those advocating ""militant atheism,"" whatever that is. As written, the Senate bill doesn't carve out narrow exemptions for wedding vendors but instead extends the blanket conscience provision to all commercial quarters. Not only could restaurateurs and hoteliers turn away same-sex couples, but pharmacists could deny life-saving therapy to HIV-positive patients. The legislation is so vague that it's not merely limited to individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender: It could even be used as a means to discriminate against unmarried women and people of different faiths. Those possibilities are frightening, but the economic consequences are no less serious. Georgia, like much of the Southeast, is still struggling to reinvent its modest economy after it collapsed from an overdependence on housing and real estate. Every job, every dollar of out-of-state investment matters. We have no such luxury of chasing Yankee business from our borders. And yet that's precisely what this legislation would accomplish. In Arizona, respected companies such as Apple and American Airlines warned they would withdraw investments from the state should the law take effect. Gov. Jan Brewer must have taken this into consideration in her veto. Anti-gay legislation of this order is a significant social barometer for the young professionals and innovators on whom businesses rely. If they deem the state hostile to mainstream sensibilities, neither will come. Georgia's proposal would repel the creative class in a way few other factors could -- except maybe our recent experiences with snowstorms and 20 hours in a frigid car. In the same way, the law would spook out-of-state firms weighing a move to Georgia. But even worse than new business avoiding the state is the real prospect of existing major companies bailing. Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia's largest employers, on Tuesday strongly denounced the measure and warned it would ""result in job losses."" That's a proposition Georgia can ill afford. Central to the American ethos is the promise of freedom, the protection of which is an appropriate function of the legislature. But freedom is a universal shelter, swaddling each American the same as the next no matter his or her color, creed or sexual orientation. No weary driver nor hungry belly would want to be denied a hotel room or hot meal on the basis of immutable characteristics or faith, but that's what the Georgia bill would allow. The notion is distinctly un-American and we, Republican and Democrat together, don't want that in our state. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: Georgia considers bill that would allow discrimination based on religious beliefs .

"(CNN) -- Powerful winds and a tornado spawned by a 1,000-mile-long storm system pounded communities in northwest Georgia on Wednesday, overturning dozens of vehicles and trapping residents. The tornado caused significant damage in Adairsville, Georgia. One person died in that town and another died in Tennessee, authorities reported. At least 17 people were injured in Georgia, two critically. The Adairsville death marks the first person killed by a U.S. tornado in 220 days, a record for most consecutive days without such a fatality, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. Severe weather 101 . The storm churned eastward, prompting severe thunderstorm and flash-flood warnings in eastern Tennessee and western portions of the Carolinas. The front has led to nearly 400 reports of severe wind and 20 of tornadoes over two days, from Texas to Pennsylvania. In the Adairsville storm, winds caused significant damage to a motel and a manufacturing plant, according to Craig Millsap, fire chief and interim emergency management director for Bartow County. The motel's guests are believed safe and workers at the Daiki plant have all been accounted for, he said. Daiki employees hid in a kitchen and bathroom as the tornado snatched the roof off and left much of the plant in ruins. Two workers suffered minor injuries. The driver of a commercial truck that was overturned near Adairsville said the storm ""grew legs and just started accelerating."" He told CNN Atlanta affiliate WGCL he was unscathed. ""There is no way in the world that if you see this debris behind me I should be alive."" The National Weather Service reported major structural damage and overturned cars in downtown Adairsville, where a news crew for CNN affiliate WSB-TV witnessed a tornado form and touch down Wednesday morning. The death came when a building collapsed, Millsap said. 10 deadliest U.S. tornadoes . Nine people in Bartow County suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. The storm caused major damage on and near Interstate 75, the Georgia Department of Transportation said. The weather service, citing emergency management officials, said dozens of cars had been overturned near Exit 306 at Adairsville. Officials reported up to 100 homes damaged in Bartow and Gordon counties. Georgia emergency officials reported eight injuries in Gordon County, north of Adairsville. Two of the injuries were described as critical. Interactive: Check your forecast . ""There have been a number of entrapments, and deputies, firemen and emergency personnel have all been working to free those people,"" said Robert Paris, Gordon County's chief deputy sheriff. ""I don't believe we have any more trapped at this time."" The tornado struck a subdivision that also was hit by storms in 2011, Paris said. ""This one appears to be much, much worse. But this was almost the same path. There were some people that had to go through both of them."" Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for both counties. State officials late Wednesday afternoon said they had no reports of anyone unaccounted for, but searches of homes and businesses were continuing. Trees and power lines were down as the result of a possible tornado in Georgia's Gilmer County, the weather service said. KFVS: Power outages from storm . Utilities reported about 21,000 customers without power in west and north Georgia and metropolitan Atlanta. In Tennessee, a 47-year-old man died early Wednesday when high winds toppled a tree onto a roof in Nashville, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said. CNN affiliate WSMV said the victim was in a building next to a home. Other injuries were reported in Chester, McNairy and Henderson counties, emergency management spokesman Jeremy Heidt said. The National Weather Service also reported severe weather or damage Wednesday in Texas, Mississippi and Alabama. Tornadoes were confirmed in Marion County, Kentucky, and Harrison County, Indiana. In the mountains of North Carolina, iReporter Matt Able said most of the roads around Appalachian State in Boone were impassible because of flooding. He sent in video of people driving down U.S. 321, which was under several inches of water. ""People were driving down the middle of the (four-lane) road to avoid being swept away by the fast-moving water,"" he said. WBKO: Tractor trailer flips on I-65 . Northern Florida, southeastern Georgia, much of South Carolina and portions of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland were under a tornado watch Wednesday night. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the massive storm system was 1,000 miles north to south, moving eastward in a belt that will eventually stretch from New York to Florida. ""If it's hot and humid where you are, then you are still in the danger zone,"" Myers said. The strong cold front causing the severe weather brought huge extremes in temperature readings. Thermometers reached the low 80s in parts of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, the 50s in Tennessee and the 30s in Illinois. WFIE: Storms blow new roof off tri-state church . Earlier, in Alabama, the storms blew the metal roof off a building in Sheffield, CNN affiliate WHNT said. The storm also damaged a church steeple in Rogersville, the station reported. In Kentucky, winds blew off much of the roof of the Penrod Missionary Baptist Church and damaged several homes, CNN affiliate WFIE reported. In Nashville, the weather service listed dozens of damage reports across the region: a funnel cloud was reported early Wednesday in Jackson County, there were dozens of reports of downed trees and power lines, and law enforcement reported damage to homes and businesses. CNN affiliate WSMV also reported the partial collapse of an office building in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. ""I built it myself to take an event like this. And it looks like a freight train hit it,"" the station quoted building owner Dewey Lineberry as saying. ""It's just destroyed. It laid the building down on top of cars, it put the building on top of people. It's unbelievable."" Workers who were inside the building when the storm hit took cover under mattresses, the station said. The storm came dangerously close to WSMV, the station reported: Workers had to move to a safe room when a buzzer in the newsroom alerted them of storm danger around 4 a.m. Wednesday, the station reported. WKRN: Confirmed tornado . CNN iReporter Matt Davis said overnight storms damaged a historic brick structure on Fairvue Plantation in Gallatin, Tennessee. ""The plantation was a horse farm. Those (structures) have been standing there for 100 to 200 years. It was sad to see those collapsed and caved in. It's historic to the neighborhood,"" the high school student said. On Tuesday, the storms raked Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, among other places, with heavy rain and high wind. Photos: Finding art in icy weather .

"(CNN) -- Getting cell phone reception in waterlogged New York and New Jersey could get a bit easier. In a rare moment of collaboration, wireless providers AT&T and T-Mobile have agreed to share networks in the challenging days following Superstorm Sandy, allowing customers to use whichever network gets coverage in their areas. The combining of networks will happen entirely behind the scenes, so all customers need to do is dial out. They'll automatically be routed over whatever network is currently the strongest in their location. How you can help . There will be no roaming charges for customers of either company, and no need to change any settings, rate plan or service agreements. Making calls across the Northeast has been difficult following Sandy, and New York and New Jersey seem to be the hardest hit. According to the Federal Communication Commission, about a quarter of cell phone towers in the 10 states were knocked out by the storm. Repairing these towers will take several days or longer, and continued inclement weather could cause additional issues and repair delays. Some transmission sites that are still working are currently running on backup generators, which carriers hope will last until power is restored. ""Our assumption is that communications outages could get worse before they get better, particularly for mobile,"" FCC chairman Julius Genachowski said on a call with reporters Tuesday. Only a very small number of 911 call centers had lost power, and those calls were being rerouted to working centers, according to the FCC. Post-Sandy water safety tips . The major cellphone carriers have shared varying amounts of information on their service outages following Sandy. Sprint said it was experiencing ""service impacts,"" but that it could not provide a specific number for the amount of people without service. T-Mobile said that in New York CIty, 20% of its network was down. In Washington that number was 10%. Verizon's New York City facilities were severely flooded, and the damages were still being assessed. The carrier said its networks were mostly doing well, but there were serious problems in lower Manhattan and general problems throughout New York City. The company did not give exact numbers for outages. Verizon officials also cautioned that some customers in the Northeast might receive ""all circuits are busy"" messages when trying to make calls because of an unusually large volume of post-Sandy demand on the network. AT&T was the most vague, only saying that it was monitoring its land line and wireless networks and working to restore service. T-Mobile and AT&T did not give a timeline for how long this cross-company cooperation would last. Man faces fallout for fake Sandy tweets .

"(CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, who has served as an al Qaeda spokesman, was captured and has been brought to the United States, two administration officials and a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith has been charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. Abu Ghaith is scheduled to be arraigned at 10 a.m. ET Friday in a federal courtroom in New York. ""No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""To violent extremists who threaten the American people and seek to undermine our way of life, this arrest sends an unmistakable message: There is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice because we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law."" Abu Ghaith was captured within the past week in Jordan, according to a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York. Bin Laden confidant emerged as voice of al Qaeda . Congress was notified when Abu Ghaith was taken into U.S. custody, the administration officials said. The decision to take Abu Ghaith to New York rather than to a detention facility at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba raised fresh questions about the treatment of those accused of making war or plotting against the United States. The administration said President Barack Obama remains committed to closing Guantanamo, rather than adding to its population. The Justice Department said it examined the nature of Abu Ghaith's alleged conduct and whether charges would best be served in federal court or through a military commission. ""Our policy is that we will prosecute whenever feasible in the national security interests of the United States,"" department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said in a statement. ""In this case, the president's national security team examined this matter and unanimously agreed that prosecution of (Abu) Ghaith in federal court will best protect the national security interests of the United States."" Several Republicans argued Abu Ghaith should have been taken to Guantanamo for interrogation as an enemy combatant. Sen. Lindsey Graham, in a news conference, argued against civilian criminal proceedings. ""I think we (are) setting a new precedent that will come back to bite us,"" Graham told reporters. ""It's clear to me they snuck him in ... under the nose of Congress."" The South Carolina senator was joined at the news conference by Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who said, ""If you are that close to bin Laden, we want to develop all the information that person has."" Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, reaffirmed his opposition to U.S. trials of suspected al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo. ""We should treat enemy combatants like the enemy -- the U.S. court system is not the appropriate venue."" But Eugene Fiddell, a prominent military legal expert, said the conspiracy charge is not a war crime and is outside the jurisdiction of a military commission. The U.S. Treasury Department has described Abu Ghaith as ""the official spokesman of al Qaeda since his appointment to that position after the attacks of September 11, 2001."" He appeared in videos as ""the mouthpiece of bin Laden,"" the department said. Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported that Abu Ghaith was seized in Ankara ""after a tipoff"" from the CIA and was held for 33 days. A Turkish court decided to release him because he had not committed a crime in Turkey. He was considered ""stateless"" because Kuwait had stripped him of his citizenship after he appeared in videos supporting the 9/11 attacks, the report said. Abu Ghaith entered Turkey illegally from Iran, so he could be deported to Iran or another country, the report said. After Iran did not accept him, Turkey decided to send him to Kuwait through Jordan. The CIA captured Abu Ghaith when he was passing from Jordan into Kuwait, the newspaper said. 'Nightmare' at home for SEAL who shot bin Laden . The U.S. government did not immediately confirm the report. Abu Ghaith was a high school teacher and preacher at a mosque in Kuwait, the U.S. Treasury says on its website. ""He fought in Afghanistan, accused the U.S. government of killing children in Iraq through U.N. sanctions, and joined Muslim guerillas fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the summer of 1994."" He was later banned from his mosque for using his sermons to attack the government. Before September 11, 2001, ""his mission was to recruit elements for training in bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan."" The U.S. 9/11 Commission said Abu Ghaith ""reportedly"" supported the idea of a major operation directly against the United States in 2001. Bin Laden, leader of the terrorist al Qaeda network that staged the 9/11 attacks on the United States, was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan in 2011. According to the indictment unveiled Thursday, Abu Ghaith was engaged in planning and perpetrating a federal crime of terrorism against the United States and its citizens. He could face a life sentence if convicted. In May 2001, Abu Ghaith urged individuals at a guest house in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to swear allegiance to bin Laden, according to the charges. A day after 9/11, the alleged spokesman warned the United States and its allies that a ""great army is gathering against you"" and called on ""the nation of Islam"" to battle ""Jews, the Christians and Americans,"" the indictment states. Abu Ghaith later warned ""the storms shall not stop, especially, the airplane storms"" and warned Muslims and foes of the United States not to board aircraft or live in high-rise buildings, according to the indictment.

"(CNN) -- At over 1500 meters above sea level, the picturesque setting of Davos inspires those attending the World Economic Forum to take a step back and look at the big picture. If there has been one common thread that has run through this Swiss Alpine village for the past decade and half, it has been the love affair the corporate world has had with fast-growing emerging markets. One would have been hard pressed to find a chief executive in the halls here who was not bullish on the developing world. But Davos 2014 may bring an end to sweeping generalizations, as those here representing the Fortune 500 become more discerning in their hunt for growth. Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University sees it as the next phase of an economic evolution. ""Some of these emerging economies are well managed, others have some fairly miserable politics, some have good growth prospects, others fairly mediocre,"" Sachs said in interview with CNN. ""So I think that it's good to scrutinize to get much more detail and fine grain in one's analysis."" As an institution, the World Economic Forum was quick to embrace the shift of growth to the East and the rise of India and China. In the early 1990s here in Davos, I bore witness to leaders of China being welcomed on stage signaling the start of economic reforms. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin were here what as well after the Soviet Union broke apart. Those major forces of globalization sparked a decade-long drive by chief executives to direct their investments to the developing world. Nearly a quarter century later, today's emerging markets can be divided into the tortoises and hares. Large, populous countries such as China, Nigeria, and the Philippines shows signs of racing ahead. But those that have been slow to reform like Brazil, Russia and Turkey have lagged behind. With growth that fell from recent highs, all three of the latter countries bore witness to intense protests with citizens disgruntled about decisions made at the top. Sachs says this trend is not limited to the developing world, but it is more pronounced now with growth a third if not half of what it was just a few years ago. ""We see in just about every country throughout modern history that politics can interfere with the good economic policy and that's certainly happened in many of the major emerging economies,"" said Sachs. 2014 may turn out to be a tricky year to navigate with the U.S. Federal Reserve in the mix. The World Bank estimates $64 billion was pulled out of emerging markets between June and August of last year due to anxieties over the tapering of government bond purchases by the U.S. central bank. Alex Thursby, chief executive of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, said even the fastest growing region, Asia, was hit by the trimming of financial support. ""Asia and other parts of the world over the last six to nine months have suffered because of that, not purely because of that, but have suffered. They will need to re-balance and their equilibriums restored,"" he said in an interview from the bank's headquarters. As this takes place, the pursuit of growth continues. Southeast Asia continues to impress as a market of some 600 million consumers. The Philippines, according to the World Bank, is projected to grow 6.5% this year. But from a demand perspective and the building out of infrastructure, the African continent seems to create the most excitement. ""What we can see in other Southeast Asian countries that is terrific, it's true, but let's not forget about Africa. Africa is a continent where we think a lot of developments are going to happen, "" said Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency. So while leaders of the emerging markets try to find their footing after a bumpy 2013, it will be those atop this mountain who need to decide how much risk they are willing to take in search of growth.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Knox says she's scared to return to Italy to face a new trial nearly six years after her study-abroad roommate's slaying. But she's considering it. ""I'm afraid to go back there,"" she told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""In Italy,"" she added, ""people think it's arrogant of me to sit here in the United States and have a book come out and defend myself. And first of all, I find that incredibly unfair, because I have the right to defend myself. And no one can ask me to just shut up because it's convenient. But at the same time, I want to prove to them that I care about what's going on."" Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are accused in the 2007 killing of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy. In a wide-ranging interview set to air on CNN Tuesday night, Knox spoke to Cuomo about the case against her. ""I find it incredible that despite an absolute lack of evidence that connects me to this murder, I am still being judged based upon unrealistic and unreasonable expectations about how a young woman would react to a horrible situation,"" she said. ""No one knows how they would react to a horrible situation until it happens to them."" Criticisms that she was cold and unfeeling about her roommate's murder are unfair, she said. ""I have cried. I have been angry. I have been scared. And these were all things ... that I have shown, that have come out of me,"" she said. Knox: I wanted to come back from Italy stronger and surer . For years, the twists and turns of the case have drawn international attention. The case began in 2007, when Knox, then 20, was studying abroad and lived with Kercher. That November, Kercher's semi-naked body was found at the home where they lived, her throat slashed. Police arrested Knox and Sollecito, who was her boyfriend at the time. Two years later they were convicted of murder. Another man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of Kercher's killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. Case is complicated, confusing mess . A jury overturned Knox's conviction in 2011, and she flew home to Seattle. An Italian appeals court overturned Knox's acquittal earlier this year, but experts disagree over whether the U.S. State Department will extradite her to be retried. She told CNN she was shocked to learn that there would be a retrial. ""There's no evidence against me,"" she said. ""There is nothing that links me to this murder. I am not present at the crime scene. I am just not."" She said theories from Italian police and prosecutors that she was involved in a sex game gone horribly wrong are ""absurd."" Opinion: What Knox can and can't tell us . ""I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip. I have never done that. ... I have never taken part in an orgy. Ever,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Well played, fake Scott Weiland. A man arrested July 26 by Beverly Hills police on suspicion of shoplifting at a local Rite Aid and alleged drug possession was somehow able to convince police he was the Stone Temple Pilots frontman. But the real Weiland -- upon seeing a report on TMZ's website posted Thursday that he was in jail -- quickly recorded a video and posted it on his Facebook page to prove that he was free. ""I just got done reading something very interesting, a nice piece of fiction from TMZ saying that I was in jail and have been for four months,"" the musician said in the video. ""I've actually been touring, writing and recording my new album."" Weiland has had run-ins with police before due to problems with addiction. For its part, TMZ said that -- after seeing an obviously not incarcerated Weiland -- the site ""then called the Sheriff's Dept. back but they were unwavering, telling us they did a 'physical check' on the inmate and insisted Scott 'was definitely in custody.' "" ""The BHPD got back to us late Thursday night and said they made a BIG mistake ... the inmate is actually a 44-year-old guy named Jason Michael Hurley,"" TMZ reported. ""They discovered it through belated FBI fingerprint analysis, even though he's been locked up since July 26."" According to the Los Angeles Times, Hurley gave police the name and birthdate of Weiland and now probably also face charges of giving false information to officers. Hurley remains in the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles. Weiland had a few arrests in the 1990s for drug possession and completed a stint in rehab in 2008 after being arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs.","The rocker is not in jail .

"(CNN) -- Is Orbitz trying to get Mac users to book higher-priced hotels? The travel website's CEO says that's not exactly the case. But that's how many Mac users are feeling after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Orbitz was steering Mac users toward higher-priced hotels than PC users, based on spending habits discovered by one of the site's algorithms. CEO Barney Harford told CNN that Orbitz recommendation results are part of an attempt to pair customers with the hotel they'd probably pick. In this case, Orbitz will offer recommendations based on what other PC or other Mac users selected as their final hotel, on the assumption that spending habits are the same, he said. ""What we have found is ... that Mac users are 40% more likely to book four- or five-star hotels than PC users,"" Harford said. ""That lines up with (the fact that) Mac users are typically more willing to spend more money on higher-end computers."" In the Wall Street Journal story, Orbitz engineers said they were experimenting with predictive analytics based on users' computers, which resulted in Mac users being served up a different set of results -- often with a bigger price tag. And boy, did that anger some Mac users. Once the Journal story hit, many people took to Twitter in a fury, saying that just because they shelled out money for a MacBook doesn't mean they don't want a good deal on a hotel. Others argued that buying a pricier computer would leave them less money for a vacation and make them more inclined to seek travel deals. They argued that what Orbitz is doing is unfair and that it is forcing Mac users to take longer or dig deeper for a deal. Meanwhile, rival travel sites Expedia, Priceline and Travelocity capitalized on the furor to insist that they don't use similar algorithms based on what type of computer their customers employ. Mac vs. PC: The stereotypes may be true . Online marketers have long culled information about users in order to better target ads. And studies show that consumers are indeed targeted in different ways based on their devices. You may see different promoted products on many sites depending on whether you're using a mobile app or a desktop. Marketing analysts, reacting to the Orbitz story, say the thinking is that if you're willing to shell out extra money for an iPad or MacBook, you may have more disposable income. They believe that Orbitz may be trying to skew their results for Mac users based on this perception. Orbitz, on the other hand, says it's trying to provide Mac users with the best hotel recommendations based on what other Mac users are choosing. Orbitz data show that Mac users are likely to spend $20 more a night on a hotel than PC users, on average, Harford said. Harford said his company is in no way charging Mac users more for the same hotel as PC users. ""That would be absolute nonsense,"" he told CNN. Harford said customers can always ignore the recommended options and search specifically by price. ""Our goal though is to use technology to learn from the millions who search our website every day, every week, every month, to make the consumer experience better. We are really excited about the potential to use this wisdom ... to make travel better for consumers,"" he said. ""This is just one of myriad examples of how we're making the site more customized.""","Orbitz CEO: Company tries to display search results that pair consumer with best choice .

"(CNN) -- Dutch investigators will issue a preliminary report Tuesday on the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down in eastern Ukraine in July. The Dutch Safety Board said its report will be based on the sources available. More investigations will be conducted before a final report is issued, the board said in a statement on its website. The final report is expected within a year after the crash. The Boeing 777 fell from the sky on July 17 near the Ukraine-Russia border. Of the 298 people killed, a majority were Dutch. It's unclear who shot it, but the U.S. and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile. After the crash, the separatists took control of the site for weeks, combing through the wreckage and hindering access to investigators. The plane was headed from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report .","The Boeing 777 was shot down in Ukraine in July .

"(CNN) -- Seventy-nine-year-old Henri Wosniak had only ever seen France's beloved revolutionary painting -- ""Liberty Leading the People"" -- on postage stamps. Then the real thing turned up on his doorstep. For 35 years, Wosniak worked one-meter underground in one of the coal mines dotted across the small town of Lens, in northern France. Two decades ago, the last mine closed, and the industrial city fell into a grim economic slump of ""closed shops, abandoned houses, angry residents and a boarded up cinema."" ""We became a ghost town,"" said regional president Daniel Percheron, of a city that had an unemployment rate three times the national average. Then last year, ""Liberty Leading the People"" came to town. Or to be more precise, the Louvre's sister gallery -- called none other than Louvre-Lens -- opened her gleaming doors to the public. Boasting hundreds of masterpieces on loan from the Louvre in Paris, the slick €150 million ($204 million) museum has become an unlikely art haven, sitting in the shadow of Lens' looming slag heaps. For retired miner Wosniak, the biggest thrill was seeing the gallery's star attraction -- Eugene Delacroix's ""Liberty Leading the People"" -- a painting commemorating the 1830 revolution and familiar to everyone in France. ""I had seen it on stamps,"" he says, animatedly making the small shape with his hands. ""And here it is,"" he adds, waving at the grand artwork surrounded by a throng of admirers. Happy Birthday . This week marks the first anniversary of Louvre-Lens, and already 750,000 people have visited the sleek glass and polished aluminum building, 200 kilometers north of Paris. It's a very different museum to its glamorous Parisian sister. While the Louvre -- which attracts over 9 million visitors each year -- sits on the banks of the River Seine and overlooks elegant Tuileries Gardens, Lens rests atop a disused coalmine, with views of the local football stadium. That's not to say Lens isn't a spectacular building in itself. Designed by Japanese architect firm Sanaa, the minimalist museum is remarkable in that it doesn't separate artworks according to style or era. Instead, the pieces -- spanning Greek sculpture to 19th century French painting -- are showcased together in one long light-filled gallery. Indeed, part of the reason the museum was built, was to display some of the hundreds of thousands of artworks in storage deep under the Louvre in Paris. ""The Louvre has more than 460,000 works of art, and only presents around 40,000,"" explained director Jean-Luc Martinez, who took on the top job at the world's most popular museum earlier this year. ""Why take them out? For preservation -- we are close to the Seine and they risk being destroyed."" Of course, Louvre-Lens is more than an expensive storage unit. It is hoped the new gallery with the internationally recognized ""Louvre"" name will reinvigorate the struggling city -- much like the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain, or the Tate in Liverpool, Britain. ""There was nowhere the Louvre was as needed as much as Lens,"" says the gallery's director Xavier Dectot. New era . Until now, Lens had been better known as the place you sped through from Calais' major port, to a more holiday-friendly destination. Ravaged by both World Wars, its cemeteries are full of the names of young soldiers -- and miners. When the minister of culture, Frederic Mitterrand, inaugurated the Louvre-Lens construction site, he marked the occasion with a minute silence for the 42 workers who lost their lives in a mining accident in 1974. Almost four decades later, black coal has been replaced with gleaming glass. ""There was a one in a million chance for the Louvre to come here. It's an unimaginable dream,"" said Percheron. ""The miners built France, they symbolize France. This museum is all about restoring justice to this region.""","How did an ex-mining town in northern France become an art haven?

"(CNN) -- During the last four months, the people of Ukraine have been fighting for their freedom, independence and European path in a war started by Russia-backed terrorists and their accomplices. Ukrainian military forces suffer heavy losses in battles against terrorists equipped with the newest Russian weaponry. We've seen reports of the pro-Russian thugs shooting women and children, cynically calling it a ""protection of the Russian-speaking population."" The price we are paying to bring peace back to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine is too high. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has proposed the decentralization of power as part of his peace plan. It means more freedom, more economic autonomy and more opportunities to use languages spoken in a particular community for every region. How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies . Ukraine has also demonstrated its genuine willingness to resolve this crisis through negotiations and compromises. Our armed forces have shown exceptional restraint during their military operations in order to avoid casualties among peaceful civilians and prevent destruction of their towns and villages. Our unilateral cease-fire in the zone of the conflict had lasted from June 20 to June 30, during which 27 Ukrainian servicemen, from all over Ukraine, were killed by the bandits. On July 17 we believe the terrorists fired at the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, cutting short the lives of almost 300 people. This was a tragic wake-up call to the whole world. From now on Russian exporters of terrorism bring tragedy and tears to people across the planet -- from the Netherlands to Australia. Ukrainians, knowing too well the bitterness of loss, sincerely share grief with the families of the deceased. Our government is conducting, together with a team of international experts, a thorough investigation of the circumstances of this heinous act of terrorism. There is already incontrovertible evidence that the airliner was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile system that had arrived from Russia. When civilian planes are shot down . For the first time since 1983, when a Soviet jet fighter deliberately shot down a South Korean Boeing 747, Russia stands entangled in such a horrendous tragedy. We remember that an objective investigation of that catastrophe was made possible only 10 years later, after the USSR collapsed. We would not like to have to wait that long to learn the truth about the tragedy of MH17. Indeed, the guilty must be promptly punished. We are encouraged with the growing understanding in both the West and the East of the nature of terrorism in eastern Ukraine. While U.S. senators and European Union ministers already consider designating the Donetsk People's Republic and its Luhansk twin as terrorist organizations, we expect Russia to halt its support to terrorists. Since most of them are Russian citizens and ""former"" security service officers, we also urge Moscow to take them away from Ukraine. They must go home. Russian sponsorship of terrorism in Ukraine amply demonstrates that in the 21st century any regional conflict invariably poses a threat to global security. International and internal terrorism, as well as unbridled export of conventional and high-tech weaponry, have no regard for state borders, national sovereignty or human lives. Ukraine has been consistently advocating not only international control of nuclear weapons, but today we also stand for the creation of a universal mechanism for international control of conventional arms. We strive for a world based on the respect for international law and trust between nations.

"(CNN) -- Sigrid Avrillier might be a 65-year-old woman living in Paris, but for four hours each day she is transformed into the legendary Renaissance painter, Peter Paul Rubens. You wouldn't know it to look at her -- a former physics teacher with mousey brown hair and a cheeky gap-toothed smile. But over the last few months Avrillier has come to know Rubens intimately, recreating his every brush stroke, his every color choice. ""I live with him,"" she says. ""I become him."" Avrillier is a copyist. And if you wander around the grand rooms of Paris' Louvre gallery, you'll see dozens of people just like her with their easels pitched in front of a masterpiece, paintbrush at the ready. Curious children scamper up to them, doing a double-take between the painting on the wall and the version being created before their eyes: ""What are you doing?"" they ask. The copyists are recreating some of the most famous paintings in the world, in a remarkable tradition dating back to when the museum first opened in 1793. Grand tradition . It's a tradition that continues today -- albeit it, in a far more regimented fashion. Just 150 copyists are allowed in the Louvre, with a one-year waiting list for the privilege. Each canvas is signed, dated, and stamped three times before even a drop of paint hits it. And even then, it must not be the same size as the original or include the artist's signature. Five-days-a-week, from 9.30am to 1.30pm, copyists stream into the most popular museum on the planet, using one of the easels and stools provided. There is one easel however, which never leaves the office -- the very same one renowned post-impressionist painter Paul Cezanne used 150 years ago. Mastering the masters . Indeed, Cezanne, who would often copy the great masters, once famously said: ""The Louvre is the book from which we learn to read."" He wasn't alone. Pablo Picasso also painted a fantastical version of Eugene Delacroix's ""Women of Algiers."" ""That bastard,"" Picasso reportedly said of Delacroix. ""He's really good!"" So why do these artists -- ranging from professionals painters, to students, and retirees -- spend painstaking hours perfecting what has arguably already been perfected? ""You spend so much time in front of this painting, that little by little you understand what's in it -- how he did it, the people in it, the historical context,"" explained Avrillier, who has completed five paintings from the Louvre, over four years. ""You find the right brush, the right colors, the right movement in your hand. You feel very close to them."" Curious copyists . Of course, not everyone saw copyists in quite the same light. ""Poor ridiculous folk, picking up the crumbs and alms of art at the feet of the Gods,"" said the New York Times in 1887. Today, many museum visitors appear baffled or intrigued to see the artists quietly working among the crowds, and children will often be the first to poke their head in. ""The children, they can't believe it,"" said Avrillier, who sometimes gives the youngsters a paint brush of their own. ""If you go into a museum and see paintings on the wall, you think you will never be able to do it. I say: 'But you can.' ""Anyway, we are doing copies, we are not trying to say it's a new Raphael,"" she added. It's a date? But the Louvre isn't just a giant studio for these artists -- it's also a potential meeting place for single copyists. Or at least, that's how 19th century French art critic and novelist Champfleury -- otherwise known as Jules-FranÃ§ois-FÃ©lix Husson -- reportedly saw it. ""Copy a painting next to hers, then ask to borrow some cadmium or cobalt. Then correct the odious mess of colors she calls a painting (they're always glad to get advice) and talk about the Old Masters until the Louvre closes and you have to continue the conversation in the street. Improvise the rest,"" was supposedly his advice for meeting like-minded ladies. For Avrillier, love at the Louvre comes in a very different form -- her own paintings. The last picture she completed, a one-mete- tall copy of Correggio's 16th century ""Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine,"" now sits proudly in her house. In fact, she can't bear to be apart from it. ""I love this painting so much, I put it in the room where I am,"" she says. Does that include moving it to her bedroom at night? ""Yes!"" she says.","Who are the Louvre's copyists and why do they do it?

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton have dueling opinion pieces about foreign policy in The Washington Post on Friday, but neither former presidential candidate appeared to take a stand on the current debate dominating the foreign policy arena: how to deal with ISIS. Reviewing former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's book ""World Order,"" Clinton writes that she and President Barack Obama share a similar world view as Kissinger, one that's rooted in ""a belief in the indispensability of continued American leadership in service of a just and liberal order."" Showing off its crimes: How ISIS flaunts its brutality as propaganda . Clinton, who's thinking about another run for president in 2016, argues that what makes the country a leader is not only its military strength but its ""soft power"" -- its values, relationships and diplomacy. She likes to call it ""smart power."" While she doesn't mention the emerging crisis related to ISIS, she writes, ""it's time for another of our great debates about what America means to the world and what the world means to America."" ""We need to have an honest conversation together -- all of us -- about the costs and imperatives of global leadership, and what it really takes to keep our country safe and strong,"" the Democrat writes. Romney, in his op-ed, argues that the dominating force that keeps the U.S. on top is its military strength and that one can't equate that with soft-power values. Widely seen as the GOP's party elder, Romney warns that decreasing military budgets can lead to disastrous outcomes. ""The most ludicrous excuse for shrinking our military derives from the president's thinking: 'Things are much less dangerous now than they were 20 years ago, 25 years ago or 30 years ago.' The 'safer world' trial balloon has been punctured by recent events in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, Gaza, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria and Iraq,"" the 2012 GOP nominee writes. "" 'Failures of imagination' led to tragedy 13 years ago; today, no imagination is required to picture what would descend on the United States if we let down our guard,"" he continues. Former Boston man may be helping with chilling ISIS social media, source says . While both spell out a general sense of their ideas on American leadership, neither offers a clear position on the current dilemma over how Obama should go about dismantling ISIS, the Islamist militant group seeking to create a ""caliphate"" in the Middle East. ""We have Hillary Clinton sort of arguing in the abstract for this sort of pragmatism, and interestingly aligning herself with the legacy of Henry Kissinger ... but she doesn't give any answer, she doesn't take sides on any of the debates going on,"" Molly Ball of The Atlantic said Friday on CNN's ""Inside Politics with John King."" ""And Romney is the same way,"" she continues. ""He's saying we shouldn't cut the military. Well, that's not the debate we're having right now."" The dueling op-eds also set the stage for the next two political cycles. On CNN, King asked whether foreign policy would become the major conversation driver in the midterm elections and become the early big topic in the 2016 debate. Ball argued that it will probably be ""background noise"" in the upcoming elections but won't be a decisive factor, as most races will still be based on the economy and state-specific issues. ""But absolutely, this is going to be the debate in 2016, especially with Hillary Clinton at the center of it,"" she said. Jackie Kucinich of The Washington Post said, ""Traditionally, voters don't really vote on foreign policy, and you wonder if Hillary Clinton, as a candidate potentially, if that's going to change,"" she added.","Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton offer differing viewpoints on foreign policy .
Both have previously run for president, and Clinton is thinking about running in 2016 .

"(CNN) -- It's the height of summer in Paris, and the director of the most famous art museum in the world is queuing like any other tourist. Three-and-a-half hours later, Jean-Luc Martinez finally enters the Louvre, putting his bag through security, asking for directions, stopping to buy snacks and drinks. It's a familiar story for anyone brave enough to join the snaking line during peak season. Less so, when you're the man who holds the key to the front door. A few months after taking the top job at the Louvre, 49-year-old Martinez went on a covert mission to see what it's really like for the average Joe jostling against the snap-happy masses. Why? ""If you are a professional, there is a risk at certain times you are only going to look at the museum with the eyes of a professional,"" he told CNN in his first television interview with the international press, since taking the role in April. ""The people who visit the Louvre might only stop by once, and a trip to Paris is the holiday of their life. We have to make sure that they are received with a certain dignity."" The people's museum? With over 9.7 million tourists streaming through the turnstiles last year -- easily making it the most popular museum on the planet -- the biggest challenge the institution now faces is not how to increase numbers, but how to improve the experience. How will Martinez, one of the institution's youngest ever directors, make that happen? ""I hope it will be more welcoming, which means that when you arrive at the museum there are less queues, that the people of foreign origin find reference points in their language, that with the help of Wi-Fi and apps you understand what you see,"" he said. ""I picture a museum in which everyone finds their space. What threatens museums is that it is only an elite which understands the works of art. I want a museum where there are young people, children, elderly people -- and that requires work."" Modest Martinez . It's an ambitious vision for the 220-year-old gallery, an institution so steeped in prestige that Martinez underwent an interview with French President Francois Hollande before being offered the role. But then, Martinez isn't like previous directors. Growing up in social housing just outside of Paris in the 1960s, his father was a postman, his mother a caretaker of an apartment building. A former archeology and art history professor, Martinez was head of the Louvre's Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities department before taking over from 12-year director Henri Loyrette -- himself the son of a business lawyer. Described by colleagues as a ""quiet intellectual with a penchant for tweed and sweater vests,"" Martinez says the first time he visited the gallery as an 11-year-old on a school trip, it revolutionized his view of the world. ""I was a kid that lived in a modern city, almost entirely dating from the 1960s,"" he said. ""And there I was, in the heart of Paris, shown works of art that were more than 5,000 years old and that history is profound."" Beyond the stars . Yet gaze across at the crowds scrambling to get a photo of the Mona Lisa -- while a room of precious Rembrandt paintings stands almost empty -- and you get the feeling not everyone shares Martinez's appreciation for the Louvre's vast collection. ""The majority of people want to see the works of art that are the most famous -- the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace,"" said Martinez. ""We have to do some profound work to valorize the other collections."" How? Through exhibitions of lesser-known works, new educational centers, and translating information plaques into English. Brand Louvre . Of the Louvre's 460,000 works, just 35,000 are exhibited, the rest in storage deep under the famous building. That's where Louvre Lens comes in -- a €150 million ($200 million) sister gallery in a former mining town in northern France. Opened last year, the gleaming new building displays around 200 pieces on loan from Paris. It's part of a growing Louvre empire, with another gallery set to open in Abu Dhabi in 2015, exhibiting 300 works from French museums. The United Arab Emirates is paying €400 million ($538 million) for the prestigious Louvre name. And in times of austerity, it's a deal which will help the French institution revamp its entrance and ticket areas. Does the deal also devalue the Louvre brand? ""No,"" says Martinez. ""It's an agreement, a scientific partnership, an economic partnership."" With Martinez at the helm, it's also the beginning of a brave new era for the beloved institution.","Jean-Luc Martinez, new director of the Louvre, reveals plans to shake-up establishment .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the incoming U.S. House freshmen of the 113th Congress take their class photo, the image will reflect two very different visions of the nation. On the Democratic side: Women and minorities -- a coalition that, along with young voters, largely helped re-elect President Barack Obama -- collectively will for the first time in the nation's history outnumber white male Democrats. On the Republican side: The majority of the House seats will be held by white men -- a group which far outnumbers the now dwindled numbers of House GOP women and minorities after the losses of two minority members and about a half dozen women from that caucus. ""They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Well the picture that you see before you is worth millions of votes, millions of aspirations and dreams of the American people for problem-solvers to come to Washington to get to the job done, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in welcoming the incoming freshman class to the Capitol for orientation. Pelosi's guessing game . ""Today we officially welcome our Democratic freshmen to Washington. They are extraordinary leaders who will make our House Democratic caucus the first caucus in history, in the history of civilized government, to have a majority of women and minorities in the caucus."" It also symbolizes something else that is more troubling politically. ""It's basically a sign that both parties are distilling to their core, and they are living in parallel universes,"" said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report. The stark demographic and ideological differences now reflected in the House will also likely lead to increased partisan showdowns over entitlement spending, education, health care and immigration reform, political and cultural experts say. Studies and polls have shown, for example, that women tend to be more supportive of government spending than men, and those attitudes might have helped influence women's choice for president, said Michele Swers, a Georgetown University American government professor. ""You can draw a clear line between the changing demographics of the parties and the polarization (likely to follow),"" Wasserman said. The shift is the result of an increase in the Hispanic population and concerted efforts among the Democratic leadership to recruit and support female and minority candidates coupled with the effect of redistricting, which created large majority minority districts in states such as California, Florida and Texas. 2014 battle for the Senate starts now . Democrats picked up three seats in the election so far and lead in five others yet to be resolved. A sixth race will be decided in a runoff between two Republicans. In the heavily contested race to win the newly created 9th Congressional District seat in Arizona, TV ad dollars from a Democratic super PAC helped Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, a former state senator, defeat Republican Vernon Parker, the former mayor of Paradise Valley. ""... We're seeing a record number of Democratic women elected to office,"" said Jess McIntosh, a spokeswoman with Emily's List, an organization that works to help pro-choice, Democratic women get elected to office, on Election Night. Her group supported Sinema. ""It says voters saw a clear contrast between the parties ... there was an absolute rejection of extremist Republican (proposals)."" Though there has been an increase in women elected to federal office, there is still room for progress, Jennifer Lawless, director of Women & Politics Institute at American University, said. ""Obviously this is movement in the right direction,"" Lawless said, adding women are still underrepresented in federal offices. ""Women are 50% of population, so I'm not sure we should be breaking our arms patting ourselves on the back,"" Lawless said. And with those redrawn districts comes increased polarization. Moderate Senate Democrats eye midterms warily . ""What Republicans (in state legislatures) did in redistricting was purge a lot of blacks and Latinos out of their congressional districts,"" Wasserman said. ""Non-white voters are sufficient to win those seats."" Losses among moderate, white, male ""blue dog"" Democrats and Republican women and minorities further helped change the face of Congress, Wasserman said. House Republicans lost one African-American, one Latino and a net of six women, he said. House Republicans lost one of their few African-American members when Florida Rep. Allen West appeared to have been defeated by Democratic businessman Patrick Murphy, although West refuses to concede and demands a recount. Blue dog Democrats Leonard Boswell of Iowa, Ben Chandler of Kentucky and Larry Kissell of North Carolina all lost their races. The House's congressional makeover occurs as a battle looms over immigration reform, which could not only test the new-found political sway of minorities but also the Republican Party's ability to redirect on the issue, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Strategically, Obama needs to identify pro-immigration Republicans and get them on board pretty quickly. He's got to figure out which Republicans are hip and realize the game has got to change on immigration and help protect them (so) they feel comfortable enough to defect,"" Gillespie said. Republican leaders know that there are challenges ahead. Many issues same since Obama's last news conference . ""It's clear that as a political party, we've got some work to do,"" House Speaker John Boehner told reporters after the election. ""The principles of our party are sound,"" but the question is, ""how we talk about who we are as a party?"" But politically, Republicans, who hold control of the House, have little incentive to compromise, Wasserman said. ""A lot of people who anticipated Republicans would lick their wounds ... there's no incentive for House Republicans to fold,"" he said. For now, at least. Republicans ""can't continue to write off demographics,"" Lawless told CNN. Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters -- who, according to U.S. Census figures released earlier this year, now represent more than half of the nation's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in traditional Republican strongholds such as Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend across the Southwest all the way to California, experts say. When that happens, Congress could see the type of political alliances that are now considered rare. ""We're a country that has always presumed male leadership, has always been most comfortable with white male leadership and we're watching the transition of that notion,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University.

"Sheremetyevo International Airport (CNN) -- My first morning at Moscow Airport's Terminal E consisted of an indescribable burger at Burger King. We are thinking of going to one of two TGI Friday's for dinner in Terminal D. There is always Costa Coffee for tomorrow morning if I want to walk the half mile or so from my pod hotel room. I'm on day two of my time inside Moscow's international transfer terminals. They are long, clean, stuffed with shops and not stuffed with very many people. The person I have come to look for is Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency computer contractor who spilled details of U.S. surveillance programs to reporters. President Barack Obama says he won't take extraordinary measures to track Snowden down. He is apparently holed up in here, somewhere. He is not likely in one of the hostel-like rooms you can rent by the hour, nor is he in the bars -- I have dutifully checked them all, including the annoying one with piped bird song surrounded by 1970s rustic charm. This is a 24-hour transit hub, so we could buy a beer at 2:30 a.m. and I could have bought luggage, vodka, chocolate and toys all night long. Snowden could too, but no one has seen him getting gifts for his next hosts, whoever they may be. It's not the worst place to be holed up. Our excitement Thursday was crowding around Gate 25 to see if Snowden caught the flight to Havana, Cuba. Two dozen or so journalists, most working off iPhones or iPads pretending not to be journalists, filmed and photographed bemused Russian children and their parents looking forward to a summer holiday in the sun, while an angry Aeroflot agent told us we could not film, but did nothing to stop us. A number of journalists now seem to have packed up and took the next stage out of town. There isn't another flight to Cuba until Saturday and why is it presumed he will take one any time soon? So it's another night in the hourly hotel with paper-thin walls for those of us staying. Still it's better than sleeping against a wall of Terminal E in bright lights which dozens of people did last night.","Moscow's international airport is hub of the hunt for Snowden .

"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) -- Washington no longer has a monopoly on bitter partisanship. Much of the nation's political rancor has spread to statehouses across the country. And the weekly demonstrations outside the North Carolina legislature, dubbed ""Moral Mondays,"" are only the latest example. As they have for three months, liberal activists rallied once again on Monday outside the GOP-dominated statehouse to protest what they see as an aggressive and fast-moving conservative agenda. ""First the Great Recession. Now the Great Regression,"" read one protest sign. ""It's about exposing what's immoral and extreme,"" the Rev. William Barber II, a key Moral Monday leader, said. Republican leaders in the state just walk past the demonstrators and their posters. Ever since they won control of the legislature and the governor's office for the first time in more than a century, they have repeatedly flexed their newfound muscle. Legislators' secret abortion bill fuels #vaginamotorcycles . Just this year, Gov. Pat McCrory and GOP legislators have cut unemployment benefits, rejected the expansion of Medicaid under the new national health care law, and moved to change voting laws, to the chagrin of Democrats. On the same day of the latest Moral Monday protest, McCrory announced a deal to reduce state personal income and corporate taxes. Another check, Democrats complain, on the tea party checklist. In an interview with CNN, McCrory said, ""Frankly it's pragmatic, systematic change that's going to make North Carolina more competitive."" McCrory brushed off criticisms from Democrats that he is only pushing a conservative agenda. ""I have stepped on toes in my first six months in office of the right and the left and the media,"" McCrory added. ""Maybe that means I'm doing something right."" Texas Senate OKs abortion restrictions bill . Democrats in the state, who lack any power to pass, sign, or reject laws for the first time anybody in the party can remember, feel that it's only their toes that McCrory is stepping on. And they accuse the governor and the Republicans of trying to ""turn back the clock."" ""Overall there tends to be a movement, as we would call it, backwards,"" Democratic state Sen. Ben Clark said. McCrory points to his record as mayor of Charlotte for 14 years as proof he can work with both Democrats and Republicans. But Democratic lawmakers are waiting for that bipartisan leadership to emerge in Raleigh. For progressives in a state that helped elect President Barack Obama in 2008, the only recourse is to protest. Among the thousands of protesters at this week's gathering, hundreds filed inside the legislative building for a show of force that ended with dozens of well-choreographed arrests. Gayle Ruedi, a veteran Moral Monday demonstrator who was arrested at a protest in May, said she traveled to Raleigh again, despite having her first court date this week. ""What they did with unemployment is wrong. What they did with Medicaid was wrong. (And) what they're doing with abortion,"" Ruedi said. Last week, Republican lawmakers in the state House of Representatives approved new rules governing the practices of physicians who perform abortions. McCrory has indicated he will sign the guidelines into law, a move Democrats say would break a campaign promise to stay clear of any new abortion restrictions. ""Absolutely not,"" the governor said, insisting the new rules are only a necessary legal update to regulations already on the books. ""Absolutely, that's a promise kept."" The sudden partisan combat in Raleigh is seen as a test to the state's reputation of both business-friendly and centrist leadership. ""I think there are people all over the place who say it doesn't help to have this much disagreement,"" North Carolina State University political science professor Andy Taylor said. In light of the state's 8.8% unemployment rate, McCrory argues North Carolina needed a jolt of new ideas. ""They're fighting to keep the status quo,"" the governor said of the demonstrators. Taylor says what's happening in Raleigh is a continuation of the partisan battles that have moved from Washington to statehouse in Texas and Wisconsin where Republican governors have recently pushed through controversial abortion restrictions. As in Austin and Madison, the protests from liberals are having little effect on the legislative process. Several leaders of the Moral Monday movement said they may continue their weekly gatherings beyond the end of the legislative session, knowing full well they are having little direct impact on the laws passed in their state. Their focus is on next year's elections. ""The one thing they don't want to see is all of us coming together,"" Barber said. CNN's Matt Hoye contributed to this report .","Republicans control N.C. state politics for first time in more than a century .

"(CNN) -- What started as a deeply emotional race for Tony Stewart ended prematurely when a blown tire cut short his return to NASCAR. Stewart came back to competition Sunday for the first time since his car struck and killed another driver on August 9. The crowd at the Oral-B USA 500 erupted in cheers as Stewart was introduced. But after just 172 of 325 laps at the Atlanta Motor Speedway, his front right tire blew, and Stewart's car smacked the wall on Turn 2. In the end, Kasey Kahne won the race and clinched a spot in the ""Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup"" playoff. Matt Kenseth came in second, and Denny Hamlin finished third. But many thoughts were with Stewart and Kevin Ward Jr., the 20-year-old driver who was killed at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park in New York. Stewart declined to speak to a reporter after Sunday's race. But he spoke to the media briefly Friday about Ward's death. ""This has been one of the toughest tragedies I've ever had to deal with, both professionally and personally,"" Stewart said. ""And this is something that will definitely affect my life forever."" Ward's death . Spectator video from the night of Ward's death shows two cars coming out of a turn, with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. Authorities said Ward died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Stewart withdrew from the NASCAR race in New York's Watkins Glen the day after Ward died. He also missed races in Michigan and Tennessee. Under investigation . New York authorities have been investigating the fatal crash. Ontario County Sheriff Philip C. Povero has said there was no evidence that a crime had been committed. Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. He began racing when he was 4, running go-kart events. When he was 12, he moved to the faster sprint cars. His father blames Stewart for hitting his son. ""Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,"" the father said, according to Syracuse.com. Stewart said that he wants Ward's parents and sisters ""to know that every day I'm thinking about them and praying for them."" While the incident hit him hard, Stewart said he knows ""that the pain and the mourning that Kevin Ward's family and friends are experiencing is something that I can't possibly imagine.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A clerical misstep? Failure to double-check a routine process? Whatever the cause, the seemingly accidental outing of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan could put the life of the spy and any family members in danger. It also raised the question of whether the official can continue working in Afghanistan after the revelation in a White House media report sent to about 6,000 journalists. ""I think they are going to have to pull him out, now that he's been identified publicly,"" said CNN National Security Analyst Robert Baer, noting the Taliban would likely attempt to assassinate the official. ""It will affect his career over the long term, too."" Josh Rogin, who covers national security issues for The Daily Beast, told CNN on Tuesday the mistake was ""catastrophic"" for the official's career and ""potential future as a covert operator, both in Afghanistan or anywhere else."" The official ""was in the middle of a very dangerous mission, which was to govern the transition of CIA forces in Afghanistan,"" Rogin noted. If forced to leave now due to danger over being exposed, the official's absence could hurt the mission, according to Rogin. Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official. Administration officials expressed alarm over the mistake. Deputy National Security Adviser Antony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that steps are being taken. ""It shouldn't have happened. We're trying to figure out why it happened. In fact, chief of staff Denis McDonough asked the White House counsel to look into it, to figure out what happened and to make sure it won't happen again,"" Blinken said. Asked whether the official will have to leave Afghanistan, Blinken added, ""You'll understand that I can't comment on the details, but you can rest assured that the security of this person is foremost in our minds and will be taken care of."" The official's name was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Sunday. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, ""Chief of Station."" The common practice is for the print pool reporter -- a journalist representing the wider media contingent who relays information about an event to other reporters -- to copy and paste the list provided by the White House into what is called a media pool report. It then gets distributed to a large list of media outlets by the White House, which does not edit the list. In this case, the print pool reporter that day -- Scott Wilson, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post -- noticed the unusual entry after the White House distributed the list. Wilson checked it out with officials, and the White House later distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief's name. In his account to CNN, Wilson said that when the media pool accompanying Obama arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. The official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line, ""manifest for briefing for pool,"" Wilson told CNN. That e-mail was forwarded to Wilson, and he proceeded to copy and paste it for the pool report. Wilson then sent it to the White House official, who sent the report to the distribution list that reaches some 6,000 journalists. After the initial report was issued, Wilson noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list. He flagged the White House official, who checked with the military and then said: ""This is a problem."" The White House official asked if Wilson would write another pool report that would advise journalists to disregard the previous report, which contained the chief of station's name. Wilson said he was open to the request and sent the White House a new report, but he was unsure if it got distributed. According to Wilson, another pool report from a different reporter that was distributed later included details from Obama's speech to the troops, as well as the shorter list of names that excluded the CIA official and a note saying, ""This is the correct list of participants."" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, called the accidental outing ""unpardonable."" ""This is something that they had a chance to look at and look at again, and they still allowed it to be out,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" Tuesday night. ""To me, it's unforgivable and the message has to be sent that this type of incompetence -- six years into an administration -- is just inexcusable."" A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities. The identity of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly. In the most recent case of a spy being outed, the Bush administration infamously leaked the name of former CIA officer Valerie Plame to a journalist in 2003. Plame, who resigned from the CIA after the incident, tweeted on Monday that the White House's mistake this past weekend was ""astonishing."" No one was punished for leaking Plame's CIA role to the media. Scooter Libby, the chief of staff to then-Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of perjury, obstruction and lying to the FBI about the Plame leak. President George W. Bush later commuted Libby's 30-month prison sentence. Top U.S. spy pulled from Pakistan after terror threats .

"Monza, Italy (CNN) -- Has Lewis Hamilton's luck finally turned at the 13th race of the season? The Formula One title contender beat rival Nico Rosberg to the checkered flag at the Italian Grand Prix. The dueling Mercedes teammates came to Italy bruised and bowed after a bust-up in Belgium. Rosberg had apologized to Hamilton for effectively putting him out of the race in Spa and the team made it clear under no circumstances would they tolerate another clash between its two cars. But on Monza's high-speed circuit, the German championship leader knocked himself out of contention. On lap 29, and with Hamilton looming large in his mirrors, Rosberg misjudged his braking at the first chicane -- for the second time in the race -- and Hamilton sailed past to inherit the lead. The passionate crowd roared with delight and Hamilton cruised to his sixth win of the season. ""I had the pace on everyone and on Nico and I felt that way all weekend,"" Hamilton told reporters. McLaren's 2008 champion is now 22 points behind Rosberg, who is chasing his first world title, with six races left to run. The final race in Abu Dhabi offers double points for the first time. Rosberg booed . Despite his misfortune during the race, Rosberg was booed on the podium just as he was in Spa. ""It's obviously not nice but what can I say?"" the 29-year-old said. ""I hope that with time they forgive and forget. I have apologized, I can't really do anything more than that."" There was a sweet third place for Felipe Massa, who celebrated in front of Ferrari's famous tifosi. The Brazilian, who raced in Ferrari colors for eight years, claimed his first podium since joining Williams with a controlled race. ""I'm so happy to be on the podium here,"" said Massa, who was confirmed as a Williams' driver for 2015 on Sunday along with teammate Valtteri Bottas. ""There's a lot more to come."" Mental toughness . There was a feeling before race day that the Italian Grand Prix would be a battle of mental strength as well as engine might. Whether it was brake failure, engine fires or a puncture meted out by his Mercedes teammate, fate has been a fickle friend to Hamilton. The British racer mastered the mind games in Monza. Hamilton fought back after a technical problem with his start procedure dropped him back from pole position to fourth on the opening lap. When the team advised him to maintain a two-second gap to leader Rosberg and save his tyres for a fight at the end of the race, Hamilton had other ideas. ""I knew that wasn't the way forward, so I chose another route,"" he explained. Hamilton immediately set about cutting into his teammate's lead and his looming presence was a contributing factor in Rosberg's error. ""Lewis was quick, coming from behind,"" the German said. ""I needed to up my pace and then as a result I just went into the mistake. ""That was very bad and lost me the lead."" When asked by CNN if he had proved he had the mental toughness to win the title, he answered: ""I came here to do a job and I did it."" He added: ""I came here with a positive attitude. All those experiences I've had have prepared me for it today. ""I'm quite grateful that I didn't lose it, didn't end up crashing in the first corner, I didn't end up touching anyone. ""I managed to keep my composure. [But] I'm still looking for one of those weekends where we don't have any troubles."" Significant victory? If victory boosted Hamilton's reserves in the mental warfare between the Mercedes rival, then Rosberg's confidence may have been dented by his own mistakes. Whatever the internal mental machinations, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff is still expecting the fight to the title to remain a close battle between his two racers. ""You need extreme mental strength to make it until the end and win the championship,"" he said. ""I'm impressed with Lewis as he's had some dreadful weekends and he has always come back with a smile to the next race. ""I think mentally Nico is very strong and if you want to be a world champion you have to go through lows and highs. ""Lewis has had many of them and he came back and we've seen Nico after Silverstone came back. ""I think both of them have it in them to bounce back after bad weekends.""","Lewis Hamilton wins Italy GP .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hovering above Congress with the unpleasant scent of deja vu are concerns that current budget talks seem poised to fail and that the word ""shutdown"" is back on the rise. First, there's the apparent budget impasse. ""There does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement in the budget conference,"" House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters on Tuesday. The ""budget conference"" is the 29-person House and Senate conference committee tasked with hashing out basic budget parameters, including total spending for the next two years. They have until December 13 to come up with a deal. ""Many of us are skeptics there ever will be (a deal),"" said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, adding he is confident that the leaders of the budget conference, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, are doing their best. Battle for the House in 2014: Obamacare vs. shutdown . Personal thoughts about the leaders aside, a lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear this week. On Monday, the 13 top Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee sent Ryan and Murray a letter expressing concern and urging them to at least come up with a topline figure for spending so that appropriators could then start writing the bills that actually spend the money. The lawmakers behind that letter are worried that they won't have time to write and pass appropriation bills before January 15, when government funding is set to run out. They didn't mince words in the letter: ""The failure to reach a budget deal to allow Appropriations to assemble funding... will reopen the specter of another government shutdown."" ""We need that (spending figure),"" said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, who signed the letter. ""It will probably take a good month (to write the spending bills)."" Shutdown cometh? Some aren't worried; others are . Frank, like most Republicans with whom CNN spoke, does not believe a shutdown is likely in January. Even without a budget conference deal, the House and Senate could pass simple continuing resolutions to keep government funded. Appropriators don't want that because it would trigger blunt, across-the-board budget cuts and block any chance to tailor the cuts agency by agency. So the lack of a budget deal does not mean a shutdown will happen, but nonetheless, murmurs of shutdown politics are emerging. Wolf and other Republicans are concerned that the mantle of a shutdown, or any threat of one, could again harm their party. ""We probably lost the governor's race and attorney general's race in Virginia because of the shutdown,"" he said, shaking his head. Polling after the shutdown but before the Virginia elections showed Republicans were more tarnished by the fiscal fight. In a CNN/ORC poll, 52% said Republicans in Congress were more responsible for the shutdown compared with President Barack Obama's 34%. Democrats are clearly teeing up the connection between Republicans and another shutdown. ""I think Paul Ryan ought to put a serious proposal on the table,"" said Democratic Whip Hoyer. ""Paul Ryan ought to lead, not follow his caucus down a road which would lead to shutdown."" ""No one's talking about a shutdown except for Democrats,"" responded Donald Stewart, spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. ""Everything they're doing now is to get them away from the pain and problems of Obamacare, of course they want to talk about something else."" All of this political debris is again swirling in large part because of the absence of clear progress from Ryan and Murray's budget conference talks. The two budget committee chairs and their staff have made pragmatic but hopeful statements in public. Aides from both parties tell CNN the two leaders have been in frequent contact and had face-to-face meetings. But their public words on the matter are few. On Wednesday, Ryan repeatedly donned headphones and holding his hand up as if to say ""no comment"" on Tuesday. Budget staffers from both chambers point out that the less that negotiators say during talks, traditionally, the closer they are to a deal. But in this case, the wild politics involved lead many to question whether it's in Ryan's interest to cut a deal. Senate leader pays a House call . Perhaps the most significant sign of concern came from a rare cross-Capitol visit Tuesday when McConnell spoke to a closed-door meeting of the House GOP Conference. According to multiple sources in the room, McConnell talked about the upcoming funding deadlines and made it clear that he wants the overall budget reduction slated for January to go into place. McConnell's visit was unusual, one of just a handful he's made to House conference in his six years as Republican leader. In general, he has a reputation as a practical fiscal negotiator who aims to avoid crisis. He and Vice President Joe Biden were among the final negotiators during the fiscal cliff fight of 2011 and 2012. And in October, Democrats and others pointed to McConnell's role as critical in ending the shutdown. His decision to start talking with House Republicans about the January shutdown deadline now is significant. Meantime, the budget conference committee has a timing problem. The group technically has three weeks on the calendar to hash out a deal. But in reality, Congress leaves at the end of the week for Thanksgiving and after it returns, members will have just eight days in session before that December 13 deadline. If they miss that deadline, then Congress could go home for Christmas with no plan for how to keep government funded past January 15. Lawmakers would return January 7 and have a week to decide.

"Varadero, Cuba (CNN) -- Decades navigating the roads in Cuba have left deep scars on Sergio Morales' jet black 1947 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The Harley's frame is a battlefield of craters and gashes. The frozen odometer stopped counting at 45,000 kilometers. In Cuba, where little is in abundance save shortages, Morales uses a car wheel for his motorcycle's back tire. But when Morales kick-starts the Harley, its engine roars to full-throated life. Morales is a ""harlista,"" what Cubans call the small band of men and women who have preserved the island's motorcycle culture. That hasn't been an easy task in a country where a five-decades-old U.S. economic embargo makes getting new parts -- much less bikes -- near impossible. ""It's work. You have to have spirit, desire,"" Morales said. ""There's nowhere to buy spare parts here so over the years we have had to find alternative fixes or invent our own."" And being a Harley fanatic courted controversy in the early years of the Cuban revolution when everything American, from jazz music to rock 'n' roll, was considered suspect. It also didn't help that Harleys were the motorcycle of choice for police during the Batista dictatorship. But now the iconic American bikes are enjoying something of a comeback. Over the weekend, Morales was one of about 50 harlistas to participate in Cuba's first ever nationwide Harley-Davidson rally in the beach resort town of Varadero. ""It's an opportunity for us to celebrate not just the Harley but the Cuban Harley,"" Morales said. ""And in one of the prettiest places with the best beaches in the country."" The sight of the motley crew of black leather-sporting motorcyclists pulling into a seaside town seemed like a scene straight out of the classic Marlon Brando film ""The Wild One,"" where a band of bikers terrorize a small community. But in Varadero it was the bikers who were beset upon by admiring locals and tourists. One family of American tourists said they had changed their travel plans to come from Mexico to Cuba for a few days after learning about the event. ""We are here to give these guys a hand; it's lot of work to keep their bikes running,"" said event organizer Kristen MacQueen. Cuban Harley aficionados are unique, MacQueen said, because their vintage bikes are not just for show. ""A lot of the people use them in their everyday life to get around,"" MacQueen said. ""For some people here, it's their only form of transportation."" The bikes lined up at the Varadero rally were a mix of Harleys from the decades leading up to Cuba's 1959 revolution. Some Harleys were adorned with the face of revolutionary icon Che Guevara, others with American eagles. In between demonstrating their agility in biking competitions, the harlistas checked out one another's rides and explained to tourists how they keep them running. Even with foreigners bringing in replacement parts from the outside, keeping the Harleys running is no small feat. Many of the bikes used parts cannibalized from Asian and old Soviet bikes and cars. Some Harlistas are legendary in the community for hand-making the parts they need. But however challenging, none of the Cuban Harley fanatics says they plan to abandon their passion any time soon. ""You get to a point where the Harley becomes part of your family,"" Cuban Harley owner Yuri Garcia said. ""You become inseparable. If you sold it, you'd never find another bike like it.""","Those who have preserved Cuba's motorcycle culture are called ""harlistas""

"Swat Valley, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Sabaoon School for boys in northern Pakistan is anything but average. Nestled amid the bucolic charm of the Swat Valley's fertile terraced fields and steeply rising crags it looks idyllic. But if you get up close, a harsher reality becomes clear. Two army check-posts scrutinize visitors entering the sprawling site. Once inside, the high razor wire-topped walls around the classroom compounds create a feeling reminiscent of a prison. The boys here, aged 8 to 18, were all militants at some point. Some are killers, some helped build and plant improvised explosive devices, and others were destined to be suicide bombers until they were captured or turned over to the Pakistani army. All of them are at the school to be de-radicalized. Ninety-nine percent of the boys, I am told, have never heard of Osama bin Laden, despite the fact he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in the next valley over from here. What has radicalized these boys instead, the school's director says, is what turns teenagers the world over to crime: poverty, poor education, limited prospects and often lack of parental control. It is in this setting that the boys have made ready recruits for Taliban scouts who wean them on tales of the U.S. drone strikes that have killed scores of Pakistani women and children over the past few years. EXCLUSIVE: Musharraf admits to secret drone deals . The walls of the school, I learn, are not so much to keep the boys in, but to keep the local Taliban out. A few years ago they held sway in the Swat Valley, and while the army has since reclaimed control, the militants remain a threat -- particularly for the teachers. The boys here are being schooled in basic math and literature. Drama and sports are also encouraged, as is art. Physiologists evaluate the boys and offer council, and a religious scholar is attempting to draw them away from extremist ideology and back towards mainstream Islam. For Pakistan it is a new approach to radicalism that has been forged out of necessity. The director tells me the need for more resources in Swat is huge. Just a few days before our visit, a dozen more child militants were arrested by Pakistani officials. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on drones, British lawyer Ben Emmerson, recently visited Pakistan and told me: ""The consequence of drone strikes has been to radicalize an entirely new generation."" READ MORE: U.S. drone program by the numbers . In early March he spent close to a week in Pakistan meeting government officials and tribal leaders, some of who claim to have lost family members in strikes. Since 2003 there have been more than 350 drone strikes in Pakistan, but no one has a reliable figure for precisely how many have been killed. The New America Foundation estimates that in Pakistan, drones have killed between 1,953 and 3,279 people since 2004 -- and that between 18% and 23% of them were not militants. The nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10% in 2012, the group says. A study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that since 2004, Pakistan has had 365 drone strikes that have killed between 2,536 and 3,577 people -- including 411 to 884 civilians. U.S. President Barack Obama has maintained the strikes are necessary for defeating al Qaeda and the Taliban, but others including Emmerson have their doubts. READ MORE: U.S. drone kills 4, Pakistani sources say . He said: ""Through the use of drones you may win the immediate battle you are waging against this particular faction or that particular faction ... but you are losing the war in the longer term."" Emmerson's legal insights will form the basis of his report to the U.N., expected later this year. For the United States, at least, it could make for a damning read. Emmerson says the drone strikes are illegal under international law as they violate Pakistan's sovereignty and fly in the face of Pakistani government calls for them to desist -- and that they also legalize al Qaeda's fight against America. He said: ""If it is lawful for the U.S. to drone al Qaeda associates whereever they find them, then it is also lawful for al Qaeda to target U.S. military or infrastructure where ever (militants) find them."" Until now the U.S. has used its own lawyers to give legitimacy to the covert war being waged by drones. Now Emmerson believes it is time to challenge them. ""There is a real risk that by promulgating the analysis that is currently being developed and relied up by the United States they legitimize, in international law, al Qaeda, by turning it in to an armed belligerent involved in a war and that makes the use of force by al Qaeda and its associates lawful,"" he told me.

"(CNN) -- CNN lost a much loved and respected colleague Monday with the sudden passing of photojournalist Sarmad Qaseera. A longtime member of CNN's Baghdad bureau, Sarmad had to flee his country in 2006 after death threats, eventually settling in the United States and continuing his work for CNN based out of Atlanta. He was 42. *** . In the darkest days of war and amid the chaos and despair it wrought, CNN staffers in Iraq could always count on Sarmad Qaseera to bring some light -- even humor -- to the worst of situations. He was unflappable, committed to the job and yet, at the same time, a goofball who could provide endless laughter when it was least expected and most needed. And perhaps above all, he had empathy and compassion for those who suffered most from the war. His sudden death on Monday has rocked his CNN family and a loving circle of friends and family, all of whom are trying to process how Sarmad could be taken so soon, and with so much more to conquer. From Saddam Hussein to CNN . After a childhood spent under Saddam Hussein's rule, Sarmad Qaseera used the dictator's overthrow as a springboard into a life incredibly well-lived. He came to CNN early in the war, a young cameraman recommended by his uncle Faris, himself a CNN staff member in Baghdad. CNN's Ingrid Formanek hired him in January 2003, just before the war began, mentoring a nervous, shy young man who knew not a word of English. ""He was, in many ways, shell-shocked by life under Saddam, but was obviously keen to be working for CNN,"" Formanek said. ""In the beginning, we had to try to bring him out of that shell -- something made more difficult because we had to use a translator just to give him the basics of what we needed. ""When the war started a few months later, he had already picked up some English and his true personality started shining through and it wasn't long before he was out in the field shooting stories for us. ""Sarmad was our personification of the Iraqi dream: Work hard, get out alive, take the ones you love with you if you can, find success in America and charm people along the way."" Like so many Iraqis who worked with the West, Sarmad risked his life doing so. Eventually, after a very specific death threat, he was forced to leave. But he did take one special person with him: his invalid mother, Suad. He brought her to the United States and spent his own money initially to have her cared for in his apartment 24/7. He talked endlessly to her, not knowing whether she could hear or understand. Even when he was away on assignment, he would call or Skype and have Suad's nurses hold the phone or laptop next to her. You should have heard his Wolf Blitzer impression . Sarmad had a wicked (and sometimes ribald) sense of humor. His usual greeting to me, an Australian, was a full-throated ""Kangarooooooo!!!!"" Often, in the middle of editing a story, he was inclined to do his Wolf Blitzer impersonation: ""Happening noowwww!"" His other signature phrase was an enthusiastic ""Number ONE!!!"" which could be used in Sarmad's world for just about any occasion. He was a fixture in our Baghdad operation, ever cheerful and brimming with talent, and legendary for his ability to fall asleep just about anywhere, anytime. Equally legendary was the volume of his snoring; no one could, or would, share a room with Sarmad during Baghdad assignments. Within hours of the news of his passing, my Facebook feed and email in-box were inundated by photographs and recollections, anecdotes and tributes. 'A bright light' in a war zone . Former CNN'er Aneesh Raman put it well: ""War zones sharpen edges. They harden souls. They are dark places. Which makes it all the more remarkable that those of us who met Sarmad in Baghdad remember him as such a bright light."" He had many -- so many -- close friends in the CNN family. Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh described years of working alongside him. ""From Baghdad to Beirut, Amman to Damascus, Islamabad to Tripoli, he really made some of the toughest assignments so memorable,"" she said. ""He captured every story so beautifully, his pictures told it so brilliantly. CNN lost a gift today, but we all lost the man."" Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon, who spent much of the war living in Baghdad alongside Sarmad, echoed those thoughts in recalling his work covering the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. ""He was the one who somehow saw and noticed things that we didn't,"" Damon said. ""A piece of paper fluttering amid the ashes with 'Libya is sooooo important' scrawled on it. The remnants of the last meal in the kitchen. A flower that somehow survived the carnage."" Damon and Qaseera won an Investigative Reporters and Editors Award for their coverage of the attack. Tommy Evans, a regular bureau chief for CNN in Baghdad during the war and now chief of CNN's London bureau, recalled going on a police patrol in Afghanistan with Sarmad and correspondent Michael Ware. ""We were zipping through a dark, windy residential neighborhood when an IED went off,"" he said. ""It felt like a mule kicked me in the chest."" Evans, in the aftermath of the explosion, couldn't hear or see. ""When my eyes did refocus, the air was so full of sand and dust I could no longer see Sarmad's truck in front of me. I was convinced it had been hit."" Evans jumped from the truck and ran into the road. Standing there was Sarmad, a camera on his shoulder. ""We asked each other frantically if the other was hurt. Then he looked at me and said, 'Tommy, I am so sorry,'"" Evans recalled. When asked why, Sarmad replied: ""I don't think I was rolling."" ""Later that night we got back to the safe house, covered with dust and a little blood. And we watched the tape. ... He was rolling,"" Evans said. Just weeks from U.S. citizenship . Sarmad worked for many years for CNN in Iraq, but more recently he covered many other stories, both ""good news"" assignments and conflicts, too. Correspondent Nima Elbagir remembered a funny moment with Sarmad while covering the uprising in Egypt. ""I'm a good foot taller than Sarmad,"" she said. ""So it made a lot of Egyptians laugh to see him dragging a camera case along to stand on when he was filming me. ""When it kicked off inside Tahrir Square and we'd been separated he -- all 5-foot-nothing of him -- fought his way through to find me. We used to joke it was our 'Romeo and Juliet' moment, shouting each other's names through the crowd. We eventually took shelter in the KFC overlooking Tahrir Square, and as the mob swarmed outside the now-barricaded glass doors he calmly ordered combo meals for both of us."" Another longtime CNN Baghdad bureau chief, Kevin Flower, described Sarmad's passing as a loss not only for friends and family, but for journalism as well. ""He will be forever remembered for the infectious sense of humor and smile, but he should be remembered as a journalist's journalist. The best in class. He was a true professional in every sense of the word, who brought a whole lot of important stories to the world. With Sarmad, CNN was a better news organization."" Sarmad Qaseera was taken far too soon. His American dream was still unfolding and he had so much more to give, as a professional and a man. Sarmad was to become an American citizen in the next few weeks, something he had been waiting for for so long. Ma'a as-salÄ .","Sarmad Qaseera died suddenly Monday at age 42 .

"(CNN) -- With the announcement that Richard III's long-lost remains -- curved spine and all -- are to be buried at Leicester Cathedral on March 26, 2015, the UK city is set for another spike in tourist numbers driven by the dead monarch. This time around though, there'll be plenty for visitors to look at. It's all a far cry from those first, excited days after the discovery was announced in 2012, which saw locals and tourists alike lining up for hours around the block to look at a hole in the ground. Back then there were no bells and whistles, just a strip of scraped-back asphalt, a couple of muddy trenches and the all-important grave, marked with a handful of yellow pegs and a copy of Richard III's portrait, laminated to keep out the drizzle. The grave is still there, of course, but after months of scientific tests, massive controversy and a costly court case, it's now surrounded by Leicester's newest attraction, the King Richard III Visitor Centre. The museum, which opened with much fanfare recently, tells the story of the ""three Ds"" of Richard III: his dynasty, explaining the complex family history which led to the bloody Wars of the Roses; his death, at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, defeated by Henry Tudor and later flung into an unmarked grave; and finally, the discovery of his remains. Iain Gordon, director of the new visitor center, explains: ""We start with the medieval soap opera of Richard III's rise to power, the Wars of the Roses and the 500 years of controversy that followed, and then we tell the key part of the story: the discovery."" 'Beyond reasonable doubt' It's this part, the tale of how a King of England could lie unknown and unacknowledged for centuries, most recently beneath a municipal parking lot, only to be found by a group of archeologists as stunned by what they'd found as the rest of us -- and with just enough clues to identify him -- that has fascinated people around the world. The museum shows how the excavation was carried out, and explains the complicated series of tests carried out to prove ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the remains were indeed Richard III's. There's even a replica skeleton on display so people can see for themselves the fatal blow to the head that felled the King on the battlefield, and the distinctive curved spine that gave rise to the myth of the evil, deformed monarch portrayed by Shakespeare. Gordon says that before it had even opened, the center had sold tickets to visitors from as far afield as Australia and Scandinavia, Canada, the U.S. and Germany. ""We had people walking past the door asking 'is it open yet, is it open yet?' and Australian tourists desperate to know if it would be ready before they flew home,"" he says. International attention . Gordon adds that interest in all things Richard III-related remains high -- a temporary exhibition at the city's Guildhall nearby attracted 200,000 visitors in a year, and local authorities hope the tourists will keep coming. The area between the grave site and visitor center -- housed in an old school -- and the cathedral, where the much-tested remains will be reinterred is being redeveloped, with new gardens linking the two, and part of the cathedral itself is being remodeled to make way for the new royal tomb. The idea is that tourists will be able to spend an entire day on the Richard III tour. They'll take in the Battle of Bosworth site, just outside the city, to see where he's thought to have died, the visitor center, to learn more of his story, and finally the cathedral, to visit his grave. Thankfully, there's now plenty more to see than the original hole in the ground, though that'll remain the focal part of a trip to the new museum. The hole takes pride of place in a church-like quiet room, the floor covered with glass so that people can look down into the grave itself. There is though, a nod to the high-tech era -- at certain times of the day, lighting effects make it appear as though his bones are still in the grave. In the visitor center, as well as the minds of many visitors, he will remain the King in the parking lot.

"(CNN) -- Without action from Washington, on January 2, 2013, the U.S. defense budget will undergo the most dramatic and dangerous cuts in its history. Because of the failure of the supercommittee to agree on a deficit reduction plan, the 2011 Budget Control Act automatically cuts about $500 billion from the defense budget. These cuts fall on top of the already agreed-upon $487 billion in reductions. All told, the cuts would amount to about $1 trillion over a decade. The results would be nothing short of catastrophic. But don't take my word for it. On November 14, 2011, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta wrote a letter to Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham explaining the ramifications of the full sequestration defense cuts. Should these cuts take place over the next 10 years, he said, the United States would be left with its smallest ground force since World War II; the smallest Navy since 1915; the smallest fighter force in the history of the Air Force; and the smallest civilian work force in the Defense Department's history. Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, testified on Capitol Hill in May that such cuts would leave the corps without ""adequate capabilities and capacities to meet a single major contingency operation."" National defense is only 20% of the budget, yet the sequester subjects it to 50% of the automatic cuts. The other $500 billion will be cut from domestic programs. Sequestration, which both Democrats and Republicans voted for, was intended to spur Washington to responsible action; it was never meant to be an effective deficit-reduction tool. No doctor operates with a pickax, unless, of course, he intends to maim his patient. Who's to blame for threat of defense budget cuts? Last week on my radio show, ""Morning In America,"" Sen. Graham said the full brunt of these cuts would mean ""no more F-35s, no more modern fighters"" and ""it means that those who are serving in the military will be sent off to future wars ill-equipped and unprepared."" Leaders on both sides of the aisle agree: Sequestration cuts will gut the world's greatest military. Washington cannot, and must not, allow this to happen. And yet, the president and his administration seem preoccupied with leveraging defense cuts for political gamesmanship. Last week, the White House sent a letter to Capitol Hill saying it would exempt all military personnel from the cuts, thereby avoiding the political fallout from military voters and ensuring that the bulk of the cuts come to equipment, readiness, and weapons. We may have an army, but, if the cuts happen, little to arm them with. The remainder of the cuts will fall on the Defense Department's wide network of contractors. In a recent study, the Aerospace Industries Association found that the sequester cuts could eliminate more than 2 million jobs and add 1.5% to the unemployment rate. Such massive layoffs made in anticipation of the budget cuts and before an election would be disastrous, especially in swing states, like Virginia, whose economies depend heavily on defense contractors. Knowing full well the political fiasco this would be, the Obama administration's Labor Department issued a memo advising defense industry contractors to ignore the WARN Act, which requires federal contractors to issue layoff notices 60 days before, meaning they would land in employees' hands four days before the November 6 election. Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, fired back at the White House and told contractors to ignore the Labor Department. On Tuesday, the White House finally agreed to detail exactly where these massive cuts will come from within the Defense Department and from domestic programs. The president signed the bill only after the Democrat-led Senate unanimously passed the Republican-led House's Sequestration Transparency Act, which requires the White House to inform Congress and the public exactly how and where the sequestration cuts will be made. Now that the cuts will be disclosed in full view, one cannot believe the president would go against the wishes of his own secretary of defense and generals and allow the military to be subjected to these traumatic cuts and massive layoffs. Rather, the president seems to be engaging Republicans in a high-stakes game of chicken -- his demands, like tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans, or the threat of sequestration. Republicans shouldn't yield, but call this what it is -- reckless and dangerous politicking. After all, the president is the commander-in-chief. If he takes credit for the death of Osama bin Laden, he takes responsibility for welfare of the military and the safety of America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: On January 2, the defense budget will automatically be cut by about $500B .
Bennett: ""Sequestration"" was meant to spur Washington to make a responsible deal .
Now it threatens to gut military, he says. Defense secretary, generals, politicians don't want it .

"(CNN) -- Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said he is taking a break from his re-election campaign to seek help for alcohol abuse -- hours after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine. ""It's not easy to be vulnerable and this is one of the most difficult times in my life,"" Ford said in a statement Wednesday. ""I have a problem with alcohol, and the choices I have made while under the influence. I have struggled with this for some time."" The statement, provided to CNN by Canada's CTV News, comes after the Toronto Globe and Mail reported on the new video. In the video purportedly filmed Saturday, the newspaper reports Ford is seen smoking what a drug dealer described to the paper as crack cocaine from a copper-colored pipe. Two Globe and Mail reporters viewed the video, and the publication said it was shot in what appears to be Ford's sister's basement. The paper said the substance in the pipe could not be confirmed. The video is part ""of a package of three videos the dealer said was surreptitiously filmed around 1:15 a.m., and which he says he is now selling for 'at least six figures,'"" the paper reported. Leave is immediate . Shortly after the newspaper confronted the Mayor about the video, Ford announced he was taking a break to get help. ""Today, after taking some time to think about my own well-being, how to best serve the people of Toronto and what is in the best interests of my family, I have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as mayor to seek immediate help,"" he said. His lawyer, Dennis Morris, told CNN that Ford's leave begins immediately. ""He has to take a break to re-energize, because he realizes he has flaws that have to be addressed,"" Morris told CTV. But Morris told the Globe that he questioned the authenticity of the video, and said it is hard to prove what the Mayor is smoking. ""If these guys are drug dealers and there's money involved, they can say whatever they want to get more money, to extract more money from the people who are paying,"" he said of the seller. The Globe said it did not buy the video, adding it purchased screen grabs from the three clips. Fall from grace . Ford's fall from grace started in May 2013 when a cell phone video taken months earlier appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. Despite intense public pressure, he remained defiant and denied using any illicit drugs. In November, the city council stripped him of most of his power as mayor. That didn't stop Ford, though. He ignored calls to enter rehab or resign, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. ""If you think American-style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait,"" he said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers. Seeking another term . And none of this stopped Ford from seeking another term in office, something he's done for the past few months despite continued public ridicule and other challenges. In January, he admitted he had suffered a ""minor setback"" after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief while at a fast-food restaurant. Again, he insisted that he'd had a small amount to drink, but he hadn't taken any drugs. ""As you know, I'm a human being -- the same as every one of you,"" he told reporters at the time. ""And I'm entitled to a personal life, and my personal life does not interfere with the work I do, day-in and day-out, for the taxpayers of this great city.""

"(CNN) -- The estranged wife of banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling says she supports the decision by the National Basketball Association and the team to work together to find the franchise a new chief executive officer. Shelly Sterling, a co-owner of the Clippers, said she spoke with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to tell him she supported his decision to fine her husband $2.5 million and ban him for life after racist remarks by Donald Sterling became public. ""We also agreed at that time that, as a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomplished executive leadership for the Clippers,"" Shelly Sterling said in a written statement Saturday. Her statement didn't mention the potential sale of the team, which Silver has said he will press the other 29 ownership groups to mandate through a vote. The league said in a news release that now that Donald Sterling is banned from team operations, it is best that the league step in temporarily. ""The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization,"" NBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said in a statement. ""The process of identifying that individual is under way."" While the team has been distracted off the court, it has continued winning on it. The Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors 126-121 Saturday to win its first-round series in the NBA playoffs. The Clippers will face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday in the Western Conference semifinals. NBA to name new CEO for the Clippers . V. Stiviano speaks . After dodging the media for days, the woman who recorded Donald Sterling making the racist remarks urged him to apologize. In an exclusive interview with ABC's Barbara Walters on Friday, V. Stiviano said Sterling is hurting after the scandal that turned him into a sports pariah. ""I think he feels very alone. Not truly supported by those around him,"" Stiviano, 31, said. ""Tormented. Emotionally traumatized."" But, she told Walters, this is not the first time they've discussed race. ""There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one,"" she said. ""Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know."" One recording of Sterling's conversation released last month triggered a firestorm that led to his ban and league-record fine. In the audio, the billionaire tells Stiviano not to ""promote"" her relationship with black people or bring them to games after she posted a picture on social media with NBA legend Magic Johnson. Stiviano said Sterling should apologize for the comments and has discussed it with him. ""God only knows,"" she said when asked if he will apologize. Stiviano's attorney has said she did not leak the audio tape. Shelly Sterling is suing Stiviano, saying the woman received cash and property purchased with the couple's money. Stiviano says the items were gifts. On Friday, Donald Sterling was quoted on DuJour.com as saying ""I wish I had just paid her off"" in reference to Stiviano. The site, which specified that Sterling was referring to Stiviano in a discussion with one of its writers, didn't state when the remark was made. Donald Sterling's fall . Other NBA owners, players and sports commentators called for swift, firm punishment after TMZ posted the audio featuring the racist comments purportedly made on April 9. Silver heeded their call, issuing sweeping sanctions against Donald Sterling on Tuesday. Under the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings. If Sterling does sell the team, he'd profit considerably. He bought the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, and the team is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine.

""We treat the cancer according to its origin."" In other words, doctors treat prostate cancer that has spread to a patient's bones differently than they would treat bone cancer. Harper rose to fame playing Rhoda Morgenstern on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoff ""Rhoda."" In 2009, she was diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer. Doctors removed the tumor and told Harper the cancer had not spread to other parts of her body. Then in January, Harper spent a week in the hospital after falling ill during a play rehearsal. ""The side of my face started to feel kind of numb. I was slurring my speech,"" Harper told The New Yorker. Doctors ruled out a stroke and continued to do more tests. Shortly after, Harper was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, also called cerebral carcinomatosis. The cancer cells from her lungs had spread to the meninges, which is three layers of tissue that protect the central nervous system. Think of it like a bag that contains the brain, spinal cord and spinal fluid. This metastasis happens in about 3% to 5% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, Brawley said. ""It is like little grains of rice sprinkled on the surface of the meninges when seen (during an) autopsy,"" he said. ""It is diagnosed in life with a spinal tap, and you find cancer cells in the spinal fluid."" It's rare that someone does well with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, Brawley said, which may explain why Harper's doctor said her current health ""defies the odds."" But most outlets didn't publish the doctor's following quote from the ""Today"" piece: ""The problem is that at any time this can change."" The treatment that Harper has undergone -- most likely chemotherapy administered through a spinal port, Brawley said -- reportedly is working to slow the disease. But these cancer cells are adaptable and will develop resistance to the treatment. So short of a miracle, complete remission isn't in Harper's future.

"(CNN) -- Life on Mars? That's the question facing the NASA team responsible for putting together the objectives for 2020 rover mission to Mars. ""We're still on the quest to answer the grand question: Is there life somewhere else in the universe?"" John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science, told reporters Tuesday in a teleconference. Previous missions to Mars have found definitive signs that water once flowed in a crater and rock samples that show signs of clay minerals. ""We really needed to go back to the surface, and go to the next stage. ... Did Mars ever have life?"" Grunsfeld said as he previewed a 160-page report prepared by the Mars 2020 Science Definition Team, a group assembled by NASA to outline the objectives of the mission. The 2020 rover mission to Mars is considered essential to meeting President Barack Obama's challenge to send a manned mission to the planet in the 2030s. Among the objectives of the 2020 rover mission will be the search for signs of life, the collection of samples to possibly be returned to Earth and testing technology that may allow for a manned mission to Mars. Astronauts would face high radiation on Mars trip . ""We want to be able to seek signs of life: Had life been there, did it leave a mark?"" said Jack Mustard, a member of the development team and a chair and professor of geological sciences at Brown University. As part of the preparation for the mission, NASA plans to conduct an open competition. It is planned by NASA for the space technology and scientific instruments that will be carried by the rover and used in the mission, according to the report. In addition to the 2020 mission, NASA is scheduled to launch the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission in November 2013. That mission is set to explore the compounds of the Martian atmosphere, which scientists say will offer a glimpse into the planet's climate and habitability. In 2016, a collaboration between the European Space Agency and Russian Federal Space Agency is expected to launch an ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter -- a mission to map methane and other gases on Mars. The European and Russian space agencies plan to launch the ExoMars rover in 2018. ""What we have over the next 10 years is a very comprehensive series of international missions to Mars,"" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington.

"(CNN) -- Since March 11, the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material: . Reactor No. 1 . The ""vapor"" rising near the No. 1 reactor at the plant is ""only natural"" and not a cause for alarm, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Thursday, especially since water is now in that unit's nuclear spent fuel pool. The temperature at the No. 1 reactor ""right now is going down,"" he added. Light was restored Thursday in the No. 1 reactor's central control room, a Tokyo Electric Power Co. official told CNN. But it was just a partial restoration, as workers continued to try to get electricity going for control panels and cooling system pumps at the reactor. Hidehiko Nishiyama, an official with Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency, said that the hope is to begin cooling the unit's spent fuel pool -- which is thought to be fully or partially exposed -- on Friday using outside power. According to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, a nuclear industry group basing its data on official government and utility information, the No. 1 unit's reactor core has been damaged, but its containment vessel was not. As of Thursday, the unit's cooling systems were still not operational, with seawater being pumped into the reactor. Still, the building itself was ""severely damaged"" by an earlier hydrogen explosion. There were concerns Thursday, according to the trade group, that pressure in the reactor was rising. Reactor No. 2 . Nishiyama on Thursday described the No. 2 unit as ""quite stable."" But he did note -- but did not explain -- that there had been ""high radiation readings"" nearby. Seawater continues to be pumped in an effort to cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Damage is ""suspected"" in this unit's containment vessel -- the only such vessel so compromised, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. The reactor's core is also thought to be damaged. But the building itself has only been ""slightly damaged,"" the same group reports. With the cooling system still not working, seawater has been injected into both the unit's reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool. Like units Nos. 1 and 3, the reactor's fuel rods are thought to be fully or partially exposed, leaving them susceptible to overheating and subsequent emissions of radioactive material into the air. Reactor No. 3 . By 10 a.m. Thursday, black smoke spotted a day earlier rising from the No. 3 reactor had stopped, according to Nishiyama. He said the cause of the smoke remains unknown, speculating it may have come from burning oil or machinery nearby. Edano announced Thursday that, the previous day, three workers were exposed to more than 170 millisieverts of radiation while laying cable in the No. 3 reactor's turbine building. Two of them were hospitalized. By Thursday, work had resumed at that reactor. Beginning shortly after 5:30 a.m., about 500 tons of seawater began being injected into it, Nishiyama said. Authorities intend to eventually switch to adding fresh water, he said, without providing an explanation as to why or a timetable. In addition, firefighters from Tokyo and Yokohoma cities are preparing to spray another 500 tons of water toward that reactor's nuclear spent fuel pool, which Nishiyama said could happen Thursday or Friday. These pools contain fuel rods that, if not cooled down, can overheat and, in the process, release radioactive vapors into the air. The building of the No. 3 reactor was ""severely damaged"" after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas, reports the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. Its core reactor is also damaged, its fuel rods are either partly or fully exposed. As to its nuclear spent fuel pool, reports are that the pool itself was ""possibly damaged,"" and the water level has been low -- a reason for the repeated spraying. On the positive side, the No. 3 unit's containment vessel is not damaged, according to the nuclear trade group. Reactor No. 4 . Members of Japan's self-defense forces on Thursday doused the nuclear spent fuel pool at the No. 4 reactor. Nishiyama estimated that this effort should wrap up Friday. Along with the Nos. 5 and 6 units, the No. 4 was offline on a scheduled outage when the earthquake hit, and as a result the reactor's water level and pressure are continued safe. But its nuclear spent fuel pool was ""possibly damaged,"" which is why authorities have said its water levels are low and why they've made repeated efforts to fill it up with seawater. Reactor No. 5 . The No. 5 unit appears safe, for now, Nishiyama said. Workers were trying Thursday to repair the unit's cooling system, which gave out the previous day. The temperatures in the unit remained relatively low, though authorities acknowledged that they could rise again if the cooling system isn't fixed soon. As with units Nos. 4 and 6, this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself. The nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning, aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool. Reactor No. 6 . The No. 6 unit appears safe, for now, Nishiyama said. Workers were trying Thursday to repair the unit's cooling system, which gave out the previous day. The temperatures in the unit remained relatively low, though authorities acknowledged that they could rise again if the cooling system isn't fixed soon. The No. 6 reactor was offline when the tsunami struck, and there are no major concerns about the structure or safety of its core or containment vessel.

"(CNN) -- It makes its World Cup debut in Brazil later this year and is already being used by the English Premier League, but the head of European football remains resistant to the introduction of goal-line technology (GLT) for Europe's top competitions. The technology allows referees to make almost instant decisions on awarding goals if the ball has crossed the line. However, UEFA president Michel Platini advocates using extra officials behind the goal, a method used in the Champions League, Europa League and Italy's top division. The Frenchman, who won the European Championships with his country in 1984, prefers UEFA to invest in grassroots football and develop young players rather than spend millions of dollars on installing GLT in stadia. ""I prefer that we have more referees to see if there is a penalty foul and if the ball is going over the line,"" Platini told CNN. ""We don't need perfect camera to see the ball. ""For the Champions League, it's too expensive,"" added Platini, who despite his philosophical opposition to GLT, admitted it could be used during Euro 2016 if that was the consensus of UEFA's executive and referee committees, set to be held in France. Estimating that GLT woud costs â‚¬52 million to use in Champions League matches, Platini said: ""I prefer to give these millions of euros to grassroots, to the young players in football, to some infrastructures so they can play football."" England's top flight adopted GLT for the first time at the start of the 2013-14 season, while the Dutch Eredivisie also uses the technology. Germany's top two divisions will make a decision on whether to use GLT for the 2014-15 campaign before the end of the current season. Bayer Leverkusen's ""ghost goal"" against Hoffenheim in October, when Stefan Kiessling's header went into goal through a hole in the side of the net, illustrated the mistakes that can be made when techonology isn't used. But Platini insisted the example of Italy shows how using more officials can reduce refereeing errors. ""If you want to make a point about five referees, you have to go to Italy because it's been implemented for two years and is working very well,"" he added. ""Thirty five national associations are using the five referees in the world. ""But in Africa, there is only one referee. They don't have the money to afford GLT. There is no money. It's easier to have five referees that you don't pay."" Platini's homeland will host an expanded European Championships in 2016 -- with 24 teams set to compete compared to 16 in 2012 -- before the tournament changes format ahead of the 2020 edition. Rather than one single country hosting Euro 2020, it will be played across 13 different European cities with the venues set to be announced following a vote in September. Blog: Can football change the world? The pan-European format is Platini's way of marking the 60th ""birthday"" of the tournament and the former Juventus player wants to see Turkey host the final. ""Turkey lost against my country 6-5 (in the vote for Euro 2016) and it is a long time that they have been bidding for some things,"" added Platini. ""They bid for the Euros, they bid for the Olympic Games and I think in the end it will be a beautiful festival for one week with the semifinal in a big country, a beautiful country ... like Istanbul,"" said Platini, referring to the Turkish city. Critics have argued the expansion of teams in the Euros will dilute the quality of the competition, but Platini dismissed those fears. ""I am a man of football, I never will propose to the national association something which is not good for the football,"" he said. ""Never. ""I have to receive the feedback of the fifty-four national associations. Fifty-two were in favor, two were not in favor: Germany and England, but they say we move with the majority. ""I think 24 teams in Europe are good (enough) to win. That means that the quality of the football is not a problem. ""I have to take care about what is good for the football and I only do it for the football. And to me, it was good for the football to extend to 24."" Platini has been head of UEFA since 2007 and a bid by him for the presidency of FIFA, football's global governing body, has been mooted. The current FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been in the position since 1998 and he had announced his intention to step down from the role ahead of a presidential election in 2015. But he has since said he will reverse that decision if the FIFA members ask him to remain. Platini, a FIFA vice president, was tight-lipped on whether he will be running against Blatter and his fellow Frenchman Jerome Champagne, who announced his intention to run for the presidency in January. ""I didn't think about that a lot because I am very busy and it's so far, one year from now and we don't know what could be,"" said Platini. ""I have to speak with the national association of Europe, I have to travel and I don't take the time to think about that. ""I am working here. We have many projects ... After this work, perhaps I will think about FIFA ... perhaps I don't know.""","Michel Platini reiterates his preference for extra officials over technology in football .

"Washington (CNN) -- The 2012 presidential election shattered spending records, further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags. The race appeared to be a nail-biter going into Tuesday night but in the end, it came down to the state that most had been saying for weeks that it would â€” Ohio. Here are five things we learned from Tuesday . Victorious Obama faces familiar challenges . 1. The GOP has a Latino problem . ""If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. ""The big issue Republicans are going to have to wrestle with is the Hispanic issue,"" adds Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's first press secretary. ""Republicans are going to have to find a different way forward."" The national exit polls tell the story. Latinos are the fastest growing-segment of the population. Their share of the vote expanded from 9% in 2008 to 10% in this election. The president won 67% of the vote four years ago. He increased that to 71% this year. Latinos were crucial in helping Obama win the battleground states of Colorado and Nevada, and in putting the president in the lead for Florida's 29 electoral votes. And they were just as important in turning the former swing state of New Mexico into what appears to be an increasingly safe state for the Democrats. CNN Election Center: 2012 exit polls . If the current trend continues, Arizona and Texas could turn from red to purple. The 2012 election is a loud wake-up call for the GOP to change its stance on illegal immigration. And that's being acknowledged by arguably the best known Latino Republican senator. ""The conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night. Opinion: Five things Obama must do . 2. The youth vote came up big â€” and the white vote got smaller . A big question heading into Election Day was whether younger voters would show up at the polls. More of them did than last time. According to national exit polls, 18-29 year olds increased from 17% to 18% of the electorate from 2004 to 2008. They made up 19% of the electorate this time around. That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president's drop in capturing the youth vote, from 66% in 2008 to 60% in 2012. It wasn't just age, but also race, that worked in the president's favor. Obama's share of the white vote dropped from 43% four years ago to 39% this year. But that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74% of the electorate four years ago to 72% now. And the African-American percentage of the electorate stayed steady at 13%. Some GOP strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74% for Romney to win. ""The youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that's to the president's credit,"" Fleischer said. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . 3. The auto bailouts helped drive Obama to victory in Ohio . For months, the Obama campaign touted the taxpayer bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler, and they were given prominent prime-time placement during the Democratic National Convention in early September. It's a strategy that the Obama campaign thought could be the difference in Ohio, a major base for the auto industry that eventually decided the election. ""The American auto industry is back on top,"" Obama said campaigning last week in the Buckeye State. The bailouts were started under President George W. Bush in 2008 but Obama grabbed the keys to the program the next year, managing and funding the assistance. Romney opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed and managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. The Obama campaign and other Democrats have attacked Romney over his opposition to the federal intervention, which aided the companies through their eventual bankruptcies. And in the final weeks leading up the the election, the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China. Portman stands by Romney auto ads . It seemed to work. Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters. Economy tops voter concerns in exit polls . 4. Romney wasn't able to expand the map . Much was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election, and Romney's return to the Keystone State on Election Day. The Romney campaign and allied super PACs supporting the GOP nominee flooded Pennsylvania airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads. To a lesser degree, there was a similar push in Minnesota, another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month. There was talk by Romney campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map. It didn't pan out. While Romney performed stronger than 2008 Republican nominee John McCain in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it wasn't enough. And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago, it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again. Romney's 'all' proved not enough . 5. What will $6 billion get you? We had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election. And we'll have a Democrat in the White House, with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate after the election. When all the bills are in, total spending for the 2012 election (all federal and state races) could top a record-breaking $6 billion. And what did all that money buy? 2012 election priciest to date: $4.2 billion tab and rising . Some would argue ... nothing.","The president increased his support with Latinos, the fastest growing segment of the population .
Changes in the size of the youth vote and the white vote worked in Obama's favor .
The auto bailout helped Obama in Ohio, a crucial battleground .
Romney failed to expand the map and lost in Pennsylvania and Minnesota ."
"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Dozens of members of the group ""Ladies in White"" were detained Sunday in Havana and several -- including the group's leader -- were unaccounted for and believed to be under arrest, a group member said. The organization, ""Damas de Blanco"" in Spanish, is composed of the family members of Cuban dissidents, many of whom have been jailed. Every Sunday, the women march silently from a Havana church to their homes to protest against the Cuban government. The island's government says the women are paid by the United States to create disturbances on the island. ""We were doing our march as we usually do when women dressed in civilian clothes stopped us,"" said group member Katia Sonia. Sonia said she recognized the women as state security agents. She said the women made the 22 marchers get into vans and cars. They were then taken to a police station and questioned, Sonia said. All 22 women were later released, she said. But 52 other women, including group leader Bertha Soler, who did not arrive at the church for Mass, were unaccounted for, Sonia said. She said other members had heard the women were detained as they made their way to the Mass. The Ladies in White have asked to meet with Pope Benedict XVI when he makes his first visit to Cuba in a week. So far Cuba's Catholic Church has not responded to their request. Sunday was the ninth anniversary of what is known in Cuba as ""the Black Spring,"" when 75 dissidents were arrested by the government.","The Ladies in White are relatives of Cuban dissidents .

"(CNN) -- A jailed American contractor said Friday he feels like a ""hostage,"" in Cuba, where he is serving a 15-year prison sentence on charges of subversion. Alan Gross was arrested in 2009 while working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Gross' family and attorneys say that he traveled to Cuba to help link the country's small Jewish community to the Internet. But Cuban authorities say Gross imported sensitive communications equipment to connect dissidents. ""I feel like I'm a hostage,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, speaking by phone from the Carlos J. Finlay Military Hospital in Havana. ""The president of the Dominican Republic told me two years ago when he visited, he said: 'Alan, I hope you realize this is not about you.' And at the time, I could understand that. I could intellectualize it -- that it wasn't about me, that it was an effort on the part of the Cuban government to express its disdain to the United States,"" he said. ""But right now, it is about me. It's about my family and it's about my mother. And I'm taking this very personally,"" he said. He asked that be allowed to visit his dying mother, who is suffering from cancer and getting along in age. ""I have a 90-year-old mother who has inoperable lung cancer. She's not getting any younger, and she's not getting any healthier,"" he said. ""My lawyer and I have written, on more than one occasion, to the government of Cuba requesting permission for me to visit her. I would return to Cuba. You can quote me on that,"" Gross said. Earlier this year, his attorney said the mother's final wish is ""to be able to see her son once more before her battle with cancer is lost."" The Cuban government has not yet responded to their request. Gross, 63, has been held in Cuba for two years and five months. He's lost about 100 pounds during that time but said his overall condition is fine. After having not been allowed to see the sun for a year and a half, Gross said he is now permitted to go outside. The quality of his food has also improved, he said. Last year, Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state -- charges Gross described as ""laughable."" His case sank U.S.-Cuba relations to a new low after initial signs of thawing when President Barack Obama took office. The State Department has said no progress will be made until Gross is released. ""If I weren't in this situation, I would be laughing about it because I'm about as much of a threat to the security and the state as the chair is that I'm sitting on right now,"" he said.","Alan Gross was arrested in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years in prison .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans mourned the death of their first black president, weeping, singing and gathering near Nelson Mandela's homes and other landmarks linked to him nationwide. Mandela, 95, died Thursday in Johannesburg. ""We will always love Madiba for teaching us that it is possible to overcome hatred and anger in order to build a new nation and a new society,"" President Jacob Zuma said Friday, referring to the revered statesman by his clan name. In Soweto township, where Mandela lived before he was imprisoned for 27 years, giant posters of his face adorned streets. Residents surrounded his former red brick house on a busy street and sang songs of freedom. On the grass near Mandela's home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton, children spelled out with rocks ""We love you Mandela."" Others wept, lit candles and sang in celebration of a life well lived. Tributes planned . A state funeral will be held December 15 in his ancestral hometown of Qunu in the Eastern Cape province. Before the funeral, various events to honor him are planned in major cities. Sunday will be a national day of prayer and reflection, and people will gather in places of worship to pray and meditate, Zuma said. The official memorial service will be held Tuesday in First National Bank Stadium in Johannesburg. And his body will lie in state at the seat of government in Pretoria from Wednesday through next Friday. Zuma announced the death late Thursday in a nationally televised address. ""Our nation has lost its greatest son, our people have lost a father,"" he said. ""Although we knew that this day would come, nothing can diminish our sense of a profound and enduring loss."" In recent years, Mandela had battled health issues that included multiple hospitalizations for treatment of a recurring lung infection. Many South Africans didn't get the news until Friday morning. ""I woke up and was shocked when I saw it on television,"" said Wilson Mudau, a cabdriver in Johannesburg. ""It's sad, but what can we do? Let him rest in peace. It's time ... Madiba has worked so hard to unite us."" Memorials worldwide . Nearly 8,000 miles north of Johannesburg, in Paris, leaders from 53 African countries attending a summit on peace and security observed a minute of silence for him Friday. Memorials popped up from Los Angeles to Chicago, where mourners placed flowers and candles in front of murals bearing his likeness. In Washington, crowds gathered in front of the South African Embassy. In Adelaide, Australia, cricket fans observed a moment of silence. ""I admired Mandela (because) he had not poisoned his heart,"" said Leo Udtohan of Bohol, Philippines. ""He learned to forgive despite the horror he experienced while in prison."" At New York City's Apollo Theater in Harlem, which Mandela visited in 1990, the marquee lit up in tribute. ""In memory of Nelson Mandela, 1918-2013,"" it said. ""He changed our world."" Man of complexities . Mandela helped South Africa break the practice of racial segregation and do away with white minority rule. Imprisoned for nearly three decades for his fight against state-sanctioned racial segregation, he was freed in 1990 and quickly set about working to unite the nation through forgiveness and reconciliation. ""As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison,"" Mandela said. His rejection of vengeance led him to assume roles that led from freedom fighter to prisoner to a world symbol of the struggle against racial oppression. And, four years after he left prison, he became the nation's first black president, cementing his place in the consciousness of the nation and the world. ""I'm just glad he finally found his place of rest,"" said Omekongo Dibinga of Washington. ""From the family drama to his health problems, it just seemed like he could never get a break in his later years. Now I hope be can finally rest, but he'll probably still be watching down on us in frustration."" 'We all knew he'd leave us' His recent bouts of illness had prepared many South Africans for Thursday's announcement. ""We all knew he'd leave us at some point,"" said Tony Karuiru, a Johannesburg resident. ""But we were hoping that he would be with us during the festive season. It's the holidays, I just wish God would have given him a few more days with us as well."" Thomas Rabodiba said though he expected Mandela's death, he was having a hard time accepting it. ""At first, when I heard he died, I thought it was the usual rumors we get all the time,"" he said. ""After I heard the president's announcement later that the old man has departed, then I believed that he's really gone."" His legacy . Mandela will be remembered for many things, but his message of forgiveness and reconciliation may resonate the most. ""Mandela's biggest legacy ... was his remarkable lack of bitterness and the way he did not only talk about reconciliation, but he made reconciliation happen in South Africa,"" said F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's last white president and Mandela's predecessor. Leaders react . Zuma has ordered flags around South Africa to be flown at half-staff until the funeral. The U.S. government and Buckingham Palace also lowered their flags. ""Nelson Mandela achieved more than could be expected of any man,"" President Barack Obama said Thursday. ""We have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this Earth. He no longer belongs to us -- he belongs to the ages."" In recent years, plans for a fitting farewell were hammered out among the government, the military and his family. Events over the next 10 days will culminate in a state funeral to be broadcast worldwide and a private farewell for those closest to him. CNN's Arwa Damon reported from South Africa, and Faith Karimi and Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Mandela dies at age 95 .

"Washington (CNN) -- It is up to the Justice Department to determine if there will be criminal charges in the release of classified military documents by WikiLeaks, but Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday the website is morally guilty for putting lives at risk. On the ABC program ""This Week,"" Gates declared himself ""mortified"" and ""appalled"" over the public dissemination of 76,000 documents that detailed military operations in Afghanistan. ""If I'm angry it is because I believe this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk,"" Gates said, citing a Taliban statement that it would seek out informants and other collaborators exposed by the documents. He said the issue involved two areas of culpability - legal and moral. While the Department of Justice will decide on the legal questions, ""there's also a moral culpability, and that's where I think WikiLeaks is guilty,"" Gates said. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also cited the Taliban's threat to sources named in the leaked documents, saying the United States had a ""moral obligation"" to protect their safety. However, neither Gates nor Mullen, who appeared on both the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" and the NBC program ""Meet the Press,"" could cite a specific example of any Taliban attacks based on information from the leaked materials. The public face of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, says the purpose of posting the leaked documents was to increase awareness of the realities of the war within the American public. Gates, however, complained that there was no accountability for WikiLeaks in making public the documents presumably leaked by military personnel. One suspect, Pfc. Bradley Manning, is in custody as part of what officials call a widening investigation. Manning has already been charged with leaking a 2007 airstrike video and downloading documents from classified military systems. The documents posted last week are divided into more than 100 categories and touch on everything from the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to Afghan civilian deaths resulting from U.S. military actions. Thousands of pages of reports document attacks on U.S. troops and their responses, relations between Americans in the field and their Afghan allies, intramural squabbles among Afghan civilians and security forces, and concerns about neighboring Pakistan's ties to the Taliban. According to Gates, an effort by the military to provide up-to-date information to the frontlines helped ease the ability of the documents to get leaked. ""Had whoever did this tried to do this at a rear headquarters overseas or pretty much anywhere here in the United States, we had controls in place that would have allowed us to detect this,"" Gate said. A change made for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to ""put as much information as far forward as possible"" made it ""much easier to do in theater"" than anywhere else. However, Gates said he believed the benefit to soldiers in the field of having updated information probably outweighs the risk of a single soldier or a few leaking classified material. ""If one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the frontline by denying them this information ... my bias is against that,"" Gates said. ""I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have.""","Gates and Mullen say WikiLeaks did harm in posting classified documents .
The Justice Department will decide on criminal charges, but WikiLeaks is morally guilty, Gates says .

""(W)hen you talk about 'the gay community,' you are talking about MY community,"" Nairn said when questioned about his gay fan base. ""I've never hidden my sexuality from anyone, my whole life in fact, and I've been waiting for someone to ask about it in an interview, (because) it's not something you just blurt out.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The inquest into the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash in 1997 returned a verdict of unlawful killing on Monday, blaming ""grossly negligent"" driving by her chauffeur and pursuing photographers for the car wreck. Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997. Coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker, holding the inquest into the deaths of Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, had earlier Monday told the 11 jurors that he would accept a verdict if nine of them agreed. The jury had been deliberating since last Wednesday, April 2. The jury's first task was to decide whether French investigators got it right within days of Diana's death when they concluded that her speeding driver, Henri Paul, was drunk. The second issue for the six women and five men was whether the paparazzi who chased the princess around Paris bore a heavy responsibility for the deaths. On both counts their answer was yes.  Watch report on the jury verdict » . Baker also told the jury last week to consider whether Diana and Fayed would have lived if they were wearing seat belts and whether Diana would have survived had she been taken to the hospital faster. The jury decided that the fact that the couple were not wearing seatbelts was a contributory factor. After the verdict had been returned, Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police during an earlier inquiry, said it had been an unprecedented inquest and that he hoped that those killed would now be allowed to rest. ""There have been a number of allegations which have been unfortunate,"" said Stevens, referring to the conspiracy theories raised during the inquest by lawyers for Mohammed al Fayed, father of Dodi. ""I just hope this can bring closure to what has been a traumatic event for a lot of people."" But a spokeswoman for al Fayed said that he felt vindicated by the jury's verdict and that he was shocked that senior members of the British royal family, French police, pathologists and the paparazzi among others had not been compelled to give evidence.  Al Fayed, who was present for the verdict, said of the couple: ""I will always mourn their loss to me and to the world,"" reported his spokeswoman. Asked whether al Fayed planned to challenge the verdict by means of a High Court judicial review, Michael Coles, al Fayed's press agent, said: ""That is a very difficult route but we are keeping all our options open."" In a statement issued Monday evening, Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, offered their thanks to jurors ""for the thorough way in which they have considered the evidence."" ""We agree with their verdicts, and are both hugely grateful to each and every one of them for the forbearance they have shown in accepting such significant disruption to their lives over the past six months,"" the princes said. They also thanked the rescuers who tried to save the 36-year-old princess and the 250-plus witnesses who appeared during the inquest, ""in many cases reawakening their painful and personal memories."" The British inquest into the August 31, 1997, deaths began in October after a decade of British and French police investigations and French court proceedings. The jury's role was to determine how the victims died; it had no authority to blame any individual.  See gallery of images related to Diana inquest » . Baker said there was ""no evidence"" that the British secret service -- or any other government agency -- had anything to do with the crash, as Fayed's father had alleged. The inquest is the official British inquiry into the deaths of the princess and Fayed while they were fleeing paparazzi photographers. It began October 2 and has cost an estimated £8 million ($16 million), Stevens said.  Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Fayed were killed when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being followed at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. More than 240 witnesses have given evidence, including Diana's close friends, Prince Philip's private secretary, a former head of the Secret Intelligence Service and Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell.

"(CNN) -- The skies are under threat. Not from terrorists or hardened criminals, but from everyday passengers who seem to go a little loco when the airplane leaves the tarmac. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), there have been 28,000 reported cases of unruly passenger incidences from when the organization started recording in 2007 to 2013. It's a number that, according to aviation experts, is both underrepresented and on the rise. Unruly passengers have become enough of a disturbance to airline professionals to warrant a two-day conference dedicated to the topic. Last week, London hosted DISPAX World 2014, the second international conference on how to handle disruptive travelers. Approximately 100 professionals -- made up mainly of airline training managers and regulators -- representing 35 different countries attended the event. ""We're not really sure of the number of incidents taking place, though it's safe to assume there are about 300 to 400 per week happening on board airliners,"" says Philip Baum, the managing director of Green Light Limited, the company that organized the event. In addition to the passenger bad behavior in the news (Justin Bieber and Ralph Lauren's niece are two of the more high profile fliers that made headlines with their on-board antics this year), Baum notes that there are many more low-key altercations that don't ever get reported. ""The definition of unruly behavior can range from disobeying crew commands, to becoming verbally abusive, then escalating to becoming physically abusive, then potentially life-threatening,"" says Baum. ""IATA reports there having been 8,217 unruly passenger incidents in 2013, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. IATA's figures are based solely on a limited number of IATA member airlines reporting. Most airlines are not IATA members and few are willing to share their incident reports."" Starting at the airport . Among many of the solutions batted around by presenters at DISPAX were several that took an early-prevention approach -- namely, ones that started at the airport. ""I see unruly behavior due to frustration and lack of information more than anything else,"" notes Prasad Yarlagadda, a professor of science and engineering at Australia's Queensland University of Technology. Yarlagadda gave a talk on his experience working with Australian regulators to devise an airport design to help alleviate the type of traveler angst that often leads to outbursts. ""An informed passenger will take 21 minutes to get from the curb to their flight. For an uninformed passenger, this could take 30 to 40 minutes,"" he notes. Even simple tweaks, like introducing more frequent and clearer signage, and ensuring staff are better trained to direct passengers through the right channels, he argues, could make all the difference. ""If a passenger has a good experience at the airport, that will continue when they board their flight."" Better screening of passengers could also potentially help carriers avoid headaches up in the air. Marcia Mendes, a research scientist at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, has been studying behavioral screening tactics used by airport security -- usually as a means of spotting criminal activity. At DISPAX, she discussed how the same procedures could be used to spot potential problem passengers. ""The main task of officers conducting behavioral security screening is to identify passengers with criminal or terroristic intentions. Nevertheless, being responsible for the observation of passengers, officers would possibly also spot those who pose a safety risk for other reasons. Airlines could surely profit if such information would be passed on to the crew prior to take off,"" she notes. What Would Monarch Do? (WWMD?) Perhaps the biggest factor for the rise in aggressive passengers, however, is alcohol, a problem exacerbated, says Baum, by low-cost carriers shuttling groups to prime party destinations. ""Low-cost carriers have introduced a new breed of passenger into the sky, and I don't think airports and airlines do enough to counter the binging culture associated with many of these passengers,"" he says, pointing to the fact that in many airports, bars can open as early as 6am. One company that has worked to reduce on-board binging is Monarch Airlines. By adopting a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to drunk passengers -- particularly on the UK-Ibiza leg, Monarch claims it has halved passenger flare-ups. One particularly useful tactic has been to train crew to identify when duty-free carry-ons have bottles in them, and to store them in the overhead. Monarch is also one of the few airlines to work with local police to deal with such passengers before they board. Such collaborations, says Baum, are all too rare. ""Aircrew are extremely concerned at the lack of legislation in many states to prosecute offenders. As a result, whilst many unruly passengers are handed over to the authorities, far too many walk free,"" he says.","IATA has reported 28,000 incidents of unruly passenger behavior since 2007 .
Experts agree the figure is unrepresentative, and growing .
Tweaks in airport design, security measures and airline policy could help address the problem ."
"(CNN) -- In April 2009, the White House released a presidential memorandum declaring that democracy and human rights in Cuba were ""national interests of the United States."" Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela repeated the message in May of this year to the Cuban-American National Foundation in Miami. The Obama administration, he said, wanted ""to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ... in ways that will empower the Cuban people and advance our national interests."" Fine words. But if the administration really wanted to do something in the national interest, it would end the 50-year-old policy of political and economic isolation of Cuba. The Cuban embargo can no longer even pretend to be plausible. On the contrary, it has contributed to the very conditions that stifle democracy and human rights there. For 50 years, its brunt has fallen mainly on the Cuban people. This is not by accident. On the contrary, the embargo was designed to impose suffering and hunger on Cubans in the hope that they would rise up and overturn their government. ""The only foreseeable means of alienating internal support,"" the Department of State insisted as early as April 1960, ""is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship."" The United States tightened the screws in the post-Soviet years with the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act -- measures designed, Sen. Robert Torricelli said, ""to wreak havoc on that island."" The post-Soviet years were indeed calamitous. Throughout the 1990s, Cubans faced growing scarcities, deteriorating services and increased rationing. Meeting the needs of ordinary life took extraordinary effort. And therein lies the problem that still bedevils U.S. policy today. Far from inspiring the Cuban people to revolution, the embargo keeps them down and distracted. Dire need and urgent want are hardly optimum circumstances for a people to contemplate the benefits of democracy. A people preoccupied with survival have little interest or inclination to bestir themselves in behalf of anything else. In Cuba, routine household errands and chores consume overwhelming amounts of time and energy, day after day: hours in lines at the local grocery store or waiting for public transportation. Cubans in vast numbers choose to emigrate.  Others burrow deeper into the black market, struggling to make do and carry on. Many commit suicide. (Cuba has one of the highest suicide rates in the world; in 2000, the latest year for which we have statistics, it was 16.4 per 100,000 people.) A June 2008 survey in The New York Times reported that less than 10 percent of Cubans identified the lack of political freedom as the island's main problem. As one Cuban colleague recently suggested to me: ""First necessities, later democracy."" The United States should consider a change of policy, one that would offer Cubans relief from the all-consuming ordeal of daily life. Improved material circumstances would allow Cubans to turn their attention to other aspirations. Ending the embargo would also imply respect for the Cuban people, an acknowledgment that they have the vision and vitality to enact needed reforms, and that transition in Cuba, whatever form it may take, is wholly a Cuban affair. A good-faith effort to engage Cuba, moreover, would counter the common perception there that the United States is a threat to its sovereignty. It would deny Cuban leaders the chance to use U.S. policy as pretext to limit public debate and stifle dissent -- all to the good of democracy and human rights. And it would serve the national interest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Louis Perez Jr.","Louis Perez: U.S. administration has said Cuban democracy is U.S.'s ""national interest""

"(CNN) -- Board a bus or a train today and chances are you'll see several people with eReaders in hand. While most probably bought their electronic books on a popular website, you may find a few who borrowed the paperless books from the library. EBooks accounted for 6.4% of all publishing in 2010, according to the American Association of Publishers, and 114 million electronic books were sold last year. While the majority of eBooks sold today are bought by individual readers, a growing number of the paperless books are winding up in public library catalogs. ""Our popular e-content collection at ebooks.nypl.org currently has over 75,000 copies across more than 35,000 titles,"" said Christopher Platt, director of Collections and Circulation Operations at The New York Public Libraries. He oversees the intake of more than a million new items every year. While that sounds like a lot of eBooks, it's a tiny fraction of the system's overall number of books available for lending. ""We have over 6 million items across our 90 locations in the physical circulation collections,"" Platt said. EBook lending is growing at a fast pace at the New York Public Library. The number of downloads of electronic books on the library's website grew by 81% in the last 12 months, Platt said. The more than 9,000 public library systems across the country are experiencing a similar growth in eBook demand. So why would someone pay for an eBook if they can download it free from a library's website? After all, the process is more or less identical to buying an electronic book on Amazon.com or Barnes and Noble's website. That has publishers approaching eBook lending with some trepidation. Several large publishing companies have yet to make eBooks available to public libraries. Those that have sold eBooks to libraries set limitations on how they can be loaned out. For example, one electronic copy of a book can be taken out by just one reader at a time. Some companies limit the number of copies of a book they'll sell to a library. A few have set a limit on how many times a book can be downloaded. Platt said publishers shouldn't be concerned that eBook lending will affect commercial sales of eBooks. ""Digitally, there's kind of a fear right now,"" Platt said. Several publishing companies were contacted for this story but none returned messages seeking comment. ""The impact is profound both on the publishers and the libraries,"" said author Warren Adler. He has written 30 books, including ""The War of the Roses"" and ""Random Hearts."" Both were made into popular movies. Adler said he believes as more publishers make eBooks available to libraries, the companies will limit the number of times most books can be loaned out. ""They have a product that has to get out there even to libraries. I don't think they'll remain reluctant."" Adler said. ""They're going to have to figure out ways to stay profitable and this is going to be a challenge."" Consider that public libraries make up 10% of all book sales in the United States each year. While publishers are concerned about the institutions competing in the eBook market with a free product, libraries are also an integral part of the publishing industry's bottom line. ""We do not want to see any publisher go out of business, because they create the content,"" Platt said. ""It's very much that we're on the same side of the fence here. We just have to be able to work together."" As with physical books, there can be a wait involved in downloading an electronic book from a library's website. Publishing companies call that wait ""friction"" and it's why they're comfortable with libraries lending physical books for free. But publishers think there's less friction involved in borrowing an eBook from a library's homepage. The concern is that this could affect commercial sales. Librarians think making eBooks available for lending has value for the publishing industry. Platt said it exposes readers to books in a way that legitimizes the material. That material can reach a much wider audience. Libraries across the country recently developed the ability to make their eBook downloads compatible with the Kindle, Amazon.com's eReader. Amazon.com representatives did not respond to a request for an interview. Amazon sells more eBooks in the United States than any other company. Some patrons noted that a library is more than just a place where people go to take out books. They often serve as civic meeting centers. They offer an opportunity for social interaction that you don't get with eBooks. ""I love the libraries,"" said Ronald Baines outside the New York Public Library Branch on 5th Avenue and East 40th Street in Manhattan. ""They're entertaining. Since I was a kid they were very entertaining and they're resourceful. As I became older they became more important to me in terms of identifying information and accessing information"" Baines has never read an eBook. ""The written word is a wonderful thing and that's something you should always have in your hand ... turning those pages, there's an experience that comes with that."" Carol Salzano walked out of the same library branch with a bag full of books. She worries that libraries will lose their place in society as borrowing eBooks grows in popularity. ""I think it will be sad. I mean there's just something about smelling the books and the whole experience,"" Salzano said. ""It's like a feeling of calm and peace and you don't really get that anymore. You can't just sit and read a book."" Platt isn't concerned about the potential for libraries to lose their role as a gathering place. He said they'll continue to offer enriching programming that draws people to the buildings . With the closing of Borders bookstores there are just about as many public library branches in the United States as there are commercial bookstores; more than 16,000. It may not be surprising, then, that while more people are borrowing eBooks from libraries, more people are also going to libraries. ""Our usage is going up as well,"" said Platt as he pointed out that New York libraries loaned more than 28 million items in 2010. ""That's a lot of people coming through our doors."" But the number of digital patrons is growing at a much faster pace. ""We have, I think, over 150,000 Twitter followers on our flagship Twitter account and over 40,000 Facebook friends,"" Platt said. He hopes that more publishing companies will see the benefit in making eBooks available to public libraries with mutually beneficial arrangements. One possibility would be the creation of subscription packages segmented into specific genres or themes such as best-sellers, classic novels and children's books, each with their own price. The challenge for publishing companies is figuring out how to capitalize on the millions of people across America who patronize libraries without having too much of the product being given away.","Paperless books are winding up in public library catalogs .

"Washington (CNN) -- Who needs the Kardashians -- or has time for them, anyway -- when ""Keeping up with the Clintons"" is so entertaining. Not to mention exhausting. Karl Rove raises the idea that Hillary Clinton suffered a traumatic brain injury, and the debate rages: . A. A low blow reckless gossip nugget? B. A legitimate point about her health and her transparency? C. Proof Republicans are so afraid of her they are getting hyper-tough now, hoping she chooses the calm of civilian life? D. All of the above? As you debate that, consider this sage observation from Bill Clinton, the former President who for decades now has reveled in dishing out political advice and analysis: ""You can't get too upset about it. It's just the beginning. They will get better at it."" Speaking in his signature raspy drawl, laughing the entire time, he also worked in a priceless nugget that reminds us the Clintons know hardball, and are hard to surprise no matter how loud, low, or legitimate the attack: ""I'm still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to Whitewater. It's just part of the deal."" Bill Clinton: Nixon was a communist compared to modern GOP . Too young to get the Whitewater reference? Try your favorite Internet search engine. Or call an Arkansas real estate agent and suggest you are looking for a nostalgic vacation retreat. Democratic strategist Paul Begala, a veteran of both Bill Clinton campaigns who remains a family confidant, offered this take on the Clintons-dominated political week: . ""The Clintons learned a long time ago that no matter what they do, the kook right will attack them and the media will cover them."" ""Rove was being stupid, not smart. His comments anger principled conservatives and engender support for Hillary, both among the Rove-hating Democratic base and the smear-hating center. Plus, if I know Hillary, Karl's cheap shot makes her more likely to run, not less -- which is something Karl does not want."" Details aside, it was a week to remember that -- love them or not -- the Clintons are a formidable political team. And a week, or maybe two weeks, of building the list of questions, both policy and personal, awaiting a Clinton 2016 campaign. Pelosi: Attacks make Hillary stronger . From Benghazi to Boko Haram, there were fresh assertions from Republicans that Citizen Clinton often exaggerates her successes or ignores her shortcomings as secretary of state. America Rising, a GOP group that critiques Secretary Clinton on a near-daily, sometimes hourly basis, was quick on Thursday to distribute a report from Josh Rogin of the Daily Beast that led with this: . ""Hillary Clinton is now claiming to be the architect of crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy. But during her tenure as secretary of state, her department repeatedly opposed or tried to water down an array of sanctions measures that were pushed into law by Democrats and Republicans in Congress."" A pattern of avoiding the reality of her record, America Rising suggested, noting recent Clinton statements about Russia and the Nigerian kidnapping it said could not be squared with her actions at Foggy Bottom. Rove attacks show GOP's concerns about Clinton . Bill Clinton stepped up this past week as his wife's chief defender, specifically addressing Benghazi but suggesting she did all she could, and then adding that Republicans never talk about the deaths at overseas diplomatic outposts during the George W. Bush administration. Rove's ""TBI"" suggestion was first reported by The New York Post, with a dramatic headline suggesting the GOP strategist had suggested she had brain damage. ""I never used that phrase,"" Rove said on Fox News. Still over the line if, as reported, he suggested she had some lasting traumatic brain injury. Cleaning up his language later is a time-tested method of attack politics: say something provocative to plant a seed -- and start the conversation -- and then stage a rhetorical retreat filled with softer language. But Rove's broader point is legitimate: If she runs for president, Secretary Clinton will face enormous pressure to release more details about her December 2012 fall and concussion. Bill Clinton guaranteed that this week even as he shrugged off the Rove attack. ""First they say she faked her concussion and now they say she is auditioning for a part on 'The Walking Dead,'"" the former President said. But he went on to say this, proving this was no minor fall: ""She had sustained what was a terrible concussion. Required six months of very serious work to get over."" The former President said his wife, ""never low-balled"" the severity of her injury with the American people. Gingrich slams ""Republican consultant class"" Perhaps not, but she never discussed it in great detail, either. In a January 2013 interview with CBS, she said: ""I still have some lingering effects from falling on my head and having the blood clot. But, you know, the doctors tell me that that will all recede. And so thankfully I'm, you know, looking forward to being at full speed. ... I have some lingering effects from the concussion that are decreasing and will disappear. But I have a lot of sympathy now when I pick up the paper and read about an athlete or one of our soldiers who's had traumatic brain injury. I'd never had anything like that in my family. And so, you know, I'm very conscious of how lucky I was."" If she is a candidate for president, she will be asked for her medical records, and to make her doctors available. Those questions are not ageist or sexist, but routine. As the Rove-Clinton drama played out, and most everyone in Washington took Bill Clinton's vocal and aggressive defense of his wife as more proof she will run, Matt Bai of Yahoo News weighed in with a thoughtful look at the constant Clinton speculation. He took issue with reporters and pundits who see all the stories and maneuverings as carefully orchestrated from within Camp Clinton. ""What we're really looking at is a campaign orchestrated by nervous Democrats and aimed at persuading Clinton herself,"" Bai writes. ""The truth is that, leaving aside all this bravado about happy demographics and the disunion of Republicans, Democrats are scared out of their minds right now. The House is solidly out of reach. The Senate is slipping away. And the White House could be close behind, especially if Clinton doesn't run, and if Republicans can rally around a credible candidate."" All true. All very true. A leading reason so many Democrats jumped to endorse Hillary Clinton so early is that they believe only someone as formidable as her can keep the White House in Democratic hands after two Obama terms, . It's part of what makes the Hillary chatter so fascinating. And entertaining. And remember, to borrow that line again from Bill Clinton: ""It's just the beginning.""","Republican strategist Karl Rove asked if Hillary Clinton had suffered brain injury .
Bill Clinton laughed off Rove's attack, saying, ""They'll get better at it""

"(CNN) -- Bahrain defended its decision Wednesday to impose a ban on all public protests, following calls from rights group Amnesty International to lift it immediately as a breach of people's right to free speech. Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority said in a statement that the ban was needed because ""increasing violence has resulted in death and serious injury to many."" Most recently, two police officers died as a result of attacks with petrol bombs and a homemade bomb, the IAA said. Since the start of the year, there have on average been two or more licensed protests a week, the authority said, many of which expressed views critical of the government. ""However, all too often these demonstrations devolved into violence and lawlessness as demonstrators dispersed and youths armed with petrol bombs and other weapons took their place, launching assaults on public security officers and civilians,"" the statement said. From May to July, there were 91 injuries requiring treatment to members of the police force, averaging about one a day, it added. ""The reality is that one would be hard pressed to find a protest that both begins and ends peacefully,"" IAA spokesman Fahad Albinali said. ""The fact of the matter is that there has been an escalation of violence by some elements of the opposition and those who regularly engage in riotous activity."" Opinion: Don't forget about Bahrain . Violent clashes have broken out between security forces and opposition protesters on numerous occasions since protests began in the Persian Gulf kingdom in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But Amnesty International warned that a ban on all public gatherings was unwarranted and amounted to a drastic crackdown on people's freedoms.

""Even in the event of sporadic or isolated violence once an assembly is under way, the authorities cannot simply declare a blanket prohibition on all protests,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director for Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa program . ""Such a sweeping measure amounts to nothing less than nullifying the rights to freedom of association, expression and assembly. Law enforcement officials must act to protect peaceful protesters rather than using the violent acts of a few as a pretext to restrict or impede the rights of all."" The Interior Ministry's announcement of the ban Tuesday pointed the finger at opposition political groups, headed by Al Wefaq, as being behind ongoing protests. The ministry said the protests were a continuation of those held in February and March of last year that it said called for the overthrow of leading figures and the state.

The government had sought to protect freedom of expression, but ""that privilege has been abused repeatedly by organizers' violations"" and people's lack of respect for the law, Interior Minister Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa is quoted as saying Tuesday by the state-run Bahrain News Agency. The rallies have been associated with ""violence, rioting and attacks on public and private property,"" and are a threat to public safety and commerce, according to the news agency. The Interior Ministry is now looking for sites around the country to be used for staging protests ""to preserve the right of political expression while minimizing the risk of injury or disruption to society at large,"" the Information Affairs Authority said. The demonstrations staged in Bahrain early last year failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state. The crackdown was backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests. The independent commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture in their response to the protests in the Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority country. It recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces, as well as other measures. Bahrain plays a key strategic role in the Middle East and is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet headquarters. Read more: Bahrain arrests 6 anti-government protesters .

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian authorities have dismantled an armed underground group they claim was plotting against the Kiev-based government and planned to launch an attack in a few days, that nation's top security agency announced Saturday. Fifteen people were detained following a large-scale operation in the eastern city of Luhansk, the Security Service said in a statement. The raid also netted about 300 guns, a grenade launcher as well as numerous grenades, Molotov cocktails and a significant amount of knives, according to the agency. The Security Service alleges the group was plotting to carry out an attack April 10 in Luhansk. Those detained face charges that include betraying the government and weapons violations. Luhansk is on the border with Russia in eastern Ukraine, a region that some say could follow the lead of Crimea and soon fall under Moscow's control. The city has a substantial Russian minority. A classified U.S. intelligence assessment last month identified Luhansk, along with Kharkiv and Dontesk, as possible targets for Russian forces seeking to establish a land bridge to Crimea. NATO says tens of thousands of Russian troops have massed near Ukraine's border, amid fears they may seek to invade. Russia says its forces are just on military exercises. Those fears come on the heels of the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Moscow president was ousted and the emergence of a new Western-leaning government in Kiev. That was followed by Crimea leaving Ukraine and being folded into Russia following a quickly organized referendum -- a move that derided by authorities in Kiev and officials in the West. Moscow's recent moves have caused the worst crisis in East-West relations since the end of the Cold War. The United States and European Union have responded with asset freezes and travel bans against individuals and warned of further economic and diplomatic sanctions if Russia does not curb its activities. Speaking to reporters Saturday ahead of his arrival in Japan, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that the ""world will respond"" to Russia's annexation of Ukraine. ""I think any time you have a nation, Russia in this case, try to impose its will to define international boundaries and violate territorial integrity and sovereignty of a nation by force, all of the world takes note of that,"" he said. ""All of the world should take note of that, and the world will respond to that.""

"(CNN) -- As Moscow escalates its invasion of eastern Ukraine and NATO convenes this week in Wales, the United States, NATO, and free nations around the world confront a pivotal moment of truth. If the international community, led by the United States, fails to respond in a strong and unified manner to Moscow's blatant aggression in Ukraine, the ramifications will be both serious and far-reaching. By now, it should be clear to all objective observers that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not impressed by starkly worded statements and declarations, and if that is the only outcome in Wales, it could represent a historic failure of the alliance at a time when NATO's foundational purpose has renewed relevance. As NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed last week, Russian forces have ""engaged in direct military operations inside Ukraine,"" including firing on Ukrainian forces from inside Ukraine itself. According to NATO, in addition to the Russian-backed separatists, there are now more than a thousand Russian military forces in Ukraine. This latest escalation follows Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine, as well as months of instigating and perpetuating the crisis in eastern Ukraine. Even after the Russian-backed separatists apparently launched a missile that murdered 298 people on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Putin has continued to provide separatists with tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons. In short, Putin has brushed aside U.S. and European warnings, as well as initial sanctions, and has invaded eastern Ukraine. The pre-eminent question now is what will the United States and NATOâ€”and nations around the world that value democracy, freedom and the rule of lawâ€”do about it? In May 2012, NATO governments declared that, ""An independent, sovereign and stable Ukraine, firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law, is key to Euro-Atlantic security."" Opinion: ""The NATO Show"" -- Putin's favorite comedy? In his June 4 speech in Poland, President Obama said, ""Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia."" As NATO declared at the 2010 Lisbon Conference, ""Crises and conflicts beyond NATO's borders can pose a direct threat to the security of Alliance territory and populations."" Russia's aggression in Ukraine certainly presents a threat to NATO. The NATO Summit in Wales presents a critical opportunity to build the consensus necessary to back up these declarations with tangible and urgent action. This action should include the toughest possible U.S. and European sanctions against Russia, the provision of much-needed and long-requested weapons to Ukraine, the strengthening of NATO's military posture in eastern Europe, the sharing of real-time intelligence with Kyiv, as well as robust economic assistance. The United States and NATO do not need to send combat forces to Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have demonstrated a willingness to fight, and all they have asked for is our support. As Europeans learned at a tremendous cost during World War II, weakness and delay in the face of invasion and aggression only invite more aggression. Thus far, the West's tepid response to Moscow's actions in Ukraine has only confirmed Putin's view that the United States and Europe lack the resolve to stand up to him -- and even worse, he views it as a green light for expanded aggression. Continued weakness in the face of Putin's invasion risks leaving him with the dangerous impression that he can send his ""little green men"" to NATO member nations on Russia's periphery. Such a step by Moscow would trigger NATO's Article Five commitments and would require a NATO military response, as Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, has reiterated. The United States and our NATO allies wish we had a well-intentioned partner in Moscow who follows international law and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Despite NATO's best efforts to establish friendly and constructive relations with Russia since at least 1994, we clearly do not have a partner in Moscow. Putin is a bully who wants to prevent the Ukrainian people and their legitimately elected government from choosing their own future based on his nostalgia for his days in the KGB, his desire to restore Russian dominance over its neighbors, and his fear that a democratic, independent and prosperous Ukraine might entice Russians to demand more accountability, democracy and prosperity at home. The United States and our democratic allies in Europe and around the world are not and must not be neutral when a free people and their democratically elected government confront an unprovoked invasion of their sovereign territory. Opinion: Ukraine's strong argument for military aid . Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Kim Jong Un in North Korea, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Putin in Russia are watching. Do the United States and NATO possess the political will to back up their statements? The answer to that question will have national security consequences for years to come in Europe and around the world.","Sen.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- In the '90s a certain joke became very popular in the streets and homes of Cuba. It began with Pepito -- the mischievous boy of our national humor -- and told how his teacher, brandishing a photo of the U.S. president, launches into a harsh diatribe against him. ""The man you see here is the cause of all our problems, he has plunged this island into shortages and destroyed our productivity, he is responsible for the lack of food and the collapse of public transport,"" the teacher says. After these fierce accusations the teacher points to the face in the photo and asks her most wayward student, ""Do you know who this is?"" Smiling, Pepito replies, ""Oh yes, ... I know him, it's just that without his beard I didn't recognize him."" Photos: Cuba -- a sense of home in a timeless place . The joke reflects, to a large measure, the polarization of national opinion with regard to our economic difficulties and the restrictions on citizens' rights that characterize the current Cuban system. While the official discourse points to the United States as the source of our greatest problems, many others see the Plaza of the Revolution itself as the root of all the failures of the last 53 years. True or not, the reality is that each one of the 11 administrations that have passed through the White House since 1959 has influenced the course of this island, sometimes directly, other times as a pillar of support for the ideological propaganda of Fidel Castro's government (and now that of his younger brother Raúl). Hence the growing expectations that circulate through the largest of the Antilles every time elections come around to decide who will sit in the Oval Office. Cuban politics depends so greatly on what happens in the ballot boxes on the other side of the Florida Straits -- and some share the view that we have never been so dependent on our neighbor to the north. Postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election . Cuban diplomacy seems more comfortable contradicting America than seeking to solve the problems between the nations, which is why many analysts agree it would be easier for Raúl Castro to cope with an aggressive policy from Uncle Sam than with the more pragmatic approach of Barack Obama. Obama's easing of the rules on family remittances, reestablishing academic travel, and increasing cultural exchanges add up to an unwieldy formula difficult for the Castro regime's rhetoric to manage. But the regime has also tried to wring economic and political advantages from these gestures from Washington. The real question in this dispute is which approach would more greatly affect democratization in Cuba -- to display a fist? Or to offer a hand? To recognize the legitimacy of the government on the island? Or to continue to treat it as a kidnapper holding power over 11 million hostages? Postcard: Can Tokyo learn from election ""matsuri?"" When the Democratic party, led by Barack Obama, came to the White House in January 2009, our official press was faced with a dilemma. On the one hand the newly elected president's youth and his African descent made him immediately popular with Cubans, and it was not uncommon to find people walking the streets wearing a shirt or hat displaying the face of the former senator from Illinois. It was the first time in decades that some compatriots dared to publicly wear a picture of the ""enemy"" (the U.S. president) himself. For a population that saw the top leaders of our own government approaching or passing 80, the image of a cheerful, limber, smiling Obama was more consistent with the myth of the Revolutionary than were the old men in olive green standing behind the national microphones. Obama's magnetism also captivated many here as well, and disappointed, of course, those who hoped for a heavier hand toward the gerontocracy in Havana. Farewell socialism ... hello to pragmatism . Beyond the political issues, the measures undertaken by the Obama administration were felt quickly in many Cuban families, particularly in their economy and relations with their exiled relatives in America. With the increased cash from remittances, the small businesses that emerged from Raul Castro's reforms were able to use the money coming from the north for start-up capital and to position themselves. Meanwhile, thousands of Cuban-Americans arrived at José Martí airport every week loaded with packages, medicine and clothes to support their relatives on the island. Those who see the Cuban situation as a pressure cooker that needs just a little more heat to explode feel defrauded by these ""concessions"" to Havana from the Democratic government. They are the same people who suggest that a hard line -- belligerence on the diplomatic scene and economic suffocation -- would deliver better results. Sadly, however, the guinea pigs required to test the efficacy of such an experiment would be Cubans on the island, physically and socially wasting away until some point at which our civic consciousness would supposedly ""wake up."" As if there are not enough historical examples to show that totalitarian regimes become stronger as their economic crises deepen and international opinion turns against them. No wonder Mitt Romney is a much talked about figure in the official Cuban press. His strong confrontational positions feed the anti-imperialism discourse like fuel to a fire. The Republican candidate has been the focus of numerous articles in the official organ of the Communist Party, the newspaper Granma. His photos and caricatures appear in this same daily that was stymied when trying to physically mock Obama. Given the high rate of mixed marriages among Cubans, it's quite sensitive to enlarge the ears and fatten the lips of the U.S. president without it reading as racist ridicule. Postcard: Parisians marvel at Obama's ""coolitude"" If, in the eighties, the media's political humor was honed in the wrinkled face of Ronald Reagan, and later the media had a field day with the physique of George W. Bush, for four years it has been cautious with the current resident of the White House. All this graphic moderation will go by the wayside if Mitt Romney is elected as the next president of the United States. There are those who are already laughing over the possible jokes to come. But whoever scores the electoral victory will find Cuba in a state of change. The reforms carried out by Raúl Castro lack the speed and depth most people desire, but are heading in the irreversible direction of economic opening. Havana is full of private cafés and restaurants, we can now buy and sell homes, and Cubans are even managing to sell the cars given to them during the era of Soviet subsidies in exchange for political loyalty. The timid changes driven by the General President are threatening to damage the fundamental pillars of Fidel Castro's command. Volunteerism at any cost, coarse egalitarianism, active adventures abroad, and a country kept in a state of constant tension by the latest economic or political campaign appear to be gradually fading into things of the past. On the other hand, citizens themselves have begun to experience the most definitive of transformations, that which occurs within. Public criticism is on the rise, although it has not yet found ways to be heard in all its diversity, but every day the fear of police reprisals diminishes. More: Cuba disputes reports of jailed American's health . The official media have unquestionably lost a monopoly on the flow of information and thanks to illegal satellite dishes Florida television now comes to Cuba. Alternative news networks circulate documentaries, films, and articles from independent journalists and bloggers. It's as if the enormous ocean liner of Revolutionary censorship was taking on water through every porthole. Young people are finally pushing to have Internet access, while the retired complain about their miserable pensions and almost everyone disagrees with the travel restrictions that prevent our leaving and returning to our own country. In short, the illusion of unanimity has fallen to pieces in Raúl Castro's hands. More: Raul Castro's daughter endorses Obama . To this internal scenario, the result of the American elections could be a catalyst or obstacle for changes, but it is no longer the most important factor to consider. Although the billboards lining the streets continue to paint the United States as Goliath wanting to crush little David who represents our island, for an increasing number of people the metaphor doesn't play out that way. They know that in our case the abusive giant is a government that tries to control the smallest aspects of our national life, while his opponent is a people who, bit by bit, is becoming more conscious of its real stature.","While Castro regime blames U.S. for Cuba's ills, many Cubans blame regime .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's favorite television shows include ""House of Cards"" and ""Mad Men."" One can imagine that when his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin wants to kick back and relax, all he will need to do is turn on the nightly news and watch the latest reports from the NATO Summit in Wales. Putin can listen as NATO leaders roll out the latest iteration of their bold responses to his annexation of Crimea and his invasion of Ukraine. Imagine how he'll be tickled as NATO leaders fall all over themselves trying to find ways to refer to his sending Russian troops into a neighboring country without actually calling it an invasion. Imagine him, no doubt lying shirtless on a polar bear skin that he single-handedly separated from its original owner, laughing as NATO unveils the stockpile of strong adjectives that have been its principle weapons in containing the Kremlin's aggression. Then, as NATO's Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen rolls out what they call in the political biz ""the big deliverable"" of the summit -- a Readiness Action Plan that will make 4,000 troops available within two days of a Russian incursion into a member state -- one can only hope that Kremlin doctors are standing by, because Putin could injure himself laughing. First of all, NATO members are already supposed to be guaranteed protection by virtue of their very membership. One would imagine that each had in mind something considerably more robust and more rapid than this middling unit the alliance has dreamed up. This is little more than a tepid response gesture, a sign not of strength, but one that shows how the world's most powerful alliance is now utterly adrift. There will be many speeches suggesting that NATO is re-energized by Putin's threat. There will be lots of self-congratulations on the effectiveness of economic sanctions levied against the Russians. There will be talk of new mega-sanctions that will really keep them in line. But Putin will sit there watching, perhaps munching on pieces of deep fried Siberian tiger that he killed with his bare hands, as he contemplates that everything he wanted he got, and that all he wants he can get -- at a low, low price. No one even discusses whether Putin can keep Crimea, which he claimed without a shot being fired. Whether he ultimately annexes Eastern Ukraine or simply drives home the message that it has deep ties to Russia and that Moscow will expect to be consulted regarding its fate, he knows he is in the negotiating position of strength. He knows for two reasons. First, he sees that neither the United States nor its European allies have much appetite to stand up to him. Time after time as he tested them -- in Georgia, in Ukraine, in Syria -- they grumbled and then blinked. They are too self-absorbed and caught up in domestic problems. And frankly, they don't care that much about Georgia or Ukraine or Syria. Also, he has discovered that NATO and the West are designed to confront extreme threats, not the moderate, incremental, creeping gains he has achieved. NATO effectively has two settings when it comes to aggression in Europe's east: off and global thermonuclear war. He has worked the middle ground and the lack of resolve of his opponents with considerable skill. He also knows the truth. He is merely toying at the periphery of NATO and frankly, rhetoric aside, he is no threat to regions deeper into Europe. Putin is a distraction with which NATO is ill-prepared to deal. It faces much greater threats: The spread of Islamic extremism is destabilizing the world from Africa to Asia. Although NATO is equally ill at ease in confronting that deepening crisis, with extremist foreign fighters passing through or hailing from NATO member states, it faces an even bigger crisis from within: a leadership void. The European Union lacks the will, the culture and the institutional mechanisms to make real unified foreign policy. The United States is in a moment of seeming confusion about its role in the world. The revitalization of the alliance everyone is calling for is a good idea, urgently needed, but there are few signs it is really on the horizon. As a consequence, Putin can watch the NATO show and enjoy it for what it is: a diversion. The rhetoric might get heated. Some might suggest that he, for all his cool calculation and his so far effective gambits, is the mad man in this scenario. But watching the current version of this superannuated, divided, leaderless alliance, he knows that when it comes to standing up to him in Ukraine, NATO is the house of cards.","David Rothkopf: Vladimir Putin will be entertained watching the NATO Summit .

"Washington (CNN) -- To help mark the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, the United States' largest online digitized presidential archives were unveiled Thursday. At the beginning of the event at the National Archives in Washington, reporters were shown a portion of one of Kennedy's press conferences from the early 1960s in which he addressed the question of where and how his historical documents would be kept. ""We will find it possible to reproduce the key documents, that they will be commonly available, I would hope, in Washington,"" Kennedy responded. Many original records, however, ended up being kept at the Kennedy Library in Boston, making them not accessible to historians who were unable to travel. Now, with advances in critical hardware and software, the most important papers, records, photographs and recordings from Kennedy's time in office will be available online. ""As of today, anyone in the world with access to the internet can now view, download and analyze the original records of the Kennedy administration at the click of a mouse."" said David S. Ferriero, archivist of the United States. Caroline Kennedy, who attended Thursday's unveiling, believes that the digitization of her father's records will be useful to today's youth, in particular. ""In our increasingly fragmented society, young people are often disconnected and disillusioned with politics. President Kennedy's example -- his words, his spirit -- are more relevant than ever,"" she said, ""Using today's technology, we will be able to give today's generation access to the historical record and challenge them to answer my father's call to service, to solve the problems of our own time."" Four corporations -- AT&T, EMC, Iron Mountain and Raytheon -- worked together to create the hardware and software needed to make the digitization possible. ""This new Kennedy Library digital archives includes more than 200,000 digitized documents, the drafts of every speech delivered by the president, thousands of official white House photographs, and audio of all of President Kennedy's speeches and video of press conferences during his years in office,"" Ferriero said. The JFK archives can be viewed at jfklibrary.org.","Kennedy had hoped that the ""key documents"" from his administration would be available .

"(CNN) -- A lone saxophonist plays in the shadow of an overpass while a horde of cyclists looks down at a set of tangled train tracks. This outwardly gloomy spot is as good a place as any to begin a cycling tour of the ""Berlin Wall Trail,"" a 160-kilometer (99-mile) path developed to commemorate and transform one of the darkest chapters of the city's past. Once a popular location for defectors because East German trains cut through a corner of the Western zone, it was here on November 9, 1989, that tens of thousands of people overwhelmed an official checkpoint after a bureaucratic error led to the opening of the border. Divided by mapmakers into 14 sections that vary from seven to 21 miles in length, the Wall Trail, or ""Mauerweg,"" traces the entire path of the Wall. Built in 1961, the Wall divided the city by surrounding West Berlin, for decades following the partitioning of Germany after World War II an island of freedom behind the Iron Curtain. 'Culture, politics and nature' The Wall Trail is a unique combination of tourist attraction and recreational zone, says Michael Cramer, the Green Party politician and cycling enthusiast who conceived the plan in the early 1990s and is now working on a Europe-spanning Iron Curtain Trail, inspired by the Wall route's success. ""It's a ride through history, culture, politics and nature,"" he says. That feeling hits home as I pedal across the Mauerpark to the Wall memorial on Bernauer Strasse, where a watchtower and a section of the barren ""death strip"" have been preserved unchanged. While Cramer's scheme might seem an obvious venture now, it wasn't easy in the beginning. Berliners hated the Wall so much that many people wanted every trace of it obliterated. In 1989 and 1990, souvenir hunters were carting it away so fast that the government had to shift from demolition to conservation practically overnight. With experts forecasting an unprecedented population boom, real estate developers were eying the former ""death strip"" as keenly as East Germany's notorious Stasi security agents ever had. ""At that time, all the politicians and the media said, 'No, no, we want to erase the Wall,'"" Cramer says. ""But 10 years later, in 2000, we were successful."" Completed in 2009 at a cost of some 10 million euros ($13.4 million), today the trail appeals to all types of cyclists. Bike-friendly public transport . Every section is accessible by Berlin's bike-friendly public transportation system, so cyclists can pick and choose from various sights and terrain. It's flat and paved, so it doesn't take an athlete's fitness to hack it, and an ordinary city bike or single-gear, hipster's ""fixie"" serves as well as something fancier. Better still, even though it attracts thousands of visitors every year, it never gets crowded, says Martin ""Wollo"" Wollenberg, who heads a tour company called Berlin-on-Bike. ""As you experience the Wall zig-zagging through the city, you get a feeling for the separation,"" Wollenberg says. ""In a lot of places, the difference between East and West is still quite vivid."" For tourists new to Berlin, about 25 miles of the trail runs through the heart of the city. Passing not only the Bernauer Strasse documentation center but also the Reichstag, Brandenburger Gate, Checkpoint Charlie and many other important historical sites, it makes an excellent route for a leisurely four-hour guided tour. Meanwhile, for more committed cyclists, in former western districts such as Kladow and Wannsee, the path doubles as a nature trail, cutting through forests. Regular rows of plantation pines make the former death strip easy to identify. At 29 different sites along the path, memorial placards tell the stories of some of the nearly 250 ""victims of the Wall,"" such as Peter Bohme, a 19-year-old cadet in East Germany's National People's Army who was shot trying to escape to West Berlin in 1962. Signposts at regular intervals make it well nigh impossible to get lost, and every section has something to spark the traveler's interest -- the bridge where captured spies were exchanged, a former watchtower now used by the forest brigade or the famous Church of Our Savior whose walls once formed part of the fortifications. Riders are never more than a mile or two from the nearest beer garden. How to ride the wall . For do-it-yourselfers, bicycle rental runs about €10 per day, with outlets ubiquitous throughout the city. Visit Berlin offers free pamphlets with complete maps of the 14 sections of the trail and brief descriptions -- though only the German version was available when I visited. The same material is available online. Cramer's ""Berlin Wall Trail: Cycling Guide"" can be picked up for about $10 online or at the souvenir shop at the Berlin Wall Documentation Centre on Bernauer Strasse. Berlin on Bike's ""Wall Tour"" covers 15 kilometers of the Wall Trail in about four hours. The company's English- and German-speaking guides provide information about the building and destruction of the Wall and life in East Germany. At €14 plus €5 for bicycle rental, it's worth considering even for those planning to do the rest of trail solo.

"(CNN) -- A month ago, Martin Kaymer paid an emotional tribute to his deceased Mum after winning the Players' Championship on Mother's Day. On Sunday, the German was victorious again, this time at the U.S. Open and this time on Father's Day, a fitting tribute to his Dad Horst, a retired corporate executive. ""It was nice to win on Mother's Day and our Father's Day [in Germany] was a couple of weeks ago and I didn't get him anything,"" said Kaymer after a gargantuan eight-shot victory at Pinehurst on Sunday. ""Maybe this works today."" The 29-year-old was in a class of his own during the four rounds, carding the lowest score over two rounds in the tournament's history and, from that point, was never really challenged by runners-up Erik Compton and Rickie Fowler. Kaymer plays with a single sunflower on his bag, the favourite flower of his mother Rina, who died of complications from skin cancer in 2008. Following his Players' Championship victory, Kaymer said holding back the tears: ""My mother was always there to be affectionate and show us love. When my Mom passed away, that stopped. Mother's Day is always a nice day."" After his Pinehurst win, the German admitted he still thinks of his mother every day but it was a victory dedicated to his father, who once flew over from Germany to his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, for a mere 24 hours just to celebrate his son overtaking Lee Westwood as world No.1 in the spring of 2011. ""He says 'next time in Germany, who knows if you'll still No.1 so I just wanted to take the opportunity to say congratulations',"" recalled Kaymer of his father's gesture. ""And the next day he flew out to Germany. Not a lot of parents do that, and it was nice. It was a 30-hour trip for pretty much 24 hours there."" A U.S. PGA winner in 2010, Kaymer tried to remodel his game to make it perfect, often leaving the driving range with bleeding hands, with his world ranking plummeting as the changes took time to work. Bar the Ryder Cup-winning putt in 2012, there were few highlights to speak of, with Kaymer not winning an individual event for two-and-a-half years by the time he was victorious at the Players before becoming the first player from Europe to win the US Open. ""The way I play golf right now, I shouldn't think too much about technique,"" added Kaymer, reflecting on his restructured game. ""I'm very happy with the way I hit the ball."" While Kaymer's recent victories produced a nice family tale, Compton's position as runner-up was even more remarkable given he had twice undergone heart transplants , once in 1992 and again in 2008. ""When you have disabilities or you have health issues, some days are really bad and then you've got to try to make the best of it the next day and wake up and move your body,"" said Compton, who pocketed $790,000 after his share of second place. ""And I'm the perfect example of that. I've been on my back twice and I never thought I would ever leave the house. ""Now I just finished second at the U.S. Open which I don't think anybody would have ever thought I'd do that. You just can't give up."" Compton was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy at the age of nine but suffered a heart attack in 2007 with the new heart he was given aged 12 by a 15-year-old donor who had been killed by a drunk driver. Compton drove himself to the hospital in Miami, calling his mother Eli to tell her he didn't think he would survive. Seven months later, he underwent another transplant, this time from a 26-year-old killed on his motorbike by a hit-and-run driver. As a result, the pressure of the business end of a major tournament is relative child's play for Compton. ""I have been through a lot in my life,"" he said, ""and a lot more adrenaline pressure situations than hitting a tee shot on 18.""","U.S. Open winner pays tribute to dad, Horst, after Father's Day victory at Pinehurst .

While during the week, many choose to ignore these men, and the deftness they exhibit when navigating the roads, on Sundays, Ghanians turn up in the hundreds to watch them play a sport that could one day be a hit on the Paralympic circuit: skate soccer. ""When Saturday comes, I go to sleep early, because I know tomorrow morning I'm going to play ball,"" says Yaro. Yaro is a member of the Rolling Rockets, a team of about 40 polio survivors. As many have limited use of their legs, the men play their version of soccer on skateboards, and hit the ball with their hands. 'Bigger than me' For Albert Frimpong, the team's coach and sole financier, skate soccer is more than just a game -- it's a potential means to get these men off the streets. ""Initially, the idea was to get them to stop begging, to improve their lives. I was hoping to use the soccer as a way to set up business- and income-generating projects for them,"" says Frimpong. As an able-bodied man, Frimpong says that the first challenge was getting the men to trust him. ""Every time they saw me approaching, they would vanish,"" he recalls. ""People have exploited them for so long, they thought that I was going to do the same."" Since starting the team nine years ago, Frimpong says he has nearly bankrupted himself, paying not just for equipment and transportation, but for the men's food and medicine. ""It got to the point that I ended up owing so many people money, some took me to the police station,"" he says. ""I took upon myself something bigger than me. But the game has progressed and there's joy in the lives of these people."" Frimpong's ultimate dream is to purchase some land and set up a community where the men could train, farm and earn an honest living. ""Yes, it's farfetched,"" he admits. ""But it's a dream."" Into the limelight . Lately, the sport has attracted international attention. Last month, Chevrolet released Rolling On, a short documentary about the team that makes up part of a digital and social media campaign around the World Cup and the car company's Man United sponsorship. Chevrolet enlisted award-winning director Baff Akoto to create the spot. ""(The Rolling Rockets) play really hard. It's not pedestrian,"" says Akoto. ""The dynamics of the game might be different, but there's as much athleticism, grace, skill, commitment and kamikaze enthusiasm as in any able-bodied game."" In 2012, the story of the Rolling Rockets inspired a Kickstarter campaign for a subsequent documentary: Rollaball. The film's director, Eddie Edwards, says that his interest in the players is lost on some Ghanians. ""When I was filming, I would often get approached by the police, who would say, 'why are you interested in these guys? They're just thieves. Why do you give them so much attention?"" Through filming and getting to know the men, Edwards says he has learned to appreciate just how misunderstood the men are. ""A lot of these guys come from poor backgrounds, and either their families couldn't afford to put them through school, or else they were completely neglected and forced to live on the streets. But they have a great sense of humor, a great sense of camaraderie and a great sense of brotherhood,"" he says. The price of fame . Edwards, who has spent years filming the men, says that their increased notoriety has been a bit of a ""double-edged sword."" For some of the men, he admits, the fame has gone to their heads. ""As the team's gotten more popular, one of the guys, No Fear, has started to behave like Wayne Rooney. He's started to really bling it up and changed his hairstyle,"" says Edwards. Their fame, however, has done little to boost their income. ""Publicity is good, but it hasn't given us any reward in terms of finance,"" says Frimpong. ""Anyone who comes to film them gives us enough for transportation and to pay for their water, but by the time the game is over, the money is finished."" Unfortunately, not everyone realizes that fame doesn't necessarily equal cash. ""People in traffic sometimes recognize them from TV and think they're making money from their appearances and that they don't deserve to be helped,"" says Edwards.","The Rolling Rockets are a Ghanian team of 'football' players with polio .
They play a version of the game called skate soccer, because they play on skateboards .
The team's coach hopes the game will provide the players with economic opportunities ."
"Tokyo (CNN) -- Authorities in Japan raised the prospect Friday of a likely breach in the all-important containment vessel of the No. 3 reactor at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a potentially ominous development in the race to prevent a large-scale release of radiation. Contaminated water likely seeped through the containment vessel protecting the reactor's core, said Hidehiko Nishiyama of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Three employees working near the No. 3 reactor Thursday stepped into water that had 10,000 times the amount of radiation typical for a nuclear plant, Nishiyama said. An analysis of the contamination suggests ""some sort of leakage"" from the reactor core, signaling a possible break of the containment vessel that houses the core, he said. The workers have been hospitalized and work inside the reactor building has been halted, according to the agency. Work inside two other reactor buildings also had to stop and workers had to be pulled back Friday after the discovery of high levels of radiation in water at those locations, a Tokyo Electric Power Company official said Saturday. Water is still being pumped into the containment vessels, the utility official said. Nuclear power experts cautioned against reading too much into the newest development, saying the workers exposed to radioactive water might not suffer injuries any more serious than a sunburn. Moreover, evidence of radioactivity in the water around the plant is not necessarily surprising given the amount of water sprayed onto and pumped into the reactors, said Ian Hutchinson, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts institute of Technology. ""I am not particularly alarmed,"" he said. The reactor thought to be leaking contaminated water is the same one cited in the dramatic evacuation last week of a small crew of workers who had stayed behind after the plant's owner pulled most employees from the area. The workers were pulled back March 16 after white smoke began billowing from the reactor and radiation levels spiked. At the time, the Japanese nuclear safety agency said it suspected damage to No. 3's containment vessel, but a government spokesman the next day said there had been no indication of a ""major breach of containment."" That reactor is of particular concern, experts have said, because it is the only one at the plant to use a combination of uranium and plutonium fuel, called MOX, that is considered to be more dangerous than the pure uranium fuel used in other reactors. Plant workers were also carefully watching the plant's No. 1 reactor, concerned that an increase in pressure noted inside that reactor could be a troublesome sign. Earlier, buildups of hydrogen gas had driven up pressure that led to explosions at three of the nuclear plant's reactors, including the No. 1 unit. Nishiyama conceded that ""controlling the temperature and pressure has been difficult"" for that reactor, which on Friday had been declared stable. The hospitalized employees were working to reconnect power to the No. 3 reactor building when they encountered water that was about 5 inches (15 centimeters) deep. Water rushed over the boots of two workers, who may have received what is called a ""beta burn."" The third worker had taller boots but was hospitalized as a precaution, according to Nishiyama. The men were exposed to the water for 40 to 50 minutes, said Tokyo Electric, which owns the plant. The workers may have ignored alarms on devices intended to measure radiation levels, believing the readings to be wrong, said the International Atomic Energy Agency, citing Japanese authorities. The two workers whose skin was exposed to the contaminated water had the highest levels of radiation recorded so far, the power company said. One, in his 30s, was exposed to 180.7 millisieverts and the other, in his 20s, tested at 179.37 millisieverts. Nishiyama said the third man -- who was exposed to 173 millisieverts but at first did not go to the hospital because his boots were high enough to prevent water from touching  his skin -- has also  gone to the same research hospital out of ""an abundance of caution."" Beta rays given off by radioactive substances don't penetrate deeply into materials, including flesh, said Nolan Hertel, a professor nuclear engineering at Georgia Tech. Consequently, the danger is relatively limited, he said. ""Basically, a beta burn would be akin to a bad sunburn,"" he said. Some 17 people have been exposed to 100 or more millisieverts of radiation since the plant's crisis began two weeks ago following a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent  tsunami struck. A person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts of radiation a year. But Japan's Health Ministry recently raised the maximum level of exposure for a person working to address the crisis at the nuclear plant to a rate of 250 millisieverts per year from the previous 100-millisievert standard. In the Fukushima Prefecture where the plant is located, officials had screened 87,813 people for radiation exposure as of Thursday, NISA said in a news release. Of those 98 people had tested above limits for exposure, but once their clothes were removed and other measures taken, the exposure levels dropped and there was no effect on health. The agency also said screeners have examined thyroid glands of 66 children ranging in age from 1 to 15 and found that the ""level of exposure of no problem."" The thyroid gland, particularly in children, can readily absorb radiation, health experts say. It's not entirely clear where the contaminants in the water came from, according to Nishiyama. But he said that based on the composition of the radioactive material in the water, the likely source appears to be the reactor core and not the open-air spent fuel pool onto which workers have sprayed tons of water in recent days in an effort to keep it cool. He said it if the water is from the reactor core, the problem may not be a crack in containment vessel, but rather seepage from vents or valves. The containment vessel is still holding pressure, he said, a sign that it may not be cracked. The incident raised questions about radiation control measures at the plant as 536 people -- including government authorities and firefighters -- continued working there Friday, according to an official with Tokyo Electric. The high measure prompted a top official with Nishiyama's agency to urge Tokyo Electric to ""improve its radiation management measures."" Workers are undertaking various measures to prevent the further release of radioactive substances into the air and beyond. Nishiyama said officials hope to start pumping in fresh water -- rather than the corrosive seawater they have been using -- to cool the spent-fuel pool at the No. 1 reactor and other locations. Such pools have nuclear fuel rods that can emit radiation if the water that normally surrounds them leaks out or boils off, which is more likely to happen without any functional cooling system in place. Switching to fresh water, instead of seawater, is also a priority for the No. 2 reactor's core (as well as for its spent fuel pool), Nishiyama said. The aim is to prevent further corrosion and damage inside, which may be worsened by the buildup of salt. A U.S. military barge loaded with fresh water to help cool the reactors left Yokosuka Navy Base at 11 a.m., said Jose Schmitt, commander of Fleet Activities at Yokosuka. A Japanese ship will escort the barge to the Fukushima plant; U.S. personnel are not involved in the escort or distribution of the water, according to Maj. Joseph Macri, a spokesman for U.S. Forces Japan. The U.S. military assistance follows a request by Japanese government and utility authorities for large amounts of fresh water. Beyond the seawater/saltwater issue, water in and around the Nos. 1 and 2 reactors had ""high radiation levels,"" Nishiyama said Friday -- though not as high as that of the No. 3 unit. Thursday's incident has further made the latter reactor a prime focus, and Nishiyama said Friday that ""radiation levels are high"" in some locales near that unit. He said that authorities were considering ""other routes"" to accomplish their goals of restarting the cooling systems around No. 3, keeping its spent nuclear fuel pool in check and other aims. Later in the day, Nishiyama said authorities hadn't yet determined how to get around the obstacle. Firefighters from Tokyo and Kawasaki were expected to resume spraying toward the No. 3 reactor and its fuel pool on Friday afternoon, according to Nishiyama. Efforts also continue at the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 reactors -- each of which have their own concerns, though less pronounced because the units were on scheduled outages when the quake struck. None of these three units had nuclear fuel inside their reactors, though efforts are ongoing to control temperatures inside the spent fuel pools. On Friday morning, a concrete pump truck was used once again to inject seawater into the No. 4 unit's fuel pool.

"(CNN) -- When the time came to grab that killer Fourth of July fireworks photo, Cat Connor was ready. ""It's taken me years to get a good shot,"" the California native explained. ""I very much planned for it. I studied up on how to shoot fireworks, read photographer blogs and got to know my equipment."" Connor's dedication paid off. In 2011, she captured a frame-worthy shot of several colorful fireworks exploding above California's Eastern Sierra, their glow reflecting off of the lake below. The result is stunning; a fitting memory of a lovely day that perfectly encapsulates all that is great about the holiday celebration. The Fourth of July honors America's Independence Day, when the nation declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. A national holiday, it's often marked with glorious parades, barbecues, parties and, of course, fireworks. As part of CNN's series celebrating the biggest, boldest and most spectacular celebrations across the world, we asked people to send in their best Fourth of July images, and to give tips on how to capture the perfect fireworks photo. Here are some handy hints. Use a tripod . One thing is for sure with fireworks pictures -- you don't want them blurry. So use a tripod to keep everything steady, photographers say. ""I love taking [pictures of] fireworks [but] it's quite tricky,"" said California-based photographer Biju Chandroth, who snapped a great shot at a Fourth of July fireworks display in Mammoth Lakes, California, in 2011. ""One absolutely needs a tripod, since you will have to use a slow shutter to get the trails."" His sentiment is echoed by professional photographer Edmund Lowe, who has fond memories of spectacular fireworks competitions between families in his neighborhood in Washington state. He also has some great tips for those wanting that iconic Fourth of July shot. ""The main requirement is a tripod, I use a sandbag or some other heavy object to make sure there is no tripod shake,"" he said. ""[Also], long exposures -- up to 10 seconds -- are required. I generally use an f-stop of f/11 to f/16 and a shutter speed of two to 10 seconds. The longer exposures will also give you time for multiple reports to be visible."" Capture that key moment . Dan Anderson of Minnesota knew what he wanted for his Independence Day shot last year -- and he wasn't going to let anything, not even pesky mosquitoes, get in the way. His great photo captures the moment his nephew launched a bottle rocket across one of Minnesota's many lakes, Lake Koronis. ""We did it in one take and then ran away because the mosquitoes were eating us alive,"" he remembered with a laugh. In a similar vein, Tyler Knott from Helena, Montana, captured a memorable photo on July 4, 2009, of his sister, her now-husband and four of her college friends drawing ""July 4"" using sparklers, with help from a tripod and remote trigger release. He says despite the challenges -- each sparkler-holder had to draw a character backwards -- they nailed the photo on the first try. The end result was worth the careful planning. ""I think a lot of people thought it was Photoshopped,"" he said. Take a bunch. Then take some more . It doesn't always take a professional camera to get a great shot, but it does require patience. Marie Sager photographed a spectacular fireworks display in 2010 in Studio City, California, on the CBS studio lot. She used a Panasonic Lumix which, to her surprise, had a ""fireworks"" setting. Her advice for those keen to capture great shots is simple: ""With fireworks, you never know what to expect, so keep on clicking!"" she said. ""Everything I photograph is usually straight from the hip, not planned. And I end up usually surprised myself."" Her advice was echoed by Tracy Bond from Huntsville, Alabama, who captured her own stunning images from a celebration in nearby Madison. ""I usually shoot until a get one I like,"" she shared. ""Experiment with different settings and see what you get."" Enjoy yourself! ""A day off from work for many, picnics, maybe some time at the pool or lake, and of course, at the end of the day, sonic booms followed by shimmering, multi-colored fire bringing 'oohs' and 'aahs' from young and old. What's not to like?"" Bond asked. The point is -- make it fun. Too much time worrying about your shot means you won't get the chance to enjoy the celebration. So make sure you, well, celebrate. You could do worse than take a leaf from Scott Murphy's book. The San Diego resident took some stunning shots over the city bay in 2011. He said the beautiful display reminded him of how glorious his city -- and country -- were. ""It's one of the few times in the year when everybody stops, looks up, and appreciates how beautiful San Diego, is with fireworks going off over the bay,"" he says. It's something worth remembering as your crane your neck Thursday evening to check out those glorious displays. Got some great Fourth of July fireworks photos, or planning to take some? We want to see them! Send us your best pictures and they could be on CNN!","U.S.'s Independence Day is the perfect celebration for parties, barbecues -- and of course, fireworks.

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic has sensationally been knocked out of the US Open. The 2011 champion was beaten in the semi final in four sets by Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 in what must go down as one of the biggest shocks of the modern era. In staggeringly humid conditions Nishikori, who has been coached by former US player Michael Chang, burst out of the blocks and snatched the first set. Djokovic battled back to easily win the second. With the Serb ascendant, few gave Nishikori a chance against a player in his pomp who is considered one of the greatest of all time. But Djokovic was clearly struggling with the conditions and gave up a succession of unforced errors and a string of uncharacteristic double faults. Humid conditions . The match changed in the third set when it became clear that Nishikori was coping better with the heat, despite coming through two previous five set matches. The Japanese player won a third set tie break 7-4 before breaking Djokovic's serve in the first game of the fourth. A tiring Djokovic could do nothing to stop Nishikori, who powered on and became the first Japanese player, as well as the first Asian male player, to ever reach a grand slam final. ""I don't know whats going on, I was a little tired,"" an ecstatic and emotional Nishikori said on court shortly after his stunning victory. ""It's my first semi final in a grand slam. It is an amazing feeling playing a number one player. So happy. It was really tough conditions today. But I love to play long matches! I hope I can recover well for the final."" Although no one gave Nishikori a hope before the match, there were signs that Japan's number one could spring a surprise after recently beating Roger Federer and narrowly losing to Rafael Nadal. Equally as significant has been his teaming up with Chang. ""He's been helping me a lot,"" Nishikori said when asked about Chang's influence on his game. ""We have been working super well."" A dejected Djokovic refused to blame the conditions for his defeat. ""It was the same for both players,"" he said. ""I congratulate Nishikori. He was the better player today ... my game today was not even close to what I wanted it to be. A lot of unforced errors. I wasn't myself."" Ghosts of '33 . Nishikori was the first Japanese player to reach a major semi final for 81 years. The last player to reach that level was Jiro Satoh, who reached five major semifinals, including Wimbledon in 1933. But later that year Satoh committed suicide after jumping off the ship that was taking him and his teammates to England for a Davis Cup tie. Nishikori's victory saw him surpass Satoh's long running record. ""I hope it's big news in Japan,"" he said. ""I feel the support from Japan. It is 4am in the morning but I hope a lot of people are watching."" Nishikori will play Marin Cilic in the final after the Croatian blew Roger Federer away in straight sets 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. The day's second semi final was delayed by rain, but when it restarted Federer must have wished for the heavens to open once again. Cilic attacked from the opening game, using his booming serve to devastating effect. Federer had no answers. ""It was an amazing day for me, to be able to play like this, it was the best performance ever in my career,"" Cilic said on court after the game. It will be a first grand slam final for both Cilic and Nishikori. ""I think it will be a sensational day for both of us,"" Cilic said when asked about his Japanese opponent. ""I'm just going to enjoy it, be happy and try to win."" The 2014 US Open final will the first since the Australian Open in 2005 to not feature one of the big four of Djokovic, Federer, Nadal or Murray.","Djokovic stunned in US Open .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, the ""Fight for $15"" enters a new phase, with strikes and demonstrations at fast-food restaurants not only in up to 150 cities across the United States but also in about 30 nations across the globe. Fast-food workers can already claim their first major victory right here at home. Recently, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced a plan to gradually lift the city's minimum wage to $15. As a result, 100,000 workers in the city -- including nearly every fast-food worker -- will get a raise. From a worker's point of view, the agreement, expected to be passed by the City Council in coming weeks, is not perfect. Businesses with as many as 500 employees, for example, will have until 2019 to guarantee their workers $15 an hour in total compensation, and until 2021 to pay a full $15 in hourly wages. No doubt some businesses within this category could sustain a faster increase. Nor does the agreement mean that fast-food and other workers will be able to freely form a union at their workplaces, a critical step in solidifying wage gains made through policy and guaranteeing other core benefits such as fair work schedules and sick leave. But this should not detract from what Seattle's workers and their advocates have accomplished -- thanks in large part to the fast-food worker strikes and the groundswell of local support it generated. Check out the minimum wage in your state . To date, the corporate leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association -- McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's among them -- have greeted every proposal for a minimum wage of even $10 with dire predictions of economic chaos and a fusillade of lobbying cash to squash them. But businesses have never had uniform views on wages. Polling by the Small Business Majority reveals that 57% of small businesses support raising the minimum wage. Thousands of Main Street businesses -- and larger firms -- voluntarily choose to pay their workers more because it lowers employee turnover, improves performance and generates spending in their own stores. These fissures in the business community have become open cracks in Seattle. Although Maud Daudon, president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, was one of only three members of the mayor's Advisory Committee on income equality not to vote for the wage agreement, 10 other business leaders on the committee did. The businesses these individuals represent span companies as large as Fortune 300 member Nucor Steel and as modest as Tutta Bella, a local pizzeria. Undoubtedly, some business representatives on the mayor's advisory group are backing a $15 wage out of pragmatism rather than principle. Seattle worker groups and advocates are well-organized and enjoy the support of the mayor, the entire City Council and most Seattle residents; better to participate and be able to shape the final contours of the inevitable wage increase than oppose the process entirely. Nevertheless, businesses aren't charities, as conservatives like to say, and so the fact that a spectrum of Seattle businesses have signed off on a $15 minimum wage undercuts opponents' predictions of business closures and mass layoffs -- for if that were the inevitable result of the increase, why would Seattle's businesses swallow such a pill voluntarily? Real-life wage increases in other cities show that Seattle's businesses are in fact being quite rational. The San Jose Downtown Association reports that in the year since San Jose raised its minimum wage, business has grown by 3% -- about 10,000 new businesses were registered -- unemployment has dropped from 7.6% to 6.3%, and the cost of enforcing the new wage has been negligible. And if Seattle can sustain $15, why not other cities? Movements are afoot in San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, New York and Washington to raise those cities' minimum wages well above the $10.10 mark that congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama are pushing nationally. Opponents of wage increases will be quick to paint Seattle as an outlier, but business conditions in all of these cities -- and many others -- are comparable enough to Seattle that there is no reason why they can't absorb a similarly gradual increase to $15. See who the May 15 protesters are . In the end, the outcome in Seattle demonstrates what history has proved time and time again: When workers are well-organized and there is broad support for higher wages, even businesses that resist the idea are ultimately forced to pay more -- and they adjust. After experiencing years of wage stagnation while the wealthiest make money hand over fist, middle and working class Americans are rightfully insisting on a larger share of the nation's prosperity. In years past, the corporate establishment may have been able to subdue this agitation with references to ""job creators"" and patronizing warnings against ""hurting those you want to help."" But Americans -- low-wage workers, middle class families and even many business owners -- have had enough. The movement to create a decent life and a truly sustainable economy for us all can no longer be stifled. Look out: The wall of resistance to a $15 an hour minimum wage has been breached -- and the flood is coming to your city, too.","Fast-food and low wage workers in up to 150 U.S. cities, 30 nations will protest Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A day after parting ways with President Francois Hollande, France's former first lady discreetly left Paris for India on Sunday to support a nonprofit organization, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Valerie Trierweiler boarded an Air France flight to Mumbai with an entourage that included her friend actress Charlotte Valandrey, BFMTV reported from the French capital's Charles de Gaulle Airport. Valandrey told BFMTV that Trierweiler ""was very happy to leave for that mission to save children in India. ... She is a strong woman with a heart ... someone who can be counted on and who is engaged in a humanitarian cause."" While in India, her schedule will include attending a charity gala dinner, Action Against Hunger said on its website. It will be her first public appearance since a media storm over Hollande's alleged affair with an actress erupted this month. French president says it's over . Goodbye message . Hollande declared his relationship with Trierweiler over on Saturday. ""I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler,"" Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he'd been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet for two years. Speculation about the split swirled Saturday after a French national weekly reported Hollande was expected to announce his separation from Trierweiler later in the day. But the French presidency initially denied the report that an announcement would be made. ""It is a rumor that circulated on the Internet today. There is absolutely no confirmation of the publication of a statement today,"" the palace press officer told CNN. Hollande meets with Pope Francis amid scandal . U.S. trip planned for February . Hollande has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but did threaten legal action. At his first news conference of the year, Hollande said he and Trierweiler were going through ""painful moments."" The allegations had left Trierweiler's position in some doubt ahead of a planned trip to Washington in February. Last weekend, Trierweiler left the hospital where she had spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue, Paris Match reported. The magazine also said she would recover for ""several days"" in an official residence in Versailles. Hollande, 59, has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election, although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life. A recent survey by French pollster Ifop with the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than 80% of respondents had not changed their opinion of the President based on the allegations of an affair. Hollande has four children from a previous relationship with Segolene Royal, a senior member of his Socialist Party and a 2007 presidential candidate. Royal announced their separation just after she lost the 2007 election to Nicolas Sarkozy. Opinion: Is it time to consign role of First Spouse to history?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congress is looking into allegations that National Security Agency linguists have been eavesdropping on Americans abroad. Government linguists say the U.S. eavesdropped on Americans, including military officers serving in Iraq. The congressional oversight committees said Thursday that the Americans targeted included military officers in Iraq who called friends and family in the United States. The allegations were made by two former military intercept operators on a television news report Thursday evening. A terrorist surveillance program instituted by the Bush administration allows the intelligence community to monitor phone calls between the United States and overseas without a court order -- as long as one party to the call is a terror suspect. Adrienne Kinne, a former U.S. Army Reserves Arab linguist, told ABC News the NSA was listening to the phone calls of U.S. military officers, journalists and aid workers overseas who were talking about ""personal, private things with Americans who are not in any way, shape or form associated with anything to do with terrorism."" David Murfee Faulk, a former U.S. Navy Arab linguist, said in the news report that he and his colleagues were listening to the conversations of military officers in Iraq who were talking with their spouses or girlfriends in the United States. According to Faulk, they would often share the contents of some of the more salacious calls stored on their computers, listening to what he called ""phone sex"" and ""pillow talk."" Both Kinne and Faulk worked at the NSA listening facility at Fort Gordon, Georgia. They told ABC that when linguists complained to supervisors about eavesdropping on personal conversations, they were ordered to continue transcribing the calls. NSA spokeswoman Judith Emmel said the agency's Inspector General has investigated some of the allegations and found them ""unsubstantiated."" Other accusations are still being looked at, she said. The NSA operates in ""strict accordance with U.S. laws and regulations,"" she said. ""Any allegation of wrongdoing by employees is thoroughly investigated"" and if misconduct is discovered, ""we take swift and certain remedial action."" CIA Director Mike Hayden, who was the head of the NSA when the terrorist surveillance program began, has always maintained that private conversations of Americans are not intercepted and if it should happen inadvertently, the name is removed from the record. ""At NSA, the law was followed assiduously,"" said Hayden's spokesman, Mark Mansfeld. ""The notion that Gen. Hayden sanctioned or tolerated illegalities of any sort is ridiculous on its face."" Author Jim Bamford was the first to interview the two former NSA linguists for his new book, ""The Shadow Factory,"" which will be published next week. Bamford told CNN the accounts from the whistle-blowers demonstrate the NSA was listening to the private conversations of Americans, transcribing them and keeping them. ""They don't delete them,"" he said. Bamford has written two other books on the NSA and was a party to an unsuccessful ACLU lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The ACLU issued a statement on Thursday saying the allegations show that the government ""misled the American public about the scope of its surveillance activities."" The ABC report ""is an indictment not only of the Bush administration, but of all of those political leaders, Democratic and Republican, who have been saying that the executive branch can be trusted with surveillance powers that are essentially unchecked,"" said ACLU official Jamell Jaffer. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, called the allegations ""extremely disturbing."" ""Anytime there is an allegation regarding abuse of the privacy and civil liberties of Americans, it is a very serious matter,"" said Rockefeller, adding that his committee is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure the government is following the strict procedures to protect U.S. citizens against unwarranted surveillance. A House Intelligence Committee spokesman said the panel has been in contact with the NSA and is awaiting the agency's response.","Ex-Army Reserves Arab linguist said the U.S. government listened to private calls .

"(CNN) -- Former Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto emerged victorious in the nation's presidential election Sunday, according to preliminary results. According to Finland's Ministry of Justice, with 100% of votes counted, Niinisto defeated the nation's first openly gay presidential candidate, Pekka Haavisto, with 62.6% of the vote compared to Haavisto's 37.4%. Both were vying to succeed Tarja Halonen, Finland's first female president, who cannot run for re-election. In the first round of voting on January 28, the conservative Niinisto took just under 37% of the vote. Haavisto, a pro-European Green League candidate, got 18.8%, claiming the No. 2 spot and narrowly edging out euro-skeptic Paavo Vayrynen, who had 17.5%. The winner of Sunday's vote between Niinisto and Haavisto will break a 30-year lock on the presidency by Halonen's Social Democrats. Halonen, who is completing her second term as president, defeated Niinisto, of the conservative National Coalition Party, in 2006. Both candidates are pro-Europe at a time when the European Union is facing a debt crisis that could threaten the bloc's common currency, the euro. The most vocally anti-Europe candidate, Timo Soini of the True Finns party, came in fourth last week, though his party is the third largest in parliament. Finland joined the euro when it was created, when Niinisto was finance minister. He insists Finland should stay in the eurozone despite the debt crisis that has taken some of the shine off the common currency. His party won the top share of votes in last April's parliamentary election, and leads a broad coalition government that includes the Social Democrats. Finland is one of the few remaining AAA-rated countries in the eurozone. But 2012 is expected to deliver a growth of only 0.4%, with the possibility of a new recession, its finance ministry reports. It has had to take part in the bailouts of other euro states that faced deep financial problems such as Greece and Ireland. Many Finns now see Niinisto -- who also served as deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank -- as someone who can stand up for Finland's interests in the single currency. Haavisto, meanwhile, has served as Finland's environment and development minister and has international experience working for the European Union and the United Nations in Sudan and the Middle East. Finland's president is in charge of the country's foreign policy, together with the government, and serves as commander-in-chief of its defense forces. But recent changes have seen more power being given to the government and parliament, and former President Mauno Koivisto told YLE that there was a risk of an ""imbalance"" between the direct public election of the president and the office's diminishing power.","NEW: Sauli Niinisto gained 62.6% of the vote, preliminary results show .

"(CNN) -- Officials with Libya's interim government are reassuring the West that their religious views are moderate, after the country's interim leader called for the country's new laws to be based on Sharia, or Islamic law. At a rally on Sunday in Benghazi, National Transitional Council leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said, ""As a Muslim country, we have adopted the Islamic Sharia as the main source of law. Accordingly, any law that contradicts Islamic principles with the Islamic Sharia is ineffective legally."" Jalil also suggested in his speech that he would like to see new Islamic rules implemented to limit how banks charge interest, and put an end to some of the Gadhafi-era restrictions on polygamy. ""The law of marriage and divorce, which deals with polygamy -- this law is against Islamic Sharia, and is now halted,"" he said. That kind of talk could raise concerns among the fledgling government's Western backers. In many Muslim countries, Sharia law forms the basis for the constitution, but is interpreted moderately. But in some, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, it is seen as grounds for cutting off the hand of a convicted thief, or even stoning a woman to death for adultery. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, visiting Tripoli just last week, offered a warning when she was asked whether there should be a role for Islamists in the new Libya. ""Groups and individuals who really believe in democracy should be welcome into that process,"" she said. ""But groups that want to undermine democracy or subvert it are going to have to be dealt with -- by the Libyans themselves."" But Libya's ambassador to the United States, Ali Suleiman Aujali, says the West should not be alarmed. ""Sharia law, Islamic law, it is not against democracy, it is not against equality, is not against the relations with the other countries based on interests and respect and cooperation."" He says that women now enjoy new rights since the end of Moammar Gadhafi's regime. ""There is no restriction against Libyan women to do anything now in Libya,"" he says. And Jalil on Monday quickly reassured the international community that Libyans are moderate Muslims. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, ""We were encouraged to see President Jalil make a clarification."" But she reiterated a warning to Libya and other Islamic countries in transition, saying that ""the number one thing is that universal human rights, rights for women, rights for minorities, right to due process, right to transparency be fully respected."" Jalil's embrace of Islam's role in Libya comes just as voters in neighboring Tunisia handed a victory to the moderate Islamist party Ennahda. ""Islam is clearly going to play a much stronger role across the region,"" says Robin Wright, a Mideast expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace. ""Whether it's Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and beyond -- as countries redefine their political systems, they are going to want to use the values of their faith to help define what they want next. But that doesn't mean necessarily they're going to be rigid Islamist regimes."" Still, she says, Libyan women are very concerned about equal rights in the post-Gadhafi era. ""The idea of allowing polygamy again -- or allowing the husband to marry again without asking permission of the first wife -- is something that is going to really resonate throughout Libya,"" she said.","NTC leader Jalil said: ""We have adopted the Islamic Sharia as the main source of law""

"(CNN) -- ""Mother, mother, there's too many of you crying./ Brother, brother, brother, there is far too many of you dying./ You know we got to find a way to bring some lovin' here today. /Father, father, we don't need to escalate. You see war is not the answer, for only love can conquer hate..."" From ""What's Going On,"" sung by Marvin Gaye in 1971. In Chicago, we asked that simple question of people in the heart of communities plagued by violence. What's going on? ""We need jobs, education, recreation and we want to live, we want to feel safe,"" is mainly what young people told us. They shared their stories with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Rev. Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina's Church, the Rev. Chris Devron of Christ the King Jesuit College prep school and me. A young man said: ""When I grow up I want to be a lawyer. I am good at arguing and debating. My friends call me good news because I always take the positive side of the argument."" Another young man said, ""I'm good with the pen. I write short stories and put music behind the story so you can really hear what I'm saying."" Nurses dodge bullets to provide care . What we heard was that they all have hopes and dreams. Not one of them dreamed or aspired to a life of crime. Among the violence and death that so many experience, hope is alive. I was not shocked or surprised. It is what I expected to hear and what I knew: These kids want to belong and they want to feel valued and, yes, respected. Earning respect, having a positive reputation and being a valued member of a group or a team is partly the reason I'm where I am today; I was taught I could achieve these virtues by playing on a basketball team. Too many of our kids try to achieve them by being in a gang. We need to teach our young people that respect is given and never taken, that reputation comes from doing honest work and not hard time. They need to know the only group worth being a part of requires giving back through teamwork. My coaches, mentors and teachers taught me those lessons when I was growing up on Chicago's West Side. They taught me to use my sports platform to help others, better the community and better others' lives. It can be the crucial difference for thousands of young people, whose only knowledge of a structured organization comes from gangs. Chicago's murder rate: Don't blame the guns alone . Over the years, sports and play have broken down racial and cultural barriers. We believe that once kids who might be at risk get to know each other and play sports together, the murder rate will drop. In fully functioning parks and schools, we can win their hearts and minds and create safe places for them to interact with each other.I am proud to join forces with Mayor Emanuel to expand the ""Windy City Hoops"" basketball league, which would extend our Friday and Saturday night tournaments to 10 more Chicago parks beginning in March. This is where all of us come in. We are calling on all Chicagoans to donate what they can at cityofchicago.org/hoops in order to reach our goal of $500,000. With that money, we can provide an additional 3,200 young people in Chicago a safe alternative to drugs, gangs and violence, one hoop at a time. Donations will go toward buying a jersey, paying a referee for a game, reserving a court or supporting another part of the program. This effort began last fall when I met the mayor at a Saturday morning basketball game at Christ the King High School on the West Side. The tournament brought rival gang members together to compete. When the colors came off and the jerseys went on, nobody saw gang members: We just saw great athletes playing classic Chicago basketball. My view: How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom . Right then, the mayor and I started working out how we could give as many young people as possible across Chicago this opportunity to show off their skills and do what they love in a safe place. Whether it is 3-on-3 or 5-on-5 competition, basketball teaches you how to get along in a group; it teaches you how to set common goals and work with others to achieve them. From the courts on the West Side to the Hall of Fame, those are lessons that stayed with me my entire life, and they can give other kids from a similar background a better shot. I believe deeply in what the mayor is trying to achieve because I see the incredible potential in Chicago's young people.When I walk down the street in Englewood or Austin or Little Village, I don't see criminals or gang bangers or thugs; I see athletes and artists and academics capable of great things. Our challenge is often to get them to see themselves in the same light. Right now, too many kids aren't optimistic because they don't have much to look back on with pride. We can change that; we can give them an opportunity to build up their confidence and build up each other. We can help them see clearly that they have choices. Poverty should no longer be wedded to drugs and weapons. We want them to know that education is the only true way to better their lives. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends . Our kids are worth saving and they're worth fighting for. If you can't give resources, give them your time; have conversations with them, and become a strong mentor. Being present and showing up can change a kid's life for the better. I know, because I was one of those kids. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(MNN.com) -- Pets do the darnedest things, but that's why we love them. For every shoe that my dog Lulu has destroyed, she also has provided hours of much-needed cuddle time. I still miss those green suede pumps she ate -- and it seems that I'm not alone in lamenting lost inventory. Each year, Veterinary Pet Insurance compiles a list of the unusual ingestion claims for its annual Hambone Award. The dubious title honors a dog that got stuck in its owner's refrigerator and ate an entire Thanksgiving ham before being discovered. Here are a few notable items consumed last year. In some cases, names have been omitted to protect the guilty. 100 rocks . Harley the pug secured the 2011 Hambone Award after consuming 100 rocks during his stay at a veterinary boarding facility. His owner knew there was a problem when the pooch kept pooping rocks. A visit to the emergency clinic led to the discovery of pebbles clogging Harley's pipes. He passed the rocks without requiring surgery, earning a bronze ham-shaped trophy, treats and an emergency pet kit. It's a good reminder to create your own pet first-aid kit, complete with the number to your nearest after-hours veterinarian. Dead porcupine . Sometimes dogs like to veer off the beaten trail and find their own adventures. That didn't disturb pet owner Brian Handwerk until his dog Scooby started throwing up quills, as in potentially fatal porcupine quills. Next time, we recommend stocking up on Scooby snacks. Package of fluorescent light bulbs . Compact fluorescent bulbs require much less energy than their incandescent counterparts. But consuming a package of these green bulbs isn't so bright. MNN: 5 ways to protect your pet and your wallet from costly vet bills . Deer antlers . ASPCA dog trainer Kristen Collins recommends investing in a variety of chew toys to promote good dental health and prevent destructive behavior. Even though deer antlers have gained popularity as ""green"" chew toys, she says that pets should be monitored during playtime. ""Supervise your dog really closely the first few times that she is chewing anything,"" she warns, because broken pieces can present a choking hazard. They also can be dangerous if ingested. A cassette tape . When pet owner William Yunker discovered broken shards of plastic, he knew there was a problem. Dangling under his pointer puppy Rudy's tail, he discovered evidence of a tune gone horribly wrong. Rudy had managed to eat a cassette tape â€” and the evidence was working its way out the other end. Stringy objects such as yarn, shoestrings or cassette tapes can become potentially fatal as they become entangled in a pet's intestinal tract. Gastrointestinal foreign body issues rank among the top five preventable medical conditions treated at the ASPCA'S Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital in New York. While Rudy's case did not require surgery, it serves as the perfect cautionary tale to watch pets around bite-size items. Also, maybe it's time for Yunker to try a digital music format. MNN: How to make pet shampoo at home . Metal hanger . Boredom is a common cause for destruction, says animal trainer Kristen Collins of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Mental and physical exercise can keep dogs and cats on the path to good behavior. She recommends five to 10 minutes of playtime for frisky felines. Interactive toys also keep pets mentally stimulated. Cellphone case . Train pets to avoid potentially dangerous items. Collins is a proponent of the ""drop it"" command. If your dog has something it its mouth, say ""Drop it"" and show a high-value treat. As soon as your dog drops the item, offer praise and give the treat. Repeat this step a few times before moving on to the next stage of saying the command without showing the treat every time. Since most cats don't respond to bribery, Collins says it's important to be vigilant about keeping their environment safe. Remove items they are likely to find chew-worthy and stock up on cat grass or other alternatives. Dental retainer .

"(CNN) -- Russia has announced a ban on fresh vegetable imports from the European Union in the wake of a deadly E. coli outbreak that has swept across parts of Europe, state media reported Thursday. ""The ban will be in effect until we become convinced that this situation is resolved -- that is, when the source of the infection is located and it is established how it is being transmitted, but most importantly, when the outbreak is contained and people stop getting infected and dying,"" Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, told the state-run ITAR-TASS news agency. Frederic Vincent, the European Commission health spokesman, called the move ""disproportionate."" ""The commission will be writing today to the Russian authorities and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution,"" Vincent said. The commission is the EU's executive body. Customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country, according to Onishchenko.  Supermarkets and food chains in Russia were told to withdraw European vegetables from their produce bins. The ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the European part of the country, where about 90% of vegetables are imported, said Sergey Shugayev, chairman of the Rural Russia Association. China and Turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into Russia, according to the Russian Greenhouses Association. The outbreak is responsible for 15 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, according to the World Health Organization.  The outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 people in at least 10 countries. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said. The ban on fresh vegetables from the European Union comes three days after Russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and salad greens from Germany and Spain.  On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates imposed a temporary ban on cucumbers from Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","NEW: European Commission calls the move ""disproportionate""

"(CNN) -- In 2012, China announced that in 2017 Hong Kong could elect its chief executive through ""universal suffrage."" Previously, the leader of the Hong Kong government was picked by an election committee of between 800 and 1,200 members, most of whom were trusted by Beijing. In effect, Beijing had established procedures that ensured that a member of the territory's establishment would be in charge. But China's 2012 promise created hopes among the public that the chief executive would be picked through a truly democratic election. Those hopes have now been dashed, and it is likely that China has bought itself more instability, not less. Beijing preserves control . On August 31, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced a decision regarding the procedures for the next chief executive election. If the plan is actually passed, Hong Kong will get universal suffrage in the narrow sense that eligible voters will be the ones to pick the chief executive, not an election committee. But Beijing has preserved significant control by instituting a restrictive process for nominating candidates. It insisted that a nominating committee would pick candidates (not political parties, and not by popular nomination). And surprise, surprise: the nominating committee will be modeled on the old election committee. The new body would be composed mainly of people who are sympathetic to Beijing's desire for order and who don't want to see Hong Kong's economic growth, in which many of the members are invested, disrupted by politics. In addition, over half of the nominating committee would have to approve each candidate, which means that no pan-democrat could get nominated if Beijing disapproved of him or her. So under the plan Hong Kong voters would have a choice, but the pro-democracy camp suspects that the choice will be among two or three like-minded and Beijing-friendly candidates. Will it be approved? This new system is unlikely to be established because it must be approved by a two-thirds vote of Hong Kong's legislature. If pro-democracy lawmakers stick together, they have enough votes to veto the scheme, in which case the selection procedure reverts to the prior, ""small-circle"" system. That would be a great tragedy. A sensible compromise was objectively possible -- one that democratized the nominating process in such a way that produced a competitive election and a clear choice between an establishment and pro-democracy candidate. That was an approach that would have likely commanded two-thirds approval. In the short-term, Hong Kong faces the prospect of major disruption, because the more radical elements of the pan-democratic camp, which have insisted on nomination of candidates through citizen petition, have now promised to mount a campaign to ""Occupy Central,"" the major business district, through large demonstrations and even civil disobedience. The radicals' proposal was always unrealistic and not necessary to achieve a competitive election. The Hong Kong police are perfectly capable of controlling the protests (still, the People's Liberation Army is waiting in reserve). But whatever one thinks of Occupy Central's goals and tactics, it has given voice to the more general public desire for genuine democracy and to frustration at Beijing's rigidity. Why invite trouble? Why did China choose this course of action? First of all, it has feared that if pan-democrats ran the Hong Kong government, they would use it as a base to destabilize Communist Party rule in the rest of China. Second, it believed that the United States and Britain were manipulating the pan-democrats to further their own disruptive goals. (Both fears have no basis in reality, but what counts is that Beijing believes them). Third, the Chinese government and the Hong Kong tycoons it listens to worried that a democratic election would increase demands for costly social welfare programs. Fourth, there was the prospect of continued disruption if Hong Kong radicals concluded that Beijing would always back down in the face of mass protest. Finally, Chinese leaders may have worried that granting genuine democracy to Hong Kong would stimulate similar demands in China. Problems compounded? In the end, Beijing opted for the certainty of knowing that it could control Hong Kong's leadership by controlling the nomination process for the chief executive election. It will likely achieve that goal, but the price will be continuing instability from a frustrated public. True universal suffrage would not have solved all of the governance problems of what is becoming a more unequal and polarized society. But without genuine elections to legitimize Hong Kong's leaders, solving those problems will be impossible.","China has announced changes to election procedures in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- He began his career as a bus driver in Caracas, then rose through the ranks to become a member of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's inner circle. Now, election authorities say voters have picked Nicolas Maduro to be Chavez's successor. With more than 99% of ballots counted, Maduro secured 50.7% of the vote, Venezuelan National Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena said Sunday night, calling the results ""irreversible."" Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski has demanded a recount, and it's unclear what Venezuela's political future holds. But speaking to cheering supporters Sunday night, Maduro said he was certain of his victory and ready to lead the South American country. In campaign rallies leading up to Sunday's presidential election, Maduro pledged to continue Chavez's political projects to build ""21st century socialism."" Maduro, 50, has been Venezuela's interim leader since Chavez's death. When he registered to run for the presidency last month, he told supporters, ""I am not Chavez, but I am his son."" They weren't blood relations, but in one of his last public appearances, Chavez tapped Maduro as his replacement. Q&A: Venezuela's presidential election . ""My firm opinion, as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable, absolute, total -- is ... that you elect Nicolas Maduro as president,"" Chavez said in December, waving a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution as he spoke. ""I ask this of you from my heart. He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" Maduro was a high-profile face in Chavez's administration. So was his wife, Cilia Flores, whom Chavez named as Venezuela's attorney general last year. Serving as both the country's vice president and foreign minister, Maduro often was seen in the front row of Chavez's news conferences and traveled to Cuba many times alongside Chavez as he underwent cancer treatment. U.S. open to 'more constructive relationship' with Venezuela . ""He is without a doubt one of the ministers who is closest to Chavez,"" political analyst German Campos told CNN en EspaÃ±ol after Chavez tapped Maduro as vice president in October. As foreign minister, Maduro was the country's top diplomat as ties grew with Cuba and tensions rose with the United States. In recent years, he has been an outspoken critic of U.S. policies toward Venezuela. When the Treasury Department added four Venezuelan officials to its drug kingpin list in 2011, Maduro accused the U.S. agency of acting as ""a sort of world police agency"" that has falsely named ""decent citizens of our country ... as drug traffickers."" ""A country like that has no moral authority to judge generals and political officials in Venezuela,"" he said. ""We reject it and we believe that the drug trafficking mafias are there, in a sick society like the United States."" After security screeners detained him at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2006, Maduro called the U.S. government ""racist"" and ""Nazi"" and said does not appreciate Latin American countries. Since Chavez's March 5 death, Maduro has ratcheted up the rhetoric. His steady stream of accusations have included claims that people within the Pentagon and the CIA were plotting to destabilize Venezuela and suggestions that the United States may have caused Chavez's cancer. Chavez's criticisms of U.S. imperialism were a hallmark of his presidency and played well with his supporters. And some analysts said it was no surprise that the accusations -- which the United States has denied -- escalated with Maduro on the ticket to replace Chavez. Maduro hasn't always taken an extreme tack, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. Hugo Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger . ""On the one hand, he has been behind some of the most radical, crazy foreign policy decisions of the Chavez administration. Support for Libya, you name it, all the radical decisions, he has been behind them,"" Corrales said. ""But he also has been behind some of the most pragmatic and conciliatory decisions, including the turnaround in relations with Colombia."" That's a marked contrast with the inflammatory Chavez, who rarely turned to compromise, Corrales said. Before his role representing Venezuela abroad, Maduro honed his political skills at home. He became a union leader while working for the Caracas metro system. After Chavez came to power in 1999, Maduro helped draft a new constitution. He served as a congressman until 2006, when he was tapped as foreign minister. Maduro has said he's proud to continue ""Chavismo,"" the political movement Chavez started. Throngs of dedicated followers still call themselves Chavistas in devotion to the former president. Before Sunday's vote, some analysts questioned whether Maduro would have the charisma to maintain their support. They noted that Chavez's political strength was largely fueled by his ability to personally connect with voters. And that personal connection with his supporters is ""what's held things together in Venezuela,"" according to Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank. Opinion: After Chavez, a power vacuum . Chavez's public remarks supporting Maduro likely bolstered support for him among fervent Chavistas, Corrales said. ""When popular presidents make an endorsement, that always has an effect,"" Corrales said. When he named Maduro as vice president, Chavez noted his extensive experience on ""different battlefronts."" ""The bourgeoisie make fun of Nicolas Maduro because he was a bus driver,"" Chavez said, ""and look where he's going now."" Chavez leaves a revolutionary legacy . Journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report from Caracas.","Analyst: Maduro was behind radical foreign policy decisions, also compromises .

"(CNN)  -- The American Embassy in Yemen was the target of a mortar attack Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said, contradicting a suggestion from the Yemeni government the attack targeted a school where 13 were injured. ""Our conversations in Yemen have led us to the conclusion that the attack was directed against our embassy,"" according to a statement released Tuesday evening. ""Since this is an ongoing investigation, we are not going to talk about the specifics of the case."" Earlier, a source with knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Tuesday's mortar attack in the capital city of San'a -- but unauthorized to speak on the record -- told CNN there was a ""clear and strong indication"" the U.S. embassy was targeted. ""My strong belief is that there is almost no doubt this is an effort directed at the U.S. embassy,"" the source said. The Yemeni government said the attack Tuesday -- which injured 13 students, three critically, at the Seventh of July school for girls, near the embassy -- could have stemmed from a personal dispute involving the school's headmistress. Yemen's ambassador to the United States, Abdulwahab Abdulla al-Hajjri, said the attack was ""a private dispute."" ""The target was someone inside the school,"" al-Hajjri said. ""It had nothing to do with the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. Embassy was not a target."" However, CNN's source said the Yemeni government is calling this a private dispute to ""distract us"" from their security ""failure."" The source said Yemeni investigators are also looking at this as a terrorist attack and are ""energetically pursuing that line of thought. That reflects the seriousness in which they approach it."" The source indicated the Yemeni government ""does not have anyone in custody"" but ""they are looking for someone."" Yemeni soldiers guarding the embassy were hurt in the attack. The U.S. Embassy will be closed Wednesday. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh condemned the attack and offered rewards to anyone who assists in the investigation, according to Saba, Yemen's official news agency. The San'a city council called the incident ""a horrible terrorist work"" and said ""the attack goes against Islamic teachings and cultural values; and no one would do such a thing except those who have weak souls,"" Saba reported.

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela was always mindful that his leadership role in the liberation of South Africa from apartheid might not have been possible if he had not been imprisoned. ""It is possible that if I had not gone to jail and been able to read and listen to the stories of many people. ... I might not have learned these things,"" Mandela said of the insights that he gained during his 27 years in jail. In an interview less than a year after he had stepped down as the country's first black president, Mandela shared with me reflections of how prison changed him. He said that reading the biographies of great leaders who had been able to overcome their shortcomings and rise to do great things had inspired him. He said it also helped him to realize that behind every seemingly ordinary person lay the potential of greatness. ""I have been surprised a great deal sometimes when I see somebody who looks less than ordinary, but when you talk to the person and they open their mouths, they are something completely different,"" he said. Mandela said that prison gave him time to think about the times when he had failed to acknowledge people who had been kind to him. Mandela said that at the height of the struggle against apartheid, he and other leaders were understandably angry at the humiliation and loss of dignity of those who suffered under the unjust policy. It meant their actions were driven by anger and emotion rather than by reflection and consultation. ""But in jail -- especially for those who stayed in single cells -- you had enough opportunity to sit down and think,"" he said. There was time to listen to the stories of people who were highly educated and who were widely traveled and experienced. ""When they told of their experiences, you felt humbled,"" he said. Mandela said that he had learned that when you had the moral high ground, it was better to sit down and talk to people and persuade them of the correctness of your cause. ""If you have an objective in life, then you want to concentrate on that and not engage in infighting with your enemies,"" he said. ""You want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself,"" Mandela said. Nelson Mandela: A man of many handshakes . In his twilight, Mandela was at pains to publish and acknowledge his weaknesses and shortcomings in his family life, in his relationships with women and his first wife, Evelyn. He was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him. He also spoke increasingly about the importance of changing oneself. ""One of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself,"" Mandela said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman Douw Steyn who had made his Johannesburg residence available to Mandela as a retreat after his prison release in 1990. Mandela had given similar advice to wife Winnie in a letter written to her in 1981 after she had been jailed by the apartheid regime. Mandela noted that there were qualities ""in each one of us"" that form the basis of our spiritual life and that we can change ourselves by observing our reactions to the unfolding of life. Ten years later, Mandela said that it gave him a feeling of fulfillment to see that Douw Steyn had changed and had learned to share his resources with the poor. ""It enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that I am changing myself"" by reconciling with former adversaries, Mandela said. I believe that the essence of Mandela's greatness was to change himself fundamentally during his period in jail and emerge as a potent leader and example for all humanity. Opinion: Nelson Mandela saved my life . The reflections took me back to the extraordinary day of Mandela's release. The day the legend became a man. Even now, the moment seems frozen in time. It was February 11, 1990, and the African sun shone from a clear blue sky on a windless summer's day in Cape Town. About an hour's drive from the city, the international media thronged around the entrance of a neat prison warder's house to await the emergence of one of the century's most iconic figures. I had arrived late at the prison and wandered unnoticed into the prison grounds where my slate-blue cotton suit coincidentally blended in with the uniform color of the South African police. That might have had something to do with the fact that I was not challenged when I strode confidently into the prison grounds. But to this day I do not know. An unscheduled wait of an hour while Mandela consulted an anti-apartheid delegation including his wife Winnie, who had arrived an hour late, seemed like an eternity. When Mandela, flanked by Winnie, finally emerged walking down the driveway towards the prison premise gates, I lost all sense of time and self and strode towards Mandela to shake his hand and congratulate him on his freedom. He recognized me from the photograph that accompanied my regular column I had written for the Cape Times, where I often analyzed the successes and setbacks of the anti-apartheid movement and the African National Congress in exile. His face broke into a broad smile as we shook hands and he continued his historic walk to freedom. At the time, I was the southern Africa correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor which was for many years the only international news publication that Mandela was allowed to read in jail albeit in a vetted form with pages and sections frequently removed. On his first visit to the United States in 1990, Mandela broke from his official program on Sunday, June 24 to pay an unscheduled visit to the headquarters of the Monitor at One Norway Street in Boston to the astonishment of the editor and staff. (Today the Monitor is online only. The newspaper ceased daily publication in 2009.) South Africa since apartheid: Boom or bust? I received an incredulous call from my foreign editor, Jane Lampman, on that Sunday asking me if I could guess who was standing outside the building with two bodyguards asking to see the editor. It was, she said, Nelson Mandela. I was astonished too. Mandela was intrigued that the founder of the newspaper, Mary Baker Eddy, also founded a religion. Mandela came to respect the Monitor's sustained and fair coverage of South Africa during his time in jail. To this day, Mandela's weaknesses, his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that Mandela achieved in his own lifetime. But, the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized Mandela and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime. It augmented Mandela's greatness. Carrying on the work of Nelson Mandela . It is Mandela's achievement as a universal icon that has always fascinated me most. He first conquered his jailers by convincing them that they were the ones imprisoned by their own unsustainable policies based on fear and racial injustice. And then he negotiated them out of power with the sheer force of his moral authority and belief in himself. Mandela's example and actions in becoming the country's first black president struck a mortal blow to racism worldwide and helped build confidence and pave the way for Barack Obama to pull off a similar feat in the United States. If Mandela has a global heir in the ongoing campaign against racism and the quest for human dignity it has to be Barack Hussein Obama. The power of Mandela's leadership was rooted in the fact that at key moments in his life he acted independently of the movement to which he dedicated his life and to which he deferred as a ""loyal and obedient"" member. He did so when he decided in 1986 to begin negotiating with his jailers from behind bars not knowing where it would end. He did so in continuing to refer to former President F. W. de Klerk as a ""man of integrity"" long after it was less popular to do so in the ranks of the African National Congress. And he did so again when he went out on a limb within his own constituency after his release to support the overwhelmingly white South African rugby team in the World Cup in 1995. Mandela said that even if he wanted to he could not bind future generations to remember history in a particular way. The lesson of Mandela's life is that he has no need to bind anyone to his legacy nor does he need any organization to do so. His actions in his own lifetime are his legacy and they will remain indelibly etched in history for generations to come as a living example to inspire the leaders of tomorrow.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man who testified earlier that he shipped large amounts of the surgical anesthetic propofol to Dr. Conrad Murray in the weeks before Michael Jackson's death apparently moved out of the United States and cannot be located for this month's trial, prosecutors told the judge Thursday. The coroner ruled that Jackson died on June 25, 2009, as the result of an overdose of propofol combined with other drugs. The judge scheduled two additional hearings for next week to decide if the prosecution can use the missing witness' previous testimony and to get a head start on the last phase of jury selection in the involuntary manslaughter trial of the pop star's doctor. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said the hearings will help keep Murray's trial on track for face-to-face questioning of potential jurors September 23. Prosecutors want to use the previous testimony of Tim Lopez, given at Murray's preliminary hearing last January, because they've been unable to contact him since he moved to Thailand. Pastor said prosecutors must show Monday that they have done everything possible to reach Lopez. Lopez, the owner of a wholesale pharmacy in Las Vegas, testified that he shipped a total of 15 liters of propofol to Murray in the three months before Jackson's death. A hearing Monday morning will also consider the prosecution's request to exclude the testimony of Jackson's makeup artist. The defense wants Karen Faye to repeat statements given in interviews about what she described as Jackson's ill health in the weeks before his death, as he was rehearsing for his comeback concerts. The prosecution told the judge in a hearing Thursday that much of what Faye has said in the past is based on what she heard others say, not her own recollections. The judge will also consider if the defense can call a Texas medical examiner to testify about his inspection of the Los Angeles County coroner's facilities and practices. Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said Thursday that the man's testimony is not relevant to the Murray case. The judge again raised questions about the prosecution's plan to present testing done on university students in Chile who voluntarily swallowed propofol, the drug the coroner said was partly responsible for Jackson's death. They must overcome defense objections that the study was never published or reviewed by other scientists. The prosecution wants to argue that the experiments disprove the defense theory that Jackson died after he drank the drug, not from an injection given by Dr. Murray. Pastor also scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday afternoon to begin the process of deciding which potential jurors should be dismissed ""for cause."" Both sides will be able to challenge jurors based on their answers given to 113 questions posed to them in writing last week. Defense lawyer Nareg Gourjian said he received the defense copy of the 30-page questionnaire responses only Wednesday. Lawyers for both sides have only until next week to study the 145 jurors' answers to determine if the potential jurors can put aside biases and what they've heard about the singer's death to reach a fair verdict. Lawyers will question them about their answers when they return to court September 23. The attorneys are seeking 18 Los Angeles County residents qualified to sit in judgment of Murray. Prosecutors contend Murray, who served as Jackson's personal and full-time physician at the time, used a makeshift IV drip to administer propofol intended to help Jackson sleep, a practice they argue violated standards of care and led to the pop icon's death. If convicted on the involuntary manslaughter charge, Murray could face up to four years in prison. Opening statements for the trial, which will be televised, are scheduled for September 27. The judge told the jury pool he expects their service will be over on or about October 28.","The man who says he shipped propofol to Dr. Murray left the country, prosecutors say .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Police in Russia are investigating the murder of two women found under a slogan backing the female punk rock band Pussy Riot, apparently written in the victims' blood, officials said Thursday. The words ""Free Pussy Riot"" were scrawled in English on the apartment wall above the bodies of a 76-year-old woman and her 38-year-old daughter, investigators in Russia's Republic of Tatarstan said in a statement. The two women, who shared a home, are thought to have died of numerous stab wounds between August 24 and 26 in the city of Kazan, the Tatarstan investigative committee said. Their bodies were found Wednesday. An investigation has been launched to uncover the circumstances of the crime, as well as those responsible and their motive, the statement said. The murder inquiry comes two weeks after a court in Moscow sentenced three members of Pussy Riot to two years' imprisonment, a conviction and verdict that prompted international condemnation. The three women were found guilty of hooliganism for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals. Representatives of the jailed band members rejected the supposed link between Pussy Riot and the double murder in Kazan. ""I just found out about the incident in Kazan. Either it's a terrible provocation...Or psychiatry,"" Violetta Volkova, a lawyer for Pussy Riot, tweeted. Those responsible ""need to be found and punished,"" she said. Another lawyer for the band members, Nikolay Polozov, posted on Twitter: ""It's weird that the media mention 'supporters of Pussy Riot' while commenting on the murder in Kazan. Dear journalists, please wait for official statements from Investigative committee."" ""What happened in Kazan is terrible. Pussy Riot always supported peaceful protest,"" he added. Whether the suspect or suspects in the Kazan murder are truly supporters of Pussy Riot remains unclear. Two other members of the band fled Russia this week ""because of the danger,"" according to the husband of one of the three sent to prison. Public opinion in Russia is divided on the band, which specializes in provocative performances aimed at making political statements. Kazan, in western Russia, is one of the country's larger cities, with more than a million inhabitants. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyers for Pussy Riot condemn the murders, say the band backed peaceful protest .

"(CNN) -- U.S. coach Eddie O'Sullivan said he ""couldn't be more proud"" of his players after Thursday's hard-fought 13-6 victory over Russia at the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. It was the Eagles' first win of the tournament, after a 22-10 defeat to O'Sullivan's native Ireland on Sunday, with a superb 18th-minute try from scrumhalf Mike Petri after proving to be the difference between the two sides in wet conditions in New Plymouth. The Russians, making their World Cup debut, took an early 3-0 lead through a penalty from flyhalf Yury Kushnarev , but the U.S. rallied despite several misses from goalkicker Chris Wyles and the Bears were left with just a solitary bonus point to show for their efforts. ""It was a great victory for us,"" former Ireland coach O'Sullivan told the World Cup's official website. ""I thought it was a good match in these conditions. As a coach I couldn't have asked for more. I couldn't be more proud of these boys."" The Americans also beat Russia by a seven-point margin the last time they met, at the Churchill Cup in June, but U.S. captain Todd Clever said Nikolay Nerush's side were making impressive progress. ""I was very nervous at the end but they are a tough, tough team,"" the 28-year-old said. ""They are improving every time we play them and are getting better and better."" Russia's team director Kingsley Jones was satisfied his players were able to run the U.S. close, but the 42-year-old former Wales flanker bemoaned the mistakes made by the team.

"(CNN) -- Radiation levels in fish caught near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remain high long after the 2011 meltdowns there, suggesting contamination from the site might still be seeping into Pacific waters, a U.S. researcher reported Thursday. The ""vast majority"" of fish caught off Japan show no sign of radioactive contamination at levels dangerous to humans, even at the tighter limits Japan imposed after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, Ken Buesseler, a marine radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, wrote in this week's edition of the journal Science. But close to the plant, an ongoing high level of the reactor byproducts cesium-134 and cesium-137 ""implies that cesium is still being released to the food chain,"" he wrote. Nuclear plant operator admits downplaying risk . The sources are likely to be from radioactive particles released by the plant that settled into sediment on the sea floor or from groundwater seeping into the ocean from the plant, as operators continue to pour tons of water a day into the reactors to keep them cool. Researchers can't say definitely which is the more likely source, ""but we know both are happening,"" Buesseler told CNN. ""We can't say whether it's today's cooling water or from last April, but we continue to see cesium in the ocean, directly at the plant, is elevated,"" he said. But he added that those levels are ""not dangerously high -- I don't think we need to be alarmist about this."" The plant is no longer venting radioactive steam into the atmosphere, as it was at the height of the disaster. And the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has set up a system to absorb cesium from reactor coolant water. But not all that water is being recovered, Buesseler said. Mutant butterflies a result of nuclear disaster . Buesseler was one of the organizers of an international research expedition three months after the disaster. He studied Japanese government reports of cesium contamination in about 8,500 fish caught at different locations off northeastern Japan for his latest findings. The tsunami that hit Fukushima Daiichi after Japan's historic March 2011 earthquake knocked out power and coolant systems at the plant, resulting in meltdowns in three reactors. The result was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, as the crippled reactors spewed enormous amounts of radioactive particles into the environment. Most of the fallout from the plant was blown out to sea, where it was diluted in the vast Pacific. But while no deaths have been directly attributed to the accident, tens of thousands of people remain displaced from contaminated towns surrounding the plant. Radiation readings in the contaminated fish varied widely, with bottom-dwellers typically showing the highest results, Buesseler said. That suggests that contamination has settled over the seabed, where it will persist for decades -- cesium-137 takes 30 years to lose half its radioactivity, while cesium-134 has a radioactive half-life of only two years. Record radiation found in fish near Fukushima plant . Cesium accumulates in the muscle tissues of fish, which eventually process and excrete most of it. Since April, Japanese authorities have banned fish that show levels of both cesium isotopes higher than 100 becquerels per kilogram of wet weight. Most fish caught beyond the shores of Fukushima Prefecture, where the plant is located, test well below that limit. But levels between 1,000 and 10,000 Bq/kg have been found in fish caught off Fukushima. In one surprising result, two greenling -- a typically bottom-dwelling, near-shore fish -- tested above 25,000 Bq/kg in August, Buesseler found. Buesseler credited Japan's government for trying to protect the health of its people, noting, ""They certainly aren't hiding these numbers."" But he added, ""There's a lot of uncertainty in the Japanese public what to believe, who's telling the truth. And with radiation, there's a lot of alarmism and fear that goes with it."" Japanese nuclear plant operator admits playing down risk . The Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the Fukushima plant, said it is monitoring radiation contamination in fish and has not seen any meaningful change, but has implemented a series of preventative measures as a precaution.","U.S. scientist: Cesium levels in fish point to ongoing source of contamination .

"Spartanburg, South Carolina (CNN) -- The Republican candidates for president outlined their foreign policy and national security visions in a debate Saturday tackling issues that have largely taken a backseat in a presidential race shaped by the troubled economy. Moderators pressed the candidates on a range of topics during the 90-minute debate in South Carolina, including terrorism, Iran's nuclear capabilities, China, the war in Afghanistan, the so-called ""Arab Spring"" and foreign aid. The debate returned several times to the question of whether United States military and intelligence personnel should be allowed to waterboard suspected terrorists, a tactic banned by President Barack Obama shortly after he took office in 2009. The candidates were split on the matter. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, seeking to regain his footing after an embarrassing mental lapse during a debate earlier this week in Michigan, forcefully defended the practice. ""This is war,"" Perry said. ""That's what happens in war."" Former pizza executive Herman Cain said of waterboarding: ""I don't see that as torture. I see it as an enhanced interrogation technique."" And Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann called the tactic ""very effective"" and said Obama ""is allowing the ACLU to run the CIA."" But former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a former diplomat who has positioned himself as the only candidate in the race with serious foreign policy experience, disagreed. So did libertarian-leaning Texas Rep. Ron Paul. CNN Truth Squad: Fact checking the GOP debate . ""We diminish our standing in the world and the values that we project which include liberty, democracy, human rights and open markets when we torture,"" Huntsman said. ""We should not torture. Waterboarding is torture. We dilute ourselves down like a whole lot of other countries and we lose that ability to project values that a lot of people in corners of this world are still relying on the United States to stand up for."" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney did not address the matter during the debate held at Wofford College in Spartanburg and sponsored by the South Carolina Republican Party, CBS News and The National Journal. But Romney aides said after the forum that he does not believe waterboarding is torture. His adviser Eric Fehrnstrom would not say whether the practice would be used in a Romney administration, saying decisions about ""enhanced interrogation"" will be up to the president. ""He is not going to spell out what he would employ,"" Fehrnstrom told CNN. Romney embraced several hawkish positions and said military forces should be able to target and kill American citizens fighting alongside enemies overseas, even without a trial. Pakistan was also in the sights of several candidates. Five things we learned from Saturday's GOP debate . Perry harshly accused the Pakistani government and intelligence services of knowingly harboring terrorists and said the United States should stop sending billions of dollars in aid money to the country. He went further, saying financial aid to every country should be zeroed out and re-evaluated. That would go for Israel, too, Perry said -- though he clarified that Israel remains a staunch American ally and would continue to receive funding ""at some substantial level."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized Pakistan in harsh terms and agreed with Perry's proposal to vastly reduce the amount of federal money allocated for foreign governments. ""You ought to start off at zero and say, explain to me why I should give you a penny,"" Gingrich said. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, though, said the administration needs to engage Pakistan because it has nuclear weapons that could fall into the wrong hands under a different regime. ""So we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend,"" Santorum said. ""They must be our friend, and we must engage them as friends.""","Cain and Bachmann support waterboarding suspected terrorists .

"Demossville, Kentucky (CNN) -- The U.S. special operations teams that led the American invasion in Afghanistan a decade ago did something that no American military had done since the last century: ride horses into combat. ""It was like out of the Old Testament,"" says Lt. Col. Max Bowers, retired Green Beret, who commanded the three horseback teams. ""You expected Cecil B. DeMille to be filming and Charlton Heston to walk out."" Bowers spoke while sitting in the rural Kentucky studio of sculptor Douwe Blumberg, along with three of his former ""horse soldiers."" They, along with 30 fellow commandos on horseback, are the inspiration for a new monument that Blumberg is creating, dedicated to the entire U.S. special operations community. The statue is scheduled to be erected across from the World Trade Center site in New York on November 11, Veterans Day. The artist rounded up these ""horse soldiers"" to share their personal stories and mission photos as inspiration for the 18-foot, bronze monument. ""It was unbelievable in 2001,"" Master Sgt. Bart Decker says to Blumberg. Decker, the team's Air Force Special Operations combat controller, who is now retired, sports a Fu Manchu-style mustache. ""We all looked at each other [and said] 'We're witnessing a cavalry charge!' "" he said. Blumberg listens in awe to the elite fighters in his art studio. He says he felt compelled to sculpt the monument after then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld first held up a photo of these special operations forces on horseback in northern Afghanistan during a 2001 news conference. ""The image, I think, typifies the special operations mission of get the job done, however you have to do it, adapt, overcome,"" the artist tells Bowers and his fellow fighters. That image has also captured the imagination of Hollywood blockbuster producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who's making a movie based on the mission as told by Doug Stanton in his New York Times best-selling book, ""Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of U.S. Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in Afghanistan."" Blumberg learns that the inspirational photo was shot by one of the ""killer elite"" sitting casually in front of him in his art studio. The horse soldiers' stories . ""If we wanted to move, horses were the only way,"" said Master Sgt. Chris Spence, the team's communication sergeant, who serves with 5th Special Forces Group. ""Nobody will believe this! (So) I take my camera and (shoot) that photo."" Bowers points at that famous photo, explaining to Blumberg: ""The Afghans and intelligence officers (CIA) are clotted up in front together, and all our guys are spread out in a wedge behind them."" For most of the Americans, it was their first time on a horse. But, their mission was critical: synchronize tribal warfare against Taliban and al Qaeda enemies by riding with, and advising, rival Northern Alliance warlords. 5 voices on Afghanistan success . The artist touches a bridle and an Afghan saddle the team brought from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which are registered with the Smithsonian Museum. One of the nation's leading equestrian sculptors, Blumberg is fascinated with the little-known details of these special operators' horseback mission in the steep, mountain terrain of Northern Afghanistan. ""Were you worried about the footing of the horse?"" the sculptor asks the team. ""Absolutely,"" replies Decker, the Air Force combat controller. ""They were trying to scramble up the rocks, and their hooves, their shoes were sparking. You were worried about sliding off anytime, but you had to keep going."" In the male-dominated Afghan culture, all war horses are stallions; there were no mares. The team tells the artist the stallions were constantly biting, kicking and rearing. ""It was like riding a bobcat,"" Bowers says. ""That's another big reason we separated, especially at night, when we're walking on that ledge, because you put two horses together, all they wanted to do was fight. You look down at the left side, there's a 500-foot drop-off,"" Decker adds. ""It was a sheer cliff,"" explains Sgt. 1st Class Joe Jung, the team's Green Beret medic and sniper, who currently serves at U.S. Army Special Operations Command. ""If someone would have fallen off, we would not have known,"" Master Sgt. Chris Spence says. That almost happened to Jung. When his horse slid backward, he jumped off, and the horse landed on him. ""It was the first week. Winded up breaking my back,"" Jung says quietly. The sculptor's eyes are wide; his hand rubs his chin. ""So, you rode the rest of the mission with a broken back?"" Blumberg asks. ""Correct,"" Jung answers, ""Two shots of morphine to relieve the pain, and get back on the horse. I would not allow myself to be the weak link. It's not in my nature, and it's not in any Green Beret's nature."" Jung and the others were each handpicked for this special operation by Bowers, who carried a piece of the World Trade Center during their entire mission advising the rival Northern Alliance warlords. ""There were suspicions about our motives,"" Bowers says to the artist. ""I pulled the bent piece of steel out and showed it to them [and said,] 'This is why we're here: We simply want to ensure that it's not a sanctuary for terrorist forces that have attacked the United States.' "" Blumberg looks through the men's photos of the aftermath of a major battle in Mazar-e Sharif showing bodies and rubble from Air Force bombs. He realizes at that point just how tough the special operations forces' mission was, right after the September 11 attacks. Afghan man reflects on war, 10 years later . The battlefield is far removed from his studio, littered not with the carnage of war but with the dust and scraps from his sculpture. After that Mazar-e Sharif battle, as Green Beret medic Jung was treating wounded prisoners at a prison camp, he recalls hearing an odd voice nearby. ""The accent was not there. Something just didn't sound right, it just didn't add up,"" he says. He got up and told the American intelligence agents who were questioning other prisoners. A linguistics specialist came over to help Jung treat another patient. ""He was listening to the conversation [and] immediately scooped him up,"" Jung recalls. ""It turned out to be Walker."" It was John Walker Lindh, the so-called American Taliban from California. Blumberg sits forward in his chair. To him, the idea that an American was fighting alongside the men who helped carry out the 9/11 attacks is unthinkable. Months later, after the Taliban regime had fallen, the special operations teams chose Mazar-e Sharif -- the site of one of their fiercest battles and where CIA officer Mike Spann became the first American killed in action in Afghanistan -- to bury the piece of the World Trade Center that Bowers had carried their entire mission. ""We took this piece of steel, put it in a body bag, folded American colors over it as when we lay our heroes to rest at Arlington,"" Bowers explains to Blumberg. ""We thought that this piece of the World Trade Center [should] be buried in a spot that was full of al Qaeda terrorists and memorialized."" The monument takes shape . Ten years later, these horse soldiers' stories will be memorialized in Blumberg's monument across from the World Trade Center site. It will be unveiled during the November 11 Veterans Day parade, with the help of New York City firefighters, police officers, other emergency responders and Port Authority members. ""It will pay tribute to all U.S. special operations forces,"" Blumberg tells the team. ""It will give New Yorkers an opportunity to honor the veterans who, worldwide, acted as New York's 'second responders' directly after the attack."" Members of Wall Street banking firms, who were personally affected by the attack at the World Trade Center, commissioned the artist. They ask to remain anonymous, so the focus stays on the meaning of the monument. ""They are an ad hoc group of grateful Wall Street bankers who personally survived and lost friends and many associates in the 9/11 attacks,"" Blumberg says. ""They, and their community surrounding the World Trade Center, were permanently affected by the event. No public funds are being used."" In a Manhattan office, two of those individual supporters are helping organize this at a grass-roots level. They say that after the attacks, and the years of war that followed, their families and friends across the country asked them: Where could they go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who are trying to tackle potential terrorist threats, every day? ""We wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches, because every day since 9/11, we've had to look at that hole in the ground,"" one of the private backers says. A piece of World Trade Center steel may be embedded in the monument's base. The statue will be installed on private property, owned by a supportive firm, close to ground zero. Back in Kentucky, Blumberg asks the horse soldiers assembled in his studio if they are concerned about whether anti-military groups, or detractors, will criticize the monument as glamorizing warfare. ""It's just not about the soldiers that have fallen, it's about those that were in the towers, those that were on Flight 93, and the Pentagon; the children that lost their mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters,"" medic Jung tells the sculptor. ""What everyone needs to know is: There are people out there like this team, like the Green Berets, that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them."" Spence, the communications sergeant who shot the photo that originally compelled the artist, agrees. ""These are the guys that have your back. These are the guys that are now watching an eternal vigil over ground zero. The falling of these towers launched us off on horseback. Now, we're watching over you, and we have your back. That's what this statue is symbolizing.""","U.S. special operations forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001 on horseback .

Anas al Libi was seized by American commandos in Tripoli, then transferred to a Navy vessel in the Mediterranean Sea. Along with other accused terrorists, he had been charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy to kill Americans and embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He is expected to be transferred from military to civilian custody in coming days or weeks to face prosecution in federal court. Separately on Friday, Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan condemned al Libi's capture, calling it a ""kidnapping."" He said Libyan officials are in touch with the U.S. government to try to ensure that al Libi's rights are respected and that he ""be tried in a just way."" David Patton of the Federal Public Defenders Office in New York asked a judge on Thursday to allow his office to represent al Libi's legal interests immediately even though he is not in the United States. The Justice Department opposed the motion, saying counsel cannot be appointed until the defendant officially appears in federal court. The Obama administration activated the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, a team made up of FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies, to interview al Libi for intelligence purposes while he remains in U.S. military custody, according to U.S. officials. He is not yet in federal or civilian custody where the rules for treating criminal suspects are different. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who has been overseeing the broader judicial cases involving the bombing suspects, said counsel could not be appointed until al Libi actually is brought to the United States and is presented in court. Until then, the judge agreed with the government that al Libi is technically not under ""criminal arrest."" ""There is no proper basis on which the court could conclude that the obligation to produce the defendant before it in this criminal case has come into existence. The decision whether to proceed with a criminal prosecution of this indictment in the first instance, at least, is an Executive Branch function. It remains to be seen whether such prosecution will go forward."" The court order may be modified if and when al Libi is transferred to American soil. Federal public defenders are employed by the judiciary and provide legal representation to some indigent defendants.

"(CNN) -- Heads bowed, solemn, they filed by. The rich, the powerful. The famous and the family. All of them bidding goodbye to anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela on Wednesday, the first of three days his body will lie in state at the seat of South Africa's government. First was South African President Jacob Zuma. Then came Mandela's widow, GraÃ§a Machel, and former wife Winnie Mandela, both wearing black turbans. In near silence, dozens of family members passed by as military honor guards dressed in white flanked the coffin on each end. There were others in Pretoria, too. Former South African leaders Thabo Mbeki and F.W. de Klerk, the country's last apartheid-era president and Nobel Peace Prize winner. U2's Bono also paused for a moment before moving on. So did Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. The first several hours was reserved for family and dignitaries, but the public was to be allowed to file past his casket later Wednesday, as well as on Thursday and Friday. Viewing hours were expected to be limited to daylight. Long lines are expected to form early in the morning. On Saturday, a military aircraft is to take Mandela's remains from a Pretoria airbase to Mthatha, the main town in the province of Eastern Cape. Thousands of mourners are expected to line the streets leading from Mthatha airport to watch as the military moves Mandela's casket on a gun carriage to the remote village of Qunu, where the former leader spent his childhood. Historic venue . The hearse carrying the casket of the former South African leader, who died last week at 95, arrived early Wednesday. It weaved through streets lined with people in Pretoria, the capital, on its way to the Union Buildings. The somber mood Wednesday was a sharp change from the celebratory atmosphere at a memorial event on Tuesday, in Johannesburg. ""This is a very poignant moment,"" Khehla Shubane, who served time in prison with Mandela. ""This is not the Mandela who was in control of things that were happening around him, inspiring people. This is a Mandela who's in death now."" As the body arrived, an honor guard stood at attention and a hushed crowd looked on as eight military officers, led by a chaplain, carried the coffin inside. Police helicopters hovered overhead. A South African flag hung outside at half staff. Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, and Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula led a group of mourners wearing black who walked behind the coffin. Mandela's casket was placed under a dome, close to where, in 1994, he had taken the oath of office to become South Africa's first democratically elected president. On that day, crowds converged around the building to witness history being made. Mandela, a former political prisoner, became South Africa's first post-apartheid black leader. World leaders gather . The commemorative events have taken on an epic scale. Tuesday's memorial was billed as one of the largest gatherings of global leaders in recent history. From U.S. President Barack Obama to Cuban President Raul Castro, praise for the statesman came from all sides in a four-hour memorial service at Johannesburg FNB stadium. ""We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again,"" Obama said to cheers. ""To the people of South Africa -- people of every race and every walk of life -- the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us,"" he added, calling him a ""giant of history."" Rain poured throughout the service, but did little to dampen the mood. Inside the stadium, the atmosphere was celebratory, with people dancing and singing songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. Posters bearing Mandela's likeness hung around them. It was there that, 23 years earlier, Mandela had delivered his first speech after he was released from prison, hailed by supporters as the hope of a new South Africa.

"(CNN) -- This week marks the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Across Israel, families build primitive structures with branches or palm fronds as roofs. They do so to remember the biblical exodus from Egypt and 40 years of exile in the Sinai Desert. It is a celebration of survival. Despite a raging war in neighboring Syria and a confrontation between the military and Islamists in Egypt, Sukkot finds Israelis in an upbeat mood. Ben Gurion Airport is packed with vacationers, the shekel is strong, and economic growth this year is expected to be close to 4%. As they recall their ancestors' wandering in the desert, Israeli Jews feel surprisingly secure. In a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute this month, 74% expected their security situation to remain the same or improve over the next year. Israel's leaders are less sanguine, but not because Syrian President Bashar al-Assad might lash out against the Jewish state. They are much more apprehensive about a new Iranian president bearing gifts at the United Nations General Assembly. Hassan Rouhani, elected in June to succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has already extended an olive branch. He has released ""prisoners of conscience"" and told NBC that Iran would not ""seek any weapons of mass destruction"" under any circumstances. Now, the diplomatic corridors are abuzz with speculation that Rouhani will make a dramatic announcement at the U.N. General Assembly, perhaps offering to close the Fordow enrichment plant or allow inspectors into the Parchin site for the first time. Rouhani is expected to meet ministers of most if not all the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Iran's Rouhani: Diplomat's touch, no pushover . Gary Sick, executive director of the Gulf/2000 Project at Columbia University, said this week in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations that the Iranians ""are tough bargainers, they have real principles, and they're going to insist on them, but they're going to put those principles out in a much more attractive way than the previous administration did."" Sick is among those arguing for a new dialogue between the United States and Iran, as is The New York Times, where Bill Keller wrote that Iran was an indispensable partner in resolving Syria's crisis. And that's what worries Israel. It sees Rouhani, who once led Iran's nuclear negotiating team, as an able tactician. Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz put it most colorfully, saying Rouhani would ""smile all the way to the bomb."" He is ""a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Steinitz says. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has very publicly reiterated that the Islamic Republic must stop enriching uranium, get rid of the enriched uranium it currently has, close the facility in Qom and stop its program to develop a plutonium ""track."" ""Until all these measures are taken, the pressure on Iran should be increased and not relieved, certainly not eased,"" Netanyahu said. In short, the message to Tehran should be: ""If you want to save the Iranian economy, give up your nuclear program."" There is no third way. President Rouhani says Iran won't develop nuclear weapons . Israeli officials are worried that the United States and Europe, in an effort to encourage Iranian moderation, will begin to relax the devastating financial, shipping and oil sanctions built up against Iran, and allow more time to coax the Iranians toward agreement in the long-running ""P5 + 1"" talks. That would be a fatal mistake, in the Israelis' view, allowing Iran to run the last lap toward building a bomb. The Israeli media have seized on remarks by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who this week said cryptically: ""Heroic flexibility is very useful and necessary sometimes but with adherence to one main condition. ... A wrestler sometimes shows flexibility for technical reasons. But he does not forget about his opponent nor about his main objective."" Columnist Smadar Peri in Yedioth Ahronoth wrote that Khamenei's remarks could suggest a change in Iranian policy but equally might also indicate ""a trick in the spirit of the Persian bazaar. First you have to smile, calm the customer on the other side, and then produce the goods without revealing the final price."" While U.S. officials and analysts are divided about Iran's ultimate intentions and debate when the capability to build a nuclear device might become a program to do so, Israelis in and out of government have no doubt about Iran's objective: a ""critical capability,"" or the ability to produce sufficient weapon-grade uranium from its stocks of low-enriched uranium for a nuclear explosive without being detected. The term was used by the Institute for Science and International Security in July when it estimated Iran could achieve this critical capability in mid-2014, given the rapid increase in the number of centrifuges at the Natanz and Fordow sites. It is an assessment the Israelis endorse. In a CNN interview, Intelligence Minister Steinitz said that Iran's nuclear program was many times larger than North Korea's and that only a credible threat of military force and serious deadlines would deter the Iranians. He drew a parallel with Syria: Only when President Obama declared that the Assad regime had crossed a red line and that military action would follow did the Syrians blink. Israeli officials were disappointed -- to put it mildly -- when Obama decided to seek congressional authorization for military strikes. And they were horrified when it appeared that Congress, under the influence of overwhelming public opposition to another foreign engagement, seemed unlikely to grant that authorization. What a message to send to Iran. Iran's president calls for 'constructive' dialogue, end to 'unhealthy' rivalries . The immediate response among officials and commentators in Israel was to invoke the Jewish sage Hillel: ""If I am not for myself, who will be for me?"" So the Russian-U.S. deal to strip Syria of its chemical weapons came as a relief in Jerusalem. As one Israeli analyst put it, ""It's a win-win-win-win."" The Russians re-established themselves as diplomatic heavyweights, Obama was spared humiliation, al-Assad avoided a shower of cruise missiles. And Israel could at least hope that the Syrian chemical arsenal would be incinerated rather than be used in desperation by a sinking regime or fall into the hands of Hezbollah. That is ""hope"" rather than ""expect."" Most Israeli analysts are deeply skeptical that al-Assad will give up all his chemical weapons. Syria developed the weapons in response to Israel's growing military superiority and its nuclear deterrent. Ely Karmon of the Institute for Counter-Terrorism at The Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya says chemical weapons are also al-Assad's insurance policy, his ultimate deterrent in protecting the Alawite minority. In common with many Israeli analysts, Karmon believes the timetable for the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is unrealistic. He told CNN that the process would take three to four years and would require a cease-fire to be effective, and there would be ample opportunity for obstruction and evasion. The Israeli government wants the threat of military action against Syria to be simmering on the front burner. It's the only language that al-Assad understands, they say, just as it's the only language Khamenei and Rouhani understand. In many ways, the winds of change across the Arab world are blowing favorably for Israel, even if they could change direction without warning. The Egyptian military is hurting Hamas in the Gaza Strip by closing many of the tunnels that it relies on for trade and weapons. And the Palestinians have submitted to yet another attempt to reach a two-state solution (one that's going nowhere, Palestinian sources say). Two once-mighty Arab armies, the Syrian and Iraqi, are debilitated. The Israeli intelligence community is confident that it will detect any Syrian effort to transfer chemical weapons to Hezbollah, and Hezbollah risks losing one of its main patrons in al-Assad (though its fighters are gaining valuable experience helping him). The Israelis appear confident of being able to contain Sunni extremists should they emerge as a force in a post-Assad Syria. Until now, Israeli policy has been to say little and hope al-Assad's forces and the rebels cancel each other out. But Michael Oren, Israeli ambassador to the U.S., suggested this week that al-Assad is the worse of two evils. ""We always preferred the bad guys who weren't backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran,"" he told the Jerusalem Post. ""The greatest danger to Israel is the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut,"" he added. In Israel, so much of the regional picture is seen through the prism of Iran. So it's not the Arabs that most worry Israel at the moment. It's the Persian bazaar, described a long time ago by an American diplomat as a ""mindset that often ignores longer-term interests in favor of immediately obtainable advantages, and countenances practices that are regarded as unethical by other norms."" Israel worries that its allies will be overly enthusiastic buyers.","In Israel, the shekel's strong, the economy's growing, and Israeli Jews feel surprisingly secure .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain stepped up his rhetoric against his Democratic rival on taxes in his weekly radio address Saturday, comparing his plan to ""socialist"" programs. The remarks were part of a theme McCain has used since the final presidential debate, but his most recent comments were the first time he used the word to describe Sen. Barack Obama. In the radio address, McCain didn't directly call Obama a socialist, but he let the now-famous Joe ""the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher nearly do it for him. ""You see, [Obama] believes in redistributing wealth, not in policies that help us all make more of it. Joe, in his plainspoken way, said this sounded a lot like socialism,"" McCain said Saturday.  Watch McCain blast Obama » . In an interview with ABC last week, Wurzelbacher said Obama's proposal to raise taxes by 3 percent on those making $250,000 and over is a ""very socialist view."" Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has used the word in speeches the past two days as well.  Watch more on the state of the presidential race » . McCain also said in his radio address, ""At least in Europe, the socialist leaders who so admire my opponent are up front about their objectives. They use real numbers and honest language. And we should demand equal candor from Sen. Obama. Raising taxes on some in order to give checks to others is not a tax cut; it's just another government giveaway."" On the campaign trail Saturday in Concord, North Carolina, he added that Americans have seen sharing the wealth in other countries before. But he quoted Obama as saying he wants to ""spread the wealth around."" Fact Check: Did Obama say he would ""spread the wealth around""? ""Spread the wealth around. We have seen that movie before in other countries and attempts by the liberal left before,"" McCain said. In his speech, McCain also said, ""This explains some big problems with my opponent's claim that he will cut income taxes for 95 percent of Americans. You might ask, how do you cut income taxes for 90 percent of Americans when more than 40 percent pay no income taxes right now? ""How do you reduce the number zero? That's the key to Barack Obama's whole plan: Since you can't reduce taxes on those who pay zero, the government will write them all checks called a tax credit. And the Treasury will have to cover those checks by taxing other people. ... The Obama tax increase would come at the worst possible time for America."" Asked why McCain used the word ""socialist"" in the radio remarks, a spokesman said, ""That's what it is. 'Spreading the wealth' around is socialism."" In a July interview with the Kansas City Star, McCain said Obama had the ""most extreme"" record in the Senate. He said in a comment he has since repeated on the trail, ""his voting record ... is more to the left than the announced socialist in the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont."" Pressed on whether he considered Obama a socialist, McCain shrugged and said, ""I don't know."" Obama hit back against the McCain campaign's accusations Saturday in Missouri and said the Republican nominee was ignoring the needs of America's middle class. ""John McCain is so out of touch with the struggles you are facing that he must be the first politician in history to call a tax cut for working people 'welfare,' "" Obama told a massive crowd under the famous St. Louis arch. ""The only 'welfare' in this campaign is John McCain's plan to give another $200 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest corporations in America.""  Watch large crowds rally for Obama » . ""George Bush and John McCain are out of ideas, they are out of touch, and if you stand with me, in 17 days they'll be out of time,"" Obama added to wild applause. The Obama campaign said police in St. Louis estimated the crowd size at 100,000 people.  Watch large crowds rally for Obama » . In remarks this week, Palin referred to Obama's encounter with ""Joe the Plumber"" in Ohio on Sunday. At a rally Friday in West Chester, Ohio, where one banner in the crowd read, ""Obama is a Socialist/Marxist,"" Palin said, ""Joe suggested that that sounded a little bit like socialism. Whatever you call it, I call it bad medicine for an ailing economy, and it's what Barack Obama will do to those who want to create jobs, and we're willing to call Barack Obama on it."" Palin invoked Wurzelbacher again Saturday, needling Obama for having a ""staged photo-op"" interrupted by a voter asking him a question about taxes. ""So when he left Joe's neighborhood in Toledo, our opponent didn't look real happy,"" Palin, speaking in Pennsylvania, said of Obama. ""Seems that the staged photo-op there got ruined by a real person's question."" ""So here's a guy working -- standing there in his neighborhood when a candidate for president shows up, and he wanted more than just a handshake and a campaign button. He wanted some answers."" A similar thing happened to Palin on September 27 in Philadelphia at one of her own photo-ops. Temple graduate student Michael Rovito approached the governor at a cheesesteak shop to ask her opinions on cross-border raids into Pakistan to hunt terrorists. Palin told Rovito that the United States should ""absolutely"" attack within Pakistan to stop terrorists, a position at odds with McCain's. The remark was picked up by a network camera crew and caused a headache for the GOP ticket. Staffers were forced to explain the two candidates' apparently conflicting views on national television days later. Palin arrived in New York on Saturday afternoon and headed to NBC headquarters at Rockefeller Center for rehearsals before making her much-anticipated debut on ""Saturday Night Live.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- ""A force"" has been mobilized by the Libyan government to ""seize"" a North Korean-flagged ship that's been docked for days in a rebel-held port, despite a threat by Libya's leader that it might be bombed. Two Libyan ministers told reporters Sunday that the ""force"" consists of ""qualified"" naval officers and ""revolutionaries,"" or former rebels now being paid by the government. It has authorization ""to stop, seize or even strike (the oil tanker) with force if it does not comply with the orders issued for it,"" said Culture Minister Habibi al-Amin. ""The aim is to receive this tanker, according to the law, without causing any casualties or damage,"" said Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani, calling on those involved to surrender. ""We hope this happens."" The vessel, dubbed Morning Glory, docked late Friday night in the oil port of As-Sidra. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said Saturday that the ship's captain subsequently was warned by phone to comply with government orders or face the consequences. The captain responded that local militia onboard did not allow them to depart. Zeidan threatened to bomb the oil tanker if it didn't comply with Libya's request. On Sunday, al-Amin echoed the prime minister's concerns that a bombing could cause a large oil spill and said the ""force"" focused on the issue ""realizes the sensitivity of the situation and the risks."" ""They are dealing with (this) in kind of a surgical method,"" said the cultural minister, noting that one option may be to lead the tanker to an area where more Libyan government forces can safely seize it. The U.S. State Department weighed in Sunday, with spokeswoman Jen Psaki expressing concern about Morning Glory ""loading a cargo of illicitly obtained oil."" ""This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people,"" Psaki said. The situation speaks to the unsettled situation in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. In this case, the issue centers around the oil-rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular, Ibrahim Jadran. The militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports. But last July, Jadran and his men seized them, blocking oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region. Meet the man holding Libya's oil hostage . ""We used to be part of that government until the corruption became so visible, and the government started to sell oil without measuring units, and after we became certain that such a government is not credible and unable to rebuild the state,"" Jadran, 32, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January. ""That's why we declared independence of our province and we started to seek our fair rights."" There is a lot at stake, given the Libyan government's precarious state and the wealth of natural resources in the country. Libya is thought to have Africa's largest proven oil reserves. The country produced 1.6 million barrels per day after the revolution only to have that output slow to a relative trickle of fewer than 200,000 barrels per day by the end of last year. The government has said the disrupted oil production, from the seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities, is costing the country $130 million a day. The oil at the center of the current As-Sidra situation belongs to Libya's National Oil Corporation and its partners, which Psaki from the State Department notes includes U.S. companies. ""Any oil sales without authorization from these parties places purchasers at risk of exposure to civil liability, penalties and other possible sanctions,"" Psaki said. The threat of force against the North Korean-flagged vessel isn't the first time Libya's government has threatened force against ships that enter the eastern oil ports. On several occasions, authorities have issued ultimatums to such ships, only to have those deadlines come and go with no action. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reported from Libya and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: A U.S. official says the illicit loading oil ""amounts to theft from the Libyan people""

"Washington (CNN) -- One of the most divisive issues in politics is set to take center stage in Congress on Thursday as the House of Representatives votes on a measure banning abortions based on the sex of a fetus. Supporters characterize the proposal as a necessary defense of the civil rights of unborn children; opponents consider it part of a broader so-called ""war on women"" and an ongoing assault on legalized abortion. The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act would impose possible fines and prison sentences up to five years on doctors who knowingly perform abortions chosen on grounds based on sex. Abortion providers could also be subject to civil penalties, including punitive monetary damages, under certain circumstances. Gallup poll: 'Pro-choice' at a record low . There is ""evidence that the practice of sex selection abortion is demonstrably increasing here in the United States, especially but not exclusively in the Asian immigrant community,"" Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks, the bill's main sponsor, said Wednesday on the House floor. ""I refuse to believe that we cannot find enough humanity in this body to conclude together that it is wrong to knowingly kill unborn children because they are baby girls instead of baby boys."" It is ""hypocrisy to say that one is pro-woman and that it's OK to end the life of an unborn child just because of its gender,"" argued Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee. ""Since when did America subscribe to the idea that males are worth more than females? ... It's sick, it's discriminatory, it's sexist and it is blatantly anti-woman and anti-human."" Women's rights: Nuns' fight with Vatican highlights Catholicism's global struggle . Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, declared, ""Today the three most dangerous words in China and India are: It's a girl. We can't let that happen here."" Supporters of the measure cited multiple studies to back claims of a growing pattern of abortions based on the sex of the fetus. Opponents, however, took issue with certain interpretations of the studies and warned of negative ramifications for women's health if the bill becomes law. Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said the bill ""tramples (on) the rights of women under the guise of nondiscrimination, while doing absolutely nothing to provide women with needed resources for their babies, female and male."" Citing opposition to the bill from groups such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Conyers said, ""If this measure is passed into law, we will then require that medical and mental health professionals violate ... doctor-patient confidentiality"" and report suspected violations to law enforcement authorities. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, said the bill's backers were ""exploiting serious issues like racism and sexism (as part of) a backdoor attempt to make abortion illegal."" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said nobody he has talked to favors abortion based on sex preferences, and the proposal was brought up simply ""because somebody decided politically it was a difficult place to put people in."" Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, called the debate over the bill ""yet another distraction and yet another day that this Republican majority fails to act on job creation."" Asked why the Republican-controlled House is taking up an abortion bill at a time when GOP leaders have called economic recovery their top concern, a spokesman for Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the party's priorities had not changed. Planned Parenthood's new ad zeroes in on Romney . ""House Republicans are focused on the American people's top priorities: jobs and the economy,"" spokesman Michael Steel said. ""Dealing with a bill to prevent sex-selective abortion ... doesn't change that."" The bill is being considered under an expedited legislative process that requires a two-thirds vote of approval for passage. While Republicans wouldn't say why they were intentionally setting up a higher hurdle for House approval, the procedure avoids an extended argument over a divisive social issue with the potential to sidetrack the economic debate. Franks' bill is coming to a vote at a time when abortion, a perennial hot button topic, has re-emerged as a political focal point. The anti-abortion rights group Live Action released an undercover sting video this week showing a Planned Parenthood staffer offering advice to a woman involved in the sting on how best to proceed with an abortion if her fetus is female. Franks and several other House Republicans are scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday morning with the head of Live Action to ""address the growing trend of the abortion industry targeting baby girls in the United States,"" according to a news release from Live Action. A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, which provides a range of medical services for women, responded to the video's release with a statement noting that the staff member in question lost her job because she failed to follow proper procedures for the organization. ""Planned Parenthood opposes racism and sexism in all forms, and we work to advance equity and human rights in the delivery of health care,"" said spokeswoman Leslie Kantor. ""Planned Parenthood condemns sex selection motivated by gender bias, and urges leaders to challenge the underlying conditions that lead to these beliefs and practices."" Planned Parenthood's leadership jumped into the presidential contest on Wednesday, unveiling a roughly $1.5 million ad campaign targeting presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The ad, which claims Romney would deny women critical medical services, is set to run in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, and Virginia.

"(CNN) -- Standing near the coffin of one of her closest friends, Patty Hill made a promise that would forever change her life. Patty Hill says losing 135 pounds through weight loss surgery  still took discipline, planning and hard work. Her friend, Gail, had died from a blood clot just a week after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to make her stomach smaller. Hill was scheduled to have the same surgery and believed it was the only way to end her lifelong struggle with obesity. Tipping the scales at 280 pounds and standing 5 feet 5 inches tall, Hill says she was depressed, moody and always defensive. The 47-year-old mother from Weymouth, Massachusetts, was morbidly obese, and after her friend's death, she was beginning to lose hope. ""That was the end of the gastric bypass for me,"" remembers Hill. ""At her wake, I promised everyone that I would not go ahead with surgery."" Hill wore a 26/28 dress size and had heart problems. Now, not only was she afraid that she couldn't lose the weight, but she was even more afraid she'd die, leaving her daughters, ages 23 and 14, to grow up without her. Just when she'd lost all hope, her cardiologist asked if she had ever considered Lap-Banding -- a less-invasive form of weight-loss surgery. Hill immediately started researching the procedure, in which an adjustable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to restrict the amount of food the stomach will hold. According to MayoClinic.com, the band creates a small pouch opening to the stomach. The amount of food your stomach will hold is controlled by injecting or removing fluid from the band. Even though gastric banding restricts the amount of food, it does not reduce the absorption of calories or nutrients. In the United States, where two-thirds of the population is either overweight or obese, weight-loss surgeries have increased in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the surgeries are successful at helping people lose weight and reduce their risk for hypertension, diabetes and other chronic illnesses -- patients have to carefully weigh the benefits of the procedure with the serious risks, side effects and even death in some cases. Some of the more common side effects of weight-loss surgery can be difficulty digesting starchy foods and protein, which can lead to other physical conditions including hair loss, fatigue, swelling and muscle weakness.   Once she did her homework on gastric banding, Hill says she knew the procedure was for her. She sought treatment at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The program required six weeks of pre-operation behavior-modification classes and monthly support meetings. On February 28, 2005, Hill's Lap-Band surgery was a success. She immediately started losing weight, dropping 20 pounds the first month, and continued to lose 10 to 15 pounds a month. Six months later, at the end of August, she had dropped 75 pounds. As the second anniversary -- or ""Bandiversary"" -- of her surgery approached, Hill had lost 130 pounds and reached her original target weight of 150 pounds.  CNN I-Reporters share their weight-loss photos » . That's when she began exercising and keeping track of her daily food intake via the Web site FitDay.com. ""You don't realize how many calories you're taking in until you start keeping track,"" said Hill. Ultimately, Hill surpassed her original weight loss goal and lost another 10 pounds. She currently weighs 145 pounds and, after dropping 10 dress sizes, now fits perfectly into a size 8, she says. Despite the rapid weight loss, surgery wasn't an easy way out. Hill says she still has to plan her meals and eat properly, and one of the biggest downsides is that she has difficulty digesting some starchy foods. ""I can't eat bread, potatoes, rice,"" says Hill. ""I have to cut up everything into pencil eraser-size [pieces] and chew, chew, chew."" Still, the surgery has restored her life, Hill says. One of the biggest perks of losing weight is traveling with greater ease. She doesn't have to ask for a seat belt extender and no longer feels like she's spilling into her neighbor's seat. ""I went to Cancun last July, and I was able to go horseback riding without hurting the horse,"" jokes Hill. She's also discovered something else. ""I'm actually petite,"" Hill says excitedly. ""I can buy stylish clothes. Before surgery, I just bought clothes that fit me. Now I can buy clothes that look good on me."" When she's shopping, Hill says, people make eye contact with her more often and wait on her right away. When she was obese, Hill says, she felt almost invisible, and even though she didn't want to believe it, people ignored her. ""Men actually flirt with me; it cracks me up, but freaks out my daughters,"" says Hill. ""I have a boyfriend with a Harley. I love riding on the back of [his bike]."" The weight loss has also inspired Hill to take acting classes, and she's even appeared as an extra in several movies. Earlier this year, she attended her first Boston Red Sox game and was elated to discover that she could fit into the seats. Best of all, Hill says, she has a lot more energy and self-confidence, and she's healthier. She says the surgery is the best thing she's done for herself. ""I am so happy with the way I look and feel,"" says Hill, ""I never want to go back to the way I looked before. It sounds very superficial, but it's the truth.""  iReport.com: Have you lost weight?

"Washington (CNN) -- Lawyers for State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed an appeal Friday with the Mississippi Supreme Court to overturn last week's judicial decision rejecting McDaniel's challenge to the state's June 24 GOP primary runoff, which was won by incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran. Judge Hollis McGehee ruled on August 29 that McDaniel waited too long to file his challenge with the state Republican Party. McDaniel filed the challenge 41 days after the election; McGehee said that under state law the challenge had to be filed within 20 days. McDaniel, who received strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups, narrowly defeated Cochran in Mississippi's June 3 Republican primary. Neither candidate, however, cracked the 50% threshold needed to win, forcing a runoff three weeks later that Cochran won by slightly over 7,000 votes. Cochran's victory was apparently aided by crossover votes from African-Americans, a largely Democratic bloc actively courted by Cochran's campaign and allied groups. McDaniel's campaign said there was evidence of election fraud. McDaniel's supporters argued, among other things, that African-American Democrats improperly voted in the Republican runoff after participating in the Democratic primary. Cochran's campaign attributed the unusually high levels of support from African-Americans to four decades of the senator's relationship-building in the state. Cochran is the overwhelming favorite to win the November election. It would be his seventh term in the U.S. Senate.","Lawyers for state Sen.

"(CNN) -- A friendly fire incident that killed six soldiers in Afghanistan, including five Americans, was a result of botched communication and a series of other errors, the Pentagon said. The June 9 bombing in Zabul province is among the deadliest friendly fire incidents in the 13-year war. It also left one Afghan soldier dead. What started as a battle with insurgents on a hillside descended into a tragedy after failures in equipment and communication protocol, according to a Pentagon report released Thursday. Teams involved did not follow established procedures, and one radio had no batteries, while another had a broken talk button, according to the report. 'A challenging set of circumstances' In addition, soldiers didn't relay their position correctly, and a supersonic strategic bomber wrongfully relied on a sensor to detect soldiers. ""Though this was a challenging set of circumstances, had the team executed standard tactics, techniques and procedures, and communicated effectively, this tragic incident was avoidable,"" Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian said in the report. The 300-page report by U.S. Central Command was partially redacted before its release under the Freedom of Information Act. ""The key members executing the close air-support mission collectively failed to effectively execute the fundamentals, which resulted in poor situational awareness and improper target identification,"" Harrigian said. At the time, U.S. and Afghan forces were using a supersonic strategic bomber to target insurgents and ensure security at polling places five days before the June 14 presidential runoff election. Bomber mistakes soldiers for enemy . To tackle fire better from insurgents, a team on the ground split up at the request of Staff Sgt. Jason A. McDonald, the report said. ""Communication degradation due to terrain"" made it difficult for McDonald to tell the crew of a B1-B Lancer in the area that the team had split up and moved to higher ground. McDonald could not contact the team moving to the hillside because one member had a radio that was out of batteries and the other carried one with a broken ""push-to-talk"" function. McDonald then sent Spc. Justin R. Helton up the hill to act as a verbal communications link. Meanwhile, at 12,000 feet, a pilot flying the B1-B Lancer scanned the area with night-vision goggles, looking for infrared strobes worn by soldiers to broadcast their presence. All the pilot saw were occasional muzzle flashes, which he thought were from the enemy, the report said. Sensors on the B1-B don't detect infrared strobes, and the night-vision goggles the pilot used are not designed to see infrared strobes at an altitude higher than 7,000 feet. The bomber did not have permission to fly under 12,000 feet because of the presence of U.S. drone aircraft at lower altitudes. About 7:30 p.m. on June 9, the B1-B dropped the two bombs that killed the soldiers. Staff Sgt. Scott R. Studenmund, 24, of Pasadena, California, was wearing the strobe on the back of his helmet when he was killed. McDonald, 28, of Butler, Georgia, who split the hillside team, was also killed. The other U.S. deaths included Helton, 25, of Beaver, Ohio; Cpl. Justin R. Clouse, 22, of Sprague, Washington; and Pvt. 2nd Class Aaron S. Toppen, 19, of Mokena, Illinois.","Teams involved did not follow established procedures, Pentagon report says .

"(CNN) -- Are Syrian forces using chemical weapons in their years-long fight to hold on to power? That's what the head of the Israel Defense Forces intelligence research and analysis division said Tuesday, becoming the latest to allege that Damascus was employing weapons banned under international law against its own people. The claim further stoked the debate about the international community's role in Syria, where the United Nations estimated this month that 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict flared in March 2011. U.S. President Barack Obama, for one, has said the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against its own people would be a ""game changer"" in how his and other nations address the crisis. On Tuesday, his nation's top diplomat said Tuesday that the United States does not know definitively that such chemical weapons had been deployed. In fact, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also did not confirm the use of such weapons when the two spoke by phone earlier in the day. ""The information that I have at this point does not confirm it to me (in a manner) that I would feel comfortable commenting on it as a fact,"" Kerry said. Israeli Brig. Gen. Itai Brun, though not offering any direct evidence, stated firmly on Tuesday the belief that Syrian forces have increasingly used ""ground-to-ground missiles, rockets and chemical weapons."" He specified that sarin gas -- an odorless nerve agent that can quickly kill thousands by causing convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure -- was most likely used, as were ""neutralizing and nonlethal chemical weapons."" Brun pointed to one episode on March 19 in which, he said, ""victims suffered from shrunken pupils, foaming from the mouth and other symptoms which indicate the use of deadly chemical weapons."" ""According to our professional assessment, the regime has used deadly chemical weapons against armed rebels on a number of occasions in the past few months,"" said Brun, according to quotes provided by the IDF. In a letter to the U.N. secretary-general in December, Syria said the United States had falsely accused it of using chemical weapons. Chemical weapons frightful, relatively inexpensive . Before the Israeli official's announcement Tuesday, a United Nations-led investigation was already looking into accusations of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Tuesday against jumping to conclusions by repeating the ""Iraqi scenario"" in which claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed so-called weapons of mass destruction were the basis of the U.S.-led invasion. Lavrov accused other nations of ""politicizing the issue."" Further, he criticized how international investigators looking into an alleged use of chemical investigators in Aleppo had demanded access to to all facilities in Syria and to have the right to interview any Syrian. ""I believe that is too much,"" Lavrov said. U.S.: Chemical weapon use 'difficult to confirm' While he didn't detail a possible U.S. response, White House spokesman Jay Carney on Tuesday called the potential use of chemical weapons inside Syria ""unacceptable."" At the same time, he said, ""The use of chemical weapons is difficult to confirm."" In addition to Syria's possible use of chemical weapons against rebels, another concern is that parts of the government's stockpile of chemical weapons -- which analysts believe is one of the world's largest and includes sarin, mustard and VX gases -- could end up, if they haven't already, in others' hands. A senior U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday that Syrian government forces have carried out several movements of chemical weapons during the past month. Months of warnings, speculation swirl around Syria's chemical weapons . U.S. officials said they believe the chemical stockpiles remain under government control, but the movements have complicated the U.S. effort to keep track of them. Asked last week at a hearing whether the United States could guarantee that it could secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile if the government were to fall, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was noncommittal. ""Not as I sit here today, simply because they have been moving it, and the number of sites is quite numerous,"" said Gen. Martin Dempsey. Pentagon spokesman George Little said Tuesday that the U.S. stresses to Syria, ""in the strongest possible terms, (its) obligations ... to safeguard its chemical weapons stockpiles and not to use or transfer such weapons to terrorist groups like Hezbollah."" Israeli minister: It's clear that chemical weapons were used in Syria . Addressing the press Monday, a day before Brun's briefing, Israel's defense minister did not seem to indicate that his government has absolute proof of chemical weapons use in Syria. But if there was, Israel is prepared to act. ""We are ready to operate if any rogue element is going to put his hands or any chemical agents are going to be delivered toward rogue elements in the region,"" Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said. Analyst: 'A fantastic weapon of fear' Syria isn't one of the 188 nations that have signed on to the Chemical Weapons Convention that prohibits the production, stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons. Fellow Middle Eastern nations having taken a similar stance, officially refusing to sign on until Israel signs the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Yet Syria has denied having such weapons, as well as using them during its ongoing civil war. (Damascus has accused rebels of using such weapons, though, including in an attack last month in the northern province of Aleppo that state media claimed killed 25 people.) It's also expressed concerns that its government might be falsely implicated if ""terrorists"" -- a term it uses to refer to rebel fighters -- employ such weapons. Report: Syrian officials claim chlorine, saline mix used in Aleppo attack . ""What raises concerns ... is our serious fear that some of the countries backing terrorism and terrorists might provide the armed terrorist groups with chemical weapons and claim that it was the Syrian government that used the weapons,"" the state-run news agency SANA reported. Unlike nuclear weapons, chemical weapons are inexpensive to develop and stockpile. This lends them a disproportionate importance for Syria and the region, analysts say. ""In the Middle East, chemical weapons have been seen as a possible counter to Israel's nuclear weapons,"" Susan B. Martin of the Department of War Studies at King's College London said in March. Dina Esfandiary, a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said last month that Syria embraced a chemical weapons program as a way to bolster its strategic strength despite economic weaknesses, especially after Israel imposed a series of humiliating military defeats on the Arab world. Syria's chemical weapon potential . ""The best way to operate asymmetrically was for Syria to have its chemical weapons program,"" she said. According to Esfandiary, chemical weapons' utility is ""quite limited,"" as they are more of a deterrent than a real battlefield or tactical weapon. ""If you shoot a missile at a population center, you can be fairly certain that anyone it hits will die,"" she said. ""Chemical weapons use is not as clear-cut as that. It depends on topography, weather, how you deliver the chemical weapons, and you can't always be clear it will cause maximum casualty."" Their real power is in psychological, she said. ""It's a fantastic weapon of fear.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The connection seems obvious: nearly 400 acres of land set aside to house veterans and thousands of veterans who need a place to call home. But Los Angeles' estimated 8,000 homeless vets have been barred from living at the sprawling campus for decades. The West Los Angeles property -- some of the most valuable in the nation -- was donated in 1888 to ""establish, construct and permanently maintain"" a branch of a national home for veterans, according to the original deed. And for nearly a century, that's what happened: permanent veterans facilities sprang up, including a post office, a trolley system and housing for as many as 4,000 vets, said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Mark Rosenbaum. But ""beginning with the Vietnam War era, vets were kicked out,"" said Rosenbaum, who's leading a class-action suit over the property against the Department of Veterans Affairs. Now, a generation after Vietnam, the facility's abandoned buildings are off limits to the veterans they were intended to serve. ""It's a shame,"" said Carolina Barrie, a descendant of the heiress who donated the land. Veterans should be ""given every single opportunity to rehab their lives -- and if they have no place to live, a place to live."" The VA saw fit to lease parts of the property to several businesses. In September, the VA canceled three leases after rising criticism. But other entities remain on the property including a public golf course, a college baseball stadium, a theater and practice fields for the exclusive private Brentwood School. CNN's initial requests to the VA for its side of the lawsuit were referred to the Justice Department, which said it wouldn't comment while the case is still pending. Vet: 'I just wanted to die or go to prison' Iraq war veteran Robert Rissman, 22, isn't part of the lawsuit, but he has spent years battling addiction, post-traumatic-stress disorder and homelessness. As an 18-year-old high school senior, Rissman signed up with the Army intending to ""go to college and make something of myself,"" he said. ""And the Army said they'd pay for it. "" He was deployed to Iraq for a year as part of a quick response unit that saw constant action. Upon his return to Colorado's Fort Carson, Rissman was diagnosed with PTSD. Nightmares and paranoia haunted him. It got worse. According to Army papers, he once spent a day drinking and sitting on his bed pointing with the barrel of an illegal sawed-off shotgun in his mouth. ""I just wanted to die or go to prison,"" he said. ""And that was where I was headed and I knew that was where I was going and I was OK with that."" After leaving the Army, Rissman ended up homeless in Arizona and later Los Angeles, where he ""was doing a lot of methamphetamines"" and ""smoking a lot of dope."" Study: PTSD signals long-term health problems . Accurate figures are hard to come by, but the VA in its most recent report estimates about 107,000 veterans find themselves homeless on any given night. Mental illness plagues 45% of homeless vets and 70% suffer from some kind of substance abuse, according to the VA. Washington has OK'd $35.5 million to renovate various buildings on the campus including ""Building 209 for housing facilities for homeless veterans,"" according to a bill signed by President Obama this month. The facility would provide vets with 70 permanent housing units, far short of the living space needed to house LA's homeless vets. The VA has launched an aggressive national plan with an ambitious goal: eliminating homelessness among veterans by 2015. Under the joint program with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, homeless veterans get federal vouchers to help them pay rent. This summer the VA granted nearly $60 million to nonprofit groups that help veterans, including more than $7 million to aid an estimated 1,800 vets in California. The money aims to prevent veterans and their families from slipping into homelessness by helping with basic expenses such as rent, utilities security deposits and moving costs. Occupy the park? Ron Kovic, whose story was made famous in the 1989 Tom Cruise film ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" said the $35.5 million isn't enough. Paralyzed in the Vietnam War, the former Marine has been working to improve VA treatment of returning troops since his own homecoming in the late 1960s. Kovic is calling for an occupation protest of the West LA property, not unlike the current Occupy Wall Street movement. ""If that land was given to veterans and if we were able to put at least a small percentage of what we're spending on these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward building a facility for homeless and disabled veterans,"" Kovic told CNN, ""I think it would be one of the most honorable things we could do as citizens and one of the most honorable things that the VA could do to make up for the mistakes of the past."" U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, told CNN via an email statement that she's concerned about the rising number of homeless vets in Los Angeles and believes that ""updated and new facilities are needed at the West LA VA ."" ""I intend keep working to make sure that Congress doesn't stop"" with the latest improvements, she said. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki ""has told me he is committed to renovating two additional buildings on the campus, and we intend to hold him and the administration to that commitment."" Meanwhile, VA attorneys have asked a federal judge to throw the ACLU lawsuit out of court. ""In fact, according to Rosenbaum the Justice Department attorney said, 'We don't believe that the VA has any authority or any responsibility to provide housing."" But Dr. Dean Norman, chief of staff of Los Angeles' VA health care system seemed to contradict that. ""I think we have the resources with the community to end homelessness for veterans in Los Angeles,"" Norman said. Norman said new housing is being created for homeless vets and those who need help should call 1-877-4AIDVET (1-877-424-3838) to start the process that will put them in safe housing. As for Rissman, he's currently living at a halfway house in hopes of leaving his homeless life behind. He thinks the West Los Angeles property could help many more homeless vets win their personal battles. ""It would get a number of people in off the street and get them doing what they need to be doing to get their life together,"" said Rissman. Meanwhile, the judge has refused to throw out the case and has appointed a mediator to try and resolve the situation beginning this week. ""I promise you that these gates will be open,"" said Rosenbaum. ""We will win this case.""

"Washington (CNN) -- It was supposed to be a cakewalk for Eric Cantor. The analysts said so. The polls said so. Cantor felt so comfortable that the House majority leader wasn't in his Richmond, Virginia, district in June on the day of his Republican primary election. He lost -- badly -- to a little-known economics professor in one of the great American political upsets. How did the pundits and pollsters get it so wrong, and what does that mean for November's congressional elections? Here are five reasons to approach any prognostication with caution this time around: . 1) Low turnout . While more than half of eligible voters turn out for presidential elections, the percentage drops sharply in midterm balloting for all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate. In Cantor's 7th District race in Virginia, well below 20% of eligible voters cast ballots on the day he lost. Such a low turnout makes the outcome more vulnerable to unpredictable factors such as bad weather, a campaign misstep or crossover voting -- in this case, Democrats who may have voted for tea party-backed David Brat in an effort to oust Cantor, the seven-term congressman considered a possible future House Speaker. Brat beat Cantor by more than 7,000 votes out of 65,000 cast. In 2012, the turnout for the district's Republican primary was about 47,000 votes, and there was no way to determine how many of the 18,000 additional voters this year were Democrats. 2) National mood . Most observers think the more public distaste for Congress and politics, the lower the turnout in congressional elections. By that measure, polling stations may be particularly barren come November 4. Approval for Congress is near record lows, and a Washington Post-ABC poll in early August showed that for the first time, a majority of Americans disapproved of their own representatives. ""Americans like to vote for someone, not against someone,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""If they perceive the ballot as a choice between the lesser of two evils, that's one more excuse not to vote, and in midterms a lot of Americans don't need many excuses to simply stay at home."" Facing such a disgruntled electorate, both parties seek to energize their respective bases to try to gain a turnout advantage. Republicans frame the election as the chance to increase their House majority and regain control of the Senate, which would strengthen the party's ability to minimize or defeat the policies of Democratic President Barack Obama. Democrats reach out to demographics that traditionally support them -- single women, minorities and younger voters -- but traditionally don't turn out strongly in midterm elections. 3) Polling problems . Changing dynamics make effective polling more challenging. Cantor's pollster badly underestimated the turnout for June's primary, perhaps because he failed to anticipate Democratic crossovers and conservative disenchantment with his candidate. Whatever the reason, difficulty in knowing who will vote makes predicting the outcome a major challenge. Along with unorthodox tactics such as crossover voting, pollsters have a tougher time reaching a growing number of prospective voters through traditional methods. For example, fewer young voters have land-line telephones, the traditional polling medium for decades, meaning surveys must adapt by incorporating cellphone and Internet outreach to properly reflect the population. 4) Beware of the aggregate polls . Many popular websites simply take whatever polls they can find and average them together. Some use more sophisticated mathematical models, but the principle is the same: The end product is only as good as the data it is based on. ""Computer programmers used to say, 'Garbage in, garbage out,' and that's true for virtually any mathematical model,"" Holland said. ""Let's say you have 10 polls in a state and five of them are partisan polls that are trying to spin the data for their candidate, three of them are cutting corners on their methodology, one of them is flat-out making the data up, and only one is a legitimate poll."" The lone legitimate poll will get ""swamped"" in any aggregate model by the questionable polls, he continued, adding: ""Unfortunately, there are at least a few states where the skunky polls vastly outnumber the good ones."" 5) It's all local . ""All politics is local,"" former House Speaker Tip O'Neill famously said, and that is particularly true in congressional elections. While voting takes place in all 50 states, the competition involves the district congressional races and statewide Senate races. That means an outcome of national significance can hinge on the result from a particular district or state. For example, which party wins a majority in the Senate depends on the outcomes of half a dozen races, including contests involving incumbent Democrats in Arkansas and North Carolina. ""If it's sunny and warm in 48 states on Election Day and cold and rainy in Arkansas and North Carolina, control of the Senate could be determined by intensely local weather conditions,"" Holland noted. CNN's Dan Merica and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Low turnout in congressional elections can bring surprises .

"(CNN) -- The Bush administration said Monday it notified Congress of plans to sell $20 billion in sophisticated arms to Saudi Arabia. The deal includes the proposed sale of 900 ""joint direct attack munitions"" worth close to $120 million, said U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. Arriving in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for talks with King Abdullah, Bush delivered a proposed weapons sale that is part of a U.S. strategy to beef up security of its Persian Gulf allies to counter threats posed by Iran's rising influence in the region. Sen. Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the committee would examine the deal. ""We need to be convinced that the sale makes sense militarily and ensure that it in no way harms our security or those of our allies,"" the Democrat from Delaware said in a news release. ""We must also make certain that the administration does not just try to use a few arms sales to substitute for the comprehensive, coherent strategy we need for the region."" Bush's Mideast tour includes visits to Israel, the West Bank, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.  See map of Bush's itinerary » . Also on Monday, top Iranian officials heaped scorn on Bush's visit to the Middle East, with one of them saying the American leader was attempting to stir up ""Iranophobia,"" a state-run Iranian news agency reported Monday. Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency noted the comments of Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and Ala'eddin Boroujerdi, head of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission. Bush, in a speech Sunday in Abu Dhabi, labeled Iran as the ""world's leading sponsor of terror"" and asked allies to join the United States in confronting Iran ""before it's too late."" But Mottaki -- who made his remarks to Al-Jazeera news network Sunday -- said the United States ""was the main cause of extremism in the region as it has been supporting terrorist and extremist groups during the past six years.""  Watch excerpt from Bush's speech » . He said Bush was trying to foment tensions in the Persian Gulf over the Strait of Hormuz incident on January 6. The U.S. military described a confrontation between U.S. ships and Iranian boats, but Mottaki called the American version of the story fabricated, the Islamic Republic News Agency said. The report paraphrased Mottaki as saying that ""fanning the fuel of Iranophobia was the objective of Bush's visit to the region."" In the IRNA report, Boroujerdi said referring to Iran as a threat won't affect Teheran's ties with its neighbors.

"(CNN) -- The world's oldest person, as verified by the Guinness Book of World Records, is dead at the age of 114, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Eunice Sanborn of Jacksonville, Texas, died quietly in her home on Monday, the research group said. Sanborn was born July 20, 1896, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which said it based her birth date and age conservatively on census records from the time. Her obituary in the Jacksonville Daily Progress had her even older, however, with the obituary citing a birth date of July 20, 1895. Sanborn, who was 7 years old when the Wright Brothers made their famous first powered flight in 1903, outlived three husbands, according to the obituary. In her 90s and even beyond her 100th birthday, she would joke with men that she was scouting for her fourth, according to the Jacksonville, Texas, Daily Progress. Sanborn's only child, a daughter, died in 2005 at the age of 90, the newspaper said. When Sanborn was born, the Civil War was history -- but just by 30 years. When she was 4 months old, William McKinley defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency of the United States. The United States would enter World War I when she was 21, in 1917. By then she had been married for four years, according to Robert Young with the Gerontology Research Group. Young, a senior claims researcher with the global Gerontology Research Group and a senior consultant for Guinness World Records, said Sanborn had one of three strong predictors of longevity on her side: she was born female. According to the GRG, there are 85 ""supercentarians"" in the world -- people with verified ages of 110 or older. Of those, 80 are women and only five are men. Young calls this the ""female advantage."" Young offered two others predictors of a long life: a healthy body weight and a positive outlook. He referred to Jeanne Calment of France who, when she died in 1997 at the age of 122, had the longest confirmed life span in human history. He says reporters would ask her if she was concerned about the death of relatives and that she responded, ""I can't do anything about it, so why worry?"" Young also told the story of when Calment broke her hip and was confined to bed just prior to her 115th birthday. When asked at her birthday party if she got bored, Young said Calment replied, ""I think. I dream. I go over my life. I never get bored."" She was soon back on her feet, he said. Although some factors of long life lie within our control, L. Stephen Coles, GRG executive director, said much of what determines how long a person lives is programmed in the genes at birth. He noted that those with long lives tracked by his organization have relatives who have lived long lives, too. ""Even if you have everything going for you, if you don't have good genes from your parents then you won't be able to get to be a supercentenarian,"" he said. With Sanborn's death, the ""oldest living person"" designation goes to Besse Cooper of Monroe, Georgia, according to the GRG. Like Sanborn, she was born in 1896, but after Sanborn. On August 26, she will celebrate her 115th birthday.","Eunice Sanborn was born in 1896, according to a gerontology group .

"(CNN) -- Cars remain where they were crushed by falling walls two years ago, drink vending machines stand in gloomy isolation outside shuttered shops and traffic lights still blink amber in deserted streets. It might sound like the Hollywood setting for a post-apocalyptic dystopia but in Namie-machi, Fukushima, the scene of desolation is all too real. Two years after Fukushima's nuclear power plant meltdown forced the 22,000 residents of Namie to flee -- snap-freezing the ordinary Japanese town at the moment the disaster struck on March 11, 2011 -- Google Street View has posted striking images of the devastation inside Fukushima's 12-mile evacuation zone. ""Most of the damage that we all remember and saw was the tsunami damage because it was much more drastic,"" said David Marx, head of product communications, Google Asia-Pacific, who accompanied the Google Street View vehicle as it took 360-degree pictures along Namie's gloomily abandoned and overgrown streets. ""The earthquake, even though it was big, there was very little seen of just earthquake-damaged buildings -- so many buildings were either completely demolished or tilted or bent."" He said the scenes became even more dramatic as the Google vehicles approached the city's waterways. ""That area right next to the river is just covered in boats -- there are just huge piles of wreckage that haven't been cleaned up,"" he said. ""It's pretty intense to see."" Google's Street View cars began taking the images this month at the invitation of the city mayor who wanted a way for evacuated residents, many of whom are still in temporary accommodation, to take a virtual tour of their abandoned properties. ""Two years have passed since the disaster, but people still aren't allowed to enter Namie-machi,"" Mayor Tamotsu Baba said on Google's official blog. ""Many of the displaced townspeople have asked to see the current state of their city, and there are surely many people around the world who want a better sense of how the nuclear incident affected surrounding communities."" Marx said the Google drivers took precautions and their cars were monitored in line with the Fukushima Prefecture and Namie-machi guidelines. ""I was wearing protective gear,"" he said. ""The good news is that it's safer to be in a car than out."" While a recent WHO report says the cancer risk from Fukushima is low, Japanese authorities are taking no chances. The 12-mile exclusion zone is likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future and Mayor Baba concedes that generations of Namie residents may never see their homes again. ""Those of us in the older generation feel that we received this town from our forbearers, and we feel great pain that we cannot pass it down to our children,"" he said on the blog. ""We want this Street View imagery to become a permanent record of what happened to Namie-machi in the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster."" Authorities took more than a month to begin looking for bodies in Namie due to the danger of radiation. ""After being set off-limits, we have not been able to clean up the wreckage on the side of the road, including the many fishing boats that were washed several kilometers inland,"" Baba said . ""Ever since the March disaster, the rest of the world has been moving forward, and many places in Japan have started recovering. But in Namie-machi time stands still. With the lingering nuclear hazard, we have only been able to do cursory work for two whole years.""","Google Street View has taken street pictures of Namie-machi, Fukushima .

"LA GLORIA, Mexico (CNN) -- Tucked away in this small mountain village, off a dusty road flanked by pig farms, is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed. Five-year-old Edgar Hernandez, known as ""patient zero"" survived the earliest documented case of swine flu. Meet the child known as ""patient zero"" by his doctors -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez, who survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in an outbreak that, officials say, has now spread across four continents. His family lives in the 3,000-population village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz, where a flu outbreak was reported on April 2. State officials arrived and took samples from dozens of people. Lab tests confirmed that Edgar was the only patient in Veracruz to test positive for the swine flu virus; the others had contracted a common flu. Health officials had returned to Edgar's sample only after cases of the new flu strain were spotted around the country. ""In this case, there's a patient who turned out to be positive for the swine-flu virus, with the exception that at that time in no region of the world it had been established as an etiological, epidemic cause,"" said Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova. Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better. His mother blamed the virus on a huge pig farm in the neighborhood. Officials have conducted tests at the farm owned by U.S. company Smithfield Foods, and those tests came back negative. Meanwhile, Mexican health officials suspect the swine flu outbreak has caused more than 159 deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses. The World Health Organization says at least 105 cases have been confirmed worldwide, including 64 in the United States; 26 in Mexico; six in Canada; three in New Zealand; and two each in Spain, the United Kingdom and Israel. WHO has confirmed deaths only in Mexico, where seven people have died from swine flu. The deadly outbreak in Mexico prompted authorities to order about 35,000 public venues in Mexico City to close or serve only take-out meals as health officials tried to contain the virus. iReport.com: Are you worried about swine flu? Officials in Mexico City also ordered the closing of bars, clubs, movie theaters, pool halls, theaters, gyms, sport centers and convention halls until May 6, said Juan Jose Garcia Ochoa, one of the city government's top officials. Officials on Friday closed schools in the city and Monday extended that order nationwide until at least May 6. ""I'm pretty nervous of this whole virus thing,"" Berta Hernandez said as she touched up her eyeliner inside a packed and humid subway car in Mexico City. She did not dare lift her surgical mask to put on lip gloss. ""I'm nervous of the people who aren't wearing masks. Maybe they will suddenly sneeze or cough,"" she said. Governments around the world scrambled to prevent further outbreak. Some, like China and Russia, banned pork imports from the United States and Mexico, even though the World Health Organization said the disease ""has not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork (pig meat) or other products derived from pigs."" Several others, such as Japan and Indonesia, used thermographic devices to test the temperature of passengers arriving from Mexico. The Philippines' health department urged people to avoid kissing and hugging in public. Argentina announced a five-day ban on flights from Mexico. Four cruise lines -- Holland America, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Princess -- canceled upcoming calls to Mexican ports. President Obama said the outbreak is a cause for concern, not for alarm. The government urged travelers to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico. iReport.com: ""Regular life"" in Mexico with masks . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for the use of two of the most common antiviral drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza. The authorization allows the distribution of the drugs by a broader range of health-care workers and loosens age limits for their use. In Mexico City, however, there is a shortage of such medication. It also became impossible to find protective surgical masks, which the government had handed out to one out of every five residents.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta inside a Mexico City hospital » .

Swine influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs. When the flu spreads person-to-person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it harder to treat or fight, because people have no natural immunity. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

"(CNN) -- Colombia may have exited the World Cup at the quarterfinal stage but it did not stop a massive crowd from welcoming home their heroes in the capital Bogota Sunday. Hosts Brazil put paid to the team's hopes with a narrow 2-1 victory in Fortaleza Friday, although the win came at a heavy price with Neymar ruled out for the rest of the World Cup. Arriving at El Dorado airport after an Avianca flight, the squad were met by a frenzied welcome with thousands lining the streets as their open top bus negotiated its way through the streets. Colombia, coached by Argentina's Jose Pekerman, won its group and impressed with its flowing football, led by World Cup sensation James Rodriguez. He scored his sixth and tournament-leading goal, a late penalty, in the defeat to Brazil. ""Thanks for always being there, thanks for the support, we love you,"" Rodriguez said as he addressed the crowd. They had gathered early, most wearing the team's yellow shirt, to catch a glimpse of the players who were given red carpet treatment at the airport, before going on a tour in the bus, which inched its way through the throngs. The Colombian players were then presented on a stage at the Simon Bolivar park and showed off their footwork by dancing to the music. Meanwhile, the Brazil squad has been training in Teresopolis ahead of its semifinal clash with Germany in Belo Horizonte Tuesday. Chelsea's Willian, who could come in for Neymar, admitted his loss was a blow to Brazil's hopes of winning the World Cup on home soil. ""Neymar sets the standard for us. He is capable of deciding any game, so playing without him will be difficult,"" he said. But the midfielder added: ""We know the quality that we have. We are all very sad at losing him but we are now even stronger after what happened and we can continue to pursue our dream."" Willian suffered an injury scare in training Saturday after a clash with Hernanes but said it would not prevent him playing in the last four clash. Coach Luis Felipe Scolari's other possible replacement for Neymar, who has fractured a vertabra in his back, could be winger Bernard, who plays for Shakhtar Donetsk.","Colombia team returns home to massive welcome in Bogota .

"(CNN) -- Bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate on Thursday that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions. The proposal led by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, emerged despite Obama administration appeals for Congress to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing. The White House said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and President Barack Obama would veto the legislation if Congress were to approve it now. A letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from nine Democratic committee chairs said international talks over Iran's nuclear program should continue without additional sanctions being imposed by Congress. ""We believe that new sanctions would play into the hands of those in Iran who are most eager to see the negotiations fail,"" the letter states. But proponents of the plan that sprouted from bipartisan talks involving several lawmakers said the threat of stepped-up action could be a powerful lever against Iran's nuclear interests and work toward more fruitful diplomacy. ""Current sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table and a credible threat of future sanctions will require Iran to cooperate and act in good faith at the negotiating table,"" Menendez said in a statement announcing the legislative effort. Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, told CNN's The Situation Room that he would support the sanctions. ""The fact is that if Iran is serious about the agreement, they should have no problem with the sanctions because these sanctions only kick in if they don't comply with the agreement,"" he said. ""Secondly, the President should want these sanctions as a weapon to hold over the Iranians, so I don't see why the President is so opposed to these sanctions."" A six-month agreement struck in November among the United States, other world powers and Iran calls for Tehran to start limiting its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Talks are under way on a permanent agreement, and the outcome is uncertain. But the Senate proposal would give Obama more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against Iran's oil exports and other key areas of its economy. Sanctions would hit sooner if Iran cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord. Lawmakers demand a permanent global agreement that results in ""termination of Iran's nuclear weapons program"" and prevents it from achieving such capability in the future. The Obama administration has said the centerpiece of its policy is for Iran to not achieve a nuclear weapon. The United States and other western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. The proposal has the support of more than a quarter of the Senate. The House approved a new Iran sanctions bill in July, well before the diplomatic effort yielded the interim agreement. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Bipartisan proposal considers diplomatic effort under way around Iran nuclear issue .

"Rome (CNN) -- Meeting in Rome with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, Secretary of State John Kerry announced Thursday that the United States would provide an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance for refugees fleeing the fighting in Syria, bringing the total amount of aid to $510 million. Kerry also said that he is working to bring all parties together to create a transitional government and that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be part of that government. Jordan, which is being inundated by a wave of Syrian refugees, will receive nearly $43 million, which will support United Nations humanitarian programs in the region. Kerry said the fourth-largest ""city"" in Jordan today is a tent city filled with Syrians fleeing their country, adding that ""Jordan feels the impact of what is happening more than any other country."" The foreign minister gave a bleak assessment, saying the 525,000 refugees make up 10% of Jordan's population. He said the number is expected to increase to 20% or 25% by year's end, and then to 40% of the population by the middle of 2014. ""No country can cope with the numbers that are as huge as I described,"" he said. The minister said he was ""encouraged"" by Kerry's meetings in Moscow this week, at which the U.S. and Russia agreed to push for an international conference on Syria that would possibly be held by the end of the month and include, for the first time, representatives of the Syrian government as well as the opposition fighting that government. Judeh said he was leaving Rome for meetings in Moscow. Kerry said he had asked Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, to travel to Istanbul to confer with opposition leaders. He said that on Wednesday, he discussed the plan for the conference by phone with the foreign ministers of most of the countries involved in trying to find a political solution, as well as with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. ""There's a very positive response and very strong desire to move to this conference,"" he said, ""and to at least exhaust the possibilities of finding a political way forward.""","The U.S. secretary of state met with Jordan's foreign minister in Rome .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Flicking through her photos on her living room couch, Julia Quinn recounts the array of plastic surgery procedures she has undergone. ""That is when I had my eye done again, a bump taken out of my nose,"" she says, looking at a photo of her severely swollen face. There isn't much cosmetic surgery that this housewife from Surrey in the UK has not had done. A few years ago, feeling unhappy about the lines around her eyes and mouth, she first dabbled in surgery. She opted for a private clinic in the UK, but after a bad experience there she started looking around for alternative places to get the work done. That's when she first discovered that South Africa offered the same procedures at a fraction of the cost, she says. ""You get a lot of good surgeons and dentists in South Africa,"" says Quinn. ""It's like a holiday -- you are looked after, the weather is fine."" January is a good time to flee the UK's winter weather, so Quinn is heading back to Johannesburg for more work. This time it's a mini facelift and more liposuction. In total, she will have spent nearly $15,000 on surgery in South Africa. She says should would have spent a lot more if she had continued to be treated in the UK. In a suburb in northern Johannesburg Lorraine Melvill is running around trying to organize hospital visits for her clients staying in her guest house. She started her business, ""Surgeon and Safari,"" back in 2000 and since then she has had people from all over the world, including Quinn, come to her to facilitate their cosmetic procedures, and perhaps go on safari too. See also: School boy's wildlife-tracking website helps safari tourists . ""For most people in the first-world economies like the UK, and especially in America, their biggest desire is to go on African safari,"" she explains, ""and yet their greatest want in their life was to have plastic surgery, so why not put the two together?"" Like most companies, however, Surgeon and Safari was hit by the global financial crisis, particularly as a number of Melvill's clients were borrowing money to afford their procedures. She says: ""When there was a greater volume of people coming through then it was people who were borrowing money, for example, or using their credit cards to pay for the plastic surgery. So they weren't necessarily as educated or as financially secure, they weren't the typical baby boomer. ""So when the economic recession came along, that was the first market that dropped away because, obviously, there was a credit crunch, so that's the first thing you stop spending your money on, something like plastic surgery."" However, whilst the United States and eurozone economies may have languished, Melvill says she has benefited from the growth of some African countries' economies. ""There is a huge emergence of local Africans that chose to come to South Africa for elective surgery, whether it be breast reduction, tummy tucks, lipo,"" she says. ""I would say one of the biggest countries is Zambia,"" she adds. ""There is quite a big market coming out of Angola, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana ... Their economies are growing and therefore their middle classes are growing and therefore the need increases."" See also: The New Hollywood? Cape Town takes on Tinseltown . Chetan Patel works at Johannesburg's private Mediclinic, in Sandton. In the three years that he has been a private cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon, he says that he has also seen an increase in clients flying in from parts of sub-Saharan Africa. ""Certainly we are seeing people from very high income groups,"" says Patel. ""From a regional African point of view, countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, the DRC, all play an important role where socio-economic factors all dictate that there are more and more people who can afford this kind of surgery and so we are seeing a larger amount of those people coming certainly to Johannesburg for that kind of surgery."" See also: South Africa bids to become call center capital . These clients are very clear about what work they want done, says Patel. ""For instance, they would come to me and say 'I would like Jennifer Lopez's butt' or 'I would like to look like Kim Kardashian,' and the obvious body features of those two individuals are curvaceous hips and thighs with an augmented or accentuated buttock. ""Other than that, I think more and more African women are conscious of what their lower bodies look like, so what their tummy looks like, so they would like tummy tuck procedures, for instance."" Cosmetic surgery isn't new to Africa -- after all, in 2005, the wife of the former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo died after having liposuction in a Spanish clinic. But Patel says that from what he is seeing this is no longer just the preserve of the super rich or political elites. ""It is not a necessity it is a luxury, so I see the trend [in having plastic surgery in] the next five to 10 years increasing amongst people from the rest of Africa,"" he says. For now, though, it's people like Quinn who are keeping Melvill and Patel busy; repeat customers are the norm in the area of elective surgeries, Melvill says. But whilst Quinn will be having her surgery in South Africa, and will be recuperating in the sunshine, she has decided against going on safari. In fact, Melvill says that these days most of her clients opt instead to spend the day on a different type of safari; they choose to visit the nearby designer shops.","Many foreigners choose South Africa as plastic surgery destination .

"(CNN) -- This is an obituary, but not as you know it. One, the subject of this obituary is a horse. And two, he isn't dead. But come Saturday, countless millions of racing fans the world over will be in mourning for one of the greatest racehorses the sport has ever seen. Once a racehorse like Frankel retires to spend the rest of his life in the breeding shed he is, in some sense, lost to us forever, and we are left wondering if we'll ever see his like again. Unbeaten at two, three and four years old, Frankel's career yet seems too short for a talent that burned so bright. It is inconceivable that we would allow our human idols to retire, unopposed, at their peak of their brilliance. But the nature of Thoroughbred racing is such that the best horses are victims of their own success: Frankel is simply too valuable to race on. Valued -- conservatively, some say -- at $160 million, Frankel's true worth can only be realized away from the racetrack. Infographic: What makes Frankel so special? Undefeated in all 13 of his races, Frankel is now preparing for this 14th and final challenge. For those who've savored every one of his 13 appearances so far it will be chance to say farewell to the horse who has redefined our understanding of what is possible in an equine athlete. For those who have yet to see Frankel in action, Saturday provides one last opportunity to witness a piece of racing history as the Henry Cecil-trained colt lines up in the showpiece Champion Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. But Frankel's last race will also be his toughest yet, pitting him against the second best horse in the world on rating, Cirrus des Aigles, winner of this race last year and looking in imperious form after a stunning victory in his native France over the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe weekend. The venue for the showdown between the world's two top-rated Thoroughbreds, Ascot Racecourse, is one of the most venerable courses in racing -- but is not without its own idiosyncrasies. Founded in 1711 by Queen Anne, Ascot retains close links with the British royal family. Perhaps the best-recognized race meeting in the global racing calendar is Royal Ascot, which takes place in June each year. Queen Elizabeth II -- one of the country's best-known racing fans -- attends every day, arriving by horse-drawn carriage from Windsor Castle. Frankel immortalized on canvas . She will be in attendance again on Saturday to witness the King of the Turf take his final bow. Ascot has already witnessed what was arguably the greatest win of Frankel's career -- maybe even the greatest win of any racehorse's career -- his 11-length victory in this year's Queen Anne Stakes at this year's Royal Ascot. That performance, reminiscent of Secretariat's 31-length victory in the 1973 Belmont Stakes -- cemented Frankel's reputation as undoubtedly the greatest racehorse of the 21st century. But it was also the venue where the wonder horse came the closest he's ever come to losing his unbeaten record. One year earlier, Frankel had started in the 2011 St James's Palace Stakes. The pacemaker Rerouted set a break-neck pace, soon opening up an enormous gap to the rest of the field. Frankel's jockey, Tom Queally, appeared to panic, and sent his colt off after the leader. Frankel duly caught him, but the exertion nearly took its toll, and with a furlong to go Frankel's stride was shortening. He just held off 20-1 shot Zoffany to win by three quarters of a length -- the smallest winning margin of his career apart from his maiden win over Nathaniel (a multiple Group 1 winner in his own right who, incidentally, will also be lining up against his old foe on Saturday). Notoriously undulating, the going for Saturday's race will be another test for the four-year-old, who has yet to prove himself over such soft ground. Horse play at Ascot. Spot the Fez! It plays neatly into the hands of his rival Cirrus des Aigles who, by contrast, won over soft ground in his last impressive outing in Paris. While most racing insiders will doubtless hold the view that Frankel's sheer class will prevail, a cautionary note is sounded by the experience of Black Caviar; virtually identical conditions nearly caused a major upset earlier this season when the Australian sprinting sensation put her undefeated record on the line at Royal Ascot. She hung on by the narrowest of margins and was rewarded with a pat on the nose from the Queen herself. Frankel fans will no doubt be hoping the Queen's royal endorsement will bring him a similar degree of luck on Saturday. In a vintage year for racing that has included not only the daring of Black Caviar, the thrilling possibility of the first Triple Crown winner in four decades in Camelot, the bravado of the little German filly Danedream to capture the King George and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Frankel's final curtain call has been designed to be the climax to one of sport's great narratives. Frankel's entire career has been played out, poignantly, against the backdrop of his trainer's battle with cancer. Frankel himself was named after legendary American trainer Bobby Frankel, who lost his own battle with cancer in 2009, the year his namesake was born. Henry Cecil, who has been knighted by the Queen, was unable to attend Frankel's brilliant win in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood earlier season as he was receiving ongoing treatment for stomach cancer. But he was determined to be at York for Frankel's debut over the mile-and-a-quarter distance that he will attempt again on Saturday. As a stunned crowed watched Frankel demolish a quality field on his first outing over the longer trip, Cecil permitted himself a smile. Asked how his colt's victory had made him feel, barely audible, he replied: ""Young again."" Assuming Frankel can deliver again on Saturday he will give us the Hollywood ending this story so richly deserves. Long after the applause has died down around Ascot and the last champagne has been popped, Cecil will begin the work of easing Frankel down in preparation for his new life away from the track. But this once-in-a-lifetime horse will not be forgotten by anyone who has seen him in full flight, making his blazing runs down the home straight. We are destined to think of Frankel every time we see one of his offspring at a race course. In a little over a year from now, the first of Frankel's foals will be taking his or her first long-limbed steps in a paddock in some corner of England. A year after that, if everything goes to plan, that foal could be making its first appearance at a race track. Perhaps it will resemble him, with his four white socks and the perfect star on his forehead. His colts and fillies will be their own individuals, of course -- a blend of characteristics passed on by their sire and their dam.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lil Za, former house guest of Justin Bieber, accepted a plea deal for probation Wednesday to settle drug and vandalism charges stemming from the January search of Bieber's mansion. The rapper -- whose real name is Xavier Smith -- pleaded ""no contest"" to a felony drug possession charge and a misdemeanor vandalism count during a hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Los Angeles County Sheriff's investigators were looking for evidence that Bieber, 20, attacked a neighbor's home with eggs in January, when they arrested Lil Za for possession of suspected illegal drugs. Lab tests confirmed one of the drugs in the 20-year-old rapper's possession was MDMA, also known as Molly or Ecstasy, a sheriff's detective said. The vandalism charge was filed after Lil Za ripped a jail phone off the wall of a holding cell while waiting to be released. Lil Za must pay the sheriff $600 for the phone damage, along with $1,000 fine on the vandalism charge. He was sentenced to three years probation on the drug charge. He must also attend an outpatient drug treatment program and work 20 days on a highway cleanup crew. Judge Mitchell Block said as he sentenced Lil Za that he had noticed his good behavior during his several previous court appearances in the case. ""That impresses me as someone who will take his probation seriously, get the job done that needs to be done,"" Block said. Smith was represented in court by lawyer Shawn Holley, who is also Bieber's attorney. The Los Angeles County district attorney has yet to decide if Bieber will be charged with vandalism for the egg attack. The prosecutor could decide to make it a felony case, since investigators said it caused an estimated $20,000 in damage to a Calabasas, California, mansion. It could also be prosecuted as just a misdemeanor because of the nature of the incident. Sheriff's detectives asked for a felony charge against Bieber, but his lawyers argue that the egging was a childish prank. Bieber egging 'a silly prank,' not a felony, lawyers argue .","Lil Za gets 3 years probation, 20 days on a highway cleanup crew .

"(CNN) -- Storms in the lower Mississippi valley Tuesday night unleashed baseball-sized hail, high winds and twisters, including one that lifted a tractor-trailer, the National Weather Service said. Meteorologists from Texas to Kentucky, a day after a similar round of storms, were flooded Tuesday evening with reports of severe storms or tornado touchdowns and resulting damage. According to the agency's Storm Prediction Center, there were 29 tornado reports -- many in northeast Texas -- by late Tuesday, but the actual number had not been confirmed. Matt Bishop with the weather service's Fort Worth office said the staff had heard of multiple reports of damage in northeastern Texas, although he was unaware of any injuries. ""We're in the middle of a severe weather outbreak,"" he said at 7:45 p.m. At least two rounds of storms had struck Kaufman, Texas, about 30 miles east of Dallas, by Tuesday evening and another was on the way. ""It's a little bit of everything around us,"" said Kaufman Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Pat Laney. ""It's been a chaotic afternoon."" She had heard of some damage, but no reports of injuries. ""We've been very blessed,"" Laney said. Two reported tornadoes touched down in Coahoma County, Mississippi, said emergency management director Johnny Tarzi. Two homes were destroyed in the city of Coahoma and five were heavily damaged in Friars Point, with about 15 sustaining minor damage. Trees and homes also were reportedly damaged at Moon Lake, said Tarzi. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Coahoma County is in western Mississippi, near the Arkansas border. The Little Rock, Arkansas, office received reports of hail, downed tree limbs and the incident involving the tractor-trailer in Coy, on U.S. 165, said forecaster Brian Smith. About 24,000 people lost power Tuesday night in the Memphis, Tennessee, area. A twister was reported at Marion, Arkansas, west of Memphis. ""It's going to be a busy night,"" said Z.E. Ingram of the weather service's Memphis office. The Shreveport, Louisiana, office issued about 15 tornado warnings, and had received many reports of funnel clouds and tornado touchdowns, meteorologist intern Matt Hemingway said. Meteorologists at the Tulsa, Oklahoma, office tracked a string of storms and possible tornado activity near Fort Smith, Arkansas, said forecaster Chuck Hodges. There were reports of hail and winds reaching 80 mph near Fort Smith. Forecasters issued a tornado watch for northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Arkansas, southeastern Illinois, western Kentucky, southeast Missouri, northwest Mississippi, western Tennessee, eastern Illinois, much of Indiana, northwestern Ohio and much of Michigan until 10 p.m. This is a ""particularly dangerous situation,"" the Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said of the outlook for tornadoes. Destructive tornadoes, softball-size hail, wind gusts to 70 mph and dangerous lightning are possible in and near this watch area. The bad weather extended to the east. A tornado warning was issued Tuesday afternoon in Rome, New York. ""Very large hail and damaging winds"" can also be expected, forecasters said. Typically, only a handful of days per year reach high-risk criteria, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. On Wednesday, portions of Kentucky and Tennessee will be at moderate risk of severe thunderstorms, along with northeast and east-central Mississippi, the northern half of Alabama and northwest Georgia, the Storm Prediction Center said. An area between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains is ""likely to see a widespread/potentially dangerous severe weather event,"" forecasters said. The stage may be set for a potential record-breaking month for tornadoes nationwide, according to the center. The long-term average for confirmed tornadoes in April is 116. The previous record for April is 267 confirmed tornadoes in 1974, which includes the historic ""superoutbreak"" of April 3 and 4 that year. According to the center, the likely total of confirmed tornadoes through April 24 is between 200 and 275. In Arkansas, more than 60,000 people were without power Tuesday after a rash of severe storms tore through the state Monday, leaving 10 dead and destroying more than a dozen homes. According to the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management, four fatalities were storm-related and six resulted from flooding. In Faulkner County, at least four people died in the severe thunderstorms, according to Faulkner County Office of Emergency Management spokesman Stephen Hawk. Two people died in Madison County, one in Washington County, two in Benton County and one in Perry County. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe toured the Faulkner County town of Vilonia on Tuesday, telling CNN affiliate KATV, ""These folks have suffered some terrible losses."" House-to-house searches were being conducted in Vilonia, Hawk said. About 15 houses are destroyed, he said, and ""within the three-mile path of the storm, everything was affected. There are untold numbers of affected houses ... The only grocery store in town, the roof was pretty much torn off."" On Monday night, Madison County Sheriff Phillip Morgan said the bodies of an elderly man and woman were found after floodwaters swept away the couple's car on Highway 23 south of Huntsville, in northwest Arkansas. The deaths are attributed to rising flood waters along War Eagle Creek. Also in northwest Arkansas, the Washington County Sheriff's Office confirmed the death of 38-year-old Consuelo Santillano, who authorities say was swept away by rapidly moving water across Highway 265 South. And a possible tornado struck Little Rock Air Force Base in central Arkansas, damaging at least 100 housing units and knocking out power to some parts of the base, military officials said. Bob Oldham, a spokesman for the base, reported two minor injuries and some damage to aircraft at the base. Beebe told CNN later in the day that three C-130s were damaged to the point that, according to preliminary reports, they are inoperable ""without significant repairs."" The state also saw seven deaths in an earlier round of severe weather this month. Other parts of the state were flooded after several days of unceasing rain. Steve Wilkes of Fayetteville said his house was spared damage from a nearby flooded creek, but some of his friends are dealing with flooded basements. ""I've lived here for more than 20 years. I've never seen anything like this in my life,"" Wilkes said. ""I saw water 2 to 3 feet deep across roadways that have never flooded."" In various parts of the state, the storms flipped over cars, damaged homes and knocked out power to tens of thousands, emergency management officials said. Some areas reported gusts of up to 70 mph. CNN's Dave Alsup, Scott Thompson, Phil Gast, Sean Morris, Anna Rhett Miller, John Branch and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Storms damage homes in Mississippi .

"(CNN) -- Rep. Darrell Issa must be ruing his bad luck. The hearing he carefully orchestrated to pick at the scab of Benghazi was stepped on by the verdict in the Jodi Arias murder trial and by the story of three women held captive and brutalized for a decade in Cleveland. He was out-sensationalized and out-tawdried this week despite his own best efforts and those of his committee colleagues and staff members. That is not to say that the tragic events that unfolded last year in Benghazi are not worthy of serious investigation. They just didn't get them from Issa's committee. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in her passionate testimony in December, we need to know what went wrong to prevent future tragedies. That's why she began an investigation immediately after the attacks. But Issa and his co-inquisitors were more interested in the arithmetic of 2016 presidential politics than with the events of last September 11 in Libya. The testimony of Gregory Hicks, the former Libya deputy chief of mission, was striking and at times moving, and offered useful additional perspectives. He said he had suffered negative repercussions because he challenged the State Department line on what happened in Benghazi. But even while some of what he said was new and resonant, the Republicans on the committee weren't listening. They focused less on learning what could have been done differently than on trying to establish that Clinton and her closest associates had tried to cover up the tragedy. John King: Benghazi investigation both legitimate and partisan . On this point, very little was revealed that was either material or new. Hicks said a Clinton aide had been angry at him over how he conducted himself with investigators after the incident. He disputed the way the attack and its origins were depicted by senior officials on television. He deplored the losses that took place. But to say that any of this points at a cover-up ""has all the elements of Pulitzer Prize-class fiction attached to it,"" as former Ambassador Thomas Pickering, co-chairman of the committee that first investigated the attacks suggested. That Clinton's team might want to have a clear sense of how what was clearly a politically motivated congressional investigation was being conducted seems only logical and responsible. That the origins of the attack were framed as related to an inflammatory amateur video that appeared on the Internet has long ago been established as wrong and misguided. That the losses were terrible and that U.S. diplomatic outposts in dangerous places need more security is absolutely true, and if they really cared about such things, Issa and his team would devote more of their attention to reaching consensus on how to find the funding needed to ensure that security is available . Nothing spoken of in the hearing suggested a cover-up by a Cabinet secretary, who instantly took personal responsibility for the attacks and swiftly appointed an independent commission led by two of the most distinguished, nonpartisan career civil servants in recent American history to investigate them. To say otherwise is more than a reach. It's an effort by the Republican Party to damage the person most likely to be the next Democratic presidential candidate. In the calculus of Washington today, Clinton is a bigger and more valuable target even than her former boss, the president. Having said that, it is almost certainly the case that the reason the initial focus in these hearings was not on the White House or elsewhere in the executive branch was that there was no evidence of a cover-up or of a politically spinning of the post-Benghazi message there either. Indeed, even Republican Sen. Bob Corker said that having reviewed all the evidence he felt there was nothing new to be revealed by these latest hearings. No, this is just the latest example of the fine Washington art of promoting an enduring scandal out of not very much, demonstrating the ability of microphones in congressional hearings to turn scattered inconclusive facts and emotion into innuendo and blips in opinion polls. That the process also debases and, perversely, distracts from the very serious issues associated with protecting our diplomats and our interests overseas is hardly important, it seems, to the political attack dogs whose appetites are so insatiable that any nutrition-free scrap of half-truth looks like a meal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Benghazi hearing upstaged by Jodi Arias verdict, Cleveland story .

"(CNN) -- Britain's prestigious Royal Ascot has increased its prize money to a record $7.5 million, in an effort to attract the top race horses from around the world. The country's premier five-day racing festival -- home to Queen Elizabeth's namesake race, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes -- has boosted its prize money by a whopping $756,750 on last year. The world-renowned meeting, which attracts a ""who's who"" list of royal and celebrity guests, will now also honor Prince William with a race named after him. But despite the prestige associated with Ascot, its prize money still lags behind the rest of the world. The richest horse racing event on the planet, the Dubai World Cup, kicks off later this month with a total prize pool of $27 million, for nine group races. Similarly, the U.S. Breeders' Cup races offer combined prize money of $25 million, while France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe has a purse of $12.6 million. ""We have seen some remarkable racing at Ascot in recent years and whilst the importance of winning at Royal Ascot both in terms of prestige and in value to the bloodstock industry can't be denied, increasing prize money is equally crucial to attracting the best horses to run in a highly competitive market,"" Ascot chief executive Charles Barnett said. ""It is very important to us to have a significant minimum amount on offer, and we have set that at Â£60,000 ($90,700)."" It may not offer the same cash as other international competitions, but Royal Ascot last year attracted the top four rated race horses in the world -- Frankel, Cirrus Des Aigles, Black Caviar and Excelebration. Retired British champion Frankel, who won 14 races on the trot, chose Royal Ascot's Champion Stakes to make his final appearance, drawing a sellout crowd of 32,000. Australian super mare Black Caviar, who remains unbeaten in a remarkable 23 consecutive races, made her Ascot debut with a nailbiting win in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes. That flagship race remains capped at $756,750 -- compared to $10 million for Dubai's premier World Cup race -- but prize purses for the St James's Palace stakes and Coronation Stakes will rise from $378,000 to $530,000 each. The total prize money on offer at Ascot throughout 2013 is now just over $20 million. This year Queen Elizabeth's grandson William, who is expecting his first child with wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, will have extra reason to celebrate after the Windsor Forest Stakes was renamed the Duke of Cambridge Stakes in his honor. Pomp and pageantry define the historic track, with the royal family arriving each June in a lavish horse-drawn carriage. So highly regarded is tradition and decorum at Ascot, that last year organizers even had dress code administrators on hand to assess the thousands of people who descend on the Berkshire venue -- with a strict list of dos and don'ts issued to prevent standards slipping. The Royal Enclosure, where Her Majesty watches all five days of the meeting, is where the most stringent regulations are enforced -- including a ban on the widely popular fascinator headpieces.","Britain's Royal Ascot increases prize money to record $7.5 million .

"(CNN) -- Finland has become the first country in the world to make broadband internet access a legal right for all citizens. The legislation, which came into effect Thursday, forces telecom operators to provide a reasonably priced broadband connection with a downstream rate of at least one megabit per second (mbs) to every permanent residence and office, the Finnish government said in a statement. ""From now on a reasonably priced broadband connection will be everyone's basic right in Finland,"" said Finnish communications minister Suvi Linden. ""This is absolutely one of the government's most significant achievements in regional policy and I am proud of it. ""I hope that people will make use of the opportunity and turn to telecom operators in the area they live."" The ""universal service obligation"" as it is known means broadband access is considered a staple commodity alongside services such as telephone and postal services, according to the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (FICORA). FICORA said it had assigned 26 telecommunications companies as universal service providers across the nation. It said a monthly fee of Euros 30 to 40 (around $37 to $47) would be reasonable in most cases. Finland is one of the world's most wired nations, and numbers corporations such as telecommunications giant Nokia among its successes. Laura Vilkkonen, legislative counselor for the Ministry of Transport and Communications, told CNN in October 2009 that 95 percent of the population has some form of internet access. Statistics released by the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development) for December 2009 put broadband penetration in Finland at 26.7 percent, compared to 26.4 per cent for the United States. The Netherlands and Denmark ranked equal first at 37.1 percent each. A report issued by the European Union in November last year stated that 24 percent of the EU population had a broadband access line subscription in July 2009. It added that 80 per cent of broadband lines in the EU had download speeds of two mbs or greater. Simon Hooper and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report .","Minister: Reasonably priced broadband connection will be everyone's basic right in Finland .

"(CNN) -- From the ""Three Represents"" to the ""Harmonious Society,"" Beijing has long been fond of clunky political slogans. But the ""Chinese Dream,"" widely considered as the governing catchphrase of Chinese President Xi Jinping, has a decidedly more captivating ring. Xi started using the expression even before he took office. ""The great revival of the Chinese nation is the greatest Chinese Dream,"" he said in November last year. And in March, in his keynote speech to the National People's Congress soon after his formal appointment as president, Xi said: ""We must make persistent efforts, press ahead with indomitable will, continue to push forward the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to achieve the Chinese Dream of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" But what does that really mean? ""I think what this means is that China wants to create a more egalitarian society,"" says Jing Ulrich, JPMorgan's managing director and chairman of global markets, China. ""We have a lot of people in the last 20 years who have gotten extraordinarily wealthy. But lots of people have been left behind. So I think this means that we need to improve the income of the lower segments of society, not just creating an elite."" Along an old hutong alleyway in Beijing, we also approached a few Chinese citizens for their interpretation. Li Lei, a 27-year-old makeup artist says: ""For me, the Chinese Dream is to buy a house in Beijing and to settle down here."" Sarah Shi, a 25-year-old hostel receptionist, adds: ""My dream is to have enough money to reunite with my family, and not having to travel so far away for jobs."" Meanwhile, 47-year-old shopkeeper Li Jianjie tells us his biggest dream is just having access to medical care. Ending poverty . For Xi, the Chinese Dream is to keep the economy growing. In the last three decades, China has lifted some 600 million people out of poverty. To continue to power ahead, China must reinvent itself from an export machine to a consumer economy. That won't be easy. ""We cannot rely on investments, building a lot of infrastructure, factories, real estate... We have to really shift to a service-driven economy,"" says Ulrich. She adds: ""Aspirational consumers are everywhere in China, but they need to feel more secure by the future so that they can save less and spend more."" Corruption challenge . Apart from building a strong social safety net, there are many more challenges for Beijing like cleaning up China's air and combating rampant corruption. ""People today are looking for things that are more than just about their pocketbook,"" says Evan Osnos, China correspondent for The New Yorker. ""They have a richer conception of what 'the good life' means. They say, for instance, 'I want to live in a city where the air is cleaner.' People also say, 'if I go to court, I want to be confident that I can get a reasonable judgment where the judge hasn't been bribed or perhaps hasn't been politically influenced.' ""So that's where it starts to get into a political issue,"" says Osnos. ""In order to satisfy people's economic demands, there's going to have to be political reform of some kind. And that's where it gets hard for the party."" Beijing is up against a wall, and has been forced to recognize that its people want more. Real reform? Senior diplomat Wu Jianmin, who has served as China's ambassador to the United Nations among other posts, says: ""If you look at President Xi Jinping's speech, if you look at the Party Congress Report, you can see they talk loud about political reform."" ""Xi Jinping was very clear on that. We need rule of law and democracy."" But as China pursues its vision for its place in the world, some worry it is becoming expansionist and aggressive -- especially regarding territorial claims at sea. But Xi says his government's intentions are purely peaceful. At a recent speech in Moscow, he said the Chinese Dream ""will not only benefit the Chinese people but will benefit the people of the whole world."" Xi has the next decade to show us what his dreams are really made of. CNN's Yuli Yang contributed to this report .","Chinese President Xi Jinping says the country must pursue the Chinese Dream .
Question remains, what is the Chinese Dream and is it attainable?
Beijingers tell us they dream of buying a house, to work closer to home and have medical care .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray held a news conference -- together -- to announce that they reached a deal on the federal budget, the ideological opposites received immediate praise for their cooperation. And they reached their agreement that would avert a potential government shutdown in January just two days before the Congressionally imposed deadline for doing so. The proposal that was heading for final congressional approval in the Senate on Wednesday is being held up for all to see as a rare illustration of bipartisanship in a deeply divided Washington that could lead to greater Congressional comity. It's ""an important step in helping to heal some of the wounds here in Congress,"" Murray said when she announced the agreement with Ryan. No-drama budget vote: How can this be? While she suggested the act of working together has the potential to influence the mood in Congress to be more agreeable, the deal removes a significant obstacle that has led to legislative gridlock so far this decade. For the next two years, Congress has a binding restriction on the amount of money it can spend. The deal split the difference between the amount that Republicans and Democrats wanted to spend -- $1.012 trillion for 2014 and $1.014 trillion for 2015. ""This means we can fund the operations of government through regular, annual appropriations bills, instead of through last-minute, stop-gap bills that put the government on autopilot,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who sits at the head of the Appropriations Committee. A big deal . That's a big deal. It's the first time that a budget agreement has passed a divided House and the Senate since 1986, according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""Gridlock has got to end and it is ending,"" Reid told reporters. ""It's really a step forward."" But will it end gridlock? ""No,"" Congressional scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution said. ""I don't expect it to have any lasting consequences,"" Mann said. The budget agreement only solves part of the problem. While it sets spending levels, it doesn't actually allocate the money and doesn't specify how the money can be spent. That battle will begin immediately. Appropriations Committee members must agree before January 15 -- the deadline set by Congress in October for a new spending plan to be in place -- on how to divvy up the money. For instance, Republicans will want more money for the military. Democrats will want more money for Head Start programs. ""We may not even be through with this,"" Mann said. And that's not the only issue of contention to be worked out in January alone. Extended unemployment insurance benefits are set to expire December 28, which will leave 1.3 million people without benefits and hit another 800,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the looming deadline, the issue was shelved in order to reach a budget deal. Reid vowed to address the issue immediately upon the Senate's return in January. Republicans, however, are not keen on the extending the already expanded program. Again? Before the budget deal even becomes law, signs of serious strife are already emerging around the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit, which is expected to be tapped in February. Since 2010, the debt limit has sparked partisan fights and near-government shutdowns as Republicans want an increase in the debt ceiling tied to spending cuts. ""I can't imagine the Republicans want another fight on debt ceiling,"" Reid told reporters Tuesday. But they are. And the foundation is being laid for a major battle in the new year. ""We don't want nothing out of this debt limit,"" Ryan said Sunday on Fox News. Over in the Senate, the sentiment is similar. A top Republican indicated that he expects his caucus to push for concessions related to reducing government spending. ""Every time the President asks us to raise the debt ceiling is a good time to try to achieve something important for the country,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. An election year . Further complicating this so-called season of bipartisanship is that 2014 is an election year, historically a time when less gets accomplished in Congress as lawmakers become even more risk averse and spend even more time fund-raising and campaigning. Lawmakers up for re-election are reluctant to take risky votes. And a decent indicator of how Congress deals with next year's prickly battles is that all seven Republican Senators facing primary challengers in 2014 were opponents of the budget deal. And in the House, where all members are up for reelection, primary challengers are also common, forcing lawmakers to appeal to party activists often by shunning compromise. And that is unlikely to subside. Even though House Speaker John Boehner surprisingly criticized conservative groups publicly last week, no one on Capitol Hill expects the Ohio Republican to become the champion of bipartisanship. To be determined . A host of issues still need to be worked out, including the Farm Bill, which affects the price consumers pay for groceries, payments to doctors who see Medicare patients, and immigration. And even the budget deal were to be reworked post-passage. Some lawmakers, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, vow to reverse a provision that reduces retirement benefits for military families. Mann said the budget deal is a singular instance of cooperation because it played into both parties best interests. Both parties avoided being labeled obstructionists and extremists. ""This isn't about good feelings among members but strategic behavior by two parties,"" Mann said. Bipartisanship is, ultimately, a partisan play. Military retirees 'screwed' in budget deal . CNN's Gregory Wallace and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Bipartisan budget deal first to pass divided Congress since 1986 .
It could pave the way for future bipartisanship .
But contentious issues and an election year could hamper progress ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor years ago said she was a ""product of affirmative action"" when she was admitted to prestigious universities, but defended the contributions she offered as a Hispanic woman to classroom and workplace diversity. ""I am the perfect affirmative action baby,"" Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor said in the 1990s. The statements were part of newly released videos of speeches and panel discussions dating from the mid-1980s that the 54-year-old federal judge provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will begin confirmation hearings July 13. The remarks offer often-candid insights into the New York native's views on the law, growing up poor in a Bronx housing project, juggling a career and a social life, and her 1980s divorce. In an early 1990s panel with two other female judges, Sotomayor talked about her educational background and how it helped her in her job as a federal trial judge in Manhattan. ""I am a product of affirmative action,"" she said. ""I am the perfect affirmative action baby. I am Puerto Rican, born and raised in the south Bronx. My test scores were not comparable to my colleagues at Princeton and Yale. Not so far off so that I wasn't able to succeed at those institutions."" She said that using ""traditional numbers"" from test scores, ""it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted."" The female panel members politely objected to her characterizations of how she overcame such obstacles, pointing out she graduated from law school with honors and was on the prestigious law review. Sotomayor countered that those were signs test scores alone do not offer the full measure of a person's capability. Test scores, she said, often can be the result of ""cultural biases."" In a 1986 interview with ABC News profiling young female professionals, Sotomayor said she constantly had to deal with subtle forms of discrimination, particularly when it came to public perceptions. ""I found in my experiences that it's not that men are consciously discriminating against promoting women, but I do believe as people we have self-images about what's good,"" she said. ""What's quote-unquote a 'good' lawyer, doctor, or whatever the profession is. And if you're a male who grew up professionally in a male-dominated profession then your image of what a good lawyer is is a male image."" Years later on the federal bench, Sotomayor said she encountered similar treatment from older white men particularly, who seemed to speak longer to her than other lawyers. She said the impression she got was that was because she was a woman and a minority. Sotomayor has been criticized by some conservatives for her remarks on diversity, and her 2001 comment that she ""would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" In the legal panel, she rejected suggestions that minorities should accept ""selection by merit alone."" She noted, ""It is critical that we promote diversity"" by giving women and minorities more opportunities in the law and the judiciary. ""Since I have difficulty defining merit and what merit alone means -- and in any context, whether it's judicial or otherwise -- I accept that different experiences in and of itself, bring merit to the system,"" she said. ""I think it brings to the system more of a sense of fairness when these litigants see people like myself on the bench."" As a judge she offered a variety of thoughts on how a judge should act on the bench. ""I have to unhook myself from my emotional responses and try to stay within my unemotional objective persona,"" she told a group of Hispanic lawyers in 2000. She said in 1994 that such an attitude can be hard to maintain, when as a trial judge she had to deal with some defendants and their families. ""I watch those mothers cry and I can't help but feel their pain. Does that translate into a passion or compassion that affects my judgment? No, but it makes it much more important for me to be careful when I exercise my judgment."" In another panel she noted that she sometimes spoke to some defendants and their families in Spanish in civil cases, to keep them informed of what she was doing. She said she made sure to translate what she was saying into English. In several events she said the life of a lawyer is rarely glamorous. In a 1986 interview she admitted her divorce was caused in part by her commitment to her career, and that her subsequent social life had suffered as a result. And as she grew into her 30s, she lamented her earlier expectations had to that point not been fully realized. ""I'm very happy with where I am at this point in my life but I think my expectations were greater in '76,"" when she graduated from Princeton. ""I mean, I really expected to turn the world on fire.""","Remarks from an early 1990s panel with two other female judges .

"Washington (CNN) -- It is a lesson from the ages: Lawmakers like to talk. Even in this advanced age when thoughtlets, capped at 140 characters, are tweeted as discourse, politicians still tend to prattle on. So here's a cue from Abraham Lincoln: Cut it short. When Lincoln took the stage, 150 years ago November 19, to offer a dedication at a cemetery for war dead in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the story goes that he wasn't very popular. He didn't even have top billing at the event. Lincoln had been asked to ""please offer a few appropriate remarks."" He settled on about 200 words. Obama's no-show at Gettysburg event: snub or smart? The keynote address was given by Edward Everett, the Massachusetts statesman hailed at the time as one of the nation's greatest orators. Ever hear of him today? Everett spoke for more than two hours. Lincoln spoke for a little more than two minutes. ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,"" Lincoln said, ironically; the Gettysburg Address is now regarded as one of the most elegant, thoughtful and well-crafted speeches in American history. The words are etched in stone next to his statue at the Lincoln Memorial. 150 years later, newspaper retracts editorial panning Gettysburg Address . That's a strong case for brevity. And it's a case Lincoln seems to have learned during the course of his very difficult presidency. His first inaugural address, at 3,670 words, was delivered as he tried to keep the nation together. It was far longer than either of President Barack Obama's. But Lincoln's second inaugural address, at 700 words, delivered after years of war, is considered by many to be the best inaugural speech in U.S. history, and is also one of the shortest. It included one of the most important one-liners in history, with the South beaten but not yet surrendered, and as the nation started a very long and difficult healing process. ""With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" The shortest inaugural address in history was delivered by George Washington as he entered his second term. This one perhaps goes too far. It was just 135 words and didn't include any talk of policy, just a promise to adhere to the oath of office. But the longest is a cautionary tale against over-speechifying. William Henry Harrison spoke 8,460 words, caught pneumonia and died a month later. Fast-forward 150 years from Lincoln's 200 words in Gettysburg. When Obama took to the podium in the White House briefing room Thursday and took a question from CBS News' Major Garrett -- granted, it was a two-parter -- he went on for a full six minutes before Garrett asked a follow-up. The news conference went on for about 50 minutes. Love the president or hate him, you've got to admit he can talk. It is hard to imagine a modern-day speech gaining the historical importance of something like the Gettysburg Address. Ronald C. White Jr. is a Lincoln scholar who has paid particular attention to Lincoln's speeches. He's author of ""A. Lincoln,"" a biography of the 16th president. Lincoln's great short speeches, he argued, were different from modern-day addresses in a number of ways, not the least of which is the teleprompter. ""Speeches are meant to be said, not read,"" White said. He feels Obama does better when he engages with an audience, speaking from the heart like when he's campaigning rather than reading from a teleprompter. ""When he does that, I don't think he's nearly as effective as when he doesn't,"" White said of Obama. ""He's more engaged."" Presidents' best phrases are tweetable . He said Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address and had it memorized, although he took text out of his breast pocket before delivering it. Another problem today, according to White: speechwriters. ""It's almost like a committee where everyone involved in the writing process wants to get their points in."" Speeches today also feel too crowded, he said. ""In the second inaugural, everybody expected Lincoln to talk about the policy of the government ... he didn't offer any policies. He gave a speech that offered the moral imperative. The policy would follow later."" We know Obama takes great care in editing the speeches drafted by his speechwriters. There is a remarkable photo of all the revisions in his own hand on one sheet of a 2010 address to a joint session of Congress. See it here . The Library of Congress has posted drafts of the speech, written in Lincoln's hand, on its website. See it here . White wishes today that speeches were printed in the newspaper so that people could actually read them and get at what the lawmaker is saying. After he watches a speech on TV, he said, the first thing he does is turn off the TV. ""We don't read speeches anymore,"" complained White, who is of the mind that instant analysis on TV keeps people from really digesting what was said. But the largest problem for lawmakers giving speeches isn't a shortening collective attention span or political pundits or teleprompters. It's the lack of trust in politicians and the institutions of government. ""We're cynical,"" White said. ""We're cynical about speeches and about words.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Darrel Folkert of Redondo Beach, California, stood next to a mailbox near the finish line of the Boston Marathon to cheer on his wife as she completed the race. Moments later he was suddenly thrown by a loud explosion that shattered windows behind him, lifted tables from their foundations and tossed chairs along the sidewalk. ""He was standing right next to the mailbox when it exploded,"" his wife, Jac Bost, told CNN in a phone interview. The mailbox, one of the only objects left intact after the second explosion and the site where authorities have focused their investigation, may have saved Folkert's life. He suffered non-life-threatening puncture wounds to the leg and returned last week to Los Angeles, where he is recovering, Bost said. Bombings destroy dancer's foot, but not her spirit . Folkert and Bost, both 42, are avid ultra-marathon runners, competing in events with distances of up to 50 miles. Bost, a marketing executive, was competing in her seventh Boston Marathon and was less than a quarter mile away from the finish line when she heard a loud boom. She said organizers stopped her as word spread of an explosion and people began frantically running away from the scene. At first, she did not know what had happened to her husband, but strangers lent her a phone so she could contact him. Meanwhile, two men carried an injured Folkert to a nearby store, where they called 911 and lent him a phone to call relatives, she said. ""It was the extreme generosity of people of Boston who offered to help that deserve the praise in the aftermath of what happened,"" she said. Folkert, who is expected to fully recover, and Bost are hoping to locate the two men who treated him at the scene and the others who helped them reunite, Bost said. ""Everyone in the city of Boston was phenomenal, and I can't understate the level of generosity we received,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- People talk about all kinds of things on social media: Their day-to-day lives, articles generating a lot of buzz and the things they ate for breakfast. Some of the conversations by Facebook's 128 million daily users revolve around the news, and CNN now has the ability to take a peek into this world. Facebook has given CNN access to demographic data that tells us how many people have mentioned a topic along with age, gender and location information. We aren't actually reading through conversations, but rather looking at numbers that show us trends. Since we've just gotten this information, we thought we'd try something new. Each day, we'll be comparing two topics that show interesting trends in their demographic data. You might see that more women are talking about a particular topic than men, or that younger age groups are mentioning one news event versus another. While this isn't a scientific study, we hope pitting two topics against each other will give some perspective on these results. Sometimes, these numbers can show us things we don't expect. For example, we recently learned that many of the Facebook users talking about Iran were young people, especially internationally. We also found a similar trend in ages among the people talking about the government shutdown. Looking at Facebook mentions can give us insights that would be hard to get in any other way. Check back here to see new charts about topics in the news and popular conversation, and if you have ideas you want us to look into, let us know in the comments below.","What are people talking about?

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington has started an unpopular tradition: wreaking havoc with the holidays. And it's possible it could happen again this year. With less than a month before the New Year, doctors who treat Medicare patients don't yet know how much the government will reimburse them, parents aren't sure if their local Head Start program will turn away students, civilians in the military don't know how many days they could be furloughed, and families can't yet estimate the price of milk. All because Congress hasn't finished its work on must-pass legislation. Unfortunately, it's becoming an annual occurrence. A year ago, Congress spent the holidays battling over the ""fiscal cliff."" Lawmakers worked early into New Year's Day to prevent the combustible mix of tax increases and budget cuts, which experts warned would have damaged the economy. The previous year, Congress worked on Christmas Eve to craft a short-term deal to avoid an increase in the payroll tax, a decrease in unemployment benefits, and a cut to doctor payments for Medicare patients. And in 2010, lawmakers and Obama broke a rancorous stalemate by reaching a breakthrough agreement a full 10 days before Christmas to extend George W. Bush's expiring tax cuts. In 2009, the Senate was in session on Christmas Eve voting on the Affordable Care Act. Congress and the President are once again on course to shake up the holidays. Milk and food . The Farm Bill, which sets the nation's food policy and priorities, is two years overdue. Congress has been passing short-term extensions instead of the usual five-year plan, but key negotiators now say a short-term fix is not an option. If it fails to pass a Farm Bill, the economic impact for ordinary Americans could be quite severe. The price of milk would more than double to an estimated $7 per gallon as government subsidies expire. The cost of food overall would go up, with supports for commodities such as corn and wheat also running out. Washington gridlock risks $7 milk . Another huge factor: food stamps. The Farm Bill authorizes spending for that program. House Republicans want to drop 3.8 million people from those rolls next year -- about 8% of recipients - while Senate Democrats aren't keen on those cuts. But they would likely have to agree to some reductions for a deal to be reached. Doctors and their patients . For doctors, the holidays are a stressful time if they see Medicare patients. That's because their reimbursements are caught up in political wrangling and budget negotiations. It's called the ""doc fix"" and they would see a 24% reduction in their reimbursements if Congress fails to act. While there is bipartisan support for doctors to receive payments in full, there is plenty of disagreement between the two parties on how to pay for the costly program. The latest estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the ""doc fix"" would cost $138 billion over the next decade. While that's far lower than the $316 billion the CBO projected the previous year, it's still hard to find an extra $138 billion lying around. The House announced a path forward but the Senate has not. It's unclear how this issue will be resolved. If Congress fails to fully reimburse them, doctors have threatened to stop seeing Medicare patients. That's not a viable option as more and more baby boomers sign up for Medicare every day. Defense and diplomas . A group of bipartisan, bicameral negotiators are working on a deal to fund the government for 2014. They have until December 13, the self-imposed deadline. The group formed as part of an agreement to reopen the government after a 16-day shutdown in October. Congressional budget talks at critical point . While the two committee leaders say they are making progress, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, one of the House Democrats on the conference committee, threw cold water on any imminent budget deal, telling CNN the talks ""are going way too slowly."" One key issue is the next round of annual, across-the-board spending cuts -- also known as the sequester. Those reductions this time would total $110 billion and run for the entire fiscal year. The 2013 reductions took effect in March and ran through September, and agencies would be more limited in manipulating their budgets to account for spending reductions, according to a report by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress. Sequester cuts have had a wide-ranging impact on adult job training programs, schools for low-income students, civilian defense contractors and military readiness, the report says. But that was for 2013. The role of the sequester on schoolchildren, service members and job seekers is still unclear as Congress has yet to agree on what the budget would look like. The 2014 fiscal year began two months ago. Patients and patience . For millions of Americans who buy health insurance in the individual marketplace and for the uninsured, the option of receiving health care is supposed to be available this holiday season. While the Obama administration has said the federal website, HealthCare.gov, for people to sign up for coverage is working much better, it's clear that problems still exist. Officials warn glitches will persist and describe the online site as an ever-evolving work in progress. After website woes, White House to push benefits of Obamacare . If people can't complete their application on HealthCare.gov by December 23 -- two days before Christmas -- then they won't receive coverage on January 1, causing anxiety during an already stressful time of year. Congress and the President . In recent years, the holiday spirit has been lacking in Washington as acrimonious debates have taken over the season. A recent move by Senate Democrats to get rid of the filibuster for many presidential nominees -- the nuclear option -- could add to the season of partisanship on Capitol Hill. And displeasure with Obama's deal on Iran's nuclear program has added an additional layer of mistrust between the branches of government. The Grinch might have some competition this year. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Lisa Desjardins, Jim Acosta, Tom Cohen, and CNNMoney's Jennifer Liberto contributed to this report .","Congress has made a habit of working until the last minute to meet fiscal deadlines .

"(CNN) -- The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has issued a warning for a Big Island beach community threatened to be cut off by lava flow from Kilauea Volcano. Lava from a vent that opened on June 27 has come within a mile of the edge of the Ka'ohe Homesteads subdivision in the District of Puna, northeast of the volcano, Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi said. Kenoi signed an emergency proclamation Thursday and asked Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie for emergency assistance. ""We are taking this step to ensure our residents have time to prepare their families, their pets, and their livestock for a safe and orderly evacuation from Ka'ohe in the event the flow continues to advance,"" Kenoi said in a news release. Highway 130 separates the district of Puna from the rest of the county. The U.S. Geological Survey predicted the lava could cross the highway in the next week. ""We project that lava could reach the Kaohe Homesteads boundary within 5 to 7 days,"" the USGS said Thursday. Since July 10, the lava has advanced at an average rate of 820 feet per day, but as fast as 1,600 feet per day, the agency said. ""When this occurs, communities south of the crossing will be isolated from the rest of the county,"" Kenoi said. The Icelandic town frozen in time by a volcano . Evacuations had not been ordered as of Friday morning, but Hawaii County's civil defense restricted access to roads to the Ka'ohe community, civil defense administrator Darryl Oliveira said. ""Only residents will be allowed on the subdivision roads starting today, and we ask that nonresidents stay away from the area,"" Oliveira said. ""The lava cannot be seen from the subdivision, and there is no reason for nonresidents to be in the Ka'ohe subdivision at this time."" Volcano erupts in Papua New Guinea . More than 8,211 people live in the threatened area, according to a 2010 census. Kilauea Volcano has been active since 1983, with 61 USGS-recorded eruptions. ""Kilauea ranks among the world's most active volcanoes and may even top the list,"" the agency said. In 1983, lava from Kilauea destroyed 16 homes in the Royal Gardens subdivision, a community built on a slope downhill from the volcano. Today, only 35% of the abandoned development can be seen.

"(CNN) -- The impeachment of Iranian science minister Reza Faraji-Dana last month was just the latest episode in an ongoing struggle between so-called moderates and hard-liners that has been going on in the country since the 1979 revolution. It's a bad sign for those pinning their hopes on the ability of President Hassan Rouhani to bring about change in Iran. Tensions between reformists and conservatives have never quite brought the Islamic Republic to a breaking point, but they have been the source of economic malaise and internal instability. Unfortunately, as tempting as it has been to view Rouhani's election last year as a solution to Iran's endemic political battles, his presidency is actually likely to perpetuate -- if not increase -- the dysfunction within the Iranian regime. Indeed, even a possible nuclear deal -- which itself is far from certain at this point -- is unlikely to be enough to provide Rouhani with a decisive political victory. Instead, it might simply dredge up the angst and anxiety that culminated in the Green Movement in 2009. Hard-line parliamentarians managed to muster the numbers to impeach Faraji-Dana for his supposedly ""un-revolutionary"" educational policies, specifically his welcoming back of students and faculty associated with what hardline conservatives deem to be the ""seditious"" Green uprising. The previous government, under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had purged the universities of reformist elements and introduced an atmosphere into academia reminiscent of the early revolutionary years, and while Rouhani hasn't enacted any major reforms since his election, higher education reform was seen as a first move in delivering on his campaign promises. Hard-liners have generally been critical of Rouhani's nuclear negotiations, but are believed to have been restrained in their attacks on the urging of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- while conservatives don't wish to empower Rouhani, they are also conscious of Iran's precarious economic situation and are therefore reluctant to block Rouhani's diplomatic efforts, for now at least. But they are loathe to give Rouhani freedom of movement on domestic issues. For them, the ""sedition"" of 2009 was a direct challenge to the Islamic Republic as a whole. And while Rouhani condemned the 2009 uprising, he has nevertheless maintained working relations with key reformist figures such as former President Mohammad Khatami. Yet, although a large constituency for change exists throughout Iranian society, represented by regime reformists and centrists like Rouhani as well as secular, nationalist and leftist opposition groups vigorously oppressed by the regime, it is still unclear what could actually prompt change in Iran. After all, Iranians are well aware of the Middle East burning before them. But their country, while divided and dysfunctional, is at least relatively secure and stable. And while Rouhani suggests the possibility of political evolution, the failure of the reform/centrist movement in achieving meaningful change is also obvious. The reality for Iran is that neither revolution nor evolution might be feasible for Iran. So what is left? The eventual passing of Khamenei might one day provide an opportunity for change, but even then, the chances of a succession remaining cordial or even peaceful are hardly guaranteed, especially given the current environment of political animosity. Iran's competing factions see an uncertain future as they seek to position themselves for the post-Khamenei era, including Rouhani's ally and patron, former President Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is reportedly keen to reclaim the chairmanship of the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body with the power to appoint the next supreme leader. However, it is difficult to imagine conservatives accepting Rafsanjani or Rouhani being left in a position to shape the succession to Khamanei, as this could open the door to meaningful reforms -- and (at least as far as conservatives are concerned) the end of the Islamic Republic in its current form. All this suggests that Faraji-Dana's impeachment is very likely a sign of some troubling times to come. And even though Rouhani offers the West's best hope of the nuclear issue being addressed, a deal could very well energize the President's rivals in their bid to stave off change.","Reza Faraji-Dana, former Iranian science minister, was impeached last month .

"(CNN) -- If you are already in college or headed there, sit down. If you're the parent or friend of a student, listen up. One in five college women will be raped, or experience an attempted rape, before graduation. Less than 5 percent will report these crimes to officials on or off campus, and, when they do, there's a good chance the system will let them down. A handful of former students who spoke out and reported rapes at their schools told CNN they didn't feel protected by their universities. They were initially interviewed as part of an investigative series by the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based nonprofit that says it seeks to make institutions more transparent and accountable. The women welcomed the chance to share their experiences and offer advice to students today. ""I was too young, still in too much shock and too emotionally gone to make decisions on my own,"" said a woman who, as a freshman, reported a rape in 2001. ""I needed an adult I trusted. The school did not provide such a person."" The shocking statistics of rape and attempted rape on campus came to light in a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice  nine years ago. But the recently released series published by the Washington center shows that while federal law requires schools to act on sexual assault allegations and look out for the rights of victims, many higher-education institutions aren't making the grade. ""Schools are aware it's a problem, a big problem,"" said Kristen Lombardi, the center's lead reporter for Sexual Assault on Campus: A Frustrating Search for Justice. She pointed to a ""culture of silence"" and said critics say, ""The biggest sin is one of omission. They're just not dealing with this issue head-on in a public manner with their student bodies."" Over the course of nine months, Lombardi and her colleagues spoke to 33 women who'd reported rapes, interviewed about 50 experts and surveyed more than 150 crisis clinics and programs on or near campuses. They also reviewed cases and combed through 10 years of complaints against institutions that had been filed with the Department of Education. The alleged rape victims and others shared stories of secretive hearings, administrators who encouraged students to drop complaints and failures to sufficiently pursue the accusations and seek punishments when warranted. Others spoke of gag orders, confidential mediations where women sat across from their attackers and feelings of being revictimized at the institutions they thought would help them. Many said administrators appeared more concerned with protecting their employer, or the school's reputation, than they were with protecting students. A number of women ended up leaving their universities. One student in the investigative series was written about posthumously, after killing herself. Part of the problem stems from ignorance, said S. Daniel Carter, the director of public policy for Security on Campus, a national organization committed to advancing safety for students. For one, he said acquaintance rapes, which dominate campus assaults, are often wrongly dismissed as ""misunderstandings."" And lack of coordination when it comes to responses isn't helped by the fact that too few school officials are trained to understand the impact of sexual assaults. ""People are going to do the best they can, but they only have limited knowledge based on their profession,"" said Connie Kirkland of George Mason University in Virginia, a school that's emerged as a model for others. Kirkland, the school's director of sexual assault services, has held this position since the office was established in 1993, making it among the first of its kind. She said the university jumped to action soon after then-Gov. Douglas Wilder issued in 1992 recommendations regarding campus sexual assaults. And while other Virginia schools made efforts early on, Kirkland said that when Wilder left office in 1994, most schools folded their programs. Meantime, budgetary woes at schools across the country mean the programs that do exist often come and go, she added. Kirkland said nothing serves victims better than having a clear point of contact on campus, an office and professionals who are trained -- and can train others -- to understand all aspects of these sexual assault crimes, including legal options, the psychological toll and health concerns. A compassionate and well-meaning professor, administrator or residential adviser, for example, may listen, but they can't be expected to provide full-fledged therapy or tell a student what it means to file a police report or go to court, she said. And a therapist can't offer legal navigation any better than a law enforcement officer can be responsible for emotional processing. The women who spoke to CNN described what they would have done differently if they'd known then what they know now. In general practice, CNN does not name sexual assault victims. Here, in their own words, is their advice: . Feeling invincible, an age of denial and disbelief . ""I wish I'd been less trusting of my surroundings,"" said a woman who said she was assaulted as a sophomore in 2007. ""In college, you feel as if you are invincible, when in reality, trouble could be hiding behind the façade of a casual get-together or a party where you feel completely safe. Always keep control of yourself and your surroundings, and keep a close eye out for your friends as well. ""And if you are a friend of a person who has been assaulted, all I can say is that though it might be hard, please listen and support that person,"" continued the former student, who said she was ""met with a response that I never expected -- laughter and disbelief. Because of that, I kept silent until my attacker assaulted a friend of mine almost a year later."" Said another rape victim: ""Do not binge drink or leave drinks unattended."" Reaching out elsewhere, protecting your interests . ""I wish I'd told my parents sooner,"" said a woman who reported a campus rape that happened in her dorm room in 2003. ""My parents now know about it, but when it initially happened, they did not. I was just so ashamed. ""You're too inhibited to make rational decisions, to understand emotionally what's going on,"" she added. ""Whether it's outside counsel, law enforcement, a friend or a parent, do not rely on the university to serve your best interests. And don't sign anything."" Seeking out professionals who understand . ""Get help from a professional as soon as possible. I spoke with a counselor at Victim's Assistance a few days after my assault, and that was crucial in helping me overcome this. There are a lot of different emotions after you are assaulted, and speaking with someone who really understands sexual assault is imperative,"" said a woman who reported a gang rape by athletes in 2001 when she was a sophomore. Furthermore, she said, ""Family members and friends are also victims when this happens to someone they care about. The technical term is 'secondary survivors.' Sometimes it is difficult for them to deal with their own emotions and still be supportive to the primary survivor. Secondary survivors should not be afraid to get professional help, or to speak with a counselor about their own feelings. That way, they are not projecting their emotions onto the primary survivor. Seeking professional help also gives you options, and it is important to know all of your options after you are assaulted so you can choose how to overcome this.""","Study: 1 in 5 college women victim of a rape or an attempt, but only 5 percent report crimes .

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese government force destroyed a church Monday, ignoring the wails of nearby residents, witnesses told journalists working for CNN. The attack came a day after authorities sent a letter saying they would demolish the church, priest Kuoa Shimal said. Government sources did not immediately return calls from CNN. Complaints about the predominantly Muslim country's lack of religious freedom came under the international spotlight recently after Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, a Christian mother of two, refused to renounce her faith and was sentenced to death. After an international outcry, she was freed and reunited with her American husband. The 70-strong force Monday arrived at the Alizba slums near the capital, Khartoum, around 10 a.m., witnesses said. Some were dressed in plain clothes. CNN visited the scene afterward, where the religious site was reduced to rubble. In April 2013, the Sudanese minister of religious affairs announced that no licenses would be granted to allow for the building of new churches -- less than two years after the predominantly Christian South Sudan seceded to form an independent country. During a brief territorial war between Sudan and South Sudan in April 2012, a mob of Islamist extremists attacked and destroyed a church west of Khartoum despite a police cordon around it. The threat of violence has caused Sudan's churches to empty. At a recent Sunday service, worshipers asked CNN not to identify them by name. ""The church is now contaminated with terror. You don't feel safe in prayer,"" one Christian activist said.","Witnesses: A Sudan government force destroyed a church near the capital .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The saga of billionaire Donald Sterling enters a new phase Monday when a California probate court trial examines his estranged wife's takeover of the couple's trust that owns the Los Angeles Clippers, which she is now trying to sell for a record $2 billion. It's been an operatic tale. Sterling slurred African-Americans in a taped conversation with a woman acquaintance. The National Basketball Association banned him and ordered the couple to sell the team. His wife, Shelly, negotiated a price that would be unprecedented for a sports franchise in North America. She did so as doctors certified Donald Sterling, 80, as incapacitated with early Alzheimer's or another brain disease. Questions persist, however, on whether the team's planned sale to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is a done deal, because Donald Sterling disputes his wife's authority in the negotiations. The couple own the NBA franchise through a trust. Will there be a trial on Monday? It's anybody's guess: Anything can happen in the Sterling saga -- and just about has. Donald Sterling now wants to move the controversy over the basketball team's proposed sale to federal court -- a legal move he made just before Friday's Fourth of July holiday. It's unclear whether he'll be successful -- or what impact the last-minute maneuver will have on Monday's scheduled trial in a state court in Los Angeles. Shelly Sterling's attorney described the move as desperation. ""Donald Sterling's 11th-hour attempt to move the probate trial into the federal courts is a desperate act by a desperate man,"" said Pierce O'Donnell. ""This latest bad-faith maneuver on the eve of his reckoning is a cowardly ploy to do just one thing: Kill a record-setting $2 billion sale of the Clippers,"" O'Donnell said. But Donald Sterling's attorney says federal court is the appropriate place to hear how the publicizing of his medical diagnosis ""trampled"" his privacy rights under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) -- which Shelly Sterling denies, saying the trust allowed for the information's release. ""While Shelly Sterling and her team will claim that this is merely a 'tactic,' we feel strongly that this important issue should be addressed by the federal court at this time,"" said lawyer Bobby Samini. ""While it has become popular to attack Donald Sterling for his regrettable comments, his right to privacy and to the protection of his medical records should not be acceptable collateral damage."" Even Ballmer has entered the dispute, with his attorney saying he would file papers to block what he called a frivolous move by Donald Sterling. The parties will be monitoring how the state and federal courts will proceed Monday. Will we hear more about Donald Sterling's mental issues? No. The trial will focus on Shelly Sterling's right to sell the Clippers and not Donald Sterling's mental capacity, attorneys for both sides say. Testimony will largely focus on how the couple own the team through a trust and whether procedures for removing one of the trust's owners -- namely Donald Sterling -- were followed. The trial, however, will address an accusation by Donald Sterling that his wife duped him into undergoing separate examinations by a neurologist and a specialist in geriatric psychiatry, who both judged him to be mentally incapacitated. Donald Sterling also disputes those findings. ""We are going to argue that their examinations were by way of undue influence, that their examinations were not complete, that there was fraud in the examinations, and the letters that they have issued do not comport with technical requirements that the trust requires,"" Samini said. Shelly Sterling maintains her husband's arguments about being tricked are baseless, her attorney said. ""There was no duping or whatever,"" O'Donnell said. ""Donald voluntarily went to ... get the brain scan."" Late last month, another doctor found Donald Sterling to be mentally fit, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. So what will the probate trial be all about? The court will hear five issues, according to court papers filed by Shelly Sterling. First, the court will determine whether the physicians' evaluations of Donald Sterling were obtained by fraud, undue influence or breach of fiduciary duty, as he claims. The court will then decide whether Shelly Sterling's May 29 contract to sell the team to Ballmer is binding. Even if the court doesn't affirm that, the judge will weigh whether the contract is nevertheless binding on the couple's trust because it's in the trust's best interest -- in other words, whether it's too great a deal to pass up. The court will then have to examine how Donald Sterling later revoked the trust in June -- in apparent retaliation for his wife negotiating a proposed deal to sell the team -- and whether his revocation prevents the sale of the team or the court's jurisdiction over the trust. Finally, the judge must decide whether to provide relief to prevent injury or loss. How did this deal ever get done? Facing pressure from the NBA, Donald Sterling signed a letter in May -- on the same day when one of the physicians examined him -- to the basketball league agreeing to the sale of the Clippers and authorizing his wife to negotiate the sale of the team. But Donald Sterling changed his mind on the entire controversy: He sued the NBA for $1 billion for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise. He then opposed the proposed sale of the team negotiated by his wife. What's the rush in all this? The contract between Shelly Sterling and Ballmer has a July 15 deadline to close the deal -- with a 30-day extension, if needed. At the same time, the Sterlings face a September 15 deadline to sell team, as set by the NBA. If not, the league may sell the franchise on its own or renew termination proceedings against the Clippers or both, according to NBA general counsel Richard W. Buchanan's statements in Shelly Sterling's court filings. Donald Sterling in CNN exclusive: I'm not a racist, I'm a giver .","Sterlings face a probate court trial in California on Monday .

"(CNN) -- The water is so clear you can see it from the surface. It's the Cayman Islands' newest tourist attraction, the USS Kittiwake. The Kittiwake is a Chanticleer-class submarine rescue ship that was part of the U.S. Navy's fleet until it was decommissioned in 1994. Now it's an artificial reef, one that Scuba Diving magazine says is a must for divers. ""It is definitely one of the top 10 purposely sunk wrecks because of its accessibility,"" says the magazine's editor, David Espinosa. ""It's in relatively shallow water and it's upright."" The Kittiwake was sunk a little over a year ago just off Grand Cayman's popular Seven Mile Beach. A five-minute boat ride brings divers to the site where the vessel's bottom sits about 60 feet down on the sandy floor of the Caribbean Sea. Getting the 251-foot-long ship to the bottom of the ocean was easy, unlike the effort to obtain the vessel. ""It was a pilot project and that was part of the complexity of it,"" says Nancy Easterbrook, who spearheaded the Kittiwake project on behalf of the Cayman Islands Tourism Association. The Caymans applied to the U.S. government to receive a decommissioned ship to use as an artificial reef, a process that was open for the first time to international applicants. Then Easterbrook journeyed to Norfolk, Virginia, to tour the available ships. She says choosing the USS Kittiwake was the easy part of her eight-year effort. ""She was a ship that served divers all of her life,"" she says, ""so it just seemed the appropriate ship."" Before the vessel could be transported to its new home, it had to be cleared of all military equipment, undergo an inspection for hazardous materials and pass environmental regulations in the United States and the Cayman Islands. As a submarine rescue vessel, the Kittiwake was home to many Navy divers during its 49 years of service. When built, it was outfitted with a recompression chamber, a diving bell and a diving locker. But the ship's highlight for most divers today is an unlikely place: the vessel's head. ""They've left the mirrors inside the bathrooms, so you can actually take a look at yourself while diving,"" says Jason Shaddox, an instructor with local dive company Don Foster's. But you don't have to be a diver to appreciate this new attraction. ""It's the only wreck I've been around where you can snorkel on it and see what we see as divers,"" Shaddox adds. ""The only thing you don't see as a snorkeler is what is inside."" In just over a year, a ship that might have ended up in the scrapheap has been transformed into a must-see for visitors. Inside there are five decks with the stairs intact. A dive will take you through the recreation room, mess hall, crew quarters, navigation room and up to the main deck, which sits about 15 feet from the water's surface. ""The warmth of the water and the visibility is incredible, so you can see the whole ship from the surface,"" says Easterbrook. ""It's kind of eerie because it's something that doesn't belong there but on the other hand, it's quite friendly to divers and snorkelers."" The vessel has also quickly become a friendly spot for marine life. Recently, the island was abuzz when a whale shark was spotted near the ship.","A decommissioned U.S. Navy ship has become a popular Cayman Islands dive site .

"(CNN) -- On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln commemorated a Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by vowing that ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" One hundred and fifty years later, document experts are going to great lengths to make sure that copies of his famous speech, handwritten by Lincoln himself, hold up as well as the words themselves. Five original versions of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address remain, and they are still used for research and study. But warm temperatures, light, humidity and even oxygen are enemies of old paper manuscripts. Presidents' best phrases are tweetable . ""There's nothing that compares to the original,"" said Michele Hamill, a paper and photograph conservator at Cornell University, which has one of the five copies of the speech. ""We need to find a balance between having these national treasures and wanting to make them widely available."" To make both possible, researchers have developed advanced preservation and replication techniques that include environmental sensors, high-quality scanners and specially built cases. Each of the five versions of the Gettysburg Address manuscript are slightly different. Called the Bancroft copy, Cornell's version has been through a lot. It was written out by Lincoln months after he gave his original speech and given to historian George Bancroft. It stayed in the Bancroft family for years before bouncing around between dealers and eventually ending up at Cornell. For a time, it had a cellophane cover. But the dealer who made the cover didn't realize that cellophane was actually damaging the prized document. Cellophane is very unstable, and within 10 to 15 years, the front of the document had experienced severe darkening. Luckily, other factors have helped the manuscript survive. 150 years later, newspaper retracts editorial panning Gettysburg Address . ""We're really fortunate that President Lincoln used a great quality writing paper and his formulation of ink was good,"" said Hamill. To keep the paper from deteriorating any further, Cornell carefully controlling its environment and limits its exposure to light. (Those ""No Flash Photography"" signs are not just a suggestion.) Since the university's copy is written on both sides of a single sheet of paper, they had to develop a special case that would allow people to view the whole text. Cornell created a custom case made out of UV-ray filtering plexiglass. Most of the time, the document is kept in a secure storage vault that's been specially designed for rare materials. There's almost no light in the vault, and it has a steady temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% relative humidity. Sensors constantly monitor the vault to keep the humidity and temperature steady. To mark the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's speech, Cornell is putting the original on display as part of a special exhibit. But even when shown to the public, the document is kept in low light -- just enough for visitors to read Lincoln's neat cursive handwriting without doing additional damage to the paper. Lesson from Lincoln: Mr. President, you're talking too much . Advanced imaging technology also has made it possible for libraries to make extremely high-resolution digital copies of historical documents. The Cornell scan is so good that they've printed out a near replica of their Gettysburg address to occasionally keep on display in place of the original (with full disclosure, of course). A digital copy means that people who wouldn't normally be able to make it to Cornell or the Library of Congress to see the originals in person can examine them up close online from anywhere. Researchers around the globe can do work from the digital scans without worrying about damaging a priceless artifact. Google has copies of all five drafts online for anyone to view and compare as part of its Cultural Institute. The preservation technology is even more elaborate at the Library of Congress. To protect their two copies of the Gettysburg Address, preservationists there fabricated custom cases with gaskets that purge all of the oxygen around the document and replace it with inert argon gas. When you take away the oxygen, you take away the potential of oxidation, which can erode the delicate original material. The argon encasements are also used for many of the older documents chronicling the founding of the United States, which are written on delicate parchment paper. It's likely that as students continue to study ""Four score and seven years ago,"" the technology used to preserve Lincoln's original documents will become even more advanced.

"(CNN) -- The popular microblogging site Twitter was hacked briefly by a group calling itself the Iranian Cyber Army, but the site was quickly restored after the incident early Friday. Those who tried to access Twitter were redirected to a site displaying a green flag and proclaiming, in English, ""This site has been hacked by Iranian Cyber Army."" The group's Web address was provided. Arabic writing in blue said, ""Hezbollah is victorious,"" and a message on the flag said, ""Ya Hussein,"" referring to Prophet Mohammed's grandson. The United States and Israel categorize Hezbollah, a political party in Lebanon, as a terrorist organization. ""The group claiming responsibility for the Twitter hacking is previously unknown, but its symbols would be familiar to anyone looking at radical (Web) sites,"" said Octavia Nasr, CNN's senior editor for Middle East affairs. ""The hackers are definitely Shiites, as indicated by the 'Ya Hussein' chant printed on their banner,"" she said. ""The group also uses Arabic in their text, a clear indication of collaboration with Arabic groups. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shiite militia with ideological, political and military ties to Iran. The same name is also used by a group inside Iran."" Twitter posted a message about 2:30 a.m. ET Friday on its official Twitter page, saying, ""Twitter's DNS (domain name system) records were temporarily compromised but have now been fixed."" ""In the past few years, we've been seeing a rise in desire for hacking by insurgents and terrorist groups,"" said Nasr. Not only do they hack outside sites, but they hack each other's, she said. ""The idea of 'cyber terrorism' and 'cyber insurgency' has been manifested in many ways -- (with) hacking individual sites being the most infamous."" She added, ""This week's (revelation of) successful hacking of U.S. predator drone feeds by Iranian-backed Shiite militants adds another level of sophistication toward the hacking effort."" Twitter became unwittingly involved in Iranian politics last summer. When Iran's disputed presidential election spiraled into bloody protests, the opposition used Twitter and other social networking sites to inform the world. Protesters beamed images from the violent demonstrations at a time when mainstream media were given almost no access to the demonstrations. Twitter became so fundamental in spreading news of the protests that the U.S. State Department asked the company to delay a planned shutdown for maintenance.

"(CNN) -- As regulations tighten in Europe and the world's wealth moves to Asia, Singapore is tipped to overtake Switzerland to become the largest global offshore wealth center in terms of assets by 2020, according to London research firm, WealthInsight. Although Switzerland easily retains its offshore banking crown with $2.8 trillion in assets under management, or 34% of the global private banking industry, Singapore is now the world's fastest growing market with $550 billion under management at the end of 2011, up from just $50 billion in 2000. With $450 billion belonging to offshore clients, Singapore has grown to become the fourth largest offshore banking center globally. The UK and Channel Islands is the world's second largest hub with $1.8 trillion under management at the end of 2011, followed by the Caribbean and Panama with $800 million. A loss of confidence among wealthy American and European investors in bank secrecy laws and independence in traditional banking hubs, combined with increasingly stringent banking regulations, are playing in Singapore's favor, analysts say. ""A lot of the benefits of being in Switzerland have fallen away in terms of secrecy, therefore if you look at a convenient market, particularly for a wealthy Asian individual, Singapore fits the bill,"" said Chris Wheeler, a bank analyst with Mediobanca. ""It's got a stable government, transparent legal system, a history of investment management, having English as the first language is really very helpful and therefore it's the obvious place to go to."" The increasing numbers of wealthy Chinese, Indians and Indonesians are helping fuel the shift to low-tax Asian centers, according to the report, with Hong Kong in a strong position to benefit from the Chinese government's moves to free-up international trade in China's yuan and the growing number of Chinese millionaires looking for a safe place to invest their money. European currency movements have also contributed to the shift, with the value of the Swiss Franc rising more than 20% against the U.S. dollar last year due to ongoing concerns over Europe's debt crisis. ""The European crisis undoubtedly has had a big impact on Switzerland because all the European nations now are looking to get back as much as tax as they possibly can from anywhere, and anyone,"" said Wheeler. ""We've seen Switzerland fall away as a secret cross border location and just become somewhere which is convenient to put your money with a reasonably good tax rate."" Many investors in the Asian markets prefer to invest offshore for risk diversification, or are forced to look overseas due to a lack of experienced and reputable wealth managers in their home markets, according to the report. Assets under management in Singapore could quadruple by 2016 as a result, while offshore assets in Swiss bank accounts are predicted fall by nearly a third to below $2 trillion in the next three years. CNN's Isa Soares contributed to this report.","Singapore tipped to become largest offshore wealth center in terms of assets by 2020 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John Cornyn, welcome to the club. The two-term Texas lawmaker is now the seventh Republican Senator up for re-election next year to face a primary challenge from his right. That club also includes the top Republican in the chamber, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Pat Roberts of Kansas. If this seems like deja vu all over again, it is. Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have made major headlines, and have hurt the GOP's efforts in the last two elections in their attempts win back control of the Senate from the Democrats. ""Republicans effectively gave away five Senate seats the last two cycles because of candidates who weren't capable of winning in November,"" said Brian Walsh, who served as communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which provides support, advice and funding to Republican candidates, during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. Dems defending 21 seats . With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate but defending 21 of the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in the 2014 midterms, the GOP has another opportunity to try and retake the chamber. But Walsh said that he doesn't see a repeat of what occurred in recent years even though a majority of Republican Senators running for re-election are facing primary challenges. ""With the exception of perhaps Georgia, it's difficult to see that repeat itself even with the large number of primaries because many are not serious at this point. But Republicans have a tremendous opportunity to win back control of the Senate next year and it's a critical reminder to Republican primary voters that candidate quality matters,"" he told CNN. A top Senate Democratic official disagrees. ""Republicans said they needed to rebrand and start reaching out to voters in the middle in order to win. They were right, but the primaries have prevented them from doing that. Instead, primaries are forcing all Republican candidates to embrace the tea party and a slate of policy positions that will hurt them in a general election,"" said Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the rival Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Six-term Sen. Cochran will run again in 2014 . While the jury's out on what will happen next November, the new round of primary challenges from candidates enjoying support from tea party activists appears to be proof that the movement continues to strongly influence the Republican Party, even after some political pundits prematurely wrote the tea party's obituary after 2012. Major player in primaries . Just as tea party backed lawmakers helped drive the unsuccessful push to defund the federal health care law, which helped to ignite the government shutdown in October, the group appears to once again be a major player when it comes to next year's primaries. ""The tea party gave voice to millions of Americans who understandably viewed Washington as an insular town determined to serve its own. As that old model breaks down, conservative influence in Washington will continue to grow,"" said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action for America, which supports conservative causes and legislation but does not back individual candidates in primary challenges. Cornyn faces challenge he tried hard to avoid . He becomes first GOP Senator to be challenged in a primary by a sitting member of Congress. GOP tries to deal with damage done with women . In this case, it's Rep. Steve Stockman, a conservative firebrand who served one term in the 1990s before winning a ticket back to the House in last year's election. Since returning to Capitol Hill, Stockman's grabbed headlines for his calls to impeach President Barack Obama. Tea Party activists have been angry with Cornyn since earlier this fall, when he didn't support fellow Texas Sen. Ted Cruz when he led the push to defund Obamacare with a marathon filibuster on the Senate floor. Cornyn told reporters on Tuesday that he's not surprised about the challenge, but that Stockman ""wasn't on my radar screen."" Kentucky governor: McConnell's Obamacare criticism will hurt him . While Stockman could find support among the ever increasingly conservative GOP electorate in Texas with its March primary just a few months off, he faces long odds against Cornyn, who has some $7 million cash on hand, compared to just $32,000 in the bank for Stockman. Large incumbent war chests . Cornyn, like McConnell, has built large war chests in order to beat back primary challenges. And both men have hired veterans of the tea party movement to run their re-election campaigns. ""If you look at the two Republican incumbents who lost the last two cycles, arguably they didn't take their primaries seriously enough and weren't prepared. That's not the case this cycle where no one is taking anything for granted,"" Walsh added. Last year, Cruz upset Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who had establishment backing, to capture the GOP Senate nomination, before going on to win the Senate seat in the general election. Cornyn says he's learned some lessons from that and other recent contests. ""I think Senator Cruz was unique in many ways because of his talents and the quality of the race he ran and the timing. So, I think one race does not a trend set but obviously there are lessons to be learned from that and believe me I've learned them,"" Cornyn said. CNN Congressional Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","Cornyn is the seventh Republican Senator facing a primary challenge from the right .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge will allow John Hinckley, the man who shot and severely wounded President Ronald Reagan in a 1981 assassination attempt, more time away from a Washington psychiatric hospital to visit his elderly mother in Virginia. HIs periodic visits away from St. Elizabeth's Hospital are currently restricted to 10 days at a time. He now will be permitted 17-day visits to Williamsburg. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty. All survived the attack, but Brady was left permanently disabled. Hinckley's caregivers hope he will one day get a part-time job with pay as part of a self-sufficiency strategy that will also involve expanding his ties with the Williamsburg community. His time away from the hospital has been increased gradually over the years. In addition, he has received art and music therapy and has had a volunteer job at another hospital, a lawyer for Hinckley said at a hearing in January that assessed a request for expanded visitation.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to ""step aside,"" give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta ""should step aside to make way for a unified Burma."" ""Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,"" Bush said. ""They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. ""The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,"" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. ""Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,"" Bush warns. ""We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. ""The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now."" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a ""need to start preparing for transition"" for Myanmar.

"Washington, D.C. (CNN)  -- At a time when our nation's top university is more diverse than ever before, Harvard's recent decision to honor its former professor Marty Peretz on Friday for setting up an undergraduate research fund in his name comes as a big, disappointing surprise. The spotlight is finally shining on Peretz, editor-in-chief of The New Republic, and his history of racist comments against Muslims, Latinos, blacks and others. Here is the latest blog-post calumny: ""Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims"" and ""I wonder whether I need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the First Amendment, which I have in my gut the sense that they will abuse."" I and other Muslim-Americans are accustomed to Peretz's outlandish statements. But I felt betrayed that my alma mater would choose to honor someone with such views. I studied the U.S. Constitution and the civil rights movement in Harvard's libraries. I learned about morality and tolerance from its professors. I felt accepted in its cosmopolitan student body. This decision to honor Peretz harks back to a chapter of Harvard's and America's history that we as a nation have wisely chosen to move past. Despite the voices raised against it, the university just reaffirmed its decision to recognize him -- although it appears he will no longer speak at the gathering -- citing Peretz's apology. In fact, his carefully worded response to New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's criticism merely apologizes for his ""embarrassing"" remarks on the First Amendment. To add salt to the wound, he adds that Muslim life being cheap ""is a statement of fact, not value."" This comes in the wake of his series of shockingly ignorant comments that have galvanized student groups on campus to protest Harvard's decision to honor him. An example: In discussing Mexican-American relations, Peretz wrote of ""Latin society with all of its characteristic deficiencies: congenital corruption, authoritarian government, anarchic politics, near-tropical work habits, stifling social mores, Catholic dogma ... and increasingly violent modes of conflict."" In another display of ignorance, he claimed ""So many in the black population are afflicted by cultural deficiencies."" Ironically, Harvard University cites Peretz's right to free speech as a justification for recognizing a man who says millions of Muslim-Americans are not worthy of the privilege. But the free speech defense appears to be obfuscation, diverting our attention from what is most troubling about this affair. As Abdelnasser Rashid, who began mobilizing Harvard students to respond, explained to me: ""The university lends legitimacy and gives a platform to his racist views by honoring him at this prestigious celebration."" The Harvard platform for Peretz gives racism an intellectual cast and authority and that is a very dangerous thing. When groups like the Tea Parties espouse bigoted views, they are more easily dismissed. But when Harvard chooses to distinguish a man who cloaks his prejudice in intellectual jargon, and then gives him additional credibility by choosing to recognize him out of thousands of its distinguished alumni, it makes scholarship a haven for prejudice. Peretz contends that certain qualities exist in cultures that don't, in reality, and moreover he claims that these things are innate, a method of sophisticated racism that has existed wherever hatred has manifested itself  -- most painfully during World War II Germany. Remember, not too long ago, even in American universities, disciplines from biology to psychology justified the inferiority of women, blacks, and Native Americans. Harvard would be wise to move forward and not backward. When a prominent intellectual promotes such racist ideology, it makes such views more palatable. Many people find it difficult to recognize that educated people can hold ignorant views, and it is even more difficult to challenge such scholarly authority. Indeed, Peretz's elite background and lofty connections had several people mitigating his recent comments on Muslims as an ""oversimplification"" instead of what it really is: untrue and odious. And the timing of the tribute to someone who rationalizes racism couldn't have been more dismal. During the past holy month of Ramadan, we saw an outpouring of intolerance toward Muslim-Americans, from the ground zero mosque protests to the acts of vandalism and threats against mosques around the country that continue to this day. I don't think the majority of Americans hate their Muslim neighbors, but when a group is being ostracized, it is easy to just be thankful it's not you. But note that this mentality has always left an aching wound in our past. Last month, conscious individuals like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg restored vision to many Americans' blind eye, but someone who has a history of doing the opposite is being honored instead. The unintended consequence of Peretz's recent comment is that it situates Islamophobia within the larger context of racism at large. As his diversely racist comments indicate, hatred is rarely faithful to one group. The Peretz affair is a small aftershock of the racial and religious tensions that have shaken our nation over the past couple of months. Its silver lining is that it has mobilized hundreds of students from different backgrounds to unite against bigotry -- something we can all learn from. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Nafees Syed.","Nafees Syed: Harvard is honoring Marty Peretz, who said ""Muslim life is cheap""

"(CNN) -- When Frederick Hutson left prison in 2012 after serving four years on marijuana-related charges, he realized he had gained something more than his freedom: insight into an overlooked consumer market. Many inmates are stuck in an age before Instagram or Facebook, relying on envelopes and pay phones to connect with family on the outside. So Hutson founded Pigeonly, a photo-sharing and low-cost phone call service that has already helped 50,000 incarcerated individuals connect with their loved ones, maintain their ties to society, and remain a presence in their children's lives. The story of Pigeonly is statistically unlikely: a disruptive technology created by a member of a disenfranchised community, in order to solve a problem within that community. It is also a model for the type of entrepreneurship that can revive American capitalism: both inclusive of and responsive to America's changing demographics. One of the great achievements of the civil rights and women's rights movements was that they unleashed an enormous pool of talent into the economic life of America. Desegregation and the women's movement broke down barriers to education and employment and made our nation stronger by making it more competitive. Yet 50 years later, a narrow vision of capitalism once again threatens to leave many Americans behind. Our nation's failure to achieve equal educational opportunity has exacerbated race-based economic disparities and produced two starkly different American economies. And while women have made strong gains in professional life, they remain dramatically underrepresented in many of the most profitable sectors. Silicon Valley is hardly the only place where this is evident, but addressing it here is crucial to turning the tide. Last year there were eight states where zero Latino students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science, and 11 states in which no black students took the test. In three states, not a single female student sat for the exam. It is no surprise, then, that 99% of venture capital-funded startups in 2010 were founded by whites or people of Asian descent, the vast majority of whom were men. The result of this pipeline problem is an enormous amount of untapped talent and a tech sector that fails to reflect the demographics of its users. To be sure, government can play a crucial role in leveling the playing field. But it can only go so far. The leaders of the innovation economy can and should play their part in reviving capitalism by making it more responsive to a changing country's full range of widespread needs and more inclusive in the process. This is a practical demand as much as a moral one. Underrepresented populations are uniquely prepared to do what the tech sector claims to do best: innovate. Look at the app store on any smartphone. There are thousands of programs to edit a photo or help you check the weather, but far fewer that exist to close the gaps in our society. In Silicon Valley, we like to say that every problem is a potential opportunity. But it takes a diversity of backgrounds to identify the real-world problems begging for a solution. Simply put, startups like Pigeonly are shattering expectations of what the market demands. Smart investors are looking at firms like Regalii, which helps immigrants send cash remittances back to their home countries, or Plaza Familia, a Latina-founded multilingual education software platform that helps parents track their children's' school progress in their native language. Our firm, Kapor Capital, invests in these companies and dozens of others that work to close gaps. We saw that startups like Pigeonly were launched by entrepreneurs who identified an unmet need in the market as a result of their life experiences. Silicon Valley tells an idealistic story of itself and the revolutionary role of tech leaders in the 21st century economy. Tech innovation can and should expand wealth, democratize access to opportunity, and build a meritocracy where talent matters most. However, we still have a long way to go. We will be there when companies like Pigeonly, Regalii, and Plaza Familia and their founders -- African-Americans, Latinos, women of all colors, and others historically excluded -- are no longer the exception to the rule. Capitalism remains our nation's operating system. The current version needs an upgrade. Investing in the people who are too often locked out, and their ideas, can advance our economy and our country to the next level.

"(CNN) -- Donald Trump's decision to let Miss California USA Carrie Prejean keep her title convinced Shanna Moakler to quit as head of the pageant's California organization. Shanna Moakler talks with HLN's Mike Galanos about why she resigned as director of Miss California USA. Moakler, a former Miss USA, said she could not stay with Trump's Miss Universe organization ""when I no longer believe in it."" As the Miss California USA co-executive director, Moakler did not hide her displeasure with Prejean during the controversy over her same-sex marriage comments and the emergence of semi-nude photos. Moakler spoke exclusively with Mike Galanos, host of HLN's Prime News, about why she resigned. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Galanos: Why the change of heart after the press conference? Moakler: I wasn't really privy to what was going to be happening at the press conference. We were in Donald Trump's office, and we spoke with him briefly. Carrieand her family spoke with him briefly. We all got in and spoke together, and we were hashing things out. But I never really felt 100 percent, and I never really felt truly heard. I was hoping for the best. After the press conference when I went back to my hotel room, I just really sat down with myself. I don't believe she is going to comply with the contract, and I wasn't really happy with what happened at the press conference. I slept on it, and I woke up the next morning and was watching ""The Today Show."" I was sitting there watching her basically still make excuses. My biggest problem is that she's never really taken responsibility for herself. She's constantly pointing the finger at everybody else. Galanos: You're talking about the pictures? Moakler: Yes, the pictures. I couldn't stand by it anymore, and on top of it, the lying continues. Our contracts as state licensees were basically made invalid. For me, it was just too much. Galanos: When you say the lies, are you talking about the pictures where she says it was a windy day and the wind blew her top open? Moakler: Yes, in that particular point. It's such a complicated story with so many factors weighing in. For me, it was always about the contract. I didn't go to New York to get her decrowned. But I was hoping at some point in time at that press conference that there would be some accountability and there wasn't. Galanos: What happened in that meeting? Did you and Carrie talk it out? Did it get heated? Moakler: There was tension [and] it was a little heated. It was the first time since Miss USA that we were all together in the room. She had read articles, I had read articles, she had seen interviews, I had seen interviews, there were feelings. At the end of the day, I've known Carrie for a long time. She stayed in my home, she was my friend. We cared about each other so there was a lot of hurt, but we were talking, we were working things out. It went very quickly. Galanos: You say ""you cared"" [and that] she was your ""friend."" Is the relationship over? Moakler: I'm a mother. I have three children, and I still care about Carrie. I think she's been exploited and used as a tool for some of these other people's agendas and these different organizations. My biggest complaint is that it was never addressed and it was never reprimanded. It makes my contract as a state director void for my contestants. She was rewarded for that, and I don't think that's fair. Galanos: Let's back track to the beginning. When you heard that answer -- and you're a same-sex marriage proponent -- were you angry with Carrie? Did you want her to lose at that point? What was your reaction? Moakler: I wasn't angry; I was a little hurt. A great deal of our sponsors are gay and have supported her. I did not physically go and see her after the pageant, but I did write her. I congratulated her. I told her I was happy that she stayed true to herself, but I also conveyed that I think she hurt some people that really loved and cared about her. Galanos: Why can't someone give that answer to that question and still be Miss USA? Moakler: She can, she absolutely can. But there were gay judges on her panel of judges, and there were some people that didn't like that answer. One of the things you have to take into consideration is your judges. Galanos: Do you think she lost it because of that answer? Moakler: No, and it's been shown through the scores that she wasn't winning in points at that particular point. This has never been about her opinion. We all want her to have her opinion. She is able, and this is where the First Amendment argument has come into this. The thing is, this is a young girl who was on a public stage, and I don't think she was prepared or ready to handle the backlash of the other side, and there was another side that has the same right to voice their opinion of not liking what she said. There was no persecution. It's just that there are other people that are allowed to disagree. Galanos: When you were in the office with Donald Trump and you're about ready to go to the press conference, he says ""Carrie's keeping the crown."" Did you object at that point? Moakler: I knew she was keeping the title before going in there. I had said to him, ""What happens if she continues to breech her contract?"" And he said, ""I'll fire her."" I said, ""What happens if more pictures come out?"" He said, ""I'll fire her."" I thought he would convey that in the press conference, but I didn't see that. It was more finger-pointing and basically being honored again. It was a hard pill to swallow. You have to understand that taking big business in New York back to California makes it hard for me to run my pageant. Galanos: Is there something you could have done to calm things? Moakler: [If she had spoken to me after the pageant,] I would have stayed by her and supported her and found out what the next steps were that she might have wanted to take. I would have helped her with some of the media training. I would have made sure she was more educated on the topic she was speaking about so when she did do these interviews and she was handling all of this pressure and heated debates [that] she would be able to speak intelligently and clearly. She would be able to express her opinions. I would be able to convey to her how to understand why she's getting attacked and where these things are coming from. There were so many organizations that latched on to her, I didn't even stand a chance.","Shanna Moakler says Carrie Prejean has not taken responsibility for herself .

"(CNN) -- An estimated 125,000 Western lowland gorillas are living in a swamp in equatorial Africa, researchers reported Tuesday, double the number of the endangered primates thought to survive worldwide. Forest clearings draw large numbers of Western lowland gorillas searching for food. ""It's pretty astonishing,"" Hugo Rainey, one of the researchers who conducted the survey for the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told CNN Tuesday. The last census on the species, carried out during the 1980s, estimated that there were only 100,000 of the gorillas left worldwide. Since then, the researchers estimated, the numbers had been cut in half. WCS survey teams conducted the research in 2006 and 2007, traveling to the remote Lac Tele Community Reserve in northern Republic of Congo, a vast area of swamp forest. Acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas, Rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of Lac Tele, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the nearest road. ""When we went there, we found an astonishing amount of gorillas,"" said Rainey, speaking from the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. Though researchers did spot some gorillas, they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site, Rainey said. Each gorilla makes a nest to sleep in at night. ""This is the highest-known density of gorillas that's ever been found,"" Rainey said.  Watch a glimpse of gorilla life in African swamp » . Western lowland gorillas are listed as critically endangered, the highest threat category for a species. Their populations are declining rapidly because of hunting and diseases like Ebola hemorrhagic fever, whose symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.  Take a closer look at the Western lowland gorilla » . While the discovery in northern Congo indicates that the gorilla population remains stable in some areas, it is likely that gorillas will remain critically endangered because the threats facing the species are so great, Rainey said. iReport.com: Share photos and video of gorillas in zoos or the wild . ""We know very little about Ebola and how it spreads,"" he said. ""We don't even know the animal that spreads it around."" The goal now, Rainey said, is to work with the Congolese government and donors to protect the areas in which the gorillas are known to be living. Western lowland gorillas, which are found in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Nigeria as well as the Republic of Congo, are the most numerous and wide-ranging of the four gorilla subspecies, each of which is threatened by extinction, the WCS says.  See where the gorillas live » . Illegal hunting and habitat loss have also threatened the Cross River gorillas, found in the highlands of Cameroon and Nigeria. Only about 250 to 300 are estimated to remain in the world, the WCS says. War, habitat loss, poaching and disease are the major threats to the mountain gorillas, made famous by researcher Dian Fossey and the film ""Gorillas in the Mist."" The mountain gorilla population is starting to recover after decades of conservation work. From a population of around 230 in the 1970s, the mountain gorillas now number around 700, the WCS says. Poaching and war have also threatened populations of Grauer's gorillas in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire. The WCS estimates their population to be around 16,000. News of the discovery of the Western lowland gorillas in northern Congo comes the same week as a report that almost 50 percent of the world's primates are in danger of extinction.  Watch what gorilla expert thinks of find » . The report, also delivered to the Edinburgh conference, cites habitat loss and hunting as the greatest threats. The situation is especially dire in Asia, where the report says more than 70 percent of monkeys, apes, and other primates are classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Here's a poke to users and nonusers of Facebook: ""The Social Network"" isn't some yawny visual aid on how the website grew from a few hundred users at Harvard in 2004 to a 2010 global reach of half a billion. ""The Social Network"" is a hard-charging beast of a movie with a full tank of creative gas that keeps it humming from start to finish (hell of a middle, too.) Sure, it gives you the facts about how then-Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (a never-better Jesse Eisenberg) made billions by helping technology win the battle against actual human contact. But it's also about the nation of narcissists we've become, reshaping who we are on Facebook in the hope of being friended by other users who may or may not be lying their asses off. Bracingly smart, brutally funny and acted to perfection without exception, ""The Social Network"" lights up a dim movie sky with flares of startling brilliance. Director David Fincher (""Fight Club,"" ""Seven,"" ""Zodiac"") puts his visual mastery to work on the verbal pyrotechnics in the dynamite, d--k-swinging script by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing""), and they both do the best and ballsiest work of their careers. ""The Social Network"" gets you drunk on movies again. It deserves to go viral. The truth about Facebook: The Rolling Stone story that exposed the battle for Facebook . In the film's wow of an opener, set in 2003, Sorkin speculatively places Mark at a campus bar, where he is driving his girlfriend nuts by avoiding eye contact, juggling a dozen topics at once and ignoring her reaction to virtually everything. She is Erica, and as played like a gathering storm by Rooney Mara, winner of the coveted title role in Fincher's ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" she is steaming. It's a setup for disaster: tech nerd versus the real live girl from Boston University he uses to unload on. Fed up with his condescension and his obsession with getting into one of Harvard's elite ""final clubs,"" Erica calls him an asshole and splits. A shattered Mark returns to the dorm he shares with Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello) and Chris Hughes (Patrick Mapel), and, beer in hand, blogs out his festering rage, attacking Erica as a flat-chested bitch, hacking into photo files of female Harvard undergrads and ranking them on a hotness scale. Out of anger over being socially rejected, a social network is born. The twelve must-see fall movies: Peter Travers runs down a golden dozen and five flicks to skip . Who gets the credit/blame? There's no doubt Mark is the CEO of a Facebook complex currently valued at $25 billion. But don't forget his BFF, Brazilian student Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who provided the business plan and early financing. And then there's the memorable Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer, with Josh Pence doing duty as a body double). The Winklevi, as Mark calls them, are blond vikings on the Harvard rowing crew and, in their eyes, the originators of Facebook. They were the ones who asked Mark to help them build a Harvard computer-dating service. They all successfully sued for a piece of the pie they claim that Mark the Judas screwed them out of when he took his idea to Silicon Valley and global dominance. Not a drop of blood is spilled in ""The Social Network,"" but you can't miss the scar tissue. Get more news, reviews and interviews from Peter Travers on The Travers Take . As advertised, it's a tale of sex, money, genius and betrayal. But can a script based on what Zuckerberg calls ""fiction"" dig out the truth? The film's maverick producer, Scott Rudin, paraphrasing a line from Sorkin's ""A Few Good Men,"" argues that ""there is no such thing as the truth."" He has a point. That's why Sorkin, using research compiled by journalist Ben Mezrich for his book ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" written concurrently with the script, went to court depositions of Zuckerberg, Saverin and the Winklevi and created a fact-based structure that gives the movie multiple points of view. The ""Rashomon"" idea is inspired, and Fincher directs it with thrilling cinematic fervor. How? By effectively giving each character his own Facebook page. Watch the movie and decide who you want to add as a friend. It won't be easy. Sorkin and Fincher come down hard on these characters, without skimping on complexity and sympathy. Eisenberg delivers a tour de force, nimbly negotiating Sorkin's rat-a-tat dialogue and revealing how alienation and loneliness actually fuel Mark's ambition. More crucially, Eisenberg lets us see the chinks in Mark's armor, unearthing long-buried feelings when Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) enters the scene, ready to take Facebook to the next level even if it means leaving Eduardo behind as roadkill. Timberlake is phenomenal, a revelation, even. You expect him to nail Sean's charming hustle, and he does, working a restaurant meeting with Mark and Eduardo like a twentysomething Dr. Evil. ""A million dollars isn't cool,"" he says. ""You know what's cool? A billion dollars."" iReport: Share your review of ""Social Network"" in one photo . Sean, with a rep for drugs and very young women, sinks his hooks in. He's a seductive Iago to Mark's ego-bruised Othello. It's a role to die for, and Timberlake the mesmerizer just crushes it. Note to Oscar: You need to step up big time for Garfield, who plays Eduardo with a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie that is built on ice cool, a fact reflected in the haunting visuals achieved digitally by gifted cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and the hypnotic musical road map laid out by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Was Mark jealous that the Harvard final club that rejected him accepted Eduardo? Keep your eyes on Garfield -- he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one. ""The Social Network"" is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade. The final image of solitary Mark at his computer has to resonate for a generation of users (the drug term seems apt) sitting in front of a glowing screen pretending not to be alone.

"(CNN) -- An elderly man suspected of Nazi war crimes has been arrested in Hungary, prosecutors said Wednesday, after a worldwide Jewish rights organization discovered him living in Budapest. Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary is accused of sending more than 15,000 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in the spring of 1944, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said. The center considers him its most-wanted Nazi war criminal. The Simon Wiesenthal Center found Csizsik-Csatary as part of its Last Chance project, said Efraim Zuroff, director of the center's Israel office. Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s, the center said. ""He was a commander of a ghetto,"" Zuroff said. Csizsik-Csatary participated in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, witnesses have told the center. He also played a role in ""deportations to the Ukraine to be killed: 300 Jews,"" Zuroff said. ""We found eyewitnesses on three different continents,"" Zuroff said. Those witnesses told the center about Csizsik-Csatary's cruelty to Jewish detainees and his role in the deportations to Auschwitz and Ukraine. Csizsik-Csatary denied the allegations to a reporter from the British tabloid The Sun. A witness to the August 1941 Ukraine deportations had nine family members who were deported, Zuroff said. Csizsik-Csatary made sure four of them were brought back from forced labor with the Hungarian army so they would be deported and killed, according to Zuroff. During the Auschwitz deportations, Csizsik-Csatary ""forced these girls to dig a ditch with their hands -- young Jewish girls."" Two of the center's witnesses were survivors of that deportation, he said. Using the last name Csizsik, Csizsik-Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper. Canadian authorities later investigated allegations that he had lied to immigration authorities about his past when he arrived there. Canada revoked his citizenship in 1997 and initiated an investigation. As deportation proceedings were under way, Csizsik-Csatary voluntarily left the country. Csizsik-Csatary returned to Hungary upon leaving Canada, Zuroff said. ""Hungarian authorities knew that he was back,"" he said. Authorities in Hungary launched an investigation in September 2011 after receiving information from Zuroff regarding Csizsik-Csatary's residence in Budapest and his role in the Auschwitz deportations, the center said.

"(CNN) -- The number of Syrian civilians who have fled their country to escape the civil war has passed 1.5 million, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. ""The Syrian conflict continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of those who are forced to flee,"" said Dan McNorton, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, in Geneva, Switzerland. ""Refugees tell us the increased fighting and changing of control of towns and villages, in particular in conflict areas, results in more and more civilians deciding to leave. Over the past four months, we have seen a rapid deterioration when compared to the previous 20 months of this conflict,"" he said. The real number of refugees is probably much higher, McNorton said, adding that ""this is due to concerns that some Syrians have regarding registration."" Since the start of 2013 alone, UNHCR has registered close to 1 million refugees -- which amounts to about 250,000 people each month. Along with the refugees, more than 4 million people have been internally displaced, according to U.N. General Assembly President Vuk Jeremic. Syria has a population of just more than 22 million, according to the CIA World Factbook. That means nearly 30% of Syrian people have left their homes amid the violence. The war has left at least 80,000 dead, Jeremic said, since the start of the hostilities in Syria more than two years ago. That death toll continues to climb. On Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported 113 dead -- 39 of them in and around Damascus, 17 in Idlib province, 15 in Homs, 14 in Deir Ezzor and others elsewhere. U.S. official: Russian missiles will 'prolong the suffering' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated Moscow's position Friday that it will fulfill a deal to supply air defense missiles to the Syrian government. At a news conference with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Russia's Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Lavrov said he did not understand the furor over the sale of the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Delivery of the weapons will fulfill a signed agreement and will not give the Syrian government any advantage in its fight with the opposition, he said. Moscow says international concerns voiced over the move by Russia, a longtime friend of Syria that has supported the regime of President Bashar al-Assad during the conflict, are unfounded. ""All who are not planning aggressive acts on a sovereign country, should not be worried, because air defense missiles are exclusively for defense (hence their name) and they are needed to fight an air attack,"" Lavrov said last week, according to the Foreign Ministry website. ""We are not breaking any laws and don't want to jeopardize our reputation of a trusted supplier."" Among those expressing concern about the missiles Friday was U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who said the sale ""does not help"" the situation in Syria. ""It makes it more dangerous,"" he said. U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, elaborated further, calling Russia's move ""at the very least a very unfortunate decision that will embolden the regime and prolong the suffering."" ""What I really worry about is that Assad will decide that since he's got these systems, he's somehow safer or more prone to a miscalculation,"" Dempsey added. Hagel noted U.S. efforts, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, to work with Russia to find common ground and help prevent the eruption of a regional war. Lavrov and Ban said they were keen to see an international meeting held soon involving the Syrian government opposition. The aim would be to implement last summer's Geneva communique brokered by Russia and the United States outlining how a transitional government could be formed. Lavrov and Kerry said this month that they had agreed to try to organize a meeting ""as soon as is practicable, possibly and hopefully, by the end of this month."" France: Iran shouldn't be part of Syria conference . Even though it's viewed as a civil war, the conflict in Syria has had a significant impact on its region. Violence has spilled over into Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. And the conflict has become entangled in issues involving another hot-button nation in the Middle East: Iran. On Friday, France's foreign ministry issued a statement opposing Iran's participation in an international peace conference on Syria. Iran has been a strong ally of al-Assad and his government, as well as a focus of international condemnation over its nuclear program. ""The stability of the whole region is in question,"" the French ministry said. ""We can't see a country, representing a threat to stability, taking part in this conference."" The French government said that Tehran should provide a ""certain number of answers"" and meet ""international obligations"" before it takes part in talks regarding Syria. Gruesome footage shows man cutting out soldier's organs . Inside Syria itself, opposition groups responded Friday to widespread outrage this week over a horrific video showing a man said to be a Syrian rebel carving into the body of a government soldier, cutting out his heart and liver, and taking a bite of the heart. Syrian rebel cuts out soldier's heart, eats it . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, questioned in a statement why the world had not paid the same attention to the many videos it has published showing atrocities allegedly carried out by forces loyal to al-Assad. A new video purported to be of the Syrian rebel who carried out the atrocity, Khaled al-Hamad, known as Abu Sakkar, was also posted online Friday. He is asked, ""Abu Sakkar, do you regret what you have done? After the killing of the Assad militiaman and the mutilation of his body?"" He replies: ""I am ready to face justice and be brought to trial for my actions on the condition that they need to bring Bashar and his thugs to stand trial as well, for the atrocities that they have committed against our women and children."" He warns that ""if the bloodshed doesn't stop in Syria, all of the Syrian people will be Abu Sakkar. Everyone will be Abu Sakkar."" Although CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos, it interviewed a local rebel spokesman this week who confirmed the heart-eating incident and said he had spoken to the man involved. Also Friday, Human Rights Watch urged the rebel groups now in control of Raqqa city, in northern Syria, to ensure that evidence of torture chambers in government security facilities seen by HRW researchers last month is preserved. ""The documents, prison cells, interrogation rooms, and torture devices we saw in the government's security facilities are consistent with the torture former detainees have described to us since the beginning of the uprising in Syria,"" said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Those in control of Raqqa need to safeguard the materials in these facilities so the truth can be told and those responsible held accountable.""

"(CNN) -- For the first time in several weeks, authorities have released information about missing Malaysia Flight 370 not previously available to the public. The problem is, it's very technical and experts said it's going to take them weeks to figure out exactly what it means. On Tuesday the Malaysian authorities published a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the airliner that went missing March 8 and Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company. Is there anything in the data we didn't already know? The data is dense and complicated, and even professionals will need time to analyze the logs, experts tell CNN. But there is some key general information that has emerged. The data includes the seven ""handshakes"" investigators said helped them conclude that the plane ended its flight in the southern Indian Ocean, where the search continues. ""Handshake"" is the lingo that Inmarsat uses. It means a signal between the satellite and the plane. The satellite sends a coded signal to the plane essentially asking ""Are you there?"" and the plane sends a signal conveying ""I am here."" Remember it was Malaysian authorities who, in late March, told relatives of the 239 passengers and crew that the aircraft crashed in the southern Indian ocean. The Malaysian government's decided to release the data now, said Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce on CNN's ""New Day."" The data constitutes ""raw communications logs over our networks,"" he said. ""That's all the information that we have that passed between our network and the plane during the fateful hours when the flight was lost,"" Pearce said. ""So it's everything -- we put everything out there."" Speaking of handshakes, what's this about a 'partial handshake'? Inmarsat and Australian officials have addressed something they call a ""margin of error"" -- or how far the plane could be from the location where authorities believe it crashed. The focus of the search has been the so-called seventh arc, which represents the location of a ""partial handshake."" Authorities believe that area is where the plane ran out of fuel. When it ran out of fuel, the plane's on-board satellite communications system stopped, and the ""partial handshake"" was the battery-powered communication's equipment powering up following a power interruption, authorities said. Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating the search, first suggested at a press conference in early April that may have happened. You've said it's going to take time -- how long exactly? An international group of experts is reviewing the data from Inmarsat and examining an analysis of the plane's performance -- and that enterprise could take two to three more weeks, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan told CNN Tuesday. On top of that, it's possible that continuing to review the data will further refine or even shift the search area from its current location, Dolan told CNN. It's not just people involved in the search saying that. Even Michael Exner, founder of American Mobile Satellite Corporation, a member of a loose confederation of experts who've demanded access to the information, said the information released Tuesday is too limited to verify Inmarsat's conclusion that the plane flew south, into the Indian Ocean. He joined the chorus of others who called for more time. But don't the Australians, the leaders of the search, have anything more to say? For the first time, Australian accident investigators outlined in a detailed report why they believe the plane crashed in the southern Indian ocean. The report, posted Monday on the ATSB's website, includes a map with seven concentric circles representing the ""seven handshakes"" captured in the Inmarsat data. This is where aviation experts -- who call themselves av geeks -- can begin their inside baseball debate. To start them off -- the Australians' report explains two key measurements: The first, the Burst Timing Offset (BTO), which allowed investigators to figure out how far away the plane was from the satellite at the time of each ""handshake."" The second, the Burst Frequency Offset (BFO), which helped investigators estimate the speed and direction of the aircraft, which led to the conclusion that MH370 flew into the southern Indian Ocean. You've probably seen family members on the news, outraged at the Malaysian government, accusing officials of not being transparent during the investigation. How are relatives reacting to the release of this data? ""It is very technical and we are not experts, so we may ask some other people who can help us,"" said Steven Wang on CNN Tuesday. His mother was a passenger. Sarah Bajc, partner of American passenger Philip Wood, told CNN's ""New Day"" that she believes Malaysian authorities have more information they're not releasing. She suggested that the Malaysian government received the data from Inmarsat and manipulated it before releasing it to the public. ""They're clearly covering something up,"" she said. ""Now, whether they're covering up their own incompetence or they're covering up wrongdoing or they're covering up on behalf of somebody else, for instance another more powerful government, it could be any of those scenarios."" She said that the families have reached out to their own hired experts who are analyzing the data, but that it is too soon to tell if they can draw any conclusions.","47-page document released with data about missing Malaysia Flight 370 .

"New York (CNN) -- Legendary restaurateur Sylvia Woods, known internationally as the ""Queen of Soul Food,"" died Thursday, according to a statement issued by her family. She was 86. ""Sylvia gallantly battled Alzheimer's for the past several years, but never once lost her loving smile,"" her family said. She died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones at her Westchester home. Woods' world-renowned Harlem establishment, Sylvia's, has drawn celebrities, politicians, tourists and locals alike to enjoy its famed soul food for more than 50 years. Woods and her husband, Herbert, opened the Lenox Avenue restaurant in 1962, featuring Southern cooking staples like cornbread, collard greens and fried chicken. ""We lost a legend today,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement. ""For more than 50 years, New Yorkers have enjoyed Sylvia's and visitors have flocked to Harlem to get a table. In her words, the food was made with 'a whole lot of love' and generations of family and friends have come together at what became a New York institution."" Following the success of her restaurant, Woods and her family developed Sylvia's Catering Corp. and a nationwide line of Sylvia's Food Products. Woods also penned two celebrated cookbooks, ""Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook: From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem"" and ""Sylvia's Soul Food."" Woods announced her retirement from her soul food empire on her 80th birthday, her family said, passing the torch to her children and grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- This week, CNN is exploring American exceptionalism -- the concept that the United States is exceptional when compared to other nations and is uniquely destined to bring democracy to the world. That notion of American exceptionalism was promoted by the nation's founders and earliest leaders. It's especially evident in the places where the Puritans first landed and built their first settlements, where explorers traveled westward to fulfill the country's manifest destiny, and to purchase or take land by force. ""The American sites that evoke a sense of American exceptionalism are many; they include places that mark the history of our struggles to secure and protect liberty, and places that evoke the promise and opportunity that generations have found in America,"" says Thomas S. Kidd, a Baylor University history professor, a senior fellow at Baylor's Institute for Studies of Religion and author of ""Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots,"" ""God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution"" and other early American history books. We asked several American historians where they enjoy exploring the history of the United States. Here are some of their favorite spots: . Washington, D.C. There's nothing wrong with enjoying some of the United States' more well-known monuments to its history. A trip to Washington could include a visit to the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial and the National Archives. The National Archives Building Rotunda displays the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. (If this history lesson bores the children, promise them a visit to the International Spy Museum later.) Historic Jamestowne, Virginia. The site of the first permanent English settlement in America, the 1607 Jamestown colony is still revealing new information about the site. ""Just last year Jamestown announced the discovery of the remains of the first Protestant church built in America, the church where the Native American princess Pocahontas was baptized and married to John Rolfe in 1614,"" Kidd says. ""When I visited the site a few years ago, I found it quite moving to stand on the banks of the James River and think of the tiny band of English settlers arriving there, not having any idea the epic history of America that was to follow."" The Pilgrim Monument, Provincetown, Massachusetts. If you want to see where the Mayflower Pilgrims first made a home in the New World and the Plymouth Rock that symbolizes their journey, join the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit Plymouth Memorial State Park each year. If you want to see where the Mayflower Pilgrims first landed in November 1620 and spent a few weeks before heading to Plymouth, head to Provincetown, on the tip of Cape Cod. The Pilgrim Monument completed in 1910 commemorates the landing, their five-week stay and the creation and signing of the Mayflower Compact. Red Hill, Virginia. Founding father Patrick Henry retired to Red Hill after a lifetime of public service, including five terms as Virginia governor and 25 years in the Virginia state legislature. Henry resumed his private legal practice and died at Red Hill in 1799. He was buried there. ""In the quiet rolling hills of Brookneal, Virginia, that surround Red Hill, you can appreciate the attraction the land held for [Patrick Henry and many of the Founding Fathers],"" Kidd says. ""You can also better appreciate the quiet, grinding tragedy of American slavery in this environment; slaves toiled on the Red Hill plantation, enabling Henry and the other founders' American dreams."" Lewis and Clark historic sites. There are so many places to explore where Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first searched for a water route to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1804. Colorado College professor Anne Hyde found some of their history at the Missouri History Museum while sorting through correspondence between William Clark and fur traders for her last book. ""These were Lewis and Clark's 'before the trip letters',"" says Hyde, who won the Bancroft Prize this year for her book ""Empires, Nations, and Families."" ""I literally couldn't believe I was touching William Clark's handwriting. Following his career after his famous trip, I listen to him get very upset about what was happening to the Indian people after the War of 1812."" (Clark served as Indian superintendent for everyone west of the Mississippi for many years, she says.) The National Park Service's Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail crosses 11 states, while the Lewis & Clark National Historical Park also incorporates state parks in Washington and Oregon. About five miles south of Astoria, Oregon, Fort Clatsop marks the 1805-06 winter encampment of the expedition. Homestead National Monument, Nebraska. In the middle of the Civil War, Congress passed and President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the Homestead Act of 1862, which granted 160 acres of free land to citizens and people applying to become citizens who fulfilled certain requirements. (The rules had the effect of disqualifying citizens of the Southern states, which had left the Union to join the Confederacy, until legislation was passed in 1866 allowing them to apply.) It's the 150th anniversary of the act, which is commemorated by the Homestead National Monument of America in southeast Nebraska. This list by no means covers all of the possible sites embodying American exceptionalism. Where are some of your favorite sites in American history and why do you enjoy them?","Historic Jamestown is still revealing truths about the first Pilgrim settlement .

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Members of the Sikh temple where six people died in a weekend rampage swept, scrubbed and painted over damage to their building Thursday after investigators allowed them back inside. A lone bullet hole remained in a metal door frame, which members say won't be repaired. The doorway leads to the main prayer area, where the only female victim -- 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur -- was killed. But elsewhere, the congregation was busy polishing the tile floors, touching up patched drywall and replacing carpet, using donated supplies; and reopening the dining hall, where the SIkhs run an open kitchen for the community. Several members wept as they walked in, while others embraced. Remembering the victims . ""It takes a toll on you, thinking about the lives that were lost, when you realize our temple will never be the same again,"" said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, whose uncle Satwant Singh Kaleka was among those dead. Kaleka said it was hard coming back to the temple, known as a gurdwara -- but members returned as soon as police allowed them, ""so we can start off here tomorrow for those six people and really for the future of the world community."" Authorities have identified the man behind the rampage as Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old former soldier-turned-front man for a white supremacist rock band. Page killed himself in the parking lot of the suburban Milwaukee gurdwara after being shot by a police officer, the FBI said Wednesday. Investigators say they found no clues to explain why Page went on the killing spree. But standing with the relatives of other victims, Amardeep Kaleka, the son of the congregation's slain leader, called the killings an act of cowardice. ""Simply put, our families -- his mother, who left behind two beautiful boys ... our father, the four other victims, the people who were shot and are in the hospital, the police officer who did his job -- they are heroes,"" he said. ""They were living the American dream. The other person was a coward. And at the end of the day, he should always be remembered as a coward. Wisconsin siblings tell of running to warn others as temple shooting erupted . In addition to the six dead, three people -- two temple members and a police officer who responded to Sunday's attack -- remained hospitalized Thursday. Lt. Brian Murphy, the Oak Creek police officer shot nine times after he responded to the scene, was in satisfactory condition, Froedtert Hospital officials reported. The condition of Santokh Singh, 50, was upgraded to serious, the hospital said. He underwent two surgeries after suffering a single gunshot wound that penetrated his chest, diaphragm, stomach and liver. Punjab Singh, 65, suffered a single gunshot wound to the face that caused fractures and damage to his right carotid and vertebral arteries. ""There is evidence he also may have subsequently suffered a stroke,"" the hospital said in a statement, adding that he was on a ventilator in critical condition. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is to speak Friday at a memorial service for the victims to be held at Oak Creek High School. The incident occurred slightly more than two weeks after a shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, left 12 people dead and 58 wounded. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who visited the gurdwara on Thursday, said more massacres will come unless the United States tightens up its gun laws. ""It's easy to be polite to say 'We're so sorry this happened' and give the same speech at the next killing a month from now,"" Jackson said. ""There's some point where move from politeness to a change in policy."" A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday indicates that the public remains divided on gun laws, with 50% saying they favor no restrictions or only minor restrictions on firearm ownership and 48% supporting major restrictions or a complete ban by individuals except police and other authorized personnel. Those numbers are identical to where they were in 2011, and the number who support major restrictions or a complete ban has remained in the 48%-to-50% range for more than a decade. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International Tuesday and Wednesday, after Sunday's shootings at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and after last month's shootings at a movie theater in Colorado. Pollsters surveyed 1,010 American adults, with a sampling error of three percentage points. Complete coverage of the Sikh temple shooting .

"Hengdian, China (CNN) -- Never send a live cable across a body of water. Never. It's just good common sense. But not for the local film crew I was working with in China's Hengdian Studios. To power the lights for an episode of CNN's ""On China,"" a locally hired grip tied a rope to the end of a cable. From the movie set bridge he was standing on, he called out to a colleague to catch it on the other side of a moat and begin pulling the charged cable across. Fortunately, they were stopped before the count of three. Movie-making in China is not for the timid -- something I learned both behind the scenes and while talking to some of China's leading movie-makers in Hengdian, home of the world's largest outdoor film studio. GALLERY: Where China's best films are made . Sprawling across some 2,500 acres with a full replica of the Forbidden City, Hengdian World Studios is where Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" was filmed as well as countless TV dramas for the Mainland market. It's also where grips like to take short cuts with cables, and makeup artists do touch-ups with dirty brushes. (I opted to do my own makeup for the shoot.) Movie-making in China is a quick and dirty business, a process director Eva Jin affectionately calls ""China Speed."" Her 2009 romantic comedy starring Zhang Ziyi, ""Sophie's Revenge,"" earned 100 million RMB ($16 million) at the box office, making her China's first female director to break that symbolic barrier. ""The process in Hollywood is so slow,"" Jin says. ""The average project development time is four years. In China, if you have a good script, tomorrow you can get the money. ""A few days later, the set is built. That's 'China Speed.'"" As a purveyor of Chinese rom-coms, Jin has the benefit of speeding through China's censorship regime. That's not the case for Lu Chuan, a director unafraid to challenge convention. His third film, ""City of Life and Death,"" was a commercial success but also received notice for its sympathetic portrayal of Japanese soldiers during the Nanjing Massacre. So how did he get it past the censors? ""I don't know,"" says Lu. ""You have to allow them to check your script. For the script, it took almost one year, and after you finish the movie and post-production, you have to show the videotape to the censors and (it takes) another half a year."" ""It's not the fault of a certain person,"" Lu adds. ""It's a system."" Working with Hollywood studio execs in China, producer Dan Mintz describes the censorship process as a moving target. As CEO of DMG Entertainment, he's responsible for bringing blockbuster Hollywood-China co-productions to the big screen including ""Looper"" and ""Iron Man 3."" ""If you look at the films that are actually shown here, a lot of them don't really follow the rules,"" he says. Mintz references a list published by the government that details what types of films can not be screened in China. Examples of prohibited movies include those that ""disrupt social order,"" ""endanger social morality"" or ""promote cults and superstition."" ""If you look at that list, basically you would not really be able to make anything,"" says Mintz. ""That's very Chinese in a sense, saying 'let me say what you can't do, and we'll work our way backwards.'"" Take, for example ""Looper."" A strict interpretation of the list would have filmmakers shy away from a time travel movie in fear of ""promoting cults and superstition."" But ultimately, the sci-fi thriller was filmed partly in China and became a major box office success in the country last year. ""Stars have rules, studios have rules, everybody has rules. You just forge ahead and if it's something that's really worthwhile, it will come out,"" says Mintz. Eva Jin is also pragmatic in her view of the process: ""As filmmakers, we're so used to getting everybody's different input into the process, sometimes from investors, sometimes from producers, sometimes from the talent. We just have to deal with it and be smart about it."" But Lu Chuan is calling for change in the censorship system, hoping that Chinese filmmakers can be governed less by guesswork and more by a transparent rating system. Lu says there must be change for the sake of his craft and also because his audience demands it. ""In an American movie, you can blow up the White House. We cannot blow up (Tiananmen) Square. It's different. But the audience wants to see a lot of exciting visual things. So I think the leadership will think about that."" He's asking for the freedom to film China's own ""Independence Day,"" the freedom to blow up anything without fear of political blowback. Just try to get it on film if that gonzo grip is standing by.","This month's episode of ""On China"" focuses on country's booming film industry .

"New York (CNN) -- Cascading fireworks Wednesday night capped an Independence Day in which new citizens took the oath of allegiance and volunteers helped those affected by deadly storms and a heat wave. Revelers across the country got an early start with beer, barbecue, parades and a massive 10K race in Atlanta. In the nation's capital, a spectacular fireworks display went ahead as planned, despite the tens of thousands who remain without power in the surrounding region. PBS' ""A Capital Fourth"" included performances by Broadway stars Kelli O'Hara and Matthew Broderick, R&B group Kool & the Gang and country singer Josh Turner. See all of our Independence Day coverage here . Several cities scrapped plans to hold their annual fireworks displays over concerns of rising temperatures and dangerously dry conditions. In Boston, authorities delayed the celebrations for about 30 minutes because of storms. ""It's been in the upper 90s to low 100s all week,"" said police spokeswoman Sarah Benavidez of Sheridan County, Wyoming, which issued a fireworks ban across the region. Plans for displays were also canceled in towns across Indiana, including Delphi, where authorities said they were prohibiting even consumer-grade fireworks. In San Diego, fireworks were canceled after they all ignited prematurely at the same time, bewildering spectators and sending some fleeing. There were no injuries reported. As temperatures sizzle, fireworks are even more risky . Other areas, still struggling from the economic downturn, opted out of their pyrotechnic plans for a simpler reason: The price tag. ""When you are faced with difficult budget choices, you have to sort out the desirable from the essential,"" said New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson. ""The city council felt that this was an appropriate cut to make."" But his New York residents, not wanting to miss out on their customary dose of Independence Day explosions, sought out personal donations to make up the difference. A total of $60,000 was raised, according to city officials. And one major contributor stood out among the rest: A woman known only as Guru Madeleine. Her organization, the S.E.L.F.-Help Foundation, put forth a $50,000 contribution so that the show could go on. ""From the moment that I called to do it, I have felt nothing but joy,"" Madeleine said. ""I saw the energy shift in the people, that excitement, and you have to have that. When attitudes are starting to feel hopeless, you have to have something to say 'Let's go, come on, come on, we can do this.'"" In New York, festivities ended on a somber note when a boat with 27 aboard capsized in Oyster Bay Harbor in Long Island on Wednesday night, throwing dozens watching fireworks into dark waters. There were conflicting reports on how many people died -- with the Nassau County Police Department saying three people while the Coast Guard had two. In Washington, the annual reading of the Declaration of Independence outside the National Archives was one of the day's main attractions. President Barack Obama marked the holiday with a White House greeting following a naturalization ceremony in the East Room for a group of active-duty U.S. service members. ""Happy Fourth of July,"" he told the group. ""I have to tell you, personally, that this is one of my favorite things to do."" The ceremony came less than a month after the Obama administration announced it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements. ""It brings me great joy and inspiration because it reminds us that we are a country that is bound together not simply by ethnicity or blood lines, but by fidelity to a set of ideas,"" Obama said. Members of the military attended a celebration Wednesday evening at the White House. ""You and your families sacrifice more than most of us can ever know -- all in defense of those God-given rights that were first put to paper 236 years ago: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" Obama said. Gotta watch: Bizarre fireworks celebrations . Hundreds of thousands of Midwest and mid-Atlantic residents remained without power five days after deadly storms. Charities, including Mountain Mission, stepped in to help West Virginia residents by delivering food and water to a shelter. ""This has really surprised us,"" said Mountain Mission's John Roberts during a stop at the Kanawha City Community Center in Charleston. ""I've been doing this job for 12 years. We help with a lot of fires, a lot of floods, things like that. This storm snuck up on us."" The holiday commemorates America's original 13 colonies' declaring independence from Great Britain in 1776. July 4 has since become a federal holiday, giving all Americans an annual opportunity to celebrate. In Tennessee, Strawberry Plains resident Diane Wilson, 67, said the day brings memories of her childhood, particularly one occasion in which she stepped barefoot on a lit sparkler. ""Didn't make me scared of sparklers though,"" Wilson said, laughing. ""Just didn't go barefoot much after that."" In New York, Bill Etzel -- a Chicago native -- visited One World Trade Center, the structure in Lower Manhattan emerging from the scene of the September 11 attacks more than a decade ago. ""The Fourth means more today than it ever has before,"" said Etzel. Meanwhile, a popular hot dog eating competition brought two reigning champs across the East River to Brooklyn for the annual tradition. 'Black Widow' smashes hot dog-eating record . Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas defended her title Wednesday afternoon at the Nathan's hot dog eating competition, setting a new women's world record after downing 45 hot dogs and buns. She weighs about 100 pounds. Her male counterpart, Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut, also defended his title during the competition, tying his world record by downing 68 hot dogs in 10 minutes. His victory Wednesday marks his sixth win at the competition.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's been widely reported. The Republican Party is locked in battle. Establishment Republicans are being challenged by insurgents hoping to purify the brand and return the GOP to small government, free market principles. The conservative grassroots are organizing this election season to elect their preferred, ideologically pure candidate, even if that means unseating House and Senate incumbents. It's a strategy they had in 2010 and 2012 with mixed results. But too much emphasis might be placed on the internal strife. Because if money has anything to do with it, which it does, the battle is more like a fight between David and Goliath. Republican establishment chooses electability over purity . The three main groups working to unseat a handful of incumbents are the Senate Conservatives Fund, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. A few of the incumbents they want to unseat: Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chamber's Republican leader, and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Also on their list is Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. McConnell's re-election bid one of the key 2014 races . They have raised a nice chunk of cash. Combined, the groups' super PACs, which have different agendas and are only being lumped together because of their influence and effectiveness and their ability to raise unlimited amounts of campaign cash, have spent about $15 million in the past 15 months. That's not an insignificant amount and that's a good portion of the nearly $50 million spent by all outside groups combined this midterm election season. But Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics said campaign spending is already ahead of this point in 2012, the most expensive campaign season in history. ""No matter of how you look at it, we're well ahead of where we were at the last midterms and also the last election,"" he said. But the thing is that the incumbents they are trying to beat are raising even more cash. Political strategists agree that incumbents are much more prepared this time around. For instance, McConnell has amassed a war chest of $20 million and he's already spent $10 million -- that's almost more than the three groups combined - for his May 20 primary. And those groups are involved in a dozen different races. Making it that much more difficult in the money race is that McConnell's cash doesn't include the outside groups that support him. ""Sometimes we can compete against them and sometimes we can't,"" Russ Walker, the National Political Director of FreedomWorks For America, said. ""Sometimes we win and sometimes we don't."" While McConnell has raised and spent an enormous amount so far -- more than any other candidate, Republican incumbents with more modest resources are still operating at an advantage. 2014 Midterms: What's at stake . Of all the incumbents being challenged, Cochran is expected to be in the most danger of losing. He is currently winning the cash contest, however. He and the flushest super PAC backing him have spent about $2.6 million ahead of the June 3 primary. His challenger, Chris McDaniel, and the groups backing him have spent about $1.7 million. And in Idaho, where Rep. Mike Simpson is facing off against Bryan Smith, Simpson has spent more than $1 million while Smith, who has received the endorsements of many non-establishment groups, has spent only $550,000 for their May 20 primary. People who financially back efforts to oust incumbents they consider unfit believe their money is well-placed, even if their candidate doesn't win. Walker refers to McConnell's race: ""He's going to spend $10 to $15 million in this primary convincing the voters he's the person we want him to be. His voting record has become more conservative. His rhetoric has become more fiscally conservative. In my mind that's a win."" Incumbents have built-in advantages. Senators have a six year campaign cycle and raise money for their next election for all six years. In addition, they often have access to the established network of party donors and influence peddlers. Many independent groups, such as the super PACs and 501c4s, didn't even exist in 2010 when the Supreme Court opened the flood gates to independent spending with the Citizens United decision. But they are learning quickly and each campaign season the top groups raise more. Maguire said the influx of cash into campaigns has adverse consequences. ""It's basically become the permanent campaign,"" he said. Complete coverage: 2014 midterms . CNN""s Robert Yoon contributed to this story.","The Republican Party is facing internal strife this campaign season .
Insurgent Republicans are receiving a lot of attention and it might be outsized .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine's Prime Minister called Tuesday for a peaceful resolution to the actions that have targeted his government in recent days. ""We are open to dialogue, we are ready to discuss with peaceful demonstrators all terms of our agreements,"" Mykola Azarov told parliament here shortly after opposition lawmakers failed to garner the 226 votes they would have needed to bring down his government. Azarov said he was extending his hand to the opposition, but warned that he was working from a position of strength. ""If we find a fist, I say frankly, we have enough forces,"" he said, according to a government website. Azarov said the government is supported by most Ukrainians, who want the government to restore order ""and continue the course to democratic transformation, to European integration. In this we are united with those honest demonstrators who came on the squares."" ""Talk is cheap,"" said Mustafa Nayem, a protest organizer and journalist, in an interview with CNN International. Citing the use of force by the government against peaceful demonstrators, he said, ""Now, I don't think that the people will accept this government."" Opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk called on President Viktor Yanukovych to sack the Prime Minister and his government by executive order. Klitschko, who gained fame as a boxer, vowed that the opposition would make sure their demands were met. Among those demands were for someone to be held responsible for the violence against the demonstrators, he said. ""It's not enough to tell just 'sorry,' it happens,'"" Klitschko told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""How many times do we have to listen to that?"" As he spoke, thousands of protesters remained in the streets, undeterred by the freezing weather and demanding new elections. They took to the streets and plunged the nation into crisis after Kiev's last-minute decision not to sign a political and trade agreement with the European Union. Protests gain strength . Over the weekend, tens of thousands of protesters descended on the capital's Independence Square to voice their anger, and demonstrations continued Monday, when they blocked the government's main headquarters with trash bins and containers, preventing employees from going to work. Many set up tents and remained in the square, waving flags and chanting against the government in the biggest protests in Ukraine since the 2004 Orange Revolution -- a populist movement that booted Yanukovych, then Prime Minister, from office. ""The protests will go on until the opposition finds a way to solve this,"" protester Sergey Vysotsky, 24, told CNN. ""My guess is that they won't go back to their homes until they accomplish what they came here for."" Their numbers swelled Tuesday, with one group remaining in the square and another marching toward the President's administration building after the vote. ""If they are not following the will of the nation, they are illegitimate,"" said demonstrator Yehven Buleha. ""We need to create our own government and introduce our order, our right to vote."" The protests have been largely peaceful, though violence flared Sunday when demonstrators using a bulldozer were met with stun guns and tear gas as they tried to push through barricades at the President's administration building. That night, police chased and beat protesters with batons. Dozens were hurt on both sides. In a statement, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the organization condemned the use of violence against the demonstrators and called on all parties to refrain from violence. ""Obviously we fully respect Ukrainian decisions on their alliance affiliations and to which organizations they want to belong or with which organizations they want to cooperate,"" he said. ""But I would expect such decision-making processes to be truly democratic."" In Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said there was ""very powerful evidence"" that Ukrainians want to be associated with the European Union. ""We stand with the vast majority of the Ukrainians who want to see this future for their country,"" he told reporters. ""They ought to be able to decide who they want to affiliate with, without a bidding war either in personal terms or in national terms but rather, based on the benefits that are available to them and the life that comes with it."" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland is to visit Ukraine on Wednesday, he said, adding that he himself was looking forward to visiting the country ""when it too gets back on the path of European integration and economic responsibility."" The president of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Ranko Krivokapic, said in a statement that he was ""deeply concerned"" over the violence, in which protesters, police and journalists were hurt. ""As a participating state in the OSCE, Ukraine has committed itself to protect its citizens' right to assemble and protest peacefully,"" he said. ""The world will be watching Ukraine to make sure those rights are safeguarded in the days ahead."" Yanukovych, who departed Ukraine on Tuesday for China, told reporters on Monday that he supports a peaceful resolution to the ""questions brought on by our citizens."" But he also warned his opponents: ""As for the politicians participating in this, I consider any radicalization of the political process will only have negative consequences."" Azarov has said the government was being blocked from performing its basic functions, which could affect the payment of pensions and salaries. ""It's a path leading to nowhere,"" he said. Ukraine's central bank said it would seek to maintain financial stability amid the protests. In a video statement, National Bank of Ukraine chairman Ihor Sorkin urged depositors to have confidence in the banking system and not withdraw their savings. Ukraine's east-west split . Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west of the country and a more Russia-oriented east. At the heart of the protests is Ukraine's about-face after a year of insisting that it would sign a political and trade agreement with the European Union. The deal, the EU's ""Eastern Partnership,"" was aimed at fostering closer political ties and generating economic growth among the nations of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus. On November 21, Yanukovych's government suspended talks with the EU, angering many Ukrainians. The agreement with the EU would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion, they said. Chief among Yanukovych's reasons for backpedaling was Russia's opposition to it. Russia threatened its smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an EU deal, but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the Moscow-led Customs Union instead. Yanukovych was also facing an EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: Free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his political opponent. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office also swept Tymoshenko to power. Two years ago, she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison in a case widely seen as politically motivated. Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the protests Monday, saying they are unrelated to Ukraine's turn away from the European Union. He called them reminiscent of a ""pogrom"" rather than a revolution and an effort by the opposition to destabilize the government, Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti said. ""These actions are, in my opinion, prepared not in view of current events, but for the 2015 election campaign,"" Putin said. Echoes of the Orange Revolution . Yatsenyuk, the leader of the Motherland opposition party, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that the demonstrations were ""like a legacy of the Orange Revolution."" ""Due to the Orange Revolution, people have the spirit of freedom in my country,"" he said. The European Union, Yatsenyuk said, had been ""very clear"" that signing a trade deal would not be an auction. ""You can't sell the country to the European Union or to Russia,"" he said. As the crisis worsened, Yanukovych on Monday asked the European Commission to receive a Ukrainian delegation to discuss ""some aspects"" of the agreement Kiev had been expected to sign, according to a statement from Brussels. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso acceded to the request, but noted that the commission was not prepared ""to reopen any kind of negotiations.""

"(CNN) -- Major storms are always dangerous. Superstorm Sandy left 132 Americans dead, damaged and destroyed tens of thousands of homes, left millions without power, and crippled the largest metropolitan area in the United States. The massive human and economic toll of this disaster came just seven years after Hurricane Katrina. It marked only the latest in a spate of deadly and destructive weather events, including the May 2011 tornado that leveled much of Joplin, Missouri. Not being well prepared for dealing with extreme weather events is very expensive. Two months after Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, the new 113th Congress has just approved a $9.7 billion storm relief measure. But these funds represent but a down payment on a $60.4 billion federal aid package that the Obama administration has requested to help the region recover from a disaster. Meanwhile, the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut estimate that the tab for storm damage in their states is closer to $82 billion. Americans need to stop behaving as though major disasters are so rare and unpredictable that little can be done up front to make them less catastrophic. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the climate has changed. Global warming is making Mother Nature more mischievous, resulting in weather events that are more frequent and extreme. These disasters pose a greater risk both because the majority of Americans now live within 50 miles of the coast and because the critical infrastructure that coastal communities rely on is becoming more exposed and vulnerable. There is much that we can and should be doing to better anticipate and prepare for extreme weather events. As a nation, we also should be embracing proven cost-effective measures that will reduce the harm that disasters cause and bolster the speed at which communities can recover. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, there are five important lessons to be learned. 1. Water is more destructive than wind. Media coverage of hurricanes and coastal storms places too much emphasis on wind speed. While images of trees, road signs, and reporters being buffeted by high winds make for good video, they distract from the more serious hazard associated with major storms -- coastal flooding from storm surge and inland flooding from torrential rains. There need to be better predictive tools for estimating how much water a storm may bring and when and where it is likely to go. Rising sea levels are elevating the flooding risk. As a result, adaptations in the design of urban landscapes and the location of critical assets such as power transformers, wastewater systems, and transit systems will need to happen sooner versus later. 2. Aging infrastructure is vulnerable infrastructure. Failure to adequately invest in energy, transportation, communications, and other infrastructure practically guarantees the failure of critical systems when they are placed under the stress of extreme events. In 2009, when assigning grades for 15 sectors of America's infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers awarded 11 D's and 4 C's. In recent years, the backlog of maintenance, repair, and needed upgrades has only continued to grow, leaving us with aging infrastructure that is more and more brittle. At the top of the priority list must be improving the resilience of the nation's electric power generation, transmission, and distribution systems. While every major infrastructure sector is important, there is little that can keep operating when the lights go out. 3. It's not just about responding to disasters, but recovering from them. Warning people of a pending disaster and getting vulnerable populations out of harm's way is vitally important. So too is emergency response both during and immediately after a storm. But there is a need for far more robust planning for restoring critical systems quickly and getting communities back on their feet again. Harnessing the capabilities of willing and able citizens and the private sector is key. For instance, electric power could be restored more quickly if local independent licensed electricians could be deputized to support utility crews in conducting damage assessments and making repairs. Additionally, the counterpart to having detailed plans to guide evacuations ahead of a storm is having plans that support quickly bringing displaced people back into their homes, schools, and businesses. As extreme weather events become more frequent, it is important to try to make them less disruptive. This places a premium on bolstering community resilience. People and systems need to be able to better withstand, respond, adapt, and rapidly recover from disasters. 4. The federal government matters. Under our federal form of government, disaster response and relief have always been decentralized -- mayors and governors are in charge of incidents that happen in their jurisdictions. Historically, the federal government's role has been to provide assistance when local and state capabilities are overwhelmed. Washington has played this role in every major disaster dating back to the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, when over 4,000 troops from the U.S. Army's Pacific Division were mobilized to provide emergency relief, including constructing temporary housing for 20,000 survivors. But as the scale of disasters has grown, so too has the role of the federal government. Extreme weather events like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy invariably involve multiple states. To coordinate rapid and effective response and recovery on a regional scale requires preplanning. And part of any thoughtful preplanning should be identifying incentives that encourage states and localities to put in place measures that mitigate the risk of needless loss of life and property. This will require a federal government that is increasingly engaged before disasters happen as well as afterward. Assigning a passive ""call us if you need us"" role to the federal government, practically guarantees future replays of the kind of ineptitude that marked the federal response to Hurricane Katrina. 5. Learning from disasters needs to be institutionalized. When the U.S. Army goes to war, it takes along historians. It knows that every battle provides a potential learning opportunity for making its soldiers better war fighters the next time around. It also knows that the best time to collect information about what went right and what went wrong is while events are unfolding. However, when major disasters happen, the process of learning from them is often ad hoc. Mayors and governors may appoint commissions, and the U.S. Congress invariably holds hearings. Not surprisingly, these reviews often become politically charged. What is missing is a process much like that of the National Transportation Safety Board, that automatically conducts investigations and issues reports on civil aviation accidents. Within hours of an incident, the NTSB creates go teams made up of specialists with the relevant expertise to investigate what happened and to support the development of new safety recommendations. In the spirit of ""a crisis is a terrible thing to waste,"" catastrophic disasters like Superstorm Sandy should be seen as teachable moments to better prepare the general public and elected officials for what is inevitable: the next storm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Flynn.","Stephen Flynn: Hurricane Sandy shows how poorly prepared U.S. is for major storms .

"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande has paid his first visit to partner Valerie Trierweiler since she was admitted to a hospital amid reports that he is having an affair, his office said Friday. New claims emerged Friday about the reported liaison between the President and French actress Julie Gayet, including allegations that it has been going on for two years. In its online edition, the French magazine Closer, which first published reports of an affair a week ago, says the ""couple"" also made use of a second apartment near the Elysee Palace for romantic trysts and went on weekend breaks in the south of France. The tabloid's latest allegations come a day after it said that Gayet is suing the magazine over its earlier report. Her lawyers want 50,000 euros for invasion of privacy plus 4,000 euros in legal fees, according to the magazine. In a news conference Tuesday at the Elysee Palace, Hollande did not confirm or deny the reports of an affair. The claims have sparked a media firestorm unusual for France, where privacy is closely guarded. Hollande paid his first visit to Trierweiler's bedside Thursday evening, CNN affiliate BFM-TV said. Trierweiler, a journalist and Hollande's partner of several years, was hospitalized after the report emerged a week ago. She told French radio station RTL in a story published Thursday that the President had not visited her in the hospital, because her doctors barred him from doing so, but that he had sent flowers and chocolate. The first lady is being kept distant from her entourage while she clears her head and recovers, the radio station said. 'Painful moments' Hollande delivered New Year's wishes to the French diplomatic corps Friday and was expected to talk about France's foreign policy priorities. France is involved in international discussions aimed at resolving the crisis in Syria and limiting Iran's nuclear ambitions. It has also recently sent peacekeeping forces to the strife-torn Central African Republic and has about 2,500 troops engaged in security operations in Mali. The international media has been gripped by the growing furor over his personal life, but Hollande tried to keep the focus on his economic plans at his annual news conference Tuesday. Asked then whether Trierweiler was still the first lady of France, Hollande said personal affairs should be dealt with in private. ""Everybody in their personal lives can go through hardships. This is the case for us,"" he said. ""These are painful moments, but I have one principle: Private affairs are dealt with in private. This is not the place nor the time to do this."" In his remarks, Hollande indicated that he would not sue Closer for breach of privacy. He has immunity as President, so it would not be fair for him to pursue legal action when others cannot take action against him, he suggested. But his indignation over the invasion of privacy is ""total,"" he said, adding, ""It's a violation that affects a fundamental freedom."" Asked about Trierweiler's health, Hollande said that she was ""resting"" and that he had nothing more to add. Hollande and Trierweiler are expected to visit the United States at the invitation of President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. Their itinerary next month includes a February 11 state dinner at the White House. Hollande said he would clarify the situation before the February trip. Public opinion . The media uproar comes as Hollande is battling to turn around a struggling economy and low personal approval ratings. However, it's not clear how much impact the claims will have on his political fortunes. A survey by French pollster Ifop with French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than three-quarters of respondents saw the alleged affair as ""a private matter that only concerns Francois Hollande."" Only 23% of those questioned for the survey, conducted January 10 and 11, considered it a public matter, Ifop said. More than eight in 10 of those surveyed said the revelations had not changed their opinion of the French President. Only 13% said they thought worse of Hollande in light of the claims.

"(CNN) -- The Republican National Convention will make history Wednesday night. Ishwar Singh, wearing a turban and beard, will take the stage and lead thousands of conservatives in prayer. For the first time in U.S. history, a Sikh American will give the invocation at a Republican National Convention. The inclusion of a Sikh prayer on the stage comes just a few weeks after a gunman opened fire on Sikhs praying in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and hospitalizing three more in what could be the largest racially motivated mass shooting in recent U.S. history.  Many praise the invocation as a mark of progress in the Sikh community's 100 years in America. Visuals matter. And in a racially charged political climate, a turbaned and bearded man will be presented to the country by Republicans as a fellow American.  This is a remarkable step forward. But speech also matters. If Mitt Romney and Republican leaders want the historic Sikh invocation to be more than tokenism -- and are serious about preventing another Oak Creek -- they cannot continue to let hateful speech within their own party go unchecked.  In a time when hate groups are on the rise, the Republican Party must accept responsibility for fostering a political climate that often casts people of color as foreign and inherently suspect. GOP leaders have not only stood silent while fellow Republicans fan the flames of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim bias, they have given them the megaphone.  Singh will speak on the same stage as Sheriff Joe Arpaio, infamous for shaming and rounding up undocumented immigrants, saying that it's an honor to be compared to the KKK. Newt Gingrich, who is presiding over ""Newt University"" at the RNC, has compared Muslims to Nazis. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, also speaking at the convention, helped write a platform plank that includes supporting a ban on foreign law, which he admits targets the religious principles of Muslim Americans. The plank, which copies anti-Sharia bills pushed by extreme conservative groups, is roundly condemned as a smoke-screen for anti-Muslim bigotry.  Romney has not spoken out against it. Ishwar Singh: My Sikh prayer for the Republican National Convention . Similarly, when U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, and four other members of Congress recently demanded the government investigate American Muslim government employees and organizations for ""infiltrating"" and sabotaging the government, Romney and prominent Republican leaders remained silent. What's worse, Romney, who could be our president, has played into the xenophobia himself, making statements that imply President Barack Obama's skin color renders him foreign or suspect. On Friday at a campaign stop, Romney said, ""No one has ever asked to see my birth certificate.  They know that this is the place that we were born and raised."" At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, he said that Obama was trying to ""change the nature of America"" and that ""his course is extraordinarily foreign."" In 2001, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, hate crimes against Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim shot up by 1,600%.  To President George W. Bush's credit, he publicly repeated that Muslims were not our enemies. While prejudice and profiling became part of life for Muslims and Sikhs, violent hate crimes fell by two-thirds in 2002 and stayed low -- until two years ago. In 2010, anti-Muslim hate crimes jumped 50%.  Nothing new happened to explain the increase, except this: fringe conservative groups pumped $42.6 million into think tanks to promote anti-Islam ideologies and successfully manufactured a controversy around Park 51, the so-called ""ground zero mosque.""  At the same time, politicians such as Bachmann, U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York and Newt Gingrich pushed anti-Muslim agendas by supporting anti-Sharia legislation. Words matter.  Public voices have a responsibility for generating a climate of xenophobia, fear and hate.  The Oak Creek gunman, Wade Michael Page, was a product of white supremacist hate groups, which have been on the rise in recent years. Online hate groups have increased by 30% in the past year alone.  For gunmen like Page, it seems to matter little whether their targets are Muslim or Sikh -- they harbor hate for anyone who does not look like them. To be sure, we should give the Republican Party some credit. In a time when many Sikhs have expressed disappointment that Obama has not yet come to visit the victims in Oak Creek, most are grateful for the opportunity for a Sikh prayer to be delivered on a national platform. But if that same party permits its politicians to spew hateful speech unchecked, then the gesture simply masks deeper trouble at the core of the Republican Party. It wasn't always this way. My Sikh American father was a Republican, proud to belong to the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. He raised my brother and me with lectures on the value of hard work, small government and independence. My own progressive politics in college made for colorful arguments at the Thanksgiving table. It wasn't until the decade after 9/11 -- after witnessing firsthand how his party caved to fear-mongering, racial profiling and expansive federal power -- that he joined me in campaigning for candidate Obama. My father is one of millions of brown and black Americans alienated by a Republican Party that has forgotten its own values. Hearing that a Sikh will pray on the stage of the Republican National Convention warmed my father's heart. But it didn't make him forget. If the Republican Party wants to appeal to people like my father again, it must remember its own soul. Romney and Republican leaders must check extremism in speech. They can start by meditating on the Sikh prayer to be offered by Singh: ""Nanak nam chardi kala, tere bhaanai sarbat da bhala."" Calling upon God in the spirit of eternal optimism, the prayer asks for blessings not upon one party, community or even one country, but for sarbat dha bhalla -- all of humanity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Valarie Kaur.","Valarie Kaur: GOP will make history when a Sikh leads thousands in prayer at RNC .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton used a softball climate change question on Thursday to step up her political rhetoric and hit Republicans for ""denying people jobs and middle-class incomes."" The answer was telling because Clinton turned a benign, nonpartisan question into a political talking point, something that months ago she would likely not have done. ""The hardest part for me of this whole false choice debate that has gone on too long is that aside from the deniers and the folks who want to pretend that we don't have a crisis is the fact that we are leaving money and jobs behind,"" Clinton said at the Clean Energy Summit 7.0, describing the choice between investing in clean energy and growing the American economy. Clinton added: ""For those on the other side, they have to answer to the reality they are denying people jobs and middle-class incomes and upward mobility by their refusal to look to the future."" For months, Clinton has crisscrossed the country as part of her time on the speaking circuit and on her book tour. The former secretary of state is widely seen as the front-runner to be the Democrat's presidential nominee in 2016 and, although she has not announced she is running, she has admitted she is thinking about it and will likely make a decision at the start of 2015. As that decision date moves closer, Clinton appears to be getting more comfortable with giving political answers. She has also stepped up her political schedule, with events with a cadre of Democratic groups in September. Henry Kissinger loves joking about Hillary Clinton 2016 . Clinton also weighed in on hydraulic fracturing, a controversial method of extracting oil. The former first lady called concerns over fracturing legitimate and pressing. She added that in light of the practice, ""it is crucial that we put in place smart regulations and enforce them, including deciding not to drill when the risks are too high."" The answer was similar to what Clinton writes in her memoir ""Hard Choices."" Glenn Beck: Hillary Clinton 'will be the next president' Clinton was being interviewed by John Podesta on Thursday. Podesta, a former chief of staff for Bill Clinton who now works for President Barack Obama, attended a meeting of Democratic operatives in late July and, according to Politico, is being eyed as Clinton's likely campaign chairman in 2016. His response to her political answer: ""That is great. And I think we need to keep repeating that argument.""","On clean energy, Clinton says GOP ""denying people jobs and middle-class incomes""

"(CNN)  -- The militant fighters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have been engaged in a campaign of violence against the Turkish state for more than two decades with the goal of establishing an autonomous Kurdish homeland. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, pictured in 1992. Ocalan is currently serving a life sentence in a Turkish prison. The PKK accuses Turkey of oppressing Kurdish culture and suppressing Kurdish nationhood. More than half of the world's Kurds (10 to 12 million) are estimated to live in Turkey, making up a majority in the country's south-eastern region. Iraq, Iran and Syria also have sizeable Kurdish minorities. But the group is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union and is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 Turkish security force members and civilians, according to the U.S. State Department. In 1984 the PKK launched a guerrilla struggle in response to the wave of repression that followed Turkey's military coup in 1980 when the Kurdish language and Kurdish place names banned. By then the group's founder, Abdullah Ocalan, was living in exile in Syria where he organized PKK training camps. Since the 1980s the group has claimed responsibility for regular ambushes on military targets in the southeast but also bomb attacks across the country, notably in Turkish holiday resorts. During the 1990s the Turkish military launched a concerted campaign to eliminate the PKK threat, adopting commando tactics and targeting the group's mountain bases. The establishment of a ""no-fly zone"" over northern Iraq following the first Gulf War in 1991 also allowed Turkish troops to conduct frequent raids on PKK strongholds across the border. In 1998, under intensive Turkish pressure, Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there. Ocalan was snatched by Turkish commandos a few months later while seeking asylum in Kenya. Despite calling for a PKK cease-fire and peaceful negotiation following his capture, Ocalan was sentenced to death in 1999 following a trial condemned by the European Court of Human Rights. However his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment when Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2002. In the same year Ocalan's brother, Osman Ocalan, who had inherited leadership of the PKK, vowed to form a new group to campaign peacefully for Kurdish rights. But the frequency of PKK terror attacks has steadily risen since 2004 and Turkey claims the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the country's subsequent instability following the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003 has enabled the PKK to regroup. It accuses the PKK of launching attacks on Turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Earlier this year Turkey sent large contingents of soldiers, tanks, guns and armored personnel carriers to reinforce its frontier. But following the deaths of 27 soldiers and 12 civilians in recent attacks, Turkish military leaders have urged the government to give them the green light to strike at PKK bases inside Iraq.

"(CNN) -- Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has completed his 46 million euros ($65m) transfer to Barcelona from Inter Milan on a five-year contract, with Samuel Eto'o and Alexander Hleb moving to the San Siro as part of the deal. Ibrahimovic displays his new Barcleona shirt after completing his transfer from Inter Milan. Ibrahimovic completed his medical on Monday and the deal was finalized despite scans showing the striker has a fractured bone in his left hand. ""It's a very big move for me and too good to turn down,"" Ibrahimovic told a news conference at the Nou Camp following his signing. ""There comes a time when you want to develop more and my desire to come to Barcelona was too big to stay at Inter."" And Ibrahimovic revealed that Inter president Massimo Moratti had given him permission to leave several months ago should an offer from Barca arrive. ""Moratti helped me in every way, he did everything for me and my family. I said to Moratti a few months ago: 'Nobody can get me, only one club can get me and that's Barcelona', and he told me: 'if you want it like that you will get it like that'.  So all my respect, because it is not easy to sell a player that means so much to the team,"" he added. The 27-year-old hopes to emulate Eto'o, who was a prolific scorer during his time with the European champions. ""I'm not coming here to be Samuel Eto'o, I'm somebody else, somebody new, but I will try to achieve as much as Eto'o, or even more,"" he added. Barca president Joan Laporta hailed the Swede's arrival. ""He is not a conformist, he is ambitious, a winner, an authentic man with strong feelings and he wanted to come to Barcelona,"" he said. ""Coach Pep Guardiola said that Zlatan was the ideal player for us, so we are really happy to have him here."" Wearing the number nine shirt formerly held by Eto'o, Ibrahimovic later received a rapturous welcome before tens of thousands of fans at the Nou Camp. Meanwhile, a statement on Inter's official Web site welcomed Eto'o's arrival at the club and revealed the 28-year-old will be presented before the media on Tuesday. ""Everyone at FC Internazionale and all the fans warmly welcome Samuel Eto'o to the club, and are proud to have him in the team, convinced that new and important triumphs will be reached together."" After completing his medical on Monday, Eto'o said he was looking forward to establishing himself as a force in Serie A after five prolific seasons with Barca. ""I made history at Barcelona, but that history is finished now,"" he told reporters. ""A new story begins at Inter; I'm starting from scratch; I want a new adventure and I hope everything goes well. ""I can't but wish Ibrahimovic good luck. I have won a lot at Barcelona and now I hope to do the same with these colors, if not, more. ""I promise the fans that I will work every day, as I have always done,"" added Eto'o -- who scored 39 goals in 49 appearances for the European champions last term. ""This is at the base of everything. I believe in my work and the group. I don't have to say that what I want to do is score even more goals; I know I'm capable of scoring goals and I know that through my work I will score even more."" Meanwhile, former Arsenal midfielder Hleb will join Inter on a season-long loan deal. The Belorussian had shown some reluctance to agree to the deal, but it may end in a permanent move -- with Inter having an option to buy the player for 10million ($14m) euros after his loan deal expires next summer.","Inter striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has completed his $65m move to Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- At least 50 people were injured and 271,400 households rendered without power after Typhoon Jelawat struck Okinawa island of Japan, disaster officials there said Saturday. As the storm roared toward other Japanese islands, three people were injured in the southernmost part of Kyushu, the Disaster Management Office of the Kagoshima prefectural government said. The typhoon is expected to strike the Japanese mainland Sunday. The latest typhoon to hit the region in recent weeks, Jelawat is a ""very strong"" storm with maximum sustained winds near the center of just over 100 mph (165 km/h), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. A NASA advisory said the cyclone was comparable to a category 3 hurricane. The cyclone has lost some of its might and should continue weakening while moving into colder waters, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. Wind troughs out of China could divert Jelawat away from land and into the open Pacific Ocean. This has not kept Okinawa from feeling the might of Jelawat's gusts, although there have been no reports of major damage. ""The winds are screaming through the streets,"" storm chaser James Reynolds said from Okinawa before the typhoon strike. ""I've seen at least one window blow out."" He explained that buildings on the island are constructed to withstand the frequent Pacific typhoons. Just two weeks ago, Sanba, a Category 3 storm with slightly stronger winds than the current typhoon, passed over Okinawa on its way to South Korea. Local media reported Jelawat's gusts had overturned motor vehicles. A U.S. Air Force base on the island recorded a gust of 180 mph, Maginnis said. Kadena Air Base posted comments, photos and videos from the storm on its Facebook page. ""Jumpin' Jelawat!"" a comment read. ""OK, this is the back side of Jelawat. Impressive. Scary impressive."" The base lost its American Forces Network television signal, according to one photo post with a descriptive caption saying the storm ""decided to make a taco out of one of our satellite dish."" The page held a contest for the best storm picture. Potential winning images -- containing the worst damage -- displayed a single car that the wind had overturned and roof damage to a home.

"(CNN) -- Sarah Palin is stirring the pot, suggesting she might seek office again. ""I've considered it because people have requested me to consider it. But, I'm still waiting to see what the lineup will be and hoping that -- there again, there will be some new blood, new energy,"" she told radio host Sean Hannity on Tuesday. No, she's not thinking about the 2016 presidential race -- yet. This time, she's eyeing next year's U.S. Senate race in Alaska, where Democrat Mark Begich is seeking a second term. Begich: Alaskans don't like quitters . Several Republicans have already announced their intentions to run, including Joe Miller, who ran a spirited but unsuccessful race for Senate in 2010, and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. Both have been in touch with the National Republican Senatorial Committee in Washington to discuss their bids. Palin and her advisers have not. In fact, Republican sources say that members of Palin's team have insinuated that the former governor may be willing to support a candidate already in the race. Of course, Palin has made bashing the Republican establishment into a blood sport and likely wouldn't seek Washington-based help, anyway. Palin to GOP establishment: 'You disrespect Hispanics' ""Most Republicans would realize running against Sarah Palin in a primary is like running into a buzz saw. She's got a financial advantage and a grassroots advantage that would be very tough to compete with,"" National Review Online's Jim Geraghty adds. But there are reasons to doubt she's serious about a run. For one thing, the Republican right urged her to wage a primary challenge against Sen. Lisa Murkowski in 2010, but she opted against it. She also resigned Alaska's governorship in 2009 before completing a full term. ""Notice, this is not hiring staff, this is not any of the things that a real run would involve. This is just kind of an idle comment to Hannity,"" Geraghty says of Palin's recent actions. Palin is also not doing any of the things she did to grab headlines like when she was considering a presidential run two years ago, like publicizing slickly produced campaign-style videos and launching a whirlwind cross-country bus tour. In October 2011, she finally explained that she had decided against a national run because, ""I've concluded that I believe I can be an effective voice in a real decisive role in helping get true public servants elected to office."" And now as she flirts with a Senate run, she has to deal with a new reality: Her popularity in Alaska has tumbled. Several private polls obtained from Republican sources indicate she's one of the least-liked politicians in the state. What's more, Palin is raking in the bucks giving high-profile speeches at conservative functions and appearing on Fox News. And her family is starring in various reality shows. As a U.S. senator, those paychecks would disappear. Yet, Palin loves nothing more than to stay relevant. ""My goal right now is to keep people inspired and empowered,"" she told CNN in June. Palin embraces SNL sketch, dishes out her own humor . What she may be toying with is the uncomfortable concept that she's not the GOP's only bright young star anymore. These days, there are plenty of energetic conservatives capturing the party's imagination that may make her fight for newsy buzz, like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, among others. ""If she runs, it's going to instantly become the most covered, the most scrutinized, the most hotly debated Senate race of the 2014 cycle,"" Geraghty said. American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas said Republicans have a 50-50 chance of taking the majority back in the Senate in next year's midterm elections, and said it's an even more significant possibility if Palin runs for the Alaska seat. ""If she runs, all the odds are off the table,"" he said. ""She would win a general election."" But what about the growing chorus of Republicans who say they would rather see her leave the party than create any new buzz? ""The benefits of having her as a U.S. senator and helping us get back the majority so far outweigh any distractions that might be caused,"" Cardenas said. He added that there are a number of young, outspoken Republicans in the Senate who help the GOP spread its message and ""she will be one more such member."" And until she decides, political watchers should buckle up, because she'll get plenty of attention. Palin has until June 2, 2014, to file paperwork to run.","Former GOP VP nominee Sarah Palin is considering a run for Senate in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Michelle Obama is controversial enough in this country. Many commentators criticize the cost of her clothes and the glitz of her entertaining. Yet it may be that she has generated the most reaction across the Atlantic. As you may have heard, French President Francois Hollande has entangled himself in a farcical emotional comedy. On January 10, a French magazine printed an article insinuating that Hollande had fallen in love with an actress, Julie Gayet. Hollande threatened to sue for invasion of privacy, but he did not deny the truth of the story. Almost immediately after the magazine story appeared, Hollande's present partner -- a former television presenter named Valerie Trierweiler -- had checked herself into a hospital. Friends told the press that Trierweiler had swallowed ""a pill too many."" What has Michelle Obama to do with all this? The President of France is set to visit the United States on February 11. The grand question convulsing the French media is: Who will Hollande present to Michelle Obama as the first lady of France? The British newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, reports that Trierweiler ""has told friends that she will forgive [Hollande] if she stays as first lady and the other woman goes."" Trierweiler has supposedly set the Washington visit and the meeting with Michelle Obama as the crucial decision point. At a lengthy press conference on January 14, Hollande promised that the question, ""Does France have a first lady, and if so, who?"" would be resolved out before the Washington visit. The French are unused to romantic dramas played out in public. Until recently, the wife of a French president was deemed a private person, not a representative of the state. Mme Charles de Gaulle, Mme Georges Pompidou, Mme Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Mme Francois Mitterand and Mme Jacques Chirac would appear at formal state functions but otherwise remain secluded from public view. (Francois Mitterand, President from 1981 through 1995, insisted especially forcefully on privacy for his family for a reason the French public only learned after his death: He had two families and maintained both of the households at public expense. All that changed, first under Nicolas Sarkozy, elected in 2007, and now Hollande, elected in 2012. The twice-divorced Sarkozy married the glamorous Carla Bruni a year into his term of office. The next year, Sarkozy became the first French president to have a child in office. It was Sarkozy and Bruni who reinvented the role of the French first lady -- and Michelle Obama seems to have been a big part of the reason why. In 2008, the French media pulsed with excitement over Barack and Michelle Obama. Sarkozy, whose government had run into early trouble, was eager to borrow some of the Obamas' popularity. He sought to replace the highly formal head-of-state to head-of-state relationships of the past with a new, more tabloid-accessible, couple-to-couple relationship. Thus, although Laura Bush and Bernadette Chirac were photographed together only on red carpets and around crowded lunch tables, Michelle Obama and Carla Bruni figured in dozens of seemingly warm and friendly one-on-one shots. Sarkozy's successor, Hollande, needed something quite different from Michelle Obama. Hollande had lived unmarried for 30 years with another senior figure in the French Socialist party, Segolene Royal. They had four children together. In 2007, the French Socialist Party chose Royal as its presidential candidate. After Royal's defeat, Hollande broke off with her, took up with Trierweiler and sought and won the presidency for himself. Unlike Sarkozy and Bruni, Hollande and Trierweiler never did get married. Today, with his approval rating battered down to 22% by France's miserable economic performance and his own vacillating leadership style, Hollande's public image desperately needs some kind of reinforcement. The magazine that revealed Hollande's affair with Gayet also posted photographs of the 59-year-old Hollande popping on a helmet to ride a motor scooter to his mistress' home. Never photogenic, he looked especially absurd. Parodies ensued, including a video game in which you are Hollande on his scooter and must dodge paparazzi and his current partner to get to his new girlfriend. Standing at the White House alongside the Obamas with a first lady of France -- any first lady -- might inject Hollande with a supplemental dose of respectability and dignity. That would be the plan, anyway. Around the world, elected leaders struggle with the question: What to do with the spouse of the head of government? Voters are inescapably curious about and interested in that person, whether she is the first lady of a superpower or a small Baltic republic. The American solution is to carve out a place for the spouse of the president, with a staff and public duties. In turn, that person is expected to submit to certain demands and at least outwardly conform to more traditional norms of behavior. It's an imperfect solution. But it's a better solution than what we see in Congress and statehouses, where it has become increasingly common for one spouse to hold high office while the other spouse makes a fortune as a lobbyist -- and where voters are asked to believe that the rising wealth of the private-sector spouse has nothing whatsoever to do with the political clout of the spouse on the public payroll. On Saturday night, Michelle Obama celebrated her 50th birthday at a White House dance party. The Obamas' entertaining has often provoked criticism. Criticism goes with the first lady role. Entertain too much, dress too well, and you are Marie Antoinette. Just ask Nancy Reagan. Entertain too little, dress too plainly, and you will be mocked as dowdy and boring -- think Bess Truman. Look too interested in public affairs, and people will ask ""Who elected you?"" See Clinton, Hillary. Ignore public affairs, and Americans will grumble that you are AWOL from your duties. See Bush, Laura. Yet as impossible as it is to fill the role of first lady perfectly, it is that much more impossible to pretend that the consort of the head of state is just a private person living in a public building. The wife (someday, husband; someday after that, same-sex partner) of the head of state is inescapably a public person, too, with public influence and a public function. That function, when well-performed, deserves respect from across the political spectrum. Happy birthday, Michelle Obama. You earned your party.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have zeroed in on a possible marker for ovarian cancer. The discovery of the marker, called TEM1 and found in the blood vessels surrounding the tumor, could lead to new screening and treatment options. The scientists had found that a particular gene, named TEM1, is over-expressed, or present in abnormally high levels, in the blood vessels feeding some ovarian tumors. ""When a patient has a higher level of this gene, it always correlates with decreased survival,"" lead researcher Chungseng Li, Ph.D. told CNN. ""We were looking for [a way] to identify those patients and looking into a therapy against this gene."" Li, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Ovarian Cancer Research Center, presented his findings Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. George Coukos, M.D., Ph.D., the director of the lab where Li works, calls the discovery important because TEM1 will let researchers and doctors eventually image, or visualize, the cancer ""and also target it therapeutically through a TEM1 antibody."" ""I think it's very exciting that people are starting to get closer to a test that might be able to be used for screening,"" says Barbara Goff, M.D., director of gynecologic oncology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Goff is not connected to Li's study. ""I don't think we're there yet, but I think we can be cautiously optimistic,"" she says. Goff notes that, like Li's group, other researchers have identified different markers that may be predictive of ovarian cancer, but so far, no prospective studies have been done in humans. Still, she calls the finding ""promising."" Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the United States because it is so hard to detect in its early stage, when it is still treatable. It's diagnosed in approximately 20,000 American women each year. The overall five-year survival rate is 46 percent, but jumps up to 93 percent if caught before it has spread; however, only one in five women's cancer is diagnosed at this early stage. Currently, there is no test to detect ovarian cancer early. ""Nothing, except CA-125; it's the only serum marker we have,"" says Coukos, referring to a blood test that detects a protein often found in high concentrations in tumors. ""But it doesn't perform very well: it is not sensitive and not very specific either, so it performs very poorly in terms of early diagnosis of ovarian cancer."" If a screening test is ""sensitive,"" it results in few false negatives; if a test is ""specific,"" it results in few false positives. Li and his colleagues created the first mouse that expresses human TEM1. They then developed a new way of using PET scans -- a type of detailed medical imaging -- to detect even small numbers of cells that contain TEM1, and used DNA analysis to confirm the results. They found that high levels of TEM1 were linked to decreased survival in ovarian cancer patients. They also found that all 52 samples of ovarian cancer contained TEM1 in the blood vessels, compared with none of the healthy tissue samples. This could one day open the door to a screening test for ovarian cancer, although Li says that is still a long way off.   Also, the research could lead to new treatments. ""Future treatments could target the blood vessels containing TEM1, thereby disrupting the blood supply the tumor needs to grow,"" Li explains. Li and Coukos hope that their TEM1 findings can be used for detection and treatment of other cancers as well. ""TEM1 is over-expressed in a variety of tumors,"" says Coukos, including breast cancer, colon cancer and glioblastoma. ""I think the biggest problem for screening for ovarian cancer is that it is not a very common disease, only about one out of every 2,500 women gets it,"" explains Goff. ""So it's important, if you have to screen 2,500 women to detect every case of ovarian cancer, that you have a test that is incredibly sensitive and incredibly specific and incredibly inexpensive. Bringing all three of those things together is the real challenge."" Read one ovarian cancer patient's blog . Goff developed a ""symptom index"" -- a set of questions that doctors can ask women (or women ask themselves) to determine who would benefit from having further tests, including a CA-125 test and a trans-vaginal ultrasound. The symptom index consists of these three questions: Do you have bloating or increased abdominal size? Do you have pelvic or abdominal pain? Do you have eating difficulty, or are you feeling full too quickly? ""Rather than screening the entire population, we only end up screening the 2 percent to 3 percent of the population who test positive on the symptom index, so it makes it potentially much more cost-effective because you do early diagnostic tests on so few people,"" she says. And while she acknowledges the symptom index can't catch all cases of ovarian cancer, it's better than nothing, which is what is available now. Goff says that if ovarian cancer is suspected, it is important is to get to the right doctor. ""There have been a number of studies which show that women with ovarian cancer, if they are operated on by a gynecologic cancer specialist, have a substantially better outcome than women who don't,"" she says. ""If you think you have ovarian cancer, make sure you get into the right hands, because if you can't have your cancer diagnosed early, the next most important thing is to get into the hands of the right doctor who'll do the right operation and treat you in the right way.""","Ovarian cancer is diagnosed in about 20,000 American women each year .

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE.COM) -- Walking through the jungle in the dead of night with a group of Rwandan rebels best known for their expertise at rape and murder wasn't exactly what we had planned for our first trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo. All we wanted was to make a little film about the controversy surrounding the so-called conflict minerals that make our cell phones work, drop a couple Conrad references, and drink a Primus. Just one Primus. A week earlier, our team landed at N'Djili International Airport in the capital of Kinshasa, formerly Leopoldville. The place looks like it hasn't had a scrub since Muhammad Ali dropped by for the Rumble in the Jungle in the early 1970s. After having our yellow-fever cards checked for the first time in our well-traveled lives, we ran a gauntlet of sweaty police officers and other officials -- each with his own laundry list of infractions that we had apparently already committed. In an amazing stroke of luck, they were willing to overlook all these violations for a small fine, payable in person, to them. See the rest of VICE Guide to Congo at VICE.COM . We'd come to Congo to try to find out more about the developed world's thirst for coltan, cassiterite, and the other colorfully named minerals that make the electronics industry go round. These are part of a group of natural resources that have been dubbed ""conflict minerals"" because of the alphabet soup of armed groups (FARDC, CNDP, FDLR, PARECO, etc.) who have found them a very portable and highly profitable way to fund their activities -- which mostly consist of killing people. Since 1996, these guerrilla insurgencies have led to the deaths of more than 5 million people, and in one 12-month period, the rape of approximately 400,000 women. We knew very little about Congo before we came, but the one thing that had been drilled into our heads was ""do not fly on Congolese airlines."" Conventional wisdom says that between the beat-up Russian planes and their drunken Russian pilots, and the occasional crocodile in the overhead, if you fly a Congolese airline -- you will die. But what else could we do? Walk? This is a country the size of Western Europe, with the infrastructure of rural West Virginia. As it turned out, that flight would be the most comfortable experience of the days that followed.","VICE travels to Democratic Republic of Congo to do film on so-called conflict minerals .

"(CNN) -- Death, taxes and Black Caviar. Some things in life are just certain. For the bookmakers, it was not a question of if Black Caviar could win Saturday's Diamond Jubilee stakes at Royal Ascot, it was by how much. So popular was the mighty mare with punters, a one dollar investment might have earned you 20 cents, providing the bookie was feeling generous. The Peter Moody-trained sprinter came to England with 21 wins from 21 starts. Race number 22 was Black Caviar's first outside Australia, and thousands traveled with her, invading the typically-British race course. Royal regulations for Ascot's fashionistas . Black Caviar's colors of black and salmon pink were worn with pride in frocks, fascinators and ties. Green and gold are Australia's sporting colors of choice but this was the exception, reserved only for an exceptional performer. Australian journalist Nat Wallace traveled from Newcastle, New South Wales, to watch Black Caviar sprint to racing royalty. Wallace, who moonlights as a race-caller and is a thoroughbred owner himself, has followed this story from the time she was a filly and knew exactly what to expect, even if the British did not. ""I've been overhearing people in London streets, in bars, saying how 'the Aussies think they've got this amazing horse' and so I told them, 'we don't think we've got an amazing horse, we know we've got an amazing horse',"" said Wallace. Over confident? Perhaps. Accurate? Definitely. On the back of fantastic form, few surprises were expected but no one anticipated a photo finish. It silenced an otherwise raucous record crowd and, for the moment, history was on hold. ""It was a disappointing finish for Black Caviar,"" Wallace said after the result was decided by a photo. ""She should have won by much more."" It has been revealed a back injury could have slowed the champion mare, but as debate rages over how Black Caviar won, the fact that she did was reward enough for the thousands of ex-pats who had been hearing nothing but great things. Claire Falconer, a lawyer from Adelaide was among the London-based Aussies watching in the Grandstand. ""This is a huge moment ... that's what makes Black Caviar a champion. I'm really glad I'm here to experience it all first hand."" Stephen Pittman, a teacher from the New South Wales Central Coast, says the whole experience was a source of ""great national pride."" Now, more than ever before, there is speculation about her future. Will she race again? Will there be another overseas campaign? Questions only the trainer Peter Moody can answer. The sprinter is now in quarantine, ahead of a marathon trip home, where she returns an internationally-recognized champion. For the thousands of Australians who watched ""The Wonder from Down Under"" go round at Royal Ascot, it was not about a financial return. Black Caviar's crowning glory would be a story to tell the grandchildren, or anyone who will listen. And the bookies cannot put a price on that.","Black Caviar has won all 22 of the races she has taken part in .

"(CNN) -- After four fatal shark attacks in seven months, beachgoers on the south coast of Western Australia are understandably anxious about entering the water. ""Dawn and dusk are perceived to be the worst times for encounters so you see less people going out early morning and late evening,"" said long-time surfer Jack Carlsen, who is also a professor at the Sustainable Tourism Center at Curtin University. ""I still go out surfing, but I'm a lot more cautious,"" said Carlsen, who had his own encounter with a Great White in the same waters several years ago. ""A lot of the shark experts say it's the one you don't see that will get you. And luckily, I saw it,"" he said. The stretch of water along Western Australia's southern coast is now one of the world's most deadly for shark attacks. More people were killed by sharks there than anywhere else in the world in 2011, according to the International Shark Attack File. The latest victim was 33-year-old Peter Kurmann, a father of two, who was taken on Saturday morning while diving with his brother Gian about one nautical mile off Stratham Beach. Gian Kurmann is reported to have used his diving knife to try to fight off the shark, which he told police was about four meters long. Experts later confirmed Kurmann was likely taken by a Great White, the fourth victim of an unprecedented string of attacks by the predators in West Australian waters. ""There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the shark related fatalities in WA are a reflection of an increase population size of white sharks. It is more likely that a combination of factors, including more people in the water and white sharks being present around the south west coast this time of year,"" said Ryan Kempster, a shark biologist and founder of Support Our Sharks. After Saturday's attack, beaches were closed while authorities dispatched aerial and ocean patrols to scan the seas. A spotter plane sighted a three to four meter shark the same afternoon, but attempts to catch it failed and were aborted altogether when bad weather moved in. It's become a familiar and unwelcome drill for local authorities who are trying to prevent any further attacks and reassure worried beachgoers that efforts are being made to protect them. After three people were mauled in the water in September and October, WA Fisheries Minister Norman Moore announced a $14 million five-year plan to reduce the risks of shark attacks. It included $2 million for the Shark Response Unit which will on Saturday start an intensive three to four week tagging program to attach acoustic transmitters to Great Whites. ""The longer it's in the better, which is why with this tagging trip (we) will actually be internally inserting the tag inside the shark,"" said Michael Burgess, of the Shark Response Unit. ""We catch the shark. Turn it upside down. It'll go into a state of paralysis. That give will us the opportunity to make a small incision on the underside and insert it in its gut cavity and then give it some sutures and away it goes."" The State Government has ruled out a mass cull of white sharks to reduce numbers, although if a shark had been caught soon after the attack on Saturday it's likely it would have been destroyed. The elusive nature of Great White sharks makes them difficult to find and catch, especially in the sea off Western Australia where Burgess said they are ""very transient"" and ""very mobile."" ""The success of tagging white sharks anywhere else in the world has always been around seal colonies and where white sharks do aggregate, like the Neptune Islands in South Australia, such as over in South Africa, and likewise off the coast of Mexico and California,"" he said. Off Western Australia, the tagging team will be using long lines and bait to try to hook the sharks. ""Our target is somewhere around 100, but this is only very early days in this program we're implementing. (We want) as many as we can get, obviously,"" Burgess said. The difficulty of tagging great whites is evident in the government's admission that no sharks were successfully tagged in 2011. Eleven were tagged in the previous two years, and are feeding information to offshore receivers about the sharks' behavior. ""By next month there should be 121 acoustic receivers in the water in the southwest and south coast and that's in addition to the 39 that we've got off the metropolitan coast of Perth,"" Burgess said. Only 20 of those transit the information to satellites which is then sent to West Australian Water Police to generate an SMS warning. The vast majority store the information, which is later downloaded and used to chart the sharks' past movements. People who see sharks are urged to call the Water Police, but Jack Carlsen said many sightings by locals who spend a lot of time on the water are not being reported. ''Surfers get complacent. They might tell a few mates but they won't make it widely known that they saw a shark off a surf beach,"" he said. ""(And) we know, for example, that commercial fishermen see them all the time, but don't always report sightings."" Carlsen plans to launch a ""sharkwatch"" website in the next few months, which he says will give approved subscribers an easy way to report sightings. Messages would be sent by SMS or on Twitter or Facebook, alerting subscribers to potentially dangerous sharks along the coast. The idea duplicates in part efforts by the government to issue alerts through the state's Surf Life Saving body, and Burgess, from the Shark Response Unit, has expressed concern that a separate reporting system could leave authorities out of the loop. ""Already there's issues with people not reporting shark sightings appropriately, so that's a real big message we need to get out. People need to report shark sightings to the Water Police,"" he said. As the weather gets colder, authorities are hoping that fewer people in the water will reduce the risk of further attacks. Shark biologist Ryan Kempster said that while the government was doing a ""fantastic"" job with its ""non-lethal shark mitigation measures,"" individuals needed to take responsibility for their own safety. ""Shark bite incidents are a rare occurrence and almost impossible to predict,"" he said. ""People need to realize that when they enter the water they are taking a risk -- albeit minimal --of encountering a large predatory shark.""","Sharks have killed four people off Western Australia since September 2011 .

"(CNN) -- The historic measure to regulate and tax marijuana in Washington State deserves to be looked at closely as a model of how legalization ought to be designed and implemented elsewhere in America. We've turned a significant corner with the approval of Initiative 502, which purposefully offers a true public health alternative to the criminal prohibition of pot. For the first time in a very long time, the well-intended but failed criminal penalties to protect public health and safety will be set aside. Adults who choose to use marijuana and obtain it through legal outlets will no longer be faced with the threat of criminal sanctions. People of color will no longer face the egregious inequities in how marijuana criminal penalties are imposed. Parents, as they help prepare their children for the choices they face concerning marijuana, will no longer be hobbled by misinformation about the drug and the absence of effective supports to encourage abstinence. ""The great experiment"" of alcohol prohibition became the national law in 1920. Its intentions were good, but it failed in a number of vitally important ways. In 1923, the state of New York repealed its alcohol prohibition law. Ten other states soon followed, and in 1933 national Prohibition ended. I believe Washington state has just played that pivotal role with regard to marijuana. Moreover, by borrowing from public health model principles known to be effective, the state has offered the most compelling replacement to prohibition considered to date. What is a public health model? In brief, it's an approach that acknowledges use of marijuana can present harms to the user and to public safety, and includes provisions to prevent or ameliorate those harms. A public health model includes six key elements. Washington state's new law incorporates each of them. The first is accountable oversight by an agency of government. The Washington state legalization model assigns responsibility to a state agency for writing regulations concerning how the growing, producing and selling of marijuana will occur. Among those regulations are tight limitations on advertising and the prevention of access to marijuana by minors. Then, that agency will have the authority to issue licenses to growers, producers and sellers and to enforce adherence to the rules. The second element is a well-funded multifaceted marijuana education program that is based on science rather than ideology. Far too few Americans are sufficiently informed about marijuana's effects on health and behavior, both the positive and the negative. A key to good decision-making is possessing accurate information. The third element is well-funded prevention programs widely available to all the state's geographical and demographic communities. We've learned a great deal about what knowledge, skills and community supports actually work in helping young people navigate a world in which drugs such as marijuana are readily available. Sadly, far too little funding has been devoted to putting such programs to work in our communities. A fourth element is making treatment of marijuana dependence readily available. The new law dedicates funding to establish a statewide Marijuana Help Line. It also earmarks funding to state, county and local governments for the provision of services for those in need of help. Evaluation of the new law's impact is the fifth element. An independent state agency will receive funding to conduct periodic assessments of how the new system affects behaviors, attitudes and knowledge. Using the findings of these evaluative studies, the state agency overseeing the pricing and taxing of marijuana can adjust those costs to maximize undercutting of the black market and deterrence of youth access to marijuana. The sixth element is research. The new law earmarks funding to the state's two major research universities for the purpose of conducting marijuana-focused studies. As we gradually learn how to live more healthfully and safely with marijuana, the knowledge derived from those studies will inform education, prevention, treatment and refinements in the law. In more than 40 years of research -- primarily marijuana dependence counseling interventions for adults and adolescents -- it has seemed to me that prohibition has hindered more than it has helped good decision-making. Far too many teens think smoking pot is ""no big deal,"" greatly underestimating the risk of being derailed from social, psychological and educational attainment. Far too many adults don't take seriously enough the risk of marijuana dependence that accompanies very frequent use. We can do better. By regulating and taxing marijuana based on a set of strong public health principles, I believe our cultural norms concerning marijuana will shift and the harms we've witnessed will greatly reduce.

"Washington (CNN) -- It looks like Marco Rubio isn't laying low anymore. The senator from Florida and possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate followed up a Friday swing through the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire with some candid comments on Sunday talk shows about the next race for the White House. And following a White House report that declared the effects of climate change are upon us, Rubio said in numerous interviews that he doesn't believe that humans are causing global warming, and doesn't think any action can reverse that course. The moves by Rubio put him back in the 2016 spotlight, which he's avoided for much of the past year. Inside Politics: Rubio says he's ready to be president . ""It's a completely wide open GOP field. None of our fruit is ripe: To move from long shot to frontrunner, every potential GOP candidate has to grow, develop, or overcome a debility and Marco Rubio has as good a shot at doing that as anybody at this point,"" says Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist and CNN contributor who last year founded NewRepublican.org. Another GOP strategist said Rubio's political persona is still a work in progress. ""Building a presidential profile isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. Showing up in New Hampshire will no doubt stoke public speculation, but Rubio has spent his time in the Senate working hard on issues that matter to Florida, but they also matter to a majority of folks across the country,"" said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a CNN contributor who was a senior adviser and spokesman for the 2008 and 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaigns. Poll numbers slip . Early last year, Rubio's name was near or at the top of public opinion polls of Republicans for the party's 2016 presidential nomination. But Rubio's numbers slipped after his high-profile support for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last June. The measure, which stalled in the House, included an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, which is strongly opposed by many conservatives. Rubio's numbers in 2016 polls quickly faded, and have remained in the single digits in follow-up surveys. Rubio stood in ninth place, at 6%, in the most recent CNN/ORC International Poll, which was conducted just over a week ago. While many of the other potential Republican White House hopefuls, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, have made numerous trips to all or some of the early primary and caucus states such as New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina, over the past 18 months, Rubio has not. (While he hasn't visited Iowa since 2012, Rubio isn't forgetting about the state votes first in the road to the White House. Rubio recently decided to focus the resources of his Reclaim America PAC on three big Senate races this year. One is the crucial Senate battle in Iowa, where Rubio's backing conservative Joni Ernst, whose stock is on the rise.) The visit to the Granite State was his first trip to any of those key states since the last presidential election, other than an appearance at an event for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad soon after the 2012 election, which Rubio indicated he agreed to attend months earlier as a favor to Branstad. Rubio sounded like a presidential candidate as the headliner for the Rockingham County Republican Committee's annual ""Freedom Founders"" dinner, held at the historic Wentworth-By-The-Sea hotel just outside of Portsmouth. He slammed Democrats and in particular former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who's seriously considering a White House run and is considered the favorite for the Democratic nomination should she launch a candidacy. ""Their ideas never worked in the 20th century, much less the 21st, and they're threatening to nominate someone now who wants to take us to the past, to an era that is gone and is never coming back,"" Rubio told the audience. A good first impression . A veteran Republican strategist in New Hampshire who attended the party dinner said Rubio connected with the crowd. ""Marco Rubio made a powerful first impression with New Hampshire Republicans on Friday, speaking passionately about his uniquely American story and with conviction about his optimistic vision for our country's future, bringing an enthusiastic overflow crowd to their feet at night's end in New Castle,"" said Jim Merrill, who was a top adviser to Mitt Romney in the Granite State in his presidential campaigns. ""While Senator Paul and (New Jersey) Governor (Chris) Christie, each impressive in their own right, are both perceived as having early advantages here, New Hampshire's upcoming ""First in the Nation"" primary is the most wide open that we've ever seen, with no heir apparent,"" Merrill said. The dinner was just one stop during a busy day for Rubio in New Hampshire. Earlier, he headlined a fundraiser for the state GOP, held private meetings with some influential Republicans, and sat down for interviews with local media. ""I want people to look at the Republican Party as the party that shows them the way to a new American century versus a Democratic Party that shows us how this is the new normal and we just have to get used to it, that the cashier at Burger King will always be a cashier, and all he or she can hope for is an increase in the minimum wage,"" Rubio said in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader. Another New Hampshire-based Republican strategist said Rubio's ""taking all the necessary steps that someone would take if they were considering a presidential run."" Rubio quickly followed his New Hampshire swing with an appearance on ABC's ""This Week,"" where he said that he's ready to be commander in chief. ""But I think that's true for multiple other people that would want to run."" Dig at fellow senator? In the interview, Rubio appeared to take a shot at Rand Paul. Rubio said if someone wants to be president, they should fully commit to just that, adding that candidates shouldn't try to hold their congressional seats while pursuing the White House. Should he decide to launch a 2016 campaign, Rubio said he won't run simultaneously for re-election for his Senate seat. Poll: Bush, Paul at top of wide-open 2016 GOP race . ""I believe that if you want to be president of the United States, you run for president,"" he said. ""You don't run for president with some eject button in the cockpit that allows you to go on an exit ramp if it doesn't work out."" Rubio has noted that Florida law prohibits candidates from being on the ballot for two offices, a rule he described as ""the right law."" But in Kentucky, allies of Paul have pushed a bill that would allow a federal candidate to simultaneously seek more than one office. Climate change controversy . In the same interview, Rubio set down a marker on climate change. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" Rubio said. ""I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy,"" he added. In the week since the Obama administration released a national climate change report that named Miami as the city most vulnerable to rising sea levels, Rubio has been critical of the White House push on global warming. ""I think it's an enormous stretch to say that every weather incident that we read about or the majority of them are attributable to human activity,"" he told CNN. Among other things, President Barack Obama has proposed new programs to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which most scientists say are the major cause of global warming. ""The President is, he's not a meteorologist. Here's what the President needs to be focused on. He's proposing a certain set of policies that he would have to admit if questioned will do nothing. If in fact these scientists are right and it's greenhouse gas emissions that are changing our climate, none of the things he's proposing would do anything to change that whatsoever, but it would have a devastating impact on our economy,"" Rubio told CNN. Rubio: No 'eject button' if he runs for president . While the latest polling indicates most Americans say that human activity is causing the earth to heat up, there's a wide partisan gap, and such comments could benefit a candidate among conservatives, who dominate voting in the GOP presidential primaries and caucuses. Building a resume . And Republican strategists say Rubio's resume building can only benefit him if he runs for higher office. ""Many voters believe President Obama's inexperience has hurt him. In their next president, they are going to be looking for maturity,"" Castellanos said. ""Rubio has to prove that he's mature enough to be president and he's beginning to do that by rather fearlessly taking on some tough foreign policy and domestic issues, from Crimea to global warming."" Rubio: Candidates should only run for one office at a time . And Madden says that's just what Rubio's doing. Rather than spending much of the past year traveling across the country, Rubio's been on Capitol Hill, putting policy ahead of politics. ""You can't just invent presidential buzz, at least not presidential buzz that lasts or translates into something real. You have to be involved in shaping the debate and fighting on the big issues that matter. Rubio has done that, so he's a part of the conversation,"" Madden added. But with the midterm election campaigns in full swing, giving potential GOP 2016ers plenty of opportunities to hit the trail in support of fellow Republicans, Rubio may soon be spending more time on the stump. Next month, he joins other possible GOP White House contenders at the annual Faith and Freedom Coalition ""Road to Majority"" Conference in Washington.","After spending much of the last year dodging 2016 talk, Marco Rubio re-emerges .

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- Faustino Barrientos has spent most of his 81 years in complete solitude and isolation. Since 1965 he's worked as a gaucho -- the horse-riding ranchers and shepherds of the harsh southern swath of Chile and Argentina known as Patagonia. For most of his life, Faustino's sole human contact has occurred once every two years, when he herds his cattle to the nearest town to sell. The gaucho lifestyle, which essentially consists of hunting and herding, has remained constant since the colonial era. To say these guys are lonesome is an understatement -- this isn't like moving to the country and starting a blog about local varieties of heirloom carrots. But Faustino wasn't always alone. He was raised on the shores of Lake O'Higgins in a place known as Once Hermanos, which is named after his family of 11 brothers and sisters. Over the years, the siblings moved away one by one. Then their parents died, their houses were burned down by vengeful neighbors, and the land was sold. Faustino eventually moved to Argentina, traveling the country and honing the skills that would allow him to eventually return to Lake O'Higgins and live off the land for the next 46 years. While Argentinean Patagonia can be barren and almost desert-like, Chilean Patagonia is rugged in the classical sense. It's peppered with craggy, Gothic mountains, dense forests and sparse pockets of civilization. Lake O'Higgins is located in the AysÃ©n region, one of the most remote areas of Patagonia. It's the least populated region in Chile, and one of the most sparsely populated places in the world outside Antarctica. The closet thing to an urban center is a place called Coihaique, in which more than half of the region's 100,000 residents reside, and smaller frontier settlements are home to fewer than 500 people, such as Villa O'Higgins where Faustino sells his livestock. Like most of the developing world, Faustino's land is rapidly changing. The transformation began shortly after the Falklands War. In the mid-1970s, Chile and Argentina became involved in what came to be known as the Beagle Conflict, a territorial dispute over the nearby Picton, Lennox, and Nueva islands. This kerfuffle served as the main reason for Chile's support of the UK during the Falklands War, another convoluted and somewhat silly conflict over a few chains of islands off the coast of Argentina that the British had long claimed as their own. At the time, Chile's dapper general-turned-dictator Augusto Pinochet was in command and decided that Chile needed a highway to make its far-flung regions more accessible to the military. See the rest of Faustino's Patagonian Retreat at VICE.COM . So, in 1976, the Chilean Army Engineering Command began construction on the Carretera Austral, forever changing Patagonia and its residents. By 1986, a mostly unpaved road connected remote communities throughout the country, and the Chilean military finally had easy access to the South. Due to the increased road access, the area developed a nascent yet thriving adventure-tourism industry based out of towns like Coihaique in the North and Torres del Paine and Punta Arenas in the South. Villa O'Higgins, however, has remained somewhat isolated despite all of the recent developments. It was only accessible by plane until 2000, when the final 62 miles of the 770-mile road finally linked the remote village to the rest of the highway (via an hour-long ferry ride to Puerto Yungay). Faustino lives 20 or so miles from Villa O'Higgins, but those miles are of the Chilean Patagonia variety. It takes him several days to make his biennial trip, wrangling his cattle up precarious switchbacks, along the sides of ravines, through rapid mountain rivers, and, eventually, to town. He lived like this, without really seeing another soul outside his biannual trips into town, for about 35 years, until the boats came. First, about a decade ago, a government ship began cruising the lake weekly for whatever reasons the government had deemed important. Then came the semiweekly tourist ship that would take sightseers to the O'Higgins Glacier -- a favorite among the global warming picture-taking set. At 81 years old, Faustino is still spry and still doesn't go to town very often, but he has somewhat adapted to the changes surrounding him. Now he retrieves his supplies from the boat and generates electricity via a solar panel, and he even recently got a new neighbor. The world is catching up to him, but it's a safe bet that whatever time Faustino has left will be spent staying as far away from civilization as he can manage.","VICE meets an 81-year-old man who has spent most of his life in complete isolation .

"(CNN) -- PetSmart is recalling seven of its Grreat Choice dog biscuit products because they contain peanut products made by a company that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak in 43 states and Canada, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. Peanut butter and peanut paste processed in a Georgia plant have been linked to an outbreak of salmonella. Dr. Stephen Sundlof, a veterinarian who is the director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said that the risk to animals is minimal but that people who handle contaminated treats could come in contact with the salmonella bacteria. ""It's especially important that children wash their hands after feeding treats to pets"" because the bacteria could be on the surface, Sundlof said. Sundlof said dogs aren't immune to salmonella and in some cases could get sick. They may be lethargic or get bloody diarrhea. On the other hand, they may never show symptoms at all but could still carry the bacteria. The outbreak of salmonella typhimurium has sickened at least 486 people, killing six, and has been linked to products manufactured by the Peanut Corp. of America in its Blakely, Georgia, plant.  Watch the latest on the salmonella outbreak » . PetSmart said it ""is not aware of any reported cases of illness related to these products"" but has removed the products from the shelves as a precautionary measure. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say that of the nearly 500 people sickened, 107 have been hospitalized. The most recent death was recorded Saturday. The first illnesses were reported September 8, and the most recent illness was reported January 8. The CDC still considers it an ongoing outbreak. The CDC does not consider salmonella typhimurium any more virulent than any other strain. The strain ""is not more or less than we would expect in a normal outbreak,"" said Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases. The FDA had reported that some of the samples from the Georgia plant tested positive for salmonella. On Wednesday, it said one sample was found in a crack of a floorboard near a bathroom and another was found on the floor near pallets in another room. Neither sample tested positive for the specific strain found in the sickened people, however. Sundlof said the lack of a match makes no difference from a regulatory point of view. ""Those salmonella are not supposed to be there. Having salmonella in the plant is not supposed to happen, regardless if it's the same strain or not,"" he said. Peanut butter produced by Peanut Corp. in Georgia is not sold in individual jars in grocery stores, health officials say. However, it is sold to institutions such as nursing homes, schools and cafeterias. Peanut Corp. also produces peanut paste, which is commonly used in cookies, crackers, cake, ice cream and other products, including the Grreat Choice dog biscuits. Peanut Corp. released a statement Wednesday stating that the company is cooperating with federal and state officials and that it ""will address the agency's findings when they are shared with us."" ""To date, we have nothing in writing from the agency that documents its findings that result from its ongoing investigation and testing onsite at our facility. We trust that at some point they will share this with us, and PCA will respond accordingly."" Minnesota health officials were the first to link the specific strain of salmonella that made three people ill in one nursing home to an open 5-pound container of peanut butter. Then Connecticut health officials found the same strain in an unopened tub of Peanut Corp.-produced peanut butter. After interviewing 57 sick people and 399 healthy people, CDC officials found ""an association of illness and prepackaged peanut butter crackers in general."" These people had consumed specific brands of products, particularly the Austin and Keebler brands, which are manufactured by the Kellogg Co. and have been recalled. CDC officials recommend that consumers who are uncertain about a product throw out all recalled products. They also suggest avoiding any other products they think could contain ingredients manufactured by Peanut Corp. until they are certain they aren't being recalled. About 125 products have been recalled. The FDA maintains a regularly updated list at its Web site. The Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, issued a news release calling for ""President Obama to appoint a new FDA commissioner as soon as possible to address peanut butter contamination and a growing list of other food safety problems.""","PetSmart is recalling seven of its Grreat Choice Dog Biscuit products .

"Washington (CNN) -- A nonpartisan panel reporting to Congress says the United States is wasting $12 million a day among contracts issued in support of American efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commission on Wartime Contracting spent the past three years documenting whether American funding went where it was supposed to. The findings show misdirected money has totaled between $31 billion and $60 billion, and that both the government and the contractors are to blame for fraud and waste. Commissioner Katherine Schinasi told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that the numbers don't seem to have an impact on people concerned about spending. To make it easier to grasp the magnitude of the problem, Schinasi said, ""we've broken it down to $12 million a day."" ""We are wasting $12 million a day,"" she said, ""maybe that will make a difference."" The study looked at contracts from 2001 through the projected end of fiscal year 2011. Without contract reform and better oversight, future prospects look just as ominous, the panel members warned, as the U.S. considers a role rebuilding Libya in a post-Gadhafi time frame. Dov Zakheim, a former comptroller at the Defense Department, said he believes the misdirected money is closer to $60 billion, not the low end of the range the panel itself has estimated. ""We also have to think about projects that we start, but are not sure can be finished or sustained,"" he said. ""What is the point of spending hundreds of millions on projects that will then fall into disuse?"" he asked, saying the choice then becomes writing off the investment, or ""spending taxpayer money for God knows how long, in order to keep the projects going."" The panel issued 15 recommendations for contract reform, including hiring more auditors and analysts to make sure the government gets what was paid for. The report was delivered to congressional staffers early Wednesday; lawmakers are on summer break. A paper statement was left with reporters from Rep. John Tierney of Massachusetts, who said the panel's findings ""are alarming."" Tierney, the ranking Democrat on a House subcommittee that reviews foreign operations, said he will introduce a bill next week ""to create a permanent inspector general for contingency operations."" Such a move is among the recommendations of the commission. Tierney's statement continued: ""The kind of waste we have witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan cannot be repeated."" The commission was a provision of the 2008 Defense Department budget, mandating an investigation into the reliance on contractors for security, logistics, and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the three-year probe, the panel held 25 formal hearings, and published two interim reports and five special reports to Congress.","Commission on Wartime Contracting issues a final report to Congress .

"(CNN) -- The chiseled face and steely baby blue eyes made convicted felon Jeremy Meeks an overnight celebrity. But his manager isn't exactly feeling the love. Meeks' family hired new representation to manage his new celebrity image after his mug shot went viral on social media under hashtags such as #hotfelon and #hotconvict. But some people have taken offense to the popularity of a man who has sat in jail before for felony theft and now faces new charges of weapons possession, gang membership and probation violation. Meeks' manager Gina Rodriguez says she received about 30 harassing phone calls, including a death threat. Her office filed a report Friday with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Rodriguez was hired last week to work with the Meeks family because ""they were getting overwhelmed,"" she said. ""What a way to get discovered."" The picture turned Meeks into an overnight celebrity and prompted various memes, including digitally altered images replacing his plain white T-shirt with spiffy high-end suits. Modeling offers in jail . Even in jail, Meeks, 30, has apparently had offers from modeling agencies and reality TV shows. Rodriguez said she is considering four different production companies for a show starring Meeks. And she's also in talks with a modeling agency, she said. Meeks is still in the San Joaquin County Jail. He was arraigned Friday after being pulled over by authorities in Stockton, California, during a gang sweep, police said. Meeks was driving and one of the passengers, Terry Bailey, 23, was on probation, the San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office said. ""A search of the passenger compartment yielded a 9mm round of ammunition and a small amount of what is believed to be marijuana,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement. ""A search of the trunk located an unregistered and loaded ... 45 caliber semiautomatic handgun along with two extended magazines."" Authorities did not say who the guns belonged to, but those in the car faces felony weapons charges. Meeks' rap sheet . Meeks' prior brushes with the law include resisting arrest and admitting ties to the Crips gang, authorities said. He also spent two years in prison in 2002 for a grand theft conviction, according to the district attorney's office. But his family insists he has turned over a new leaf. ""With his past history, he got out of being incarcerated and put his mind on focus to his family and started doing what he had to do,"" his brother, Bryan Varela, has told CNN affiliate KOVR. ""Living the dream that he always wanted."" Despite his ill fame, the fans have kept coming. ""... too handsome to be in the jail omg!!!"" one commenter posted to Facebook. ""I want to marry Jeremy and have all his babies. Seeing this picture brightened my day. When I'm feeling sad, alone and hopeless, I gaze into those dreamy blue eyes and all my fears go away,"" another said. But others are unswayed by his looks and disgusted with the attention he garners. ""The problem is that he gets more 'likes' than an average-looking or ugly guy who pulls a woman from a burning car or saves a kid from drowning,"" a commenter wrote under Meeks' photo. His fans may have to wait a little longer before they see him out of the jail setting. During the arraignment, authorities set his bail at $1 million.","Jeremy Meeks' family has hired a representative to manage publicity .

"(CNN) -- Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber is considering legislation that would declare a public safety emergency in some Oregon counties where residents often have been left to try to fend for themselves. The measure would also impose a temporary income tax on residents of counties unable to pay for public safety workers due to budget cuts. ""The state has an interest in maintaining a network of public safety throughout Oregon,"" said Amy Wojcicki, a spokesperson for the governor, in an e-mail statement to CNN. Josephine County, where there is one sheriff and three deputies to serve 80,000 people, would be one of those affected. The shortage of officers and the department's limited hours led to an incident in August that helped prompt state legislators to take action, CNN affiliate KOBI reported. A woman was assaulted by her ex-boyfriend after she called 911 and tried to get an officer at her home. Her call was transferred to the state police because the sheriff's department isn't staffed 24 hours a day or seven days a week, the station said. A dispatcher for the state police said, ""Uh, I don't have anybody to send out there. You know, obviously, if he comes inside the residence and assaults you, can you ask him to go away?"" The man was arrested later that day, was later convicted and is imprisoned, KOBI reported. Her distress call is not the only that has come in with officials unable to help, the station said. On Tuesday, residents of Josephine County, shot down a measure to increase property taxes to increase funding for their depleted sheriff department, court security, animal control and juvenile justice. The tax levy, voted down by 539 votes, would have provided a $9.6 million yearly fund over three years. ""It would have allowed us a calm breathing room to arrive a better funding source,"" County Commissioner Keith Heck told CNN. The average increase per homeowner would have been about $200 a year, explained Heck. ""We have had a history of people being very protective of having the lowest property tax in the state of Oregon. There has to be a groundswell of people that will be able to move those folks into a minority,"" said Heck, who expressed frustration at the fact that 49% of registered voters in the county did not vote. But as Heck explained, there is a very popular sentiment in the community of taking the law into your own hands. ""And that is all fine and dandy until you have to shoot somebody. But you better make sure you have shot him in accordance with the law because in an effort to save yourself $200 a year, you could lose everything you have. This is a real myopic view that permeates many folks in the community. They see only their situation instead of the community structure. They think, 'I will prospect only my land,'"" Heck said. Commissioner Simon Hare told KOBI that Oregon doesn't need to step in. ""I'm never for authority being usurped by the state,"" he said. ""I think we are best in a position to reflect the will of the people here and I always advocate for local control."" Josephine County's budget was dependent on a federal subsidy program, which dispersed money to offset shrinking timber receipts to 33 counties in the state, he said. It dried up last year, and the county has not received any funding this year. The federal government owns 70% of the land (which cannot be taxed by local governments) in the mostly forested county, where the last mill recently closed. But even if Kitzhaber and Oregon lawmakers pass the public safety emergency bill, local legislative leaders and the county's governing body would have to consent to it. That is a conversation, Heck said, that hasn't happened yet. CNN's Stefan Simon contributed to this report.","Woman was assaulted after calling 911 and being told no officer was available .

"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama formally announced Sunday that retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki, a decorated veteran and popular figure among critics of the Bush administration, is his pick to be secretary of Veterans Affairs. Retired Gen. Eric Shinseki Sunday promised to work for veterans ""each and every day."" ""There is no one more distinguished, more determined, or more qualified to build this VA than the leader I am announcing as our next secretary of Veterans Affairs -- Gen. Eric Shinseki,"" Obama said at a press conference. ""No one will ever doubt that this former Army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans. No one will ever question whether he will fight hard enough to make sure they have the support they need,"" Obama added. Obama said the nation must focus on helping troops who have served their country especially during bad economic times. ""We don't just need to better serve veterans of today's wars. We also need to build a 21st century VA that will better serve all who have answered our nation's call,"" Obama said.  Watch Obama talk about Shinseki » . Obama said Shinseki, who served two combat tours in Vietnam and lost part of his foot, ""understands the changing needs of our troops and their families. And he will be a VA secretary who finally modernizes our VA to meet the challenges of our time."" Shinseki, who spoke after Obama, made a vow to his fellow veterans. If confirmed, he said, he will ""work each and every day"" to ensure the nation is serving them ""as well as you have served us."" The official announcement took place in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, the anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. In an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Obama called Shinseki ""exactly the right person"" for the post. Host Tom Brokaw said Shinseki lost his job in the Bush administration ""because he said that we would need more troops in Iraq than the secretary of defense, Don Rumsfeld, thought that we would need at that time."" ""He was right,"" Obama replied. Veterans groups appeared to support the selection. ""I am excited. I don't know him personally but this is a huge move,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. For years, Shinseki, a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, has been cited as an example by Pentagon critics who say the former Army chief's sage advice was ignored in 2003, resulting in too few U.S. troops being sent to Iraq after the invasion. Shinseki testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2003 that ""something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers would be required"" to pacify the country. The comment infuriated some Bush administration officials, and he retired just a few months later. Shinseki has never spoken publicly about his testimony, which has often been cited by critics as evidence that Rumsfeld ignored the advice of one of his key generals. But as Army chief of staff, Shinseki was not in the chain of command, and played no direct role in drawing up the war plans. Pentagon sources say that, in fact, Shinseki never advocated higher troop levels for Iraq, in part because it was not his job to do so. And sources say that just before the invasion, when asked by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers if he agreed with the war plans, Shinseki voiced no objections. Still, Rieckhoff said, ""Shinseki is a guy who had a career putting patriotism above politics. He is a wounded veteran so he understands the plight of veterans."" iReport.com: What do you think of Obama's cabinet picks so far? He said Shinseki would have to make key connections with the veterans community, adding, ""This is a big name and it shows that he [Obama] is not going to treat the Veterans Affairs secretary as a low priority."" John Rowan, president of Vietnam Veterans of America, called the reported pick an ""interesting choice."" ""I am satisfied with it,"" Rowan told CNN on Saturday, adding that the choice seems to be in the Obama transition team's pattern of ""bringing in strong personalities into all the positions who aren't going to 'yes' him to death."" ""When Shinseki had his disagreements with the administration, he wasn't afraid to speak up,"" Rowan said. Veterans for Common Sense also weighed in, issuing a statement ""strongly"" supporting Shinseki. ""In February 2003, Gen. Shinseki honestly and correctly assessed our nation's military needs before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003,"" the statement said. ""This same level of candor and honesty will serve President-elect Obama well so he can quickly and accurately identify VA's many challenges and then implement responsible solutions that take into consideration our veterans' needs and concerns.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will unveil Wednesday a package of gun control proposals that, according to a source, will include universal background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will announce the proposals, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday. They will be joined by a group of children who wrote letters to the president in the aftermath of the December 14 shooting rampage by a lone gunman who killed 20 students and six adults at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school, Carney said. Obama will propose legislative steps he previously has backed, such as a ban on assault weapons, restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines and strengthening federal background checks of people attempting to buy guns, according to Carney. The president also will push for other steps that could include executive actions on his part that don't require congressional approval, Carney noted. More specifically, the source -- an official familiar with the process -- said the president's proposal will press for a ban on high capacity magazines with more than 10 rounds, universal background checks and a request that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety. Biden led a panel assembled by Obama to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings with guns. Opponents led by the powerful National Rifle Association promise a political fight against gun control measures that they say will violate the constitutional right to bear arms. An NRA spokesman said Tuesday the group has experienced what he called an ""unprecedented"" spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month. Approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization's existing 4.25 million members, according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""This is in direct response to the threats and accusations coming from"" Obama and other political leaders, Arulanandam said, adding that ""if anyone is wondering if the American people cared about the Second Amendment ... those numbers give a very clear answer."" In addition to new members, the NRA is also receiving an influx of financial contributions, he said. ""This is going to be a very expensive and hard-fought fight,"" Arulanandam noted. The federal government estimates that more than 300 million non-military guns are owned or available for purchase in the United States. At the White House, Carney acknowledged the challenge, saying: ""If these things were easy, they would have been achieved already."" ""It's something we have to do together,"" he said. ""It's something that cannot be done by a president alone. It can't be done by a single community alone or a mayor or a governor or by Congress alone. We all have to work together."" Carney also reiterated Obama's belief in the Second Amendment right of citizens to be armed. ""He has made clear that he believes we ought to take common sense, and enact common sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights but prevent people who should not have weapons from obtaining them,"" he said. Carney said the proposals Obama will present Wednesday would be his final version of the package recommended by Biden's team. The recommendations by Biden's panel included as many as 19 executive actions, such as tougher enforcement of existing laws, legislators briefed by the vice president said Tuesday. Obama could demand that agencies provide data for background checks that are supposed to accompany gun sales, ensuring that information included in the checks is as ""comprehensive and complete as possible,"" Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California told CNN. The president also could immediately appoint a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which has been without a permanent chief for six years, Thompson said. A Democratic member of Congress who was briefed on the recommendations said some of the 19 executive actions discussed included improving the way the government administers current law. The legislator, speaking on condition of not being identified, cited loopholes in the federal database for background checks on gun sales as well as issues involving mental health checks as possibilities for executive action. Across the country, more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales. None of the legislators mentioned the NRA's call for armed guards at school as an option under consideration. Obama has not ruled out issuing executive orders on some gun control measures to enforce laws already on the books, such as bolstering the way gun sales are tracked. The president reiterated his desire on Monday for more robust background checks for gun buyers, keeping high capacity magazines away from criminals, and a ban on assault weapons. ""Will all of them get through this Congress? I don't know,"" Obama said. ""But what's uppermost in my mind is making sure that I'm honest with the American people and members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference."" Working with Congress will be paramount in curbing gun violence, Thompson said, singling out a ban on high capacity magazines as an example of a measure that could garner Republican support. A full-scale assault weapon ban would be tougher to pass the GOP-controlled House, he argued. Obama also said on Monday that the gun lobby was ""ginning up"" fears the federal government will use the Connecticut tragedy to seize Americans' guns. At least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing, he implied. ""It's certainly good for business,"" the president said, responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks since the December killings. Biden has said he's found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines, which gun control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings. The influential NRA, among other gun rights groups, has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions -- like an assault weapon ban. Gun control advocates, gun violence victims, the NRA, video game makers and others have met with the Biden-led task force. In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations -- the nation's first since the Newtown shootings. Both New York's GOP-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled Assembly approved the measure by overwhelming margins. It includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state, altering the current system, in which each county or municipality sets a standard. Residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10. ""The changes in New York are largely cosmetic,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described existing regulations as ""the toughest gun laws in the United States."" Lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year. Meanwhile, new national polls indicated a majority of Americans support some or most gun control measures. By a 51%-45% margin, Americans questioned in a new Pew Research Center poll said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights. And by a 52%-35% margin, a new ABC News/Washington Post survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month's massacre. However, the polls showed continuing divisions on political and gender lines. Mexico watching with interest .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan have given up on signing Chelsea's Portuguese pair Ricardo Carvalho and Deco for the time being. Chelsea's Portuguese midfielder Deco has been strongly linked with a summer transfer to Inter Milan. The duo had been linked with a move to the San Siro where they would link-up again with former Chelsea and Porto coach Jose Mourinho. Reports had suggested Inter sent a representative to London to talk to Chelsea about a possible deal for the two players, but the Italians' transfer consultant Lele Oriali insisted that was untrue. Oriali told Sky Italia: ""Inter don't need emissaries, the president didn't send anyone and neither did I. ""Having had the fortune of being able to speak directly with Chelsea, we know that they are ready to negotiate over these two players, but the asking price is too high. ""The deal is not as simple as it might seem. It's unrealistic for us in the current conditions. At the moment the deal is closed, and we don't know if it will open up again later on.""","Inter Milan pull the plug on signing Chelsea pair Ricardo Carvalho and Deco .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has admitted he was left angered by the decision to sell Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona, although the Inter Milan coach reveals he is delighted to welcome Samuel Eto'o to the San Siro. Jose Mourinho believes Inter Milan have done good business in selling Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona. Inter are on the verge of completing a deal which will see them receive 45 million euros ($64m) plus Eto'o for Ibrahimovic after both players agreed terms with their prospective clubs. Mourinho knows it will be a blow to lose last year's leading goalscorer in Serie A but, speaking about the deal for the first time, admitted it is a fantastic bit of business. ""I was a bit angry because no coach is happy to lose Ibrahimovic,"" the Portuguese told Sky Italia. ""But no one is not happy to have Eto'o -- we have lost a top player but we have taken another one. If I talk as a coach and a man on the pitch, I say that I don't want to lose this player. If I talk as a manager, I say that Inter have done great business,"" added Mourinho. Mourinho feels Ibrahimovic will adapt to life at the Nou Camp in no time but insists he would not make a similar move. ""He had this dream and wanted to go,"" added the Nerazzurri coach. ""He told me he would miss me and I told him exactly the same thing. He's going to a club in which I worked for four years, Barcelona are an extraordinary club and he will be happy. ""I didn't give him any advice but I spoke to him a few days before the final decision. I told him that if he wins the Champions League with Barcelona he won't be doing anything extraordinary, seeing as they have won it twice in three years. I like doing something extraordinary, not what's normal.""","Jose Mourinho angered by the decision to sell Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Count one more world leader out of the Winter Olympics, which start February 7 in Sochi, Russia. French President Francois Hollande will not be attending the Sochi Games, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Sunday. Less than a week after German President Joachim Gauck chose to boycott the Olympics, Fabius was asked about Hollande's plans for the Games. ""This (has) not been planned ... to attend,"" Fabius responded. ""But at the same time I wish all the success for these games. But for now, it is not expected that the highest French authorities attend."" Like German officials, Fabius declined to explain the decision further. Eighty kings, queens, presidents and other world leaders attended the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Summer Olympics, according to the British newspaper The Guardian. Host country Russia has been receiving scrutiny and criticism for alleged human rights violations, harassment of opposition political figures, and a law passed earlier this year banning ""gay propaganda,"" which critics have said promotes discrimination.

"(CNN) -- A little more than two weeks after it first went on sale for $99, Apple's colorful new iPhone 5c is already on the bargain racks. First Best Buy rolled out a promotion on Thursday to offer the Apple iPhone 5C for $50, and now RadioShack and Walmart have announced similar price cuts on the new device. On Friday, Walmart â€” which was already selling the phone for $79 â€” slashed its price to $45 through the holiday season, while RadioShack plans to give customers $50 gift cards to apply towards the iPhone 5C phone through Nov. 2. Best Buy's deal only lasts through Oct. 7. All promotions apply only if customers sign a two-year wireless contract. The 5C, which costs $99 if purchased through Apple with a two-year contract (or $549 without), is the cheaper version of the 5S phone. Analysts speculated that the 5C would not do as well as the high-end 5S, which costs $199 with a contract and features a fingerprint sensor, better camera and faster processor. The 5S has been frequently sold out at various locations, even though Apple reported shipping 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C models in the first weekend alone. Retailers like Best Buy and Walmart are slashing prices in an effort to entice consumers to buy the 5C, according to ABC. Target is also offering a reduced price on the colorful plastic model.","Retailers have already slashed the price of the iPhone 5C .

"(CNN) -- Indonesia's president on Wednesday announced a two-year moratorium on new concessions to convert virgin forests and peat lands into plantations, part of an internationally backed strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation. The announcement by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono came on the eve of an international conference in Oslo, Norway, on climate change and deforestation. Indonesia is one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases because of rampant clearing and burning of its forests and peat lands for logging and conversion into palm oil plantations. The country has long been a target of harsh criticisms from environmental groups who have accused the government of failing to enforce its own laws. Yudhoyono said Indonesia would ""conduct a moratorium for two years where we stop the conversion of peat land and of forest."" He was joined by Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who said Norway would provide $1 billion to Indonesia to help with the effort to reduce deforestation. ""Indonesia is a key country in terms of reducing deforestation. Therefore this agreement and Indonesia's commitment is a great step forward in achieving large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,"" Stoltenberg said. Yudhoyono said the halt on new concessions would start in 2010 as part of a broader strategy to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020. Deforestation accounts for almost a fifth of total greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. The Indonesia-Norway partnership to cut emissions is part of a broader international strategy called Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD, that would make stored carbon dioxide in tropical forests a commodity that can be bought and sold on the global market.","Indonesia announces two-year moratorium on converting forests and peat lands into plantations .

"St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN) -- Vladimir Putin was out on a mission here in his hometown to re-boot his languishing economy after political moves involving Ukraine scared off investors in the past half year. While voters were readying for an election this weekend in Ukraine, the Russian president spent 48 hours at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum to convey a message to those in attendance, his domestic constituency and investors watching our coverage from abroad. The images showed an engaged leader in constant dialogue with corporate titans and one helping to support dealmaking. Putin stood proudly behind Igor Sechin, the CEO of his energy giant Rosneft, as he finalized a recent agreement with his counterpart Marco Tronchetti Provera of Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli. The signing of seven agreements on Saturday capped off a week where Putin orchestrated a $400bn, 30-year agreement with China to export natural gas. To underscore that moment, he invited a Chinese vice-premier to his annual roundtable. Bringing him here reinforced the new partnership and illustrates to the world Russia is moving east to Asia to capture business. Alexey Ulyukaev, Russia Economic Development Minister and a member of ""Team Putin"" told a CNN emerging markets roundtable here at SPIEF. ""This is our message: nothing personal, nothing political, just business."" Impact of Crimea . But politics and business have clashed over Ukraine. President Putin's move to annex Crimea may have boosted his poll ratings at home, but it certainly has not helped his standing in global business. U.S. and EU sanctions prompted capital flight of $60bn in the first quarter. More worrying, cabinet ministers and business leaders told me, it's holding back decision making. ""This problem is not the sanctions themselves which are in place at the moment,"" said Dmitry Konov, CEO of the Russian natural gas and petro-chemical group Sibur, ""but rather that most of our partners don't know what to expect if anything."" That uncertainty is hitting an economy already in decline. Russia was growing 4% back in 2010, but it has taken a staircase lower to just over 1% last year. It is projected to barely expand this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. There is also the potential danger of global contagion by trying to isolate a near $2 trillion economy like Russia. ""It's very difficult to solve the problem without engagement, ""said Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, Chairman of the Executive Committee at private equity firm Abraaj Group. ""I don't think we'll find solution without engagement. And I would apply it to both: commercial and political decisions,"" he added. After the final event of the forum, Sechin of Rosneft told me constant questions on sanctions don't help matters. He has been the target of U.S. sanctions limiting his ability to travel there for business with partners such as Exxon-Mobil. ""I suggest we don't discuss the sanctions anymore because it is counterproductive,"" he said, adding, ""The increased attention to sanctions and discussion of sanctions significantly increase their importance."" Corporate leaders understand that Putin and his team want to turn the page on Ukraine, but there is another reality. Beyond all the efforts to convey a message of ""business as usual,"" investors who attended the forum said they want to see how the Kremlin responds to events after the Ukraine election.

"(CNN) -- New York City plans to move the remains of unidentified victims in the 2001 terror attack to a new resting place within the 9/11 Memorial Museum, officials tell CNN. The roughly 8,000 remains, which are in the custody of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, will be moved to the museum this year, spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said. ""We are making plans, but we are going to notify the families before we make any further announcement,"" she said. The remains will be kept behind a wall in an area off-limits to the public, according to 9/11 museum spokesman Michael Frazier. The museum's website says the wall, which visitors will be able to view, is to be inscribed with the following from the Roman poet Virgil: ""No day shall erase you from the memory of time."" Only medical examiners and families of victims will be given access to the repository, according to the spokesperson for both the museum and the medical examiner's office. The decision to house remains in the museum repository has been controversial. In 2011, 17 families of 9/11 victims filed a petition in court to force the museum to consult with the victims' families before deciding what to do with the remains. They eventually asked for a congressional hearing. Both efforts were unsuccessful. On its website, the museum said the decision to move the remains to the repository at the museum was because of overwhelming feedback received from families after the attacks. The 9/11 Memorial Museum is scheduled to open this spring as part of the part of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site. DNA identifications of the unidentified remains will continue in the new repository, according to the museum. In New York, 2,753 people were killed when hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers of the World Trade Center.

"(CNN) -- I met the original Wild Thing when he was about halfway through his long life. At a conference of many fine artists and writers, Maurice Sendak was indisputably ""King of All Wild Things."" But in the late 1970s, when ""Where the Wild Things Are"" was only 15 years old (it is turning 50 soon), it was already, indisputably, a classic. But not just a classic of children's books. It was a seminal book about childhood, and a journal of the life of an artist, and a clarion call for the satisfaction of those twin and opposite needs: independence and society. The man himself was small, compact, witty, intense. He was not above gossip; he could be vindictive, salacious, morose and self-absorbed. But friends and admirers took all that in their stride. And he will be remembered for his uncompromising vision not about the sweetness of children -- their purity -- but about their complexity and wholeness as human beings. Scholars suggest that in earlier centuries children were considered as deformed adults, more animal than angel. Or they were perfect packaged gifts from heaven, Mother Nature in glorious form, only to be corrupted by growing up. Sendak stood up squarely in the middle of the last century, and he shouted both those inanities out the door. Children are full humans, compromised only by their lack of vocabulary and practice in reporting how they live. But they live as fully as Sendak himself lived right up to his last months and weeks and hours. News: Author of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" dies . He leaves us with images of children flying to adventure and back again. Mickey In the Night Kitchen swooping out of his clothes into a basin of bread batter. Max Where the Wild Things Are sailing to the wild rumpus ""in and out of weeks and almost over a year."" Using images and techniques inspired by William Blake, Randolph Caldecott, Samuel Palmer and others, Maurice Sendak interpreted the works of great masters: Grimm, George MacDonald, Herman Melville. But he was never humbled by the association. No, their reputations were enhanced by his attention to them. The Beastie Boys' link to Sendak: Spike Jonze . I knew him for about 35 years. As I turned from writing for children to writing for adults and began my novel ""Wicked,"" I thought of how he never stopped yearning to make the next beautiful thing, the next meaningful page, even when his royalty checks piled up like oak leaves in the autumn around his country doorway. It was the work that counted, the chance of learning something new about himself. The chance of having something new to pass on to us. Reaction: Sendak sparked 'wild' creativity in young readers . Were there time, I would write more; but, you see, there are some books over there I need to look at again, more closely than before. I do not put them back on the shelves. There is no time for that kind of luxury. I need to remember, now, what he told us. Meanwhile, as he passes away, some more sentimental scrap of me (that he would have scorned) hopes he is settling down to some nice bowl of chicken soup with rice with Emily Dickinson or Herman Melville. Though they have been impatient to meet him in person for a very long time, no doubt they'll greet him as a fellow king. By now, Sendak is finding his dinner waiting for him. And it is still hot. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Maguire .","Gregory Maguire says when he met him, Maurice Sendak was clearly King of All Wild Things .

"Washington (CNN) -- Victims and families of those killed in the Fort Hood massacre are asking compensation totaling $750 million from the government for failing to stop the attack. Eighty-three administrative claims were filed last week, saying the Army, the FBI, and the Justice and Defense departments are guilty of gross and willful negligence for not recognizing that the man charged in the shootings, Maj. Nidal Hasan, was a threat. ""Although they had clear knowledge and warnings that Hasan posed a grave danger to the lives and safety of soldiers and civilians with whom he came into contact, they did nothing to eliminate the known risk posed by him,"" the ""basis of claim"" document alleges. ""On the contrary, bowing to 'political correctness,' the DOD, DOA (Department of the Army), DOJ, and FBI, in wanton disregard of the safety of military and civilian personnel, intentionally ignored the threat he presented,"" says the document, which was attached to each of the 83 claims. Hasan is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more in the killing spree at a medical building at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, where soldiers were screened before deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. His court martial, in which prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, is set to begin March 5. Hasan has not entered a plea. The lawyer handling the compensation claim, Neal Sher, said the next step depends on the government. ""The Army is taking the lead,"" Sher told CNN. ""They have six months either to deny the claim or satisfactorily resolve it."" After that, the case could move into federal court. Since immediately following the attacks there have been widespread questions about how Hasan was evaluated, promoted and transferred to Fort Hood with plans to deploy to Afghanistan despite questions about his ideology and stability. A congressional report labeled him ""a smoking gun,"" and ripped into the government for not sounding an alarm. ""Although neither the Department of Defense nor the FBI had specific information concerning the time, place, or nature of the attack, they collectively had sufficient information to have detected Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism but failed both to understand and to act on it,"" said the report from Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""Our investigation found specific and systemic failures in the government's handling of the Hasan case and raises additional concerns about what may be broader systemic issues,"" it said. The government refuses to confirm reports that U.S. intelligence agencies had monitored Hasan's e-mail contacts with American-born radical Anwar al-Awlaki, who in September was killed by an American drone attack in Yemen. ""It is a tragic irony that our government sought out and killed al-Awlaki, while Hasan was promoted in the Army and put in a position to carry out his murderous terror attack,"" attorney Sher had said in an earlier statement. ""It is a sad commentary on our avowed war on terror that the government deliberately refused to take even minimal steps to neutralize the clear threat posed by Hasan, who made no secret of, and actually boasted about, his anti-American and jihadist views."" Victims and witnesses identified Hasan as the shooter during a preliminary hearing at Fort Hood last year. They described the mayhem inside the building, floors slick with blood as the gunman fired more than 150 rounds and methodically reloaded his handgun. Hasan was shot and partially paralyzed in a shootout with police. A Fort Hood spokesman acknowledged that the compensation claims had been filed. ""We are aware of the cases but are not able to speak to the specifics,"" spokesman Tyler Broadway said in an e-mail. ""The cases will be taken seriously and will follow due process.""","83 claims have been filed by those wounded and the families of those killed at Fort Hood .

"(CNN) -- Chen Guangcheng, activist . Q: Why did you change your mind about staying in China? A: I think it's time for me to make such a choice. Q: Why? A: For safety. Q: Fear for your life or your family's? A: Both. Chinese activist tells CNN: 'We are in danger' Q: What would happen if you stay in China? A: Anything could happen. Q: U.S. officials said you looked optimistic when you walked out of the embassy, what happened? A: At the time I didn't have a lot of information. I wasn't allowed to call my friends from inside the embassy. I couldn't keep up with news so I didn't know a lot of things that were happening. Q: What prompted your change of heart? A: The embassy kept lobbying me to leave and promised to have people stay with me in the hospital. But this afternoon as soon as I checked into the hospital room, I noticed they were all gone. Q: Has the U.S. disappointed you? A: I'm very disappointed at the U.S. government. Q: Why? A: I don't think (U.S. officials) protected human rights in this case. Q: What would you say to U.S. President Obama? A: I would like to say to (President Obama): Please do everything you can to get our whole family out. Q: Is this your most urgent wish? A: That's right. Q: What has your wife told you after you escaped? A: (My wife) was tied to a chair by police for two days. Then they carried sticks to our home, threatening to beat her to death. Now they have moved into the house -- eating at our table and using our stuff. Our home is teeming with security -- on the roof and in the yard. They have installed seven surveillance cameras inside the house and built electric fences around the yard. Q: What did officials tell her if you didn't leave the embassy? A: They said they would send her back (to Shandong) and people there would beat her. Q: If you stay in China, is there no future? A: I tend to think so. Q: You learned most information in the hospital after you left the embassy? A: Yes, most of it. Q: Are your wife and kids with you? A: Yes. I just switched my cell phone back on. For a while, I couldn't make or receive calls. Now I can receive calls but still can't dial out. I feel my rights are already being violated. Q: Is it true no one from the embassy picked up your calls? A: Yes. I called two embassy people numerous times. Q: What do you want to say to the U.S. government? A: I want them to protect human rights through concrete actions. We are in danger. If you can talk to Hillary (Clinton), I hope she can help my whole family leave China. Q: As soon as possible? A: Yes, as soon as possible. Q: The whole world is watching you -- how do you feel about this? A: I feel very grateful. I feel they are sincere in their concern, not just for show. Q: Do you feel you were lied to by the embassy? A: I feel a little like that. Q: What has this ordeal taught you? A: I feel everyone focuses too much on their self-interest at the expense of their credibility. Q: You're both still up at 3 a.m. -- feeling anxious? A: Yes, we feel a lot of anxiety.... I told the embassy I would like to talk to Rep. Smith (Congressman Chris Smith) but they somehow never managed to arrange it. I feel a little puzzled. Yuan Weijing, Chen Guangcheng's wife . Q: What do you want right now? A: After seeing the reality, we both want to leave this place with our kids as soon as possible. It's very dangerous for us. Q: Has the situation gotten worse since his escape? A: Yes, worse. Q: What happened to you after he escaped -- where is his mother? A: She's still back home and others have moved in. It used to be plainclothes security hired locally but now it's all policemen. They've threatened to cut our power. They are also digging something outside our yard. It seems that they'll install something there. Q: What happened when they took you into custody after his escape? A: They wanted to know how exactly he escaped. Guangcheng is blind and we hired so many guards, how did we lose him and what exactly would he do once he was out? Q: Is China the kind of country you want to bring your children up? A: After Guangcheng got out, the government was persuading me to stay here. But they were also tightening their grip on me. I became really worried. If they ever get us back home, they would put us in an iron cage. Q: What would you say to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? A: I know Sino-U.S. relations encompass many issues and they have to consider many things. But the reality about my family is that our lives are in obvious danger. If we stay here or get sent back to Shandong, our lives would be at stake. Under such circumstances, I hope the U.S. government will protect us and help us leave China based on its value of protecting human rights. Q: Are you prepared for not being allowed back? A: We are prepared because our current situation is very dangerous... They made many promises. But right now, we can't even freely use our phone. I can't even freely walk out of the hospital. Friends can't visit us. It just proves that our human rights are not being protected. Q: Are there people watching you at the hospital? A: They have security guards here. Q: Have the embassy people have left? A: Yes. They promised to stay here with Guangcheng -- that would give us some sense of security. But we haven't seen anyone since we checked into this hospital room.

"Beijing (CNN) -- After years of being badgered by her parents to get married, 26-year-old Zhang Yu finally had enough. ""I have decided never to marry or have a child,"" said Zhang, a university graduate from Changsha, Hunan province, who moved to Shanghai earlier this year to escape her family and jumpstart her career. Zhang's vow to never marry is rare in a country where educated women are constantly told by their families, friends and the state media that they will be lonely and miserable if they do not find a husband quickly. Yet some women are fighting back by rejecting marriage altogether. Zhang had been living with her parents in Hunan to save money after obtaining her college degree, and for a time, fell sway to her parents' worries that she would become a ""leftover woman"" (or ""shengnv"" in Chinese,) officially defined as an urban, educated woman over age 27 who is single. But upon reading feminist websites, she came to believe the term existed to make women return to the home. She then took a risk by moving to Shanghai without a job and leaving the comforts of home for a dorm room shared with nine other roommates. But she loves her new friends and sense of freedom. ""Men are still thinking in the old ways, but women's values have evolved. I feel very relaxed now,"" said Zhang, who just received a sales job offer. Lan Fang, a 32-year-old client relations manager for a financial company in Shanghai, similarly embraces her single lifestyle. She enjoys a relatively high income of 20,000 RMB a month (around US$3,200) and often goes out with friends to dinners, movies and concerts. ""Where I grew up in Nanjing, I saw so many couples getting into big fights, and most of them seemed unhappy. Plus, so many men have affairs,"" Lan said. ""My life in Shanghai now is very rich, why would I want to change it?"" Zhang and Lan are in the minority, but their attitudes reflect the reality that marriage in today's China does little to protect women's rights. Domestic abuse . For example, a Chinese woman has almost no recourse if her husband abuses her. Official statistics show that a quarter of women have experienced intimate partner violence, but feminist activists say that number is an underestimate. Li Ying, an attorney and director of the Yuanzhong Gender Development Center in Beijing, said many women do not recognize they are victims of domestic violence. ""Ask a woman if she has experienced domestic violence and she will say, 'Oh no, of course not!'"" Li said. ""Ask her if her husband has hit her and she will say yes."" Despite years of intense lobbying by women's rights groups, the Chinese government has failed to enact targeted legislation to curb domestic violence. ""Judges almost never define a case as 'domestic violence' because the current law in China is not specific or clear enough,"" said Feng Yuan, a leading activist with the Anti-Domestic Violence Network in Beijing. As a result, it is extremely difficult for women to secure protection from a violent partner. 'The most rational choice is to stay single' Married women also experienced a severe setback to their property rights in 2011, when the Supreme People's Court amended China's Marriage Law to state, essentially, that marital property belongs to the person whose name is on the home deed. In China, that person is usually the husband. According to a 2012 survey by Horizon China of home buying in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, only 30% of marital home deeds include the woman's name, even though over 70% of women contribute to the marital home purchase. This is just one of the ways in which Chinese women have been shut out of arguably the largest accumulation of residential property wealth in history, valued at 3.3 times China's GDP, according to figures from HSBC. That amounted to more than $28 trillion at the end of 2012. Defenders of the court ruling on marriage argue that women are entitled to compensation for their share of the home payments, but most women do not keep receipts of their contributions. And stay-at-home mothers have even less financial protection in the event of a divorce. Many women are upset about the change in the Marriage Law, but the authoritarian nature of China's one-party state has prevented a women's rights movement from gaining traction. ""The institution of marriage basically benefits men, and when women are hurt, this institution doesn't protect our rights,"" a young woman in Beijing recently told me.

"(EW.com) -- ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" showed its summer might once more by holding onto the No. 1 spot in its second weekend of release, grossing an estimated $36.4 million from 4,233 locations and effectively shutting out the slate of new releases. Michael Bay's explosive epic also hit $400 million internationally after just 12 days in release. But, overall, it was a quiet holiday weekend at the box office, and the gap between 2013 and 2014 summer earnings only continues to grow. None of the week's new releases were ever going to match last year's Despicable Me 2 opening. Among the weekend openers was Warner Bros.' R-rated comedy ""Tammy"" (C+ Cinema Score), which managed to take in just $21.2 million in its first weekend in release and $32.9 million across the five-day, cooling star Melissa McCarthy's recent box office hot streak. The second place opening isn't a disaster by any meansâ€”the pic only cost $20 million to produceâ€”but it also didn't meet the studio's modest expectations ($37 million across five days). On top of that, the lousy Cinema Score means that this one will drop hard and fast. In third place, Screen Gems' and Jerry Bruckheimer Films' ""Deliver Us From Evil"" (B- Cinema Score) grossed an estimated $9.5 million from 3,049 locations this weekend, bringing its five-day total to $15 million. The ""based on true accounts"" supernatural tale reportedly cost $30 million to produce. It also earned $2.5 million from 16 markets internationally. Sony's 22 ""Jump Street"" snagged the fourth place spot in its fourth weekend with $9.4 million from 3,324 locations. That's only a 41 percent fall from last weekend for the comedy, which now boasts a domestic total of $158.9 million. Fox's ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" rounded out the top five with an $8.75 million weekend. 1. Transformers: Age of Extinction -- $36.4 million weekend ($174.7 million domestic) 2. Tammy -- $21.17 million weekend ($32.91 million domestic total) 3. Deliver Us From Evil â€” $9.5 million ($15 million domestic total) 4. 22 Jump Street -- $9.4 million ($158.85 million domestic total) 5. How to Train Your Dragon 2 -- $8.75 million ($140 million domestic total) ""Earth to Echo,"" meanwhile, opened at No. 6 and earned an estimated $8.25 million across the three-day and $13.5 million over its five days in release from 3,230 screens, failing to meet analyst and distributor expectations by a few million dollars. Relativity bought the family-friendly pic from Disney in 2013, which follows a group of friends who discover an alien in their small town and resolve to help him find his way home. The inexpensive pic ($13 million) was released over the holiday in an effort to provide counter-programming to a slate mostly devoid of family films (an industry low since 2007). And, while it may have missed the mark opening weekend, the A- Cinema Score could indicate that word of mouth will be strong for this movie and that it'll perform decently across the next few weeks. In notable expansions, distributor Lionsgate rolled out Dinesh D'Souza's ""America"" (A+ Cinema Score) to 1,105 theaters this weekend where it brought in an estimated $2.7 million, bringing its domestic cume to $4.04 million. Snowpiercer also expanded to 250 theaters and took in $998K across the three day weekend.

"(CNN) -- It began with the self-immolation of an unemployed college graduate in Tunisia. Now, newfound people power in the Middle East and North Africa is spreading fast. Bolstered by the toppling of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, popular uprising has now taken root in a part of the world where it has not been a part of the trajectory of change. On Tuesday, the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed, parts of the Muslim world were on fire, the people clamoring for change. Fierce demonstrations erupted in Bahrain, where people have organized themselves through social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, the same forums used by their Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts. Human rights activists said Bahrainis initially demanded reform, but some are now calling for the removal of the royal family. In Yemen, pro- and anti-government protesters clashed for a fifth day in the capital city of Sanaa. ""This is against the Yemeni constitution, and people have the right to peacefully protest,"" said human rights activist Abdel Rahman Barman. And, as Cairo's Tahrir Square slowly emptied, Tehran's Azadi Square swelled with people. Both names mean freedom and despite a security crackdown, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in the Iranian capital Monday. Algeria, Jordan and Syria have also been a part of the domino effect. ""We really are facing a tsunami in Arab politics,"" said Bruce Riedel, senior fellow for foreign policy at Brookings' Saban Center for Middle East Policy. ""I don't think there is any country -- except the very small and very rich and oil-rich countries like Qatar and Abu Dhabi -- that is immune,"" Riedel said. ""All of these countries have the potential for unrest in a way they've never had it before."" If only Mohammed Bouazizi, the 26-year-old unemployed man who was beaten by police and then set himself on fire, had lived to see what he began. But Bouazizi died in January, a catalyst for the events that unfolded rapidly after his death. Tunisian dictator Zine El Abedine Ben Ali fell on January 14 and fled the country. Just days later, Egyptians began massing at Tahrir Square. After 18 short days, Mubarak was gone, as abruptly as he had risen to power three decades ago. ""The yearning for change has been there for at least a decade, if not more, but it took the events in Tunisia and now Egypt to break the barrier of fear that people had,"" Riedel said. ""Fear that the army would shoot them, fear that the army would crack down on them. What it did was it broke that barrier of fear."" The region -- where people are divided between fabulously wealthy ""haves"" and desperately poor ""have-nots,"" a region split between those who can and those who cannot participate in government -- sits like a tinderbox, ready to explode. ""There's a common thread there,"" said David Pollock, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Yes, they do want freedom in the sense of not national independence -- they have that -- but freedom from oppressive internal security, authoritarian political controls and the freedom to participate in a more democratic government,"" he said. There are also economic concerns. ""People are very upset, and in many cases I think with good reason, about poverty and unemployment,"" Pollock said. Aaron Miller, a Middle East expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said the divide between the ""cans"" and the ""cannots"" is, in some ways, more dangerous than the gap between rich and poor. These are no peasant revolts, Miller said. The people on the streets include huge numbers of under- and unemployed people, ""sometimes affluent individuals who feel humiliated and powerless."" ""That's one of the driving psychological factors that powered Egypt's uprising,"" Miller said. There is also a vast generational gap that some governments may not be able to bridge, said Ken Gude, managing director for national security at the Center for American Progress. ""Most of these entrenched regimes throughout the region are governed by an old elite establishment that has grown more and more out of touch with the younger generations of its population,"" Gude said. ""Consequently, we're seeing -- perhaps sparked by what transpired in Egypt and Tunisia -- a stronger push among those younger generations for greater influence and a larger political voice in their country."" The potential for uprisings exists in those places where all the gaps are widest, though it's impossible to predict whether other dictators or entrenched regimes will fall as they did in Tunisia and Egypt. Beyond the overarching commonalities, each nation faces specific challenges. Yemen must deal with regional and tribal rivalries. Bahrain faces simmering tension between Sunnis, who form the ruling class, and Shiites, who form a slight majority. Pollock said Saudi Arabia, too, could possibly see unrest, but probably on a small scale. And in Syria, ""people are just too scared, too intimidated"" by Bashar al-Assad's iron hand. Algeria, he said, also bears watching because it shares many of Egypt's underlying issues of high numbers of young people, unemployment, corruption and a leadership that has been in power for a while. Other countries, like Morocco, have been ""surprisingly quiet,"" Pollock said. In Morocco, the king has only been around for a decade, and Pollock said perhaps people are still willing to give him a chance. There have also been some ""safety valves,"" such as a parliament. The United Arab Emirates, Pollock said, is a wealthy nation that can afford to take care of its citizens, if necessary, in pretty lavish style. And about 75% of the people are guest workers from other nations ""who don't have any rights at all,"" Pollock said. And then there is Iran. It's no stranger to mass demonstrations -- the Islamic regime itself came to power through revolution. But the regime has already shown the world that it will not hesitate to suppress street demonstrations and the opposition there has not yet been able to coalesce around common goals, said Karim Sajadpour, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The other problem in Iran, Sajadpour said, is that the international media have been banned from covering the demonstrations. The world cannot see what is happening in Azadi Square as they did in Tahrir Square. But Pollock predicted protests will continue in Iran. ""We saw yesterday that despite the most severe kind of internal repression, you had thousands of demonstrators out on the streets, and that's the tip of the iceberg,"" Pollock said. ""I think this probably foreshadows a long period of cat-and-mouse games continuing between the opposition and the regime at kind of a simmer."" Pollock did not see another government's ouster on the horizon. ""But it's important to note that after Tunisia it took a while, it took a few weeks for the protests to really start gathering steam in Egypt,"" he said. ""Right now, we're just a few days after Mubarak was finally tossed out in Egypt. It's too soon to be very confident about where this might go next."" It's hard to say what will happen next, but almost every observer agrees that this part of the world will never be the same. Miller, of the Woodrow Wilson center, quoted Dorothy in the ""Wizard of Oz"" to put events in perspective. ""We're not in Kansas anymore,"" he said. The United States and its allies, he added, need to understand that. ""This is a transformative event in Middle East politics,"" Miller said. Enough, perhaps, to change dark perceptions of a region mired in extremism and bloodshed. Two powerful messages are echoing through the region, he said. To al Qaeda, the protesters have said: Change does not have to occur through an adherence to radical ideology or violence. And to autocrats and dictators: ""You better start looking in the mirror and making changes or you're going to be looking in the rear view mirror,"" Miller said. Those ""footsteps"" you hear are ""coming for you."" CNN's Ashley Hayes, Sarah Aarthun and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Protests erupted in Iran, Yemen and Bahrain this week .

"(CNN) -- ""Hey batter, hey batter, batter -- swing!"" That's the chant my grade-school girlfriends and I would scream from the wooden bleachers at all the neighborhood Little League games. For maximum impact it was crucial to scream ""Swing!"" at the precise moment the ball crossed the plate. The goal was to intimidate batters to blindly swing and miss. Our chants were loudest when my little brother, Rod, was on the pitching mound. He was a scrawny kid but he was a lefty so his coach sometimes let him pitch. Rod wasn't easy to hit off of and if he could strike out a few batters, we knew our neighborhood reps were safe for another day. So my girls and I cheered like our lives depended on it. But honestly, many of us wanted to be more than ""bleacher creatures."" We wanted a piece of the action. Not possible. Little League back then had a strict no-girls-allowed policy. My brother could dream of being Hall of Famer first baseman Carl ""Yaz"" Yastrzemski and playing for his beloved Red Sox. We had to be happy as the rowdy pep squad. And the unfairness of this rule didn't slip by us. Especially because many of us girls held our own, and better, against the neighborhood boys during our co-ed games of sandlot stick ball, baseball, football and just about every other sport. Still, none of us or our families challenged this discriminatory rule. That's just the way things were back then. So I couldn't help but feel not only joyful but a sense of redemption as I watched Little League phenom Mo'ne Davis light up the field and shut down batters with her beautiful shutout on August 15th, in the opening game for her Philadelphia Little League team. Her feat was a first for a girl playing Little League. At 13 years old, Davis is sweet revenge for all of us not-so-young-now sisters who ever wished we could grace the Little League field or imagined making it to the Big Leagues. And while all eyes were on Mo'ne -- primarily because her games were broadcast on ESPN -- thousands of other girls across the nation play Little League today. It was 1974, in the thick of the Women's Rights Movement, that Little League softball for girls was created, and the baseball rules and regulations all of Little League were made non-gender-specific. Two years earlier, Title IX of the Education Amendments had been signed into law by Richard Nixon. The education law gave women greater opportunities to receive scholarships and funding for college athletics. But Title IX has been challenged for decades and gender discrimination in sports remains a continuous battle. It's thanks to courageous young athletes like Mo'ne and the coaches who recognize their potential who are breaking down gender stereotypes. And in Little League, girls are finally making their mark. ""I started recruiting girls my first year as a coach in 1992,"" said John Satti, who has been involved with Little League in New London, Connecticut, for the past 23 years. ""My first year, I was short about five players. So I knocked on doors and asked parents if their kids wanted to play. If girls want to play, they should be allowed to play. I've had girls on most of my teams, and women on my coaching staffs and we've won,"" said Satti. It hasn't been easy to persuade girls to try out for baseball, he said. Most girls choose softball and many parents still steer their kids into traditional gender activities. Satti said: ""When I ask parents about letting their girls play I usually get, ""Oh no, she's a dancer,"" or a cheerleader."" His daughters not only all played baseball, but were wrestlers as well. Are your children redefining gender roles? Share your story with CNN iReport . Satti thinks Mo'ne Davis success is a game changer. ""Her appearance absolutely changes things for girls. It shows the world that girls can play baseball at the Little League level. It will bring more girls into the game. It's phenomenal."" Last night, South Korea won the Little League World Series. Mo'ne's Philadelphia team fell out of contention when it lost to a team from Chicago last week. But Mo'one's star shines on. Madison Avenue marketers are eager to turn her into a commodity immediately, even if it puts her hopes of playing sports in college in jeopardy. The experts are hedging bets on how much money the eighth-grader can earn in endorsement deals. ""What's she worth today, $500,000, $100,000?"" the experts ask. A baseball she signed in the afterglow of her perfect game fetched a shocking $510 on eBay. Can she be packaged into ""America's Top Role Model""? Can she help sell the next cool gadget to kids across the country? Hungry for a happy story, the television networks are all clamoring to interview Davis. I'm hoping she and her family won't get sucked into the hype. The limelight is a cruel stage, especially for children. And something is wrong when the world is pressuring a 13-year-old to cash in quick just because she's earned a little respect and TV time for playing a sport she loves. My bet is Mo'ne Davis is just getting started. A girl with her determination and talent is destined to do far greater things with her life than throw a pitch over the plate at 70 mph. Let's step back, give her room to soar and see what she can really accomplish. Luckily, her parents seem to be thinking clearly. ""At the end of the day, she has a dream to play [basketball] for UConn, so we're not taking anything until we're clear on that, because her dream is her dream,"" Mark Williams, Davis' stepfather, told The New York Times recently. ""That's her decision. ... None of us would like to ruin that dream."" Mo'ne doesn't need a slick marketing campaign to tell the world she's a role model. She's already changed lives and planted seeds of hope for millions of young girls around the world. And that is priceless. Simply by having the courage to step onto that mound, dominate her competitors, and, yes, even handle defeat with class, Davis has inspired more young girls than we'll ever know -- and even a few big girls like me.","13-year-old phenom pitcher Mo'ne Davis' shutout a first for a girl playing Little League .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of a multi-million-dollar online scam, more than 300,000 computer users worldwide could find themselves without Web access this summer. Luckily for them, it will only take a few clicks to clean things up. The FBI announced that it's created a website where users can check whether they're infected with malware and remove it if they are. Check your computer here -- http://www.dcwg.org. The site was at times difficult to access on Monday, presumably due to heavy traffic. Let us explain: In November, six Estonian nationals were arrested on charges of fraud after a two-year FBI probe called Operation Ghost Click. They're accused of infecting computers worldwide with malware called DNS Changer, which opened up the computers to viruses. The alleged crooks used the access to direct users to their own servers and manipulate online advertising, racking up more than $14 million in illegal income, according to the FBI. ""They were organized and operating as a traditional business but profiting illegally as the result of the malware,"" an unnamed FBI agent said in a news release about the arrests. ""There was a level of complexity here that we haven't seen before."" The FBI originally estimated the scam had hit millions of computers worldwide, but has since scaled back those estimates to hundreds of thousands. They think about 350,000 computers are still infected, including 85,000 in the United States. The U.S. computers included some at government agencies, including NASA. Last month, the FBI announced that it had set up temporary ""clean"" servers to make sure the users impacted by the attack didn't lose Web access. Those servers will be shut down on July 9, and anyone still infected will be unable to access the Internet afterward. If it had merely shut down the rogue servers, many of those infected wouldn't have been able to access the Web at all, the FBI said. Most infected users on the FBI servers may not have noticed anything different, although the malware itself may have made their Web access slower and disabled their anti-virus software. Domain Name System, or DNS, servers are what online computers visit to reach the website they are seeking. By routing them to rogue servers, criminals can control which websites a computer visits. By visiting the website set up by the FBI, users can click to see if their computer is infected. An image with a green background appears if they're OK, while a red one shows up if they're not. If infected, they're then directed to information on how to remove the malware. The case against the accused scammers is still pending in federal court. One of them was extradited last week from Estonia to New York to face charges.","Hundreds of thousands could lose Web access after a multi-million-dollar malware scam .

"(CNN) -- After churning through the Caribbean and chugging up the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Isaac made landfall over southeastern Louisiana on Tuesday night -- bringing with it sustained winds of 80 mph and torrential, stinging rains. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm's center moved over land in Plaquemines Parish at 6:45 p.m. (7:45 p.m. ET) -- one day before the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which left nearly 1,800 dead and caused billions of dollars worth of damage along the Gulf Coast. Isaac's eye then ""wobbled westward"" and moved back over Gulf waters, and by 10 p.m. CT was centered about 75 miles southeast of Houma, Louisiana -- all while keeping its strength as it lashed those onshore. Throughout the night, the hurricane center issued advisories indicating that steady hurricane-force winds of 74 mph and stronger were being felt 60 miles out, mostly to the east and northeast of Isaac's eye. Sporadic gusts were even stronger, including a 106 mph wind reading from high up on an oil rig off the southeast Louisiana coast and 85 mph in Grand Isle, Louisiana. While Isaac is expected to eventually lose steam, that might not happen immediately because much of the sprawling storm will be over water for several more hours. How to prepare for a storm . Even with more dangerous conditions likely yet to come, the storm already has caused significant surges and flooding in a number of locales, and not just those directly in Isaac's path. Storm surges of 10.3 feet have been reported in Shell Beach just outside New Orleans, and 6.7 feet in Waveland, Mississippi, according to the hurricane center. These surges likely will get worse, with forecasters predicting water levels to rise between 6 to 12 feet on the coast in Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana alone. Mississippi state authorities have noted that waters have gone up around the state faster than expected, something Jim Yelverton noticed as he surveyed the Tchoutacabouffa River in Biloxi. He estimated Tuesday afternoon that this river was 6 to 8 feet higher than normal, and at low tide, expressing concerns about even more flooding during high tide Wednesday morning. ""The fact that we haven't had any rain and that we've got six to eight hours before the real fun begins ... makes me nervous,"" echoed Jon McDougal, another CNN iReporter who documented flooding in nearby Gulfport. A large swath of the northern Gulf Coast on Tuesday night was experiencing tropical storm conditions, with winds in excess of 39 mph, including parts of Mississippi and Alabama, the hurricane center reported. Intense rains alone could cause major headaches, and flooding, given Isaac's slow progression. Having at one point swept through the Caribbean at 21 mph, Isaac's movement slowed Tuesday to 8 mph. It continued creeping northwest at this speed through Tuesday night. Because Isaac is moving at such a slow clip, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers estimated some residents could experience hurricane or tropical storm conditions for between 24 and 36 hours before the storm finally moves on. While residents had been feeling its effects for hours, the storm's eye was still 75 miles south-southeast of New Orleans at 10 p.m. Tuesday. By then, heavy rain had already contributed to significant flooding, including ""deceptively deep"" water under Interstate 610 at Elysian Fields. But due to the strong winds, barriers aimed at keeping drivers away flailed in the wind. ""Please help us spread word: I610 Underpass at Elysian Fields is flooded. We cannot keep up barricades b/c of wind. Do NOT try to cross,"" the city said via Twitter. Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected the worst of the storm to hit his city Wednesday morning, bringing with it hurricane-force winds and between 10 and 16 inches of rain. The mayor wrote on Twitter that about 1,000 National Guard troops and more than 2,900 law enforcement officers are in the city ready to address issues related to the storm. ""We're in a hunker down phase now, because this storm could be over us for a while with a lot of wind and rain,"" Landrieu said in a statement. ""Hunker down means hunker down and prepare to ride it out."" Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . Like Landrieu and other local and state authorities, President Barack Obama on Tuesday had urged those in Isaac's path to listen to authorities and stay safe. ""Now's not the time to tempt fate,"" he said from Washington, after signing an emergency declaration for the state of Mississippi like he had for Louisiana a day earlier. ""Now's not the time to dismiss official warnings. You need to take this seriously."" Besides strong winds, Isaac could bring 14 inches of total rainfall in many places, and isolated parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle could get as much as 20 inches, the hurricane center said. Entering Tuesday, Gulf Coast residents braced for the worst from a storm that has already caused considerable devastation as it headed north from the Caribbean. Haiti's civil protection agency reported at least 19 people in that country died due to Isaac, which after hitting that impoverished nation went on to lash Cuba and the Florida Keys. Weathering the storm: Links, tips and resources . Trish Powers, a CNN iReporter from Fort Pierce on Florida's east coast, reported that floodwater there is ""almost waist deep at some ... points."" ""All we can do is wait for the water to recede,"" she said. The hurricane's ""increasing winds and seas"" disrupted a search for a missing man on Tuesday, Coast Guard spokesman Timothy Williams said. The Coast Guard had been looking off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, for a ""missing jet skier"" whose wife reported him missing Monday night. Williams said that rescue crews would ""temporarily suspend their search efforts until the storm passes and weather conditions become safe enough."" Hurricane Isaac: State by state . Isaac's impact has been felt, and seen, in other ways as well -- including bending trees, drenching roads and knocking down power lines. Entergy Louisiana, one of many utilities affected by the storm, reported around 222,000 customers without power statewide at 10:12 p.m. CT. Isaac earlier prompted three airports to close -- in New Orleans; Gulfport-Biloxi, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama -- and cancellations of around 1,500 flights systemwide, according to airline and airport officials. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard announced it has closed major ports along the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to its mouth because of the storm. Business in many of the most affected areas came to a standstill because of Isaac. For example, 52 Walmart and Sam's Club stores in Louisiana and nine in Mississippi had shut down by 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, their parent company said. Amtrak suspended its train service to and from New Orleans on Tuesday and Wednesday because of Isaac. And residents of Plaquemines Parish, located along the Gulf, are subject to a ""dusk-to-dawn curfew"" because of Isaac, parish officials said. In and around New Orleans, authorities closed a number of flood protection structures. These included the West Closure Complex -- one of the world's largest pump stations, capable of pumping stormwater at 20,000 cubic feet per second -- said the Army Corps of Engineers. ""There is no evidence of any (water) overtopping (canals),"" Landrieu said Tuesday evening. ""We have full confidence the levees will hold."" In Mississippi, more than 1,800 evacuees were staying in 33 shelters located in 16 counties as of 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to the state's emergency management agency. More than 80,000 sandbags were given out earlier in the day, and several popular Biloxi casinos closed temporarily. Disaster dining: Stay safe and stay fed . Shrimpers in Bayou Le Batre, Alabama, were among those who heeded official warnings and hunkered down. ""All the boats are coming. We're anchoring them down and getting ready for this blow, hoping it's not too bad,"" Dominick Ficarino, the owner of Dominick's Seafood, told CNN affiliate WPMI-TV in Bayou Le Batre. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday said it was sending additional inspectors to two Louisiana nuclear plants in the storm's path, as power company Entergy planned a ""controlled shutdown"" of one of them starting Tuesday afternoon. Isaac is not expected to be as strong as Katrina, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm with 125 mph winds. Even so, the head of FEMA stressed Tuesday that wind speed isn't the only factor to consider when assessing how much damage a storm might cause. ""I know there are a lot of jaded folks on the coast that have been through Camille and then Katrina and think, well, this is just a Category 1 hurricane,"" said FEMA director Craig Fugate from Mississippi. ""The tendency to look at the category of the wind speed doesn't always tell the story of what the impacts will be."" iReporters share Hurricane Isaac photos, videos .

"(CNN) -- Beyond the noise of raucous crowds and angry protesters who have turned town hall meetings into shouting matches is genuine concern from ordinary citizens who are afraid that President Obama's health care proposals would only make things harder for them, experts say. The battle over health care reform has energized people on both sides of the debate. ""The reason that we see these protests and people asking tough questions at town hall meetings is because they feel like the president is going to take something away from them. That motivates people. That gets them out,"" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Those fears were heard Tuesday at Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter's town hall meeting in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. ""This is going to take away my freedom,"" charged one man who wanted assurance from Specter that the private option for health insurance would stay viable. Specter repeated Obama's pledge, telling the crowd, ""If you like your policy, you can keep it."" Acknowledging the skepticism at a town hall meeting Tuesday, Obama tried to alleviate fears that reform would take something away. ""I recognize there's an underlying fear here that people somehow won't get the care they need. You will have not only the care you need, but also the care that right now is being denied to you, only if we get health care reform. That's what we're fighting for,"" he said at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, event. Since his days on the campaign trail, Obama has promised the public that those who like their health insurance plans won't have to give them up, but he's stopped short of saying at what cost. ""I think that's the fear,"" said Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and the director of American studies at Georgetown University. ""Even though they are going to keep the plan, the plan is going to be at a much greater cost. And he's not been able to really allay that fear.""  Watch what happened at Specter's town hall meeting » . The themes coming up at town hall meetings across the country are broadly the same as doubts expressed during the campaign. Critics are voicing fears about socialism and the dismantling of the government they are used to. And those who have sufficient health care coverage worry they'll have to foot the bill for reform, echoing concerns heard during the presidential campaign that Obama would ""spread the wealth around."" ""That was one of the campaign critiques of Obama that seemed to work well, that seemed to resonate well,"" Owen said. ""I really do think that it was an issue, and I think the opponents of the health care plan, by bringing that back up again ... I think that it could be an effective obstacle to what he's trying to accomplish."" Obama originally asked Congress to send him a health care bill before the August recess, but neither chamber met the deadline. As lawmakers spend the break in their home districts, they've been met with sometimes fierce opposition to Obama's proposals. ""It's not anti-reform -- it's anti-bad reform,"" Cannon said. ""I think the public is reacting to what's in the legislation. And I think that's why the president wanted the House and the Senate to pass their versions before the August recess, because the president knew that the public would object to a lot of what is in these bills."" The White House, however, said that Obama ""asked Congress to move quickly because we can't wait any longer to begin fixing what's wrong with our system."" iReport.com: Are you attending a town hall? Share photos, video . Obama's health care battle has been compared to former President Clinton's failed effort more than 15 years ago, but lawmakers didn't experience the same backlash during the Clinton years. Part of the reason was because of the calendar, CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. Clinton proposed his plan in September 1993, and by the time Congress went on recess in August 1994, the plan was dead. People also didn't use the Internet the way they use it today, ""so you didn't have the viral communications that rally people to attend town halls,"" Schneider noted. Today's hypersaturated media, where rumor is picked up as fact and disseminated to millions via blogs and discussion boards, has contributed to the misinformation being lobbed at lawmakers, Owen said. Coming out of one of her town hall meetings Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said that ""people are just getting information that's flat wrong."" But as unfounded as some of the claims may be, such as charges that Obama will set up death panels to decide who will live or die, the emotional appeals resonate with the public. ""I don't think that this is debate that is going to go away,"" Owen said, noting that given the outpouring seen at the town hall meetings, Congress can't just pick up where it left off when it returns from break. ""I think the public is going to remain engaged and energized."" Cannon said the debate has ""stunted the president's momentum"" and will make it harder for his administration to get through the types of reforms they were hoping for. Cannon predicted that Obama's plan will fail, but advocates ""are going to try more incremental reforms to improve the health care sector."" The same thing happened after the Clinton plan failed. Congress passed less sweeping reform like the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). iReport.com: Share views on health care reform . Owen said the response to his proposals has likely been ""a stark awakening to [Obama] about maybe on this particular issue, he's going to need a new tactic."" ""When Congress comes back they'll have to kind of rethink the plan and rethink particularly how they present it to the public. and that means the Obama administration as well,"" she said.","People fear they'll have something taken away from them, Michael Cannon says .
Obama promises those with coverage they like can keep it .

Congress will have to ""rethink the plan"" after recess, Diana Owen says ."
