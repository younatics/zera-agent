"Sending a package abroad? Here's a word of advice: Pick your airline carefully. A hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by an air freight handler at Guangzhou airport in China recently. The worker energetically ditches a trolley full of boxes in the general vicinity of a conveyer belt, which is supposed to transport them inside the airplane. But only a few actually hit their target, with most landing on the tarmac with a crash. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crash: A hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by air freight handlers at Guangzhou airport in China . Filming out the window, a passenger on the China Southern Airlines flight is astounded at the bizarre technique. 'These blokes don't give a damn,' the Australian passenger, Mark Bridgman, says on the tape, which he later uploaded to YouTube. 'What a half-witted idiot. More end up on the ground than are going on the conveyer belt.' 'Don't put your air freight with China Southern,' he adds. Fragile? The boxes are chucked aggressively in the direction of the conveyor belt . Cleaning up: The worker has to handle all the boxes twice because so few of them made the conveyor belt the first time . 'He's going to have to handle them all twice because most of them are on the ground. Fricking turkey. What an idiot. Goodness knows what's in there. Hope it's not fragile.' It's unclear what is inside the fairly uniform boxes shown on the tape. However, Bridgman notes in his YouTube commentary that on a previous occasion he witnessed Japanese sewing machines plastered with 'this way up' and 'fragile, handle with care' stickers being treated with the same respect. Quick chat: The worker stops work to answer his cell phone . Mid air: The packages are thrown sky high and crash onto the tarmac . At one point, the handler answers his cell phone, but continues throwing the boxes towards the belt one-handed. 'This was amazing to watch. I think I was the only one noticing what was happening outside the window of the plane,' Bridgman wrote under the video, which has garnered more than 75,500 views. 'Lesson: Pack it well, because it wont be treated well.' Looking at his handy work: The worker takes a break and views his strike rate . All done: Finally the trolley is empty, but only a handful of packages made it onto the conveyor belt .","Footage shows air freight handlers at Guangzhou airport in China chucking boxes onto a China Southern Airlines plane .

"A death mask made by Madame Tussaud has been used to recreate the likeness of Maximilien de Robespierre - the infamous revolutionary leader. Madame Tussaud, now known for her world-renown waxworks museum in London, went by her maiden name of Marie Grosholtz when she made the wax sculpture. During the French Revolution, she was saved from execution by agreeing to create death masks of famous people who met a grisly end by the guillotine. Reconstruction: Death mask made by Madame Tussaud was used to recreate of Maximilien de Robespierre . Phillipe Froesch, a facial reconstruction expert, has used Madame Tussaud's mask to recreate the face of the leader who started the Reign of Terror that cost tens of thousands of lives in 1793 and 1794. She took his head from the basket after he was decapitated on July 28, 1794 and the chambermaid's daughter sculpted the likeness. Madame Tussaud took the original sculpture with her when she went to London in 1802 and copies were made. One of these copies, in the Museum of Natural History in Aix-en-Provence, southern France, was used by Mr Froesch, the Times reports. He was asked to recreate Robespierre's face for a documentary about illness that affected famous men and women. Mapping: Mr Froesch used FBI techniques and it showed Robespierre had a pockmarked face . The facial reconstruction expert used a hand-held 3D scanner to map the scars, spots and fine details on the waxwork then set about recreating the face. Mr Froesch used FBI mapping techniques and the result showed Robespierre had an extremely pockmarked face and was 'pale and tired'. He said the result was a 'worrying face' and earlier portraits had made Robespierre look better than he was - probably out of fear. The expert is well-known in France after he recreated the face of King Henri IV using the 16th century skull and is now working on a project to bring the face of Rene Descartes back to life. Madame Tussaud learnt her skills from Dr Philippe Curtius and after she arrived in London set up and exhibition of her works in Baker Street. The collection has continuously grown over the last century and now includes celebrities, monarchy and historical figures.","Madame Tussaud saved from execution by making death masks .

"A shock new poll by YouGov has revealed that although the majority of Britons do want Prince Charles to become King, just 16 per cent want the Duchess of Cornwall to become Queen. Although the Duchess has become increasingly popular in recent years, 46 per cent of those polled said she should take the title of Princess Consort when Charles ascends to the throne instead. The Duchess, who is currently visiting Mexico with the Prince of Wales, has never spoken of future titles, although it is known that Prince Charles would like his wife to eventually become Queen.

"Alan Brazil has suggested Brendan Rodgers is losing patience with Daniel Sturridge's injury problems, with the Liverpool striker set for another spell on the sidelines. Sturridge suffered a recurrence earlier this week of the thigh problem he first suffered in September while on England duty. He is set to be out of action for six weeks, meaning he could miss 12 games. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is unhappy with Daniel Sturridge's constant injury problems . Sturridge was outstanding last season and his partnership with Luis Suarez was worth more than 50 goals . Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks. Rodgers has not been able to select Sturridge - who has also had a calf injury in between his thigh issues - since August 31 and Brazil, on his daily breakfast show on talkSPORT, hinted that the Liverpool manager is becoming irritated by being without his first-choice striker. In conversation with co-host Mike Parry, Brazil said: 'I have heard that the staff, I won't say who but, are getting just a little bit fed up of what is going on there with Sturridge.' Parry replied: 'Erm, the staff, Al? You are going to have to tell us a little bit more about that. That's just a taster.' Brazil, who is friends with Rodgers, then said: 'Well, let's put it this way. I think Brendan is very, very upset… I mean, what is going on here? Why is he (Sturridge) always injured?' Sportsmail have approached Liverpool for comment. Sturridge arrives at the side entrance of Liverpool's Spire Hospital on Wednesday . Sturridge has suffered another injury setback to his thigh in training for Liverpool . Sturridge was outstanding last season and his partnership with Luis Suarez was worth more than 50 goals for Liverpool, as they came within two points of winning their first title since 1990. But it has been a completely different situation this time around. Though he scored the winning goal against Southampton on the opening weekend of the new season, he has not kicked a ball for his club since their 3-1 win against Tottenham at the end of August. He was sidelined for six weeks after breaking down during an England training session and then, at the start of October, he damaged his calf just before he was scheduled to return. Rodgers had hoped that Sturridge would be ready to make his comeback at Selhurst Park this Sunday but there is no chance of that and Liverpool are sweating on how long he will be absent. This last setback puts an even greater emphasis on Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini - who have yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool this season - to produce goals in Sturridge's absence.

"Bill Cosby's friend of 60 years Tony Williams has defended the comedian after historic sexual assault allegations against him resurfaced. The legendary saxophonist, who appeared on stage with the 77-year-old in September, said he was angry at the reappearance of the accusations because he thinks they are a lie. The 83-year-old said there were a lot of people looking for 'positive notoriety' in relation to the claims, suggesting the alleged victims were going after Cosby because of his fame and money. His comments came as publicist and former actress Joan Tarshis became the latest woman to come forward, claiming she was attacked by Cosby in 1969. Angry: Bill Cosby's (left) friend of 60 years Tony Williams (right) has defended the comedian after sexual assault allegations resurfaced, suggesting they are a lie . Long-time friends: The 83-year-old (far right holding a saxophone) appeared alongside Cosby (left) during his annual jazz festival in September . She wrote in a Hollywood Elsewhere editorial that she was raped twice by Cosby when she was 19 years old and working with him in 35 years ago. 'The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed,' Tarshis wrote of the first incident. 'Through the haze I thought I was being clever when I told him I had an infection and he would catch it and his wife would know he had sex with someone. 'But he just found another orifice to use. I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one.' Cosby made a rare on-stage appearance at an Erie, Pennsylvania, theater. It is unknown whether any of the allegations were addressed. 'No, No. He don't have to rape anybody,' Williams told Fox Philly  29 in an interview on Sunday. Williams, who was on stage with Cosby for his annual jazz festival in September, described how he met Cosby 60 years ago through his 'passion for music'. On Sunday, Cosby's lawyer said he will not dignify 'decade-old, discredited' claims of sexual abuse with a response. It is the first comment from the famed comedian's lawyer on an increasing uproar over allegations that he assaulted several women in the past. John P. Schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.' 'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work,' Schmitt said. The renewed attention to a dark chapter for Cosby began last month when a comedian, Hannibal Buress, assailed him during a stand-up performance in Philadelphia, Cosby's hometown, calling him a 'rapist.' His remarks were captured on video and posted online, gaining wide exposure. Motivation: Williams (pictured with Cosby) believes that the alleged victims are going after the comedian's fame and fortune . Still performing: Williams' comments came as Cosby made a rare appearance on an Erie, Pennslyvania, stage on Sunday night . Accusations: Barbara Bowman, one of Bill Cosby's alleged victims of sexual assault, poses with an image of her teenage self . It was harsh criticism of the veteran entertainer known equally for his charming standup comedy, ethnically groundbreaking 1984-92 NBC TV sitcom 'The Cosby Show' and demands for personal responsibility directed at fellow African-Americans. Adding to the growing firestorm: One of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, leveled allegations of sexual assault against him in interviews and in an online column for the Washington Post. Bowman wrote that in 1985, she was 17 and an aspiring actress when Cosby 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.' Cosby, who was never criminally charged in any case, settled a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years before. He stonewalled National Public Radio host Scott Simon during an interview aired this weekend with Cosby and his wife, Camille, about their African-American art collection. Cosby fell silent when asked by Simon about 'serious allegations raised about you in recent days,' which prompted the host to say, 'You're shaking your head, no. ... Do you have any response to those charges? Shaking your head, no.'","The 83-year-old said he was angry at the claims because they are 'lies'

"A 'major winter storm' could dump up to 12 inches of snow on Seattle in two days, weather experts are forecasting. Chris Dolce, a meteorologist with weather.com, said the . Northwest could take an even bigger pounding than the snowfalls that caused havoc at the weekend. A low pressure system from . the Gulf of Alaska is bringing the first major snowfall of the season to the . Seattle area, and a major storm could dump more snow than the 9.4in of snow recorded in the 1985 blizzard, according the Mr Dolce. Scroll down for video . Icy blast: Pedestrians walk across a hill in Seattle as the snow falls on Sunday . Heavy snowfall in Seattle is rare, with a single-day snowfall of more than six inches occurring on only 14 days since 1948, and none since February 17, 1990. Between December 12 and 25 in 2008, a foot of snow fell in the area, causing chaos in a city not used to clearing such large snowfalls. Snowfall is now officially measured at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac). In November 21 and 22 1985, 9.4in was recorded there - a figure that could be broken in the coming days. Seattle's record snowfall in one day is 20 inches, which fell on January 13, 1950. The largest snowstorm on record occurred between January 5 and 9, 1880, with snow drifting to 6 feet in places. From January 31 to February 2, 1916, 29 inches of snow fell in the area. He predicted that travel by road or air could become 'dangerous or impossible' as the storm front moved in. He said: 'Keep in mind, average annual snowfall is only 2.4 inches in Portland and . 5.9 inches in Seattle, so these amounts are very significant for these . metro areas. According to the National Weather Service in Seattle, snow amounts from this storm could exceed anything seen since . November 1985 at Sea-Tac airport.'

Not all fun and games: Ken Cunningham shovels his sidewalk clear of snow. Storms have clogged up roadways and caused traffic problems . Several inches of light snow is expected to fall from Iowa and southeast Minnesota to Michigan today as the rain or rain changing to snow continues in the Ohio Valley. Tom Niziol, Winter Weather Expert for The Weather Channel, said: 'We're beginning to see the pattern across the northern United States become a bit more active now. 'There's a combination of more storm tracks going across the northern U.S. and Great Lakes and cold air being pulled down from Canada. That combination spells the return of winter.'

"Last week, she declared herself 'humbled' by the bravery of Colombia's rape victims and signalled her determination to do more to raise awareness of the problem in the UK. Now, the Duchess of Cornwall has spoken out on behalf of sex-trafficking survivors in Mexico and said she was 'moved' after hearing the stories of a brave group of women. The Duchess, who is currently touring Mexico with Prince Charles, met the women during a visit to a safe house in Mexico City. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Carla (far right) was sold into prostitution by her boyfriend when she was just 12 years old . Passion: The Duchess of Cornwall is a long-standing supporter of charities that help rape victims . Visit: The Duchess was visiting the Fundacion Camino A Casa which has rescued 169 girls since 2008 . The Fundacion Camino A Casa (The Road Home) provides shelter and rehabilitation for underage victims of the sex trade and has rescued 169 girls since 2008. During a tour of the facilities, Camilla met Madai and Carla, both of whom had been sold into prostitution by their respective boyfriends. Carla was only 12 years old when she was sold into prostitution, forced to take drugs, beaten and burned. A client helped her to escape when she was 16 and now she has a two-year-old daughter. Speaking through an interpreter, the Duchess said: 'Please tell them how touched I am by their stories. I am very humbled. Painful memories: Madai, seen with the Duchess of Cornwall, was also sold into prostitution by a boyfriend . Tea and sympathy: The Duchess heard victim's stories while taking tea with them at the shelter . Passionate: Last week in Colombia, Camilla vowed to speak up on behalf of rape victims everywhere . 'It's very moving to hear a story like that and it shows what can be done. With more people like these two you can make a huge difference.' Carla showed Camilla her 'book of dreams' which included the front cover of a Forbes 50 most powerful women in Mexico. 'I have no doubt that she will succeed whatever she does,' added a clearly moved Camilla. 'I feel the book will have a very happy ending.' The safe house visit in Mexico comes after the Duchess attended a meeting on ending sexual violence in Colombia, last week. Camilla has also visited to Rape Crisis centres and Sexual Assault Referral Centres across the UK and is a passionate supporter of victim's groups. In February 2013, she hosted a reception for charities and other organisations involved in supporting victims of rape and sexual abuse. During the visit to the shelter in Mexico, Camilla also met girls who are living there as well as staff and volunteers. Meeting: After visiting the refuge, Camilla joined Prince Charles to meet President Enrique Peña Nieto . Talks: Prince Charles and President Peña Nieto held talks on boosting the UK's links with Mexico . Big news: The visit, which diplomats hope will boost trade, comes ahead of 2015's Year of the UK in Mexico . According to Mexico's National Commission of Human Rights, in terms of economic gain, human trafficking is the second largest area of criminal activity in Mexico, after drugs trafficking. The National Institute of Geography and Statistics reports that some 10 million Mexicans have been victims of some kind of human trafficking - 79 per cent for sexual exploitation. Colombia has similarly grim figures, with an estimated 500,000 women raped between 2001 and 2009 - equivalent to one every 15 minutes. In the UK, an estimated 85,000 women are raped each year according to charity Rape Crisis, while more than 400,000 suffer some form of sexual assault. Links: Prince Charles, who had narrowly missed a dunking during an earlier visit, also made a speech . The Prince of Wales almost found himself taking an early bath yesterday, after visiting a floating farm in a rickety-looking boat. Charles has long been passionate about organic farming - of which Mexico's floating farms are a stellar example - but reaching them meant standing precariously in a flat bottomed boat for a journey up an irrigation canal. Happily for the heir to the throne, the boat proved sturdier than it looked and Charles made it back to Mexico City for the formal welcome without getting a dunking. During the meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto at the National Palace, the pair were presented with a set of miniature artworks, and gave the president a set of decorated Highgrove plates in return. Later, Charles and President Pena Nieto launched an initiative aimed at forging stronger links between their two nations - The Year of the UK in Mexico 2015. In a speech, the Prince said: 'Today, the ties that bind the British and Mexican people are stronger than ever. 'Whether in business, government, education, science, sport, culture, trade, in fighting international crime, promoting human rights, or protecting the urban and natural environment, I am struck by the fascination that we hold for each others’ cultures - and by the energy and goodwill that are generated when we work together. 'I could not be more pleased, therefore, to join with you on this occasion in order to celebrate the fact that this already excellent relationship will be further enhanced over the course of 2015 through both The Year of the UK in Mexico and The Year of Mexico in the UK.' Close relationship: Prince Charles said he 'could not be more pleased' to be in Mexico . Common ground: In his speech, Charles said the UK and Mexico shared common ground on many issues . Fascination: Prince Charles also told his hosts that the UK and Mexico had a 'fascination' with each other . Escape: Earlier, Prince Charles had narrowly avoided an early bath during a tour of Mexico's floating farms .","The Duchess was visiting a refuge for sex-trafficking victims in Mexico City .

"Samsung has come under fire once again for offering customers just half the amount of advertised storage on its flagship Galaxy S4 model. The latest round of tests by Which? magazine found that unwanted bloatware and system files still occupy 46 per cent of the phone's internal storage - eight months after intial concerns were raised. At the opposite end of the scale, Apple's iPhone 5C was the best performing handset, assigning a relatively low 21 per cent of storage to built-in apps and the iOS operating system. In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB) Bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones, tablets, or computers. As well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files, bloatware can also slow down your device. Bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars, desktop widgets or other unwanted additions. Bloatware includes apps and files . that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they . are sold to customers.

Others, however, are unnecessary or . unwanted utility apps, games and the S Travel and S Health hubs. To add . insult to injury, many of these apps and hubs can't be removed. It's . likely the difference between Apple's models are due to the iPhone 5S . running more advanced features than the 5C, and the extra files needed . for the fingerprint scanner. As technology researcher Jon Barrow explained in a blog post: . 'The reality is every phone has to sacrifice some of its internal . memory to the operating system - they never live up to the sales talk of . 8,16 or 32GB. 'But . many manufacturers further stuff their phone with pre-loaded apps, skins . and bloatware. And no phone has more piping, braiding and frills than . the Samsung Galaxy S4.' Apple's iPhone 5C, pictured, has 12.6GB of available space, while the high-end iPhone 5S offers slight less, as 12.2GB. It's likely the difference between Apple's models are due to the 5S running more advanced features than the 5C, and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner . The Samsung findings show the handset has not improved since tests last May - and has actually got worse. Samsung responded to criticisms at the time advising people that a solution that to the problem is to buy a MicroSD card if they want extra storage: 'For the Galaxy S4 16 GB model, approximately 6.85 GB occupies the system part of internal memory, which is 1 GB bigger than that of the Galaxy S3, in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers,' explained the Korean firm. 'To offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users, Samsung provides a microSD slot on Galaxy S4 for extension of memory.' Yet, as Barrow points out, the three phones that topped the latest Which? tests - Apple's iPhone 5C, 5S and Google's Nexus 5 - don't have memory card slots meaning that although they offer more overall, this can't be expanded like the S4.

"A 19-year-old American musician accused of murdering an Irish student today denied suffocating her. Richard Hinds, from Memphis, Tennessee, is accused of killing Nicola Furlong, 21, in a hotel room on May 24 in Tokyo. He admitted he and Ms Furlong, 21, were in a hotel and he 'lightly pressed her neck' while the two had sex. Arrested: Richard Hinds, from Memphis, has admitted to strangling Irish student Nicola Furlong in a Tokyo hotel room on May 24, but insisted he did not mean to kill her.

"Just days earlier he was contemplating whether he might lose his freedom but now John Edwards has been seen publicly for the first time with his 'precious' daughter Quinn enjoying Father's Day weekend. The one-time presidential candidate was pictured with the four-year-old - whose mother is his former mistress Rielle Hunter -  playing on the beach at Figure Eight Island in North Carolina. The 59-year-old ran in and out of the water with the girl as the pair chatted easily together. Edwards publicly referred to Quinn for the first time last month after he was acquitted at a trial where he had been accused of using campaign money . to cover up his affair with Hunter, 48, and her subsequent pregnancy. Daddy's girl: John Edwards, 59, spent the weekend at the beach with his four-year-old daughter Quinn - whose mother is his former mistress Rielle Hunter . First pictures: John Edwards was seen playing on a beach in North Carolina with his four-year-old daughter Quinn by mistress Rielle Hunter . Bonding: The pair chatted easily as they spent Father's Day together with Quinn's mother Ms Hunter at a $4,000-a-week rental home by the shore . After the verdict, where he was acquitted of one count of corruption and a mistrial declared on the five other counts, Edwards emerged from the court house saying he was grateful to all of his children - including his 'precious Quinn'. He said: 'My precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so grateful for.' The father and daughter were seen playing on the sand on Sunday close to where they were staying in a $4,000-a-week rental home. Later they held hands when they went to pick up groceries with her mother Rielle - who was also at the house. The disgraced senator has only ever been pictured with Quinn once before when she was a baby in 2008. The snatched photos, published in the National Enquirer, broke the news of the scandalous affair which Edwards had been keeping secret from his wife Elizabeth who was dying of cancer. Carefree: Edwards laughed as his young daughter danced on the sand. He had walked from court last month after being acquitted of one count of corruption and a mistrial declared on five other counts against him . Holding hands: At the end of his political corruption trial, Edwards spoke publicly for the first time about Quinn, saying he was 'so grateful' for his young daughter . In the public eye: John Edwards and his daughter were at the beach house with her mother Rielle - who has an explosive book about their affair due out this week . Rielle Hunter strutted on the beach in a white tankini this weekend. The candid photos came as Hunter was on the verge of revealing lurid details about her sex life with Edwards and the passion that drove him so mad he cheated on his cancer-stricken wife and sabotaged his presidential campaign in 2008. Mrs Edwards died of breast cancer in 2010. She has written a book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. The former campaign videographer leaves little to the imagination about her sex life. Hunter described the first time she slept with Edwards as the 'most extraordinary night of her life.' Edwards met Rielle Hunter in a New York hotel bar in 2006. She soon joined his campaign, and despite a lack of film-making experience, the politician arranged a $250,000 contract for her to make a series of behind-the-scenes documentaries from the campaign trail. When Hunter fell pregnant he had a trusted aide Andrew Young claim paternity of Quinn in an effort to stave off political disaster. He didn't publicly acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two. Close bond: One-time presidential candidate Edwards did not acknowledge his daughter Quinn, who he had with former mistress Rielle Hunter, until she was two years old .

His eldest daughter Cate was by his . side throughout the corruption case in North Carolina. The 30-year-old . lawyer took notes by her father's side - but at one point during the . six-week trial, she fled the courtroom in tears after details of her . father's betrayal of her late mother became too much. During . his teary speech on the court steps after he walked free, he paid . thanks to Cate, saying: 'She has been here every single day by my side.

"Maria Giorno has nothing against long gowns with high waists and flowing fabric — dresses that are designed to camouflage curves on plus-size women. But the New Jersey high school senior had no interest in buying a loose-fitting style for her senior prom, even though it was all she could find in a size 16 or so at nearby stores. So many stores, Giorno said, ""never have anything that's a little more sexy or a little form-fitting, or anything like that for my age."" Clothes shopping for plus-size teens can be frustrating in general, but shopping for a dream prom dress can be a tear-inducing, hair-pulling morass of bad design and few options — especially for girls who want a dress that hugs the body instead of tenting it. Plus-size party dress: Sydney's Closet is one of a small handful of retailers where larger teenage girls can seek out a gown for prom . ""It's like people kind of assume that's what I want and that's what I like. I'm 18. I really like the way the tight dresses look,"" said Giorno, who plays roller derby and hopes to study music education in college. She finally found one that didn't make her look like a bridesmaid — or worse, mother of the bride — at a boutique: a V-neck black lace ""fit and flare"" style with an open back and pleats above the knee for dancing ease on her big night. Consignment shops and organizations that collect donated prom dresses for girls in need also say they can't get enough plus-size gowns. Shop owner Kristen Harris went on a mission to collect them after a teen left her store empty-handed and in tears. Harris was tagging stock at her just-opened Designer Diva Consignment Boutique in Abington, Mass., when a plus-size teen shyly approached the ball gowns. ""I said, 'Hey hon, what size are you looking for,' and she said 22, and that's when I felt like someone had just kicked me in the stomach, because I knew I didn't have anything that size,"" recalled Harris, who desperately pulled some smaller sizes in stretch fabrics for the girl. Moments later, the teen was crying in the dressing room. Found it! Maria Giorno, 18, a high school senior from Manchester Township, N.J., found it difficult to track down this figure-hugging dress from the New York City Glitz boutique in Pine Beach, N.J. Figure-hugging: ""I really like the way the tight dresses look,"" says Giorno, who plays roller derby and hopes to study music education in college . So Harris began begging on social media for plus-size consignment and hunted down her young customer through Facebook, offering a private appointment and free dress from about 40 she'd collected. ""She was so sweet,"" Harris said. ""I just couldn't get her out of my head."" Operation Prom, which offers free donated dresses to girls in need in eight states, has also had to hunt for plus-size dresses. Noel D'Allacco, founder of the decade-old project, took in about 7,000 gently used dresses and new ones from corporate partners last year, but only about 700 were size 18 and up, she said. The shortage of donated plus-size garments forced her to purchase some. ""We are going crazy trying to get plus-size dresses,"" said D'Allacco, in Bronxville, N.Y. ""We have this problem, unfortunately, every year. A lot of times we get plus-size donations and they're not appropriate for a 17-year-old. They're for your grandmother to wear. It's difficult."" Online options for plus-size prom dresses have proliferated in the past decade. But shopping that way for an already difficult fit, along with restrictive return policies, can feel risky. Giorno was not comfortable searching for her dress online, yet many retailers carry few to none in stores and on trend for teens. Many designers don't bother making them in larger sizes, prospective customers say. Elegant options: David's Bridal is one destination where plus-size teens can track down appropriate gowns . Plus-size prom: Sixteen percent of women's clothing sold in the U.S. is size 14 and up, according to the market research group NPD. Both dresses pictured are available at David's Bridal . Sixteen percent of women's clothing sold in the U.S. is size 14 and up, according to the market research group NPD. But the plus-size women's business has ""pretty much been ignored by the big stores,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD's chief retail analyst. The shop in Pine Beach, N.J., where Giorno found her dress, called New York City Glitz, makes it a priority to stock trendy plus sizes. ""There's not that much made,"" owner Cat Hutton said. ""I have companies that I deal with that only carry up to a size 16."" David's Bridal, with about 300 stores around the country, estimates half of the company's prom-worthy choices come in sizes 16 to 22, with interest in those sizes growing every year, said Marissa Rubinetti, a senior buyer. ""They do struggle. They may fall in love with something they see online and they don't have the opportunity to try it on and buy it,"" she said. A decade ago, the company carried a fraction of prom dresses up to size 22, Rubinetti said. Southern stores, particularly Texas, have a higher demand, she said. Stephanie Mekhjian, manager of David's Bridal in Fort Worth, Texas, estimated 20 to 25 percent of her prom customers wear sizes 18 to 22, including some who travel 100 miles or more to shop there. Target market: David's Bridal, with about 300 stores around the country, estimates half of the company's prom-worthy choices come in sizes 16 to 22, with interest in those sizes growing every year . Full-figured fashion: Stephanie Mekhjian, manager of David's Bridal in Fort Worth, Texas, estimated 20 to 25 percent of her prom customers wear sizes 18 to 22 . Demand: Consignment shops and organizations that collect donated prom dresses for girls in need also say they can't get enough plus-size gowns. Both dresses pictured are available at David's Bridal . J.C. Penney sells plus-size prom dresses online only and offers just three styles. Target does not sell, in its brick-and-mortar stores, dressier styles appropriate for prom in any size, but the company does sell them online. Other retailers restrict all plus-size clothing to websites. ""Manufacturers are starting to create more plus-size prom dresses but they are just not as readily available as traditional size prom dresses,"" said a Penney spokeswoman, Sarah Holland. Phyllis Librach in St. Louis, Mo., knows the heartache of the dress search as both a mother and a dress designer who specializes in plus sizes for special occasions. She started her business 10 years ago after her daughter, now 29, was that curvy girl in tears in search of the perfect prom dress. They finally had one custom-made after the teen refused to buy a white wedding gown and dye it for prom. The glam factor: This image released by Sydney's Closet shows models in plus size prom dresses . Librach now designs and manufactures her own styles, including prom dresses sizes 14 to 40, which she sells on her site, Sydneyscloset.com, and through about 125 boutiques. She started out in the business buying inventory from others, but switched to producing her own after contacting a company that planned to knock off a gown worn by Queen Latifah at an awards show. ""I wanted to place an order, a very nice order, and they said, 'We're not making the dress in any size larger than 14,'"" Librach recalled. ""I said, 'Let me understand this, you're going to knock off an evening gown worn by a plus-size celebrity and you're not going to make it for plus-size women?' So I got angry, I got frustrated and I said, 'Damn it, I'll make it myself.' That dress sold out.""","J.C. Penney sells plus-size prom dresses .

"Fallen hero: Jimmy Savile on a mini trampoline at Broadmoor in 1991 . Jimmy Savile chaired a ‘task force’ set up by the Department of Health in 1988 to investigate concerns over the way Broadmoor Hospital patients were treated by staff. But staff claim that before his appointment Savile had taken teenage girls plucked from Top Of The Pops shows to the hospital, where he was a volunteer. Savile’s official title was Broadmoor’s honorary entertainments manager but staff say he stalked the corridors of the high-security mental hospital in Berkshire with swaggering impunity. In the early Seventies, he liked to frequent the staff social club, housed in a drab single-storey brick building. Bizarrely, among his guests one night were two members of the dance troupe Pan’s People. ‘It can’t have been the most glamorous watering hole they’d visited,’ a former Broadmoor nurse said. ‘Jimmy had the run of the place, he did as he pleased.’ Against this background, rumours about the entertainer circulated among staff. One souce said he took ‘trusted’ patients out for day trips in his Rolls-Royce and spoke of his sexual fascination with dead bodies. The source, a daughter of a principal nursing officer, told The Mail on Sunday he ‘liked to have his way’ with young females visiting their relatives. Standing at the main gate ‘in his swimming trunks, gold chain and sunglasses’, he would entice the ‘poor dears’ with the promise of a cup of tea in his caravan. Savile’s behaviour caused friction with staff who felt he was undermining security. A senior member of the Prison Officers Association said: ‘Savile had the run of the place. He would walk into the most secure areas containing the most dangerous patients in the UK. He was told these men and women were dangerous, but he just laughed it off and did his own thing. ‘He had friends in high places in Broadmoor and they swept concerns about him under the carpet.’ Staff who worked at Broadmoor at the time claim that Jimmy Savile took girls from Top of the Pops to the hospital . Alan Franey who was appointed chief executive of the high-security mental hospital in 1989, said the committee that Savile headed ‘was set up to review the way patients were being looked after’. He went on: ‘It was partly in response to a report advising that staff had been treating patients inappropriately, though not sexually.’ Mr Franey said that during his tenure as chief executive he was unaware of the allegations against Savile. 'He did as he pleased': Jimmy Savile took patients out for day trips in his Rolls Royce . Last week, the Department of Health launched an internal inquiry into its management of the hospital before it was transferred to West London Mental Health Trust in 2001.","Savile was appointed to look into how patients were treated by staff .

"A murder investigation has been launched after a teenager who was shot in the eye over an apparent dispute about a girl died in hospital from his injuries. The 18-year-old man, who has not yet been named by police, was taken to hospital after being shot in Rotherhithe, south east London, on Sunday afternoon. Police said he died from his injuries just before 4.45pm yesterday and confirmed two men had been arrested in connection with his death. The incident is not believed to be gang-related. The 18-year-old man, who has not yet been named by police, was taken to hospital after being shot in Rotherhithe, south east London, on Sunday afternoon. Pictured: A forensic tent at the scene of the incident . Police said investigations remain ongoing at the scene and confirmed a murder probe had been launched . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 36-year-old man was arrested at an address in south London in the early hours of Monday. 'A 21-year-old man was arrested after he handed himself in at a south London police station. Both men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody.' A 19-year-old man injured in the same incident has now been released from hospital following treatment. He was allegedly beaten with a medieval-style mace in the attack. Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn, of the Met's homicide and major crime command based at Lewisham, said: 'We are retaining an open mind as to the motive behind this incident, but there is nothing to suggest at this stage that it was gang-related. 'A crime scene remains in place at the scene.' Earlier, witnesses told how they saw the shot teenager writhing in agony after being hit in the eye in the 'dispute over a girl.' He was initially knocked unconscious by the shot before coming around as residents went to his aid. Two men have been arrested in connection with the man's death and remain in custody at a London station . Officers could be seen combing the spot for evidence yesterday as it emerged the victim had died in hospital . Nigel Fletcher, 46, described seeing the victim lying in a pool of blood wearing trainers, jeans and black coat. He said: 'I looked out and saw the guy lying on the floor in a pool of blood. 'The others obviously fled as quick as they could. 'He was just lying there still as a bat - he wasn't moving at all. I just assumed he was dead, dead instantly. There was blood everywhere. 'I heard the shooting, it sounded like two shots. There was a big bang, like a firework, but it was obviously a gun. It echoed around the estate. 'My missus came down and just said ""someone's been shot"". She told me she's heard arguing outside and then heard the shots and saw one or two of them running away. 'I've never seen anything like it. Things like this don't happen around here.' A 19-year-old man was also allegedly attacked with a medieval-style mace in the broad daylight attack . The road and footpath remained shut to the public yesterday as police investigations continued at the scene . Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I looked out of my window because I heard a noise. 'A blue car sped away and there was a lot of shouting. One group ran one way and others ran through the car park. 'I didn't realise someone had been shot. I only realised when my neighbour said. I called for an ambulance and went down with a towel. 'He was white and I did see he had an injury to his eye. He was huddled over. He was alive but he was groaning. He was conscious. 'It all happened so quickly.

"A 16-year-old girl was gunned down by her uncle after she refused to turn down her loud music. Rehana Bibi was killed in her home in the village of Matan Kallaan, in Punjab province, Pakistan, after defying her uncle's demands to lower the volume on her tape-recorder. 'Two bullets were fired at the girl. One hit her in the head while the other on her face. She died on the spot,' a police official told local media. A Pakistani shopkeeper browses through music compact discs at his shop in Peshawar . Violence against women is rampant in Pakistan, with hundreds killed every year in the name of 'honour'. Rehana's father, Munsib Khan, told police that on Saturday he had left home early to go to work. His younger brother, Muhammad Gullistan, came to his house at 10am. It is believed Gullistan found Rehana listening to loud music and told her to turn it off. She refused and the pair began to fight. 'The girl Rehana Bibi was alone at her home and was listening to music when her uncle Muhammad Gulistan... came to her house and asked to lower the volume,' Sadat Ali, an official on duty at Kallar Kahar police station, told AFP. 'On her refusal, they quarrelled and Gulistan shot her dead,' said Mr Ali. Gullistan fled the village after the attack.

Police said they were not aware of any family feud leading up to the attack.

"Alex Salmond quit last night after having failed to realise his lifetime ambition of Scottish independence. The First Minister, who days ago looked on the cusp of victory, said it was time to hand over to a new leader after the nationalists were defeated. Looking downcast during a press conference at his official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said he was proud of the high turnout and a ‘remarkable’ result. Scroll down for video . Mr Salmond said: 'Let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short... but on the distance we have travelled' Alex Salmond (pictured with his pilot),  leaves Edinburgh, Scotland, via the official 'Yes Scotland' campaign helicopter after announcing hours earlier that he is to step down from his position . ‘My time as leader is nearly over,’ he announced, ‘but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.’ He admitted a referendum could happen only ‘once in a generation’ but told the Scottish people they had the chance to ‘hold Westminster’s feet to the fire’ to deliver the powers they had been promised in return for staying in the Union. He made a final swipe at the Westminster parties, claiming they were reneging on their devolution promises already. He accused David Cameron of rowing back on Gordon Brown’s pledge to allow a vote on a draft Bill enshrining new powers for Holyrood before next May’s General Election. It is expected that Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond’s close ally and loyal deputy for seven years, will succeed him in a leadership contest at the Scottish National Party conference in November. Miss Sturgeon, a 44-year-old former solicitor who performed impressively during the referendum campaign, said last night she would make no official announcement but seemed to throw her hat into the ring, saying she could ‘think of no greater privilege than to seek to lead the party I joined when I was just 16’. Mr Salmond, 59, who intends to remain a member of the Scottish parliament, drove his party from a fringe movement to the heart of government in 20 years at the helm . Miss Sturgeon, a 44-year-old former solicitor, said she could ‘think of no greater privilege' than to take over . She added: ‘Alex Salmond’s achievements as SNP leader and Scotland’s First Minister are second to none...he inspired 1.6million of our fellow citizens to vote Yes to independence.’ Mr Salmond had appeared briefly at 6am yesterday to concede defeat, telling the nationalists they had driven fear into the Westminster establishment. He called on his supporters to accept the result and said: ‘Let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short; let us dwell on the distance we have travelled.’ Mr Salmond, 59, who intends to remain a member of the Scottish parliament, drove his party from a fringe movement to the heart of government in 20 years at the helm. When he finally surfaced to answer questions about the defeat, Alex Salmond handpicked the journalists allowed to attend – with unionist Press turned away. His press conference, at which he announced his resignation, had been due to start at 10am but at midday officials announced it would be ‘invitation only’. The Times, The Sun in Scotland, the Herald, Dundee Courier, Daily Record, PA, BBC and Sky were invited while the Mail, Financial Times, Telegraph and Express were barred and The Guardian boycotted the event. ‘I believe this is a new and exciting situation which is redolent with possibility,’ he said. ‘But in that situation I believe party, Parliament and country would benefit from new leadership. It has been the privilege of my life to serve as First Minister...we lost the referendum vote, but Scotland can still carry the political initiative. Scotland can still emerge as the real winner.’ At a press conference from which No supporting newspapers – including the Mail – were excluded, he said it was for others to take the independence cause forward. As he spoke, his chief of staff Geoff Aberdein was in tears. Mr Salmond, Scotland’s longest-serving First Minister, grew up on a council estate in the Labour stronghold of Linlithgow, West Lothian. A committed socialist, he joined the SNP as a student in the early 1970s in frustration at Labour’s support for the Union. After a stint at the civil service – where he met his wife Moira – he landed a job as an economist. He stuck with the SNP as it lost nine of its 11 MPs following a wipeout in the home rule referendum of 1979 and dragged the party into a more moderate direction, becoming an MP in 1987 and party leader three years later. He became First Minister in 2007, leading a minority government, then trounced Labour in the 2011 Holyrood elections. Mr Cameron said Mr Salmond was ‘a politician of huge talent and passion’ and an effective First Minister adding: ‘While we disagree profoundly about his goal of a separated Scotland, and many other things, I respect and admire his huge contribution to politics.’ Ed Miliband said Mr Salmond was a ‘formidable politician...who stood up for what he believed in’.","Downcast First Minister held press conference at Edinburgh residence .

They say hundreds of thousands of women have suffered unnecessarily as a result of the decade-long controversy over the effects of Hormone Replacement Therapy. Fresh guidance from the British Menopause Society is seeking to reassure patients, saying the benefits of HRT outweigh any potential risk for women in their 50s. They say GPs should prescribe the . treatment to any woman who has unpleasant menopausal symptoms, such as . hot flushes and mood changes. HRT is also known to provide bone . protection in later life. However, . the debate is likely to rage on as The Royal College of Obstetricians . and Gynaecologists continues to advise HRT only for women with serious . menopausal symptoms for the shortest time possible. After five years . doctors are not expected to continue prescribing it without discussing . potential risks. Uptake of . HRT halved after two studies linked it to an increased risk of heart . disease and breast cancer. An estimated one million women in the UK . stopped having the treatment. Consultant . Endocrinologist Dr Helen Buckler, from the University of Manchester, . said the emerging consensus was that the benefits of HRT outweighed the . risks for most women, and that GPs should consider the updated BMS . advice when treating the condition. Speaking . at the Cheltenham Science Festival, she said the two studies linking . HRT to breast cancer and heart disease were scientifically unreliable. She . said: 'The new advice is HRT should be used for a slightly wider age, . if need be. If a woman has symptoms affecting the quality of her . personal or professional life, then the benefits outweigh the risk.' The scare began in 2002, when the US . Women's Health Initiative study was halted three years early because . researchers claimed women using HRT were at higher risk of breast . cancer, heart disease and strokes. This contradicted previous – and later – research which suggested it guarded against heart problems. HRT . is normally prescribed to menopausal women in their 50s, but in the WHI . study, it was also given to women in their 60s and 70s who had gone . through the menopause more than a decade earlier. Shortly afterwards the UK Million Women Study, part funded by Cancer Research, said HRT doubled breast cancer risk, but a review last year said it was 'unreliable and defective'. Cancer Research advice remains that there is still convincing evidence that women who take HRT have an increased risk of breast cancer. But Dr Buckler said the charity was 'out of step' and its approach had tended to 'put women off' taking the treatment. Some younger doctors have never prescribed HRT because they wrongly believe the risks outweigh the benefits, experts have warned. Jessica Harris, of Cancer Research UK, said there was 'convincing evidence' that women who take HRT have an increased risk of breast cancer, but that risk returns to normal around five years after stopping using it. The BMS guidance is also opposed to the 'arbitrary' five year limit on treatment, and says it should be continued if symptoms persist. The BMS – a registered charity and medical foundation – receives no government funding. Its medical advisory council comprises leading international experts in post reproductive health management, who draw up guidelines for health professionals.","Guidance from British Menopause Society seeks to reassure patients .

"They have lain unseen for centuries – a carefully arranged group of skeletons deep beneath what became one of the busiest areas of London. Millions of feet have tramped unwittingly above them through the years; thousands of tons of earth and rubble concealed their grave. But yesterday it was hoped that the DNA within the nine sets of remains would unlock a mystery that has baffled and divided medical minds for generations: what caused the Black Death in 1348? Carefully laid out skeletons thought to be from a 14th century burial ground that have been discovered in London during work on the £14.8billion Crossrail project . Don Walker, an osteologist from the Museum of London's Archaeology department, inspects a skeleton . They were discovered during excavation work for the £14.8billion Crossrail project, currently carving a subterranean path across London. They were more than 8ft below a road between Farringdon and Barbican Tube stations, leading internet wags to suggest they probably died waiting for a Circle Line train. In fact the bodies are believed to have been among the 1.5million Britons who died when the plague swept through Europe. Sizing things up: The skeletons were carefully laid out in rows eight feet beneath the surface . Archaeologists from the Museum of London's Archaeology department work on uncovering the bodies . Emergency mass graves were dug, but the corpses were not simply thrown in. Men and women were placed side by side in uniform rows, often with hands folded across the torso. A similar skeleton formation was found in the 1980s at nearby Smithfield, and as many as 50,000 might have been buried in the area over three years. Crossrail lead archaeologist Jay Carver said: 'This is a highly significant discovery and at the moment we are left with many questions that we hope to answer. Men and women were placed side by side in uniform rows, often with hands folded across the torso . The skeletons were more than 8ft below a road between Farringdon and Barbican Tube stations . DNA experts are working with archaeologists at the Farringdon site to try to identify the exact cause from bone samples . 'We will be undertaking scientific tests on the skeletons to establish their cause of death, whether they were plague victims from the 14th century or later residents, how old they were and perhaps evidence of who they were. 'However, at this early stage all points towards this being part of the 14th-century emergency burial ground.' Around a third of the population of Britain died in the Black Death. Estimates of how many perished in Europe and elsewhere vary between 25million and 200million, making it the grimmest and most destructive pandemic in human history. Don Walker, an osteologist from the Museum of London's Archaeology department, inspects evidence of a lost burial ground dating from the Black Death Plague in 1348 . Hidden secrets: Don Walker holds the skull of one of the skeletons discovered under the streets of London . DNA analysis of European victims has suggested that the Yersinia pestis bacterium was responsible, but many scientists believe the infection was a rapidly-spreading virus. Now DNA experts are working with archaeologists at the Farringdon site to try to identify the exact cause from bone samples. Once analysis is complete, the skeletons will be reburied on the site or at a cemetery. New discovery: Scientists will take samples from the human remains to try and find out how they died .

"An Australian man was gobsmacked to discover he was stung with more than half a million dollar bill for his mobile phone that had been stolen while he was overseas. The incident happened while he was on a European holiday which he reported to his provider in Australia but due to the time difference the phone company recorded the theft as occurring the day after it actually happened.

"Dozens of original artworks by Andy Warhol have been discovered on decaying floppy disks. The artworks were commissioned in 1985 by pioneering home computer company Commodore, who wanted Warhol to demonstrate the graphic capabilities of its new Amiga 1000 as it went head to head with Apple's popular Macintosh series. Although video footage exists of the artist creating the images alongside singer Debbie Harry at the launch of the Amiga 1000, the artworks themselves were thought lost until researchers tracked down the obsolete disks within The Warhol Archive and hired a team of experts to extract the contents. Scroll down for video . Found: One of recently discovered electronic artworks created by Andy Warhol. Created as long ago as 1985 using an Amiga computer, the works were thought to have been lost at some point in subsequent decades . Looking back: One of the files features an attempt at a full reworking of one of Warhol's most famous artworks - the iconic '32 Campbell's Soup Cans' series from 1962 . The files revealed dozens of Warhol's digital originals, ranging from abandoned doodles, to an adapted version of Sandro Botticelli's Birth Of Venus, and even full reworkings of his own most famous artworks - including the iconic Campbell's soup cans. Another of the artworks shows a sketch of Debbie Harry, which was almost certainly created during the Amiga 1000 launch. The hunt for the floppy disks began when the artist Cory Arcangel - a self-described Warhol fanatic and 'lifelong computer nerd' - stumbled on a YouTube video of the Amiga 1000 launch.

This is the actual computer and kit Warhol used to do so . After discussing the footage with figures in the U.S. art scene, Arcangel was introduced to The Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist Matt Wrbican, who was able to track the floppy disks down. Describing the artworks, Arcangel said: 'In the images, we see a mature artist who had spent about 50 years developing a specific hand to eye coordination now suddenly grappling with the bizarre new sensation of a mouse in his palm held several inches from the screen.' 'It had to be enormously frustrating, but it also marked a huge transformation in our culture: the dawn of the era of affordable home computing.' 'We can only wonder how he would explore and exploit the technologies that are so ubiquitous today.'

"Chris Christie used his first interview since January's 'Bridgegate' scandal to claim that the scandal would make him a better leader and then gave the strongest hint to date he is to run for president in 2016. Speaking to ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer at his home in Mendham, the New Jersey governor also insisted that he 'did nothing to create the environment' that caused his then-top aides to close lanes in the George Washington Bridge as political payback on the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey. The embattled governor said that he was 'relieved' to have been exonerated of any involvement by an inquiry, but rejected the suggestion that the law firm who conducted it was appointed by his office to 'whitewash' its findings to protect him. Scroll Down for Video: . First interview: Chris Christie spoke for the first time on Thursday about the Bridgegate scandal which engulfed his governorship in September . Asked if the hugely embarrassing political scandal had scuttled his chances of a 2016 presidential run, Christie said that in fact he believed it 'would make him a better leader'. The governor, who is known for his confrontational and honest leadership style, said that in his opinion voters still have a lot of respect for him - especially in Iowa, where the first Republican presidential primary will be held in 2016. 'I think they love me in Iowa too,' Christie said in the interview, which aired on World News with Diane Sawyer tonight. 'I’ve been there a lot. I think love me there too, especially because of the way I am.' 'Not in spite of, especially because,' Christie added. Incredulous: ABC's Diane Sawyer asked Chris Christie if his personal brash style of leadership created a culture whereby his aides assumed that political payback was justified . Christie spoke with Sawyer at his home in Mendham, New Jersey . Christie said that he hasn't made a decision yet about a 2016 run and won't until next year. However, he said that the scandal involving his former aides, Bridget Anne Kelly, who infamously sent an email saying 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee' to David Wildstein won't adversely affect any bid. 'I don’t intend to make a discussion about 2016 until a year from now,' Christie said. 'But it won’t have anything to do with what has happened in the past 10 weeks.' 'What has happened in last 10 weeks, I think will ultimately make me a better leader, whether it’s governor of New Jersey or any other job I might take in the public or private sector,' he said. Adding to what appeared to be an admission he is giving 2016 serious consideration, Christie said his wife, Mary Pat will not stand in his way.

Christie admitted that the scandal led him on a personal journey of 'soul searching' and that he 'spent a lot of time in the last 11 weeks thinking about what did I do, if anything, to contribute to this,' Christie said. The brash governor refuted any suggestions that his own personal style of management led to a culture where staff felt able to act on their own to close the busiest bridge in the world. 'I don’t think anyone would take that as an indication to do something so incredibly stupid,' he said. At another point, he said to Sawyer: 'You asked if I contributed to a climate, and I don’t believe that I did.' He pleaded ignorance and said that he was baffled by Kelly and Wildstein's collusion in closing the bridge. 'It defies credulity to me. Which is why when things were first reported, I said, 'This can't possibly be true.' Because who would do something like that? Sometimes, people do inexplicably stupid things,' he said. Christie added, 'I can't get into what their motivations were, except to say that anybody who really knows me would not believe that doing something inexplicably stupid would please me.' The governor's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly and David Wildstein who was appointed by Christie to the agency that runs the George Washington Bridge have both been implicated in the scandal. Chris Christie's government funded lawyer claims the New Jersey governor had nothing to do with the George Washington Bridge scandal . Christie has also sacked former campaign manager Bill Stepien, and Wildstein’s boss at the Port Authority, Bill Baroni, who were both criticized for lying in the  report released today which exonerates Christie. Indeed the report that cleared Christie also revealed that Kelly and Stepien were involved leading up to last year's traffic closures.The report, released today by a law firm Christie hired to investigate the scandal, said that the two had been a couple for months but had called things off a month before the George Washington Bridge lane closures. Blame game: David Wildstein, who personally oversaw the George Washington Bridge lane closures, says he has evidence that Chris Christie lied - this was refuted by Thursday report . Asked by Sawyer if he thought his aides were acting out of personal loyalty because Fort Lee mayor, Mark Sokolich did not endorse him, Christie said no. 'I don’t believe it was for me,' he said. Indeed the report released today quashed speculation that the bridge was shut to affect Sokolich. In fact the motive was identified as some unexplained 'ulterior motive' fueled by the 'animosity' towards the Fort Lee mayor. The report also made it clear that Wildstein informed Christie that the bridge closure had caused huge traffic problems while the governor was at a 9/11 event in Manhattan. However, Sawyer said that contradicts how Christie said that he learned of the closure. 'I don't have any recollection of that,' Christie replied. 'David was one of hundreds of people that I spoke to that day. We stood around and spoke briefly that day. 'I don't have any recollection of him saying anything. But I'll tell you this. I'll tell you what he didn't say. 'He didn't say, ‘Hey, by the way governor, I'm closing down some lanes of the George Washington Bridge to stick it to the mayor. Is that OK?’ That I'd remember.' In his view: Governor Christie's office hired Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, to investigate the scandal and the report released Thursday declares clears Christie of wrongdoing . The lawyer hired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to review a traffic-blocking scandal that has engulfed Christie's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot . Christie deemed the past two months the worst of his professional life and said that the episode had brought him closer to his family. 'Right after it happened, our oldest son was home on break, and he asked me, 'Did you do this?’ the governor said. 'It was a tough question that your son would ask you. And I said, ‘No, I didn’t.’ And he said, ‘Good, I’m glad.’ 'It’s brought me closer to my family, it’s brought me to re-evaluate some of the way I spend my time,' Christie said. All but two lanes of the Fort Lee approach to the George Washington Bridge were closed for four days in September - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters . 'I think you can get caught up in this world and in this life so easily… I’m spending a lot more time at home than I ever have … where it’s taken me is that my responsibilities here are important too.' When asked if Kelly was potentially a smoking gun who could reveal the governor did know, Christie said that she couldn't 'credibly' do that. He wrapped up the interview by claiming that at no point was he ever close to resigning. 'I’m not a quitter,' he said. 'You don’t do that. Certainly, from my perspective, position, I knew I hadn’t done anything wrong, so there is no reason for me to leave. In fact there is even more of a reason for me to stay, to fix it. That’s who I am — someone who has to fix things. Make them better. So, for me it was even more of an incentive not to go.'","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spoke for the first time since Bridgegate .

"'Elfie': Elephant Latabe touched the iPhone screen with her trunk - and taken a picture of herself . This is the moment an elephant at a wildlife park used an iPhone to take the world's first ‘elfie’. Visitor Scott Brierley, 23, had been traveling in the West Midlands Safari Park’s drive-through elephant zone in Bewdley, Worcestershire, taking pictures of the African animals. But as Mr Brierley, of Birmingham, took one photograph on Bank Holiday Monday he dropped his mobile phone and the keepers ordered him to stay in his car and keep moving. Staff later retrieved his iPhone and Mr Brierley was stunned to see 22-year-old elephant Latabe had touched the screen with her trunk - and taken a picture of herself. The events manager said he has now got the world's only elephant selfie, adding: ‘I live quite close to the park so I've been there a few times. The elephants are my favourite along with tigers. ‘Me and a friend were driving past the elephant enclosure, I took a few pics of me with one of the elephants. But when I turned back around I hit my phone on the side of the car door. ‘It fell down onto the grass. The elephant was all over it - I think he thought it was food. I didn't dare get out the car to get it. I just drove to one of the workers I could see and he went to get it.

"Shot dead: Trayvon Martin was killed as he walked home from a shop at a Florida gated community where his father lives . The family of a teenager who was shot and killed by Neighbourhood Watch leader filed a public lawsuit on Thursday, and are suing police to get access to the 911, which they think could give clues to the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. They are outraged that the details of the 911 call made after George Zimmerman, 26, called police have not been made available to them. Police say the 911 recording is evidence in an on-going investigation. Martin's father, Tracy, said that family members were upset that no arrest had been made. He described the neighbourhood as mixed race but his attorneys said they believed Trayvon was being profiled at the time of the encounter because he was a young black man; Zimmerman is white. The attorneys also questioned why a neighbourhood watch leader would carry a gun.'He was stereotyped for some reason,' the Martins’ attorney Ben Crump said of the victim. 'Why was Trayvon suspicious? There are hundreds of children in that community.’ Mr Crump also called Zimmerman a ‘loose cannon’ and pointed out that Zimmerman was arrested in Orange County in 2005 for resisting arrest and battery of a police officer. 'He had a gun, and Trayvon had Skittles,' Mr Krump said. 'We want justice.' Trayvon’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, is angry no actions have yet been taken against the man who shot her son. ‘This guy was not arrested,’ she told wesh.com. ‘I do not understand. As a mother, my heart is broken.’ His father, Tracy Martin, also demanded justice. ‘My son left Sanford, Florida in a body bag,’ he told wesh.com. ‘While George Zimmerman went home to go to sleep in his own bed. It’s senseless and the police in Sanford isn’t (sic) giving any answers and we actually feel that justice hasn’t been served and isn’t being served.’ Devastated: Trayvon's mother Sybrina Fulton said her 'heart is broken' as Zimmerman has not yet been arrested . Tragic: Martin was coming home with Skittles and iced tea when he was shot dead in the gated community . The police report said Zimmerman initially called police to report a suspicious person in the neighbourhood and minutes later 911 dispatchers received several calls of shots being fired in the neighbourhood. Zimmerman told police officers that he had shot Martin and officers found a semiautomatic handgun on him. The report said that Zimmerman's back was wet and he was covered in grass as if he had been on the ground. He was bleeding from his nose and the back of the head, the report said. Difficult case: Zimmerman claimed he was acting in self-defence when he shot Trayvon Martin on the night of February 26 and has not yet been charged over the incident . A police officer said he overheard Zimmerman say, 'I was yelling for someone to help me but no one would help me' while he was being treated by paramedics. Zimmerman has been interviewed three times and is cooperating. He is claiming self-defence, even though he was following Martin, police said. Trayvon Martin was gunned down just yards from his father's home as he made his way back from a shop in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, Florida. Neighbourhood Watch captain George Zimmerman, 28, has admitted shooting the youngster, but claims it was in self-defence. As yet, he has not been arrested or charged in connection with the killing. Trayvon who lived in Miami with his mother, had been visiting his father and his partner in a gated community called The Retreat at Twin Lakes, 20 miles north of Orlando. During halftime of an NBA All-Star Game, the high school junior had gone to a nearby shop to buy some Skittles for his younger brother. Trayvon was returning home when he was spotted by Zimmerman, a college student and member of the local Neighbourhood Watch, who was armed with a 9mm handgun. According to a police report released yesterday, Zimmerman, who was patrolling the neighbourhood in his car, had initially called police to report 'suspicious person in the area'. Zimmerman was told to keep his distance, however, before officers could reach the scene, there was some kind of confrontation between him and the teenager. Scene: Police stand by the grass verge in the gated community where Martin was killed . Martin family's home: Martin's father said that while Zimmerman got to go home after the shooting, his son went away in a body bag . Minutes later, 911 dispatchers received several calls of shots being fired in the neighbourhood. By the time police arrived Trayvon lay face down on a patch of grass by the road, dead from a single gunshot wound to his chest. 'My son left Sanford, Florida in a body bag. While George Zimmerman went home to go to sleep in his own bed.' -Tracy Martin . Trayvon's family have issued repeated . calls for Zimmerman's arrest and yesterday demanded that the 911 tapes . relating to the case are released. Tracy . Martin, Trayvan's father, told the Huffington post yesterday he wants . to know what happened between his son and Zimmerman in the minutes . between the call and the shooting. 'I'm . looking for justice for my family,' he said. 'I want answers but I . don't have any to give — not for his mother, his brothers or sisters. 'We don't have nothing, but we want answers.' Exclusive: The entrance to the gated community where Martin was shot . Zimmerman told police that he had shot the youngster and officers found a semi-automatic handgun on him, for which he held a permit. The police report said that Zimmerman's back was wet and he was covered in grass as if he had been on the ground. He was bleeding from his nose and the back of the head, the report said. A police officer said he overheard Zimmerman say, 'I was yelling for someone to help me but no one would help me' while he was being treated by paramedics. 'We want answers': Trayvon pictured as a toddler: His family are desperate to see the man who shot him placed under arrest . Zimmerman is claiming self-defence, even though he was following Trayvon, said Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee. 'There is some physical evidence and some testimony that would corroborate some of that story,' Mr Lee told the Associated Press. He added that the 911 tapes have not been released because they have critical information and detectives don't want them to influence the testimony of prospective witnesses. A phone number listed for Zimmerman has been disconnected, and his current whereabouts are not known, the Huffington Post reported. Mr Martin said yesterday that family members were upset that no arrest had been made. He described the neighborhood as mixed race but his attorneys said they believed Trayvon Martin was being profiled at the time of the encounter because he was a young black man. Zimmerman is white. The attorneys also questioned why a neighbourhood watch leader would carry a gun. 'He was stereotyped for some reason,' attorney Ben Crump said of the victim. 'Why was Trayvon suspicious? There are hundreds of children in that community.' The police chief said residents upset by the lack of an arrest so far should wait until the investigation is completed, as soon as next week. The State Attorney's Office will then decide whether to present it to a grand jury. 'I understand the emotions and the response from the community ... based on the limited information they have,' Mr Lee said. 'We just hope they would allow us the time to conduct a thorough and fair investigation.' Mr Crump on Wednesday told Reuters that the family was concerned that police would treat the shooting as self-defence, and that police have ignored the family's request for a copy of the original 911 call, which they think will shed light on the incidents. 'If the 911 protocol across the country held to form here, they told him not to get involved. He disobeyed that order,' said Ryan Julison, a spokesman for the family. 'He didn't have to get out of his car,' said Mr Crump. 'If he never gets out of his car, there is no reason for self-defense. Trayvon only has Skittles. He has the gun.' Since Trayvon, a high school junior who wanted to be a pilot, was black and Zimmerman is white, Mr Crump said race was 'the 600lb elephant in the room.' 'Why is this kid suspicious in the first place? I think a stereotype must have been placed on the kid.'","Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot dead by Neighbourhood Watch leader in primarily white, gated neighbourhood .

"Fears have frequently been raised that heavy use of the internet can re-wire teenage brains. But ‘no evidence’ has been found that ‘typical’ use of the net harms young minds, according to a study review. Yet experts claim that more work is needed before any firm conclusion can be drawn. Keep on surfing: 'No evidence' has been found that 'typical' use of the internet harms young minds, according to a study review. Yet experts claim that more work is needed before any firm conclusion can be drawn . Neuroscientist Kathryn Mills, a PhD student at University College London looked at evidence from 135 previous studies focusing on ‘typical’ internet use that did not involve problem behaviours such as spending extreme amounts of time on-screen. Speaking at a news briefing in London, she said: ‘Finding lack of evidence is different to finding evidence of no effect. ‘I have not found evidence that typical internet use is harming the adolescent brain.’ In a paper to be published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, she points out that the right research to answer the question has not yet been conducted. ‘There is currently no evidence to suggest that internet use has or has not had a profound effect on brain development.’ UCL expert Kathryn Mills said: 'There is currently no evidence to suggest that internet use has or has not had a profound effect on brain development.' Previous studies have used MRI scans (stock image is pictured) to study brain activity in online 'addicts' ‘If we want to know how this highly connected world is impacting our brains, we will need to conduct studies that investigate brain measures and their relationship to behaviour, cognition, and well-being in a representative sample of the population,’ she said. In response to claims that internet use is causing major re-wiring to the teenage brain, Ms Mills said: ‘I’m doubtful that that is the case.’ In 2011, a study by neuroscientists and radiologists at universities and hospitals in China claimed that excessive internet usage - between eight and 14hours a day - may cause parts of teenagers’ brains to waste away. Scientists discovered signs of atrophy of grey matter in the brains of heavy internet users that grew worse over time. They warned that this could affect their concentration and memory, their ability to make decisions and set goals and could even reduce their inhibitions and lead to ‘inappropriate’ behaviour. In 2012, another study said that internet addiction disrupts nerve wiring in the brains of teenagers, causing a level of brain damage normally seen in heavy substance abusers. The Chinese study used MRI scans to examine the brains of teen internet addicts and occasional users and the brain scans showed significant damage to white matter in the brains of those hooked on online games.","University College London expert looked at evidence from 135 previous studies focusing on ‘typical’ internet usage .

"Cesc Fabregas made his mind up to leave Barcelona last April after they lost in the Spanish Cup to Real Madrid and the Spain midfielder sensed a trophyless season was going to end with an almighty shake-up that could well include him. Sure enough, Barca finished the campaign empty handed and manager Tata Martino was replaced by Luis Enrique. Fabregas spoke to the club’s sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta on the phone a week after the season ended. Fabregas told El Pais: ‘I called Zubizarreta and I knew by the response that I got that I was doing them a favour – it was the best thing for them and for me.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho: Fabregas made at Arsenal and brilliant for Chelsea . Cesc Fabregas is pictured celebrating with Nemanja Matic after the Serbian scored against Sporting Lisbon . After what was effectively a shrug of the shoulders from the club and not the ‘please don’t go’ message that might have changed his mind, he told his agent Darren Dein to step up the search for a club in England, with London the preferred destination. Fabregas has always had an affiliation with the capital ever since sharing digs with Philippe Senderos when he moved to the city as a 16-year-old from Barcelona. Asked by a Spanish journalist recently if he felt ‘British’, Fabregas replied: ‘More than British I feel like a Londoner’ and with wife Daniella Semaan also a fan  he was always likely to favour a move to a London club over the mooted switch to either Manchester United or City. Fabregas in action for Arsenal where he spent eight years before joining Barcelona in the summer of 2011 . The irony of his failure to fit back in at Barcelona was that while his off-the-field friendship with Lionel Messi was stronger than ever – the two were reunited having been in the same Under 13 side as schoolboys at Barcelona’s La Masia academy – the pair were difficult to fit into the same team on the pitch. Messi had become the archetypal ‘False 9’ at the Nou Camp, operating as a withdrawn centre-forward. Fabregas did the same job for Spain at the 2012 European Championship. The former Arsenal captain loves to arrive in the space between the oppostion’s central defenders and holding midfielders but that was Messi territory. Fabregas lines up for Barcelona against Villarreal in his final season with the Catalan giants . Fabregas (second right) lines up alongside Gerard Pique (third left) and Lionel Messi (front left) for Barca in '03 . Pep Guardiola changed Barca’s 4-3-3 system to a 3-4-3 in 2011 so that Messi could stay as the team’s deep-lying centre forward and Fabregas could operate at the top of a midfield diamond. The two dove-tailed brilliantly at first but the strains of playing a back three soon meant the system was binned and so began the conundrum of finding a place for Fabregas. While Messi and partner Antonella Roccuzzo stepped out with Fabregas and Semaan more and more and both couples had new-born children to tighten the bonds, Fabregas found himself stepping out on to the pitch with Messi less and less. In reference to being left out of Barca’s Champions League semi-final humiliation to Bayern Munich in 2013 he told Sportsmail: 'If you play one game, the next, and the next but then comes the big game away to Bayern Munich and we are losing 4-0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down.' He still scored 42 goals in 150 games and won the trophies that had eluded him at Arsenal and the admiration of Jose Mourinho who made his move this summer. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Christians remain the largest religious group in the world despite their population migrating from Europe to Africa, Asia and the Americas according to a new study. Around one-quarter of the world's Christian's live in Europe today compared to two-thirds a century ago according to a study compiled by the Pew Research Forum on Religion & Public Life based in Washington DC. The research showed that Sub-Saharan Africa has seen the biggest increase in its Christian population over the past century, going from about nine million Christians in 1910 to about 516 million today. Christianity remains the world's most dominant religion despite only one-quarter living in Europe. Picture: The Vatican in Rome . Countries with the largest number of Christians are the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and Russia. The study's author's said Brazil has twice as many Roman Catholics as Italy, while Nigeria has double the number of Protestants as Germany, where the Protestant Reformation began, author's of the study said. However, even despite the movement of the Christian population to different parts of the globe it is still the world's dominant religion with nearly 2.2billion followers. Islam is the world's second-largest religion with about 1.6 billion people or slightly less than a quarter of the global population following the faith. Christians attend a service in Terreiros Square, Brazil which is home to one of the world's largest populations of the faith . The Global Christianity report was . compiled using national censuses, population surveys and estimates from . church groups of numbers attending services. The . data was compared to surveys taken in 1910 including data from the . Centre for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell . Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. Europe may have been the mainland for . Christians a century ago but researchers said that the population is now . so widely spread across the world that no specific region can be described as the centre of the faith. This has been a concern for Church . leaders for many years who have  been tasked with trying to build stronger ties with . fellow believers across the geographical boundaries and reconcile . differing interpretations of the Bible. Young boys take part in a Christmas Eve service at a Catholic church in Beijing . Conrad Hackett, Demographer at the Pew Forum and lead researcher for the Global Christianity report, told The Christian Post: 'We set out to provide data on the number of Christians around the world as part of a series of reports focusing on the global populations of major religious groups. 'As we note in the report, there is no single region or continent that is indisputably the centre of global Christianity anymore'. The smallest concentration of Christians can be found in North Africa - where the faith began - and where they make up only about four per cent of the population today. Egypt has the largest Christian population in the region, with about 4.3 million Christians who have been victims of violence specifically since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. About five per cent of China's population or 67 million people are Christian, according to the study's authors. It is difficult to be accurate, however when estimating China's Christian population due to the mixture of government-sanctioned churches and grassroots operating illegally across the country.","Only one-quarter of world's population remain in Europe as followers spread across Asia, Africa and Americas .

"More than 2,000 people descended on a picturesque beauty spot for an illegal rave which police were not able to stop because there were too few officers on duty, it has emerged. Revellers turned out in their droves to Devil's Dyke in the South Downs, near Brighton, East Sussex, yesterday and set up camp in the National Park before the illegal party got underway. More than 400 cars and at least seven sound systems were spotted at the unlicensed gathering – which attracted people from as far away as Swindon after word spread on social media. Scroll down for video . Illegal: Ravers descended on a picturesque beauty spot for a rave, which police were not yet able to stop because there were too few officers on duty . Big event: Ravers came from all over the country to take part in the party at the beauty spot near Brighton . The rave, which was still going strong more than 24 hours after it started, finally ended at 7am this morning. Frustrated nearby residents called police complaining of the noise and ‘serious distress’ caused by the party, which broke out on open land near to the park’s golf course in the early hours of Sunday. However, despite sending officers to the scene, Sussex Police said it was unable to disperse revellers and was powerless to do so. A spokesman said: ‘Overnight it was assessed that due to the darkness, rain, and numbers present, it was not appropriate or practical to attempt to close the gathering safely. ‘With daylight, officers have been re-assuring local residents that action is being taken to contain the gathering, to limit further attendance, and to seek to minimise the impact on them. ‘Officers have been on the site and the gathering is good humoured though very noisy. ‘Although there are powers available to the police to close down illegal gatherings such as this, before exercising these powers an assessment has to be undertaken to determine whether or not such a gathering can be closed down safely and effectively. ‘At present the assessment is that it would not be possible or safe to close the event down, given the number of police officers available. Non-stop party: Thousands have descended on Devil's Dyke in Surret to take part in the illegal rave . More than 2,000 people and 400 cars have descended on a picturesque beauty spot at Devil's Dyke, South Downs National Park, near Brighton, East Sussex for the illegal rave (pictured) ‘However a presence at the location will be maintained and active measures are being taken to seek to prevent it escalating further.’ Raves are unlicensed, illegal parties which are often held on land which is not owned by the organisers. They can cause a huge amount of disruption to local residents and damage to the land. A police spokesman added: ‘Where we can we will attend a report of a rave at the earliest opportunity to try to bring it to a safe conclusion. ‘When a large number of people are already at the site it is not always possible for us shut down the rave with the police resources available at that time. Officers from Sussex Police have not yet been able to stop the gathering because there have not been enough officers on duty. Residents living near the usually peaceful South Downs (pictured) have made noise complaints . ‘However we will always take action to contain the event, to reassure local residents, and work with partners such as the National Trust and Council to minimise the impact. ‘We are also investigating to see what offences organisers may have committed and will pursue all offences that are identified.'","More than 2,000 people and 400 cars have descended on pretty beauty spot .

"Arsenal's interest in Mario Balotelli looks to have been dealt a killer blow, after AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani claimed the controversial striker would be staying with the Italian club. The former Manchester City centre forward has been consistently linked with a move to Arsene Wenger's side, and Milan president Silvio Berlusconi was even quoted earlier this summer as saying: 'I was selling Balotelli to an English team for several millions.' However, Galliani now appears to have shot down any chance of a move to England with the 23-year-old part of the club's plans for the new season.

"Billionaire Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay had almost $30,000 in cash when he was arrested earlier this month for driving under the influence. Irsay, 54, was preliminarily charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and four felony counts of possession of illegal prescription drugs following a March 16 traffic stop in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel - and he had $29,000 in cash, said police.

'He desperately needs help.' According to the Star, Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances. The . night of his arrest, Irsay drove at a slow rate of speed, stopped in . the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, . Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release. 'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said. Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't drink...haven't in over 15 years.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment. Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay. A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs. League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would. Weight loss: A fuller-looking Jim Irsay addresses media about his team the Colts in 2012 . Drug charges: Irsay (pictured in October 2013) now faces four felony charges relating to drug and intoxicated driving . 'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said. Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion. Meg Irsay filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage. A joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.  The couple, who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the parents of three adult daughters. Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.","Jim Irsay, 54, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, was arrested last week for DUI and felony possession of a controlled substance .

"From porkpies to stetsons and trilbies, we've seen several styles of the fedora hat pop up on the high street during the past few years, and now is the time to embrace it once again. The perfect cover up for your head for this season, felt varieties keep you warm during chilly January and will see you right through to May, when you can replace it for a sunny straw style. Catherine Zeta Zones and Myleene Klass both stepped out in stylish fedoras yesterday, showcasing the trend to perfection. Catherine Zeta Jones looks stylish at LAX Airport while Myleene is a class act leaving the ITV Studios in London . And avid fedora fan Jessica Alba chose a cool black wide-brimmed style as she jetted in to Paris for Haute Couture Fashion Week. The actress arrived at Roissy airport in France’s capital city in time to catch some shows and teamed her hat with piles of cosy layers including shiny leggings and a cashmere scarf.

Fedora is a broad terms for a variety of hat styles that traditionally made with a fairly low crown creased lengthwise and a brim that can be turned up or down. They can be 'pinched' in several ways, including in the middle at the top, with teardrop crowns or centre dents. The term fedora was used in reference to the type of hat from as early as 1891. Its popularity soared, and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking Homburg hat. The word fedora, though, comes from the title of an 1882 play by dramatist Victorien Sardou, 'Fédora', written for Sarah Bernhardt. The hat was very popular in the 1920s through to the early 1950s, but in the late 50s it fell out of fashion as style shifted towards a more casual aesthetic - but they've been back in style since the mid-70s and we're embracing the trend more than ever today.

"It’s a debate that divides people the world over: Is the Turin shroud a genuine relic or just an elaborate fake? According to one expert the answer is very much the latter, and he is baffled that no one has noticed irregularities before. He says that aside from radiocarbon dating in 1988 showing it originates from the 14th century, there is evidence that it has been altered over time and that it was used specifically during medieval Easter rituals. Scroll down for video . British scholar Charles Freeman says the Turin Shroud was a medieval prop. He analysed the cloth and found no mention of it from before 1355. This split screen shows the likeness between the Turin Shroud and a portrait of Christ by Leonardo da Vinci . The analysis  comes from British scholar and author Charles Freeman writing for History Today. Looking through historical texts, he found no mention of the shroud before 1355 - somewhat odd for an item of such apparent religious significance. Writer Michael Paulkovich has claimed that there is little evidence for a person known as Jesus existing in history. Jesus is thought to have lived from about 7BC to 33AD in the Roman Empire. However Paulkovich says he found little to no mention of the supposed messiah in 126 texts written in the first to third centuries. Only one mention of Jesus was present, in a book by Roman historian Josephus Flavius, but he says this was added by later editors. He says this is surprising despite the ‘alleged worldwide fame’ of Jesus. This has led him to believe that Jesus was a 'mythical character'. He then notes that the artefact was acquired by the House of Savoy - one of the oldest royal familes in the world - and turned into a ‘high-prestige relic’ in 1453, reports The Guardian. But following this he found that depictions of the shroud, including an engraving by artist Anotonio Tempesta in 1613, were different from the shroud we know today. They focused on features that are no longer easy to spot, including the Crown of Thorns and long hair on Christ’s neck. In addition, it is no longer easy to see that the figure in the shroud was once covered in blood and marks from where he had been struck. ‘Astonishingly, few researchers appear to have grasped that the shroud looked very different in the 16th and 17th centuries from the object we see today,’ Freeman writes. This leads him to believe that the shroud was mostly likely just a prop used in medieval Easter rituals. He believed it was used in a ceremony called the ‘Quem Quaeritis?’ or ‘whom do you seek?’ This ceremony involved re-enacting gospel accounts of the resurrection. ‘They would enter a makeshift tomb and bring out the grave clothes to show that Christ had indeed risen,’ Freeman says. The shroud is set to be exhibited next year in Turin for the first time in five years, with two million people expected to visit it. The linen cloth, believed by some to have wrapped the body of Jesus Christ, has captivated the imagination of historians, church chiefs, sceptics and Catholics for more than 500 years. There are no definite historical records concerning the shroud prior to the 14th century. Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century. But there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at Turin Cathedral. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the Byzantine emperors but disappeared during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the small town of Lirey around the years 1353 to 1357. It was in the possession of a French Knight, Geoffroi de Charny, who died at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. However the correspondence of this shroud with the shroud in Turin, and its very origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors, with claims of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart. Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer. The history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded. In 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of Chambéry, capital of the Savoy region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy ordered the cloth to be brought from Chambéry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since. The shroud has had many notorious admirers. It even obsessed Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who wanted to steal it so he could use it in a black magic ceremony. In May 2010, five years after he became Pope, Benedict authorised a public viewing of the Shroud - the first since 2000. Freeman believes that the shroud was mostly likely just a prop used in medieval Easter rituals (stock image shown). He believed it was used in a ceremony called the ‘Quem Quaeritis?’ or ‘whom do you seek?’This involved re-enacting gospel accounts of the resurrection . This picture from Turin in 1967 apparently shows the profile of Jesus Christ from the Turin Shroud. Radiocarbon dating in 1988, however, suggested the Shroud was no older than the 14th century .","British scholar Charles Freeman says Turin Shroud is a medieval prop .

"A video of a pair of dueling, dancing American priests studying in Rome has gone viral, following in the footsteps of a now-famous Italian nun whose Alicia Keyes-esque voice won her a singing contest and a record contract. The Rev. David Rider, 29, of Hyde Park, New York, and the Rev. John Gibson, 28, of Milwaukee, first shot to Internet fame when they were filmed in April during a fundraiser at the North American College, the elite American seminary up the hill from the Vatican. Rider warmed up the crowd with a lively tap-dance routine, only to be pushed aside by Gibson's fast-footed Irish dance. Soon they were battling it out, trying to impress the crowd.

'All of a sudden the numbers started rising and rising,' Lewis told The Associated Press.  The video has nearly 260,000 views. Their Internet success has drawn comparisons to Sr. Cristina Scuccia, who won the Italian edition of 'The Voice' in June with a series of unadorned pop song performances, in full habit. Her first album features a cover of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin.' As with Scuccia, the priests' online popularity was tinged with criticism.

"It’s taken 144 years for a statue of Charles Dickens to be built in Britain. And his great-great-great-grandchildren took no time in snapping a selfie with him. The life-size bronze sculpture of the writer was unveiled today in Portsmouth, the city of his birth, on what would have been his 202nd birthday. Three of Charles Dickens great great great grandchildren, siblings Tom Dickens 15, Lydia Dickens 14 and Oliver Dickens 9 take a selfie with their ancestor's new statue in Portsmouth today . The £140,000 bronze sculpture is the first statue of the author in Britain after he expressed a dying wish for no monument to be made of him after his death . The likeness was unveiled on what would have been the 19th century author's 202nd birthday . Great-great-great grandson Oliver Dickens, nine, said: ‘It feels really special. I’ve read his books and love Oliver Twist the best.’ There has been a 20-year row over whether a statue of the great novelist should ever be erected – because it is against his dying wishes. The £140,000 statue was commissioned despite Dickens writing in his will that he should never be made the ‘subject of any monument, memorial or testimonial’. More than 40 descendants of the 19th . century novelist attended the ceremony at Portsmouth's Guildhall Square . which is less than a mile from the house where he was born 202 years ago . today. The statue has . been created by sculptor Martin Jennings whose previous subjects include . Sir John Betjeman at St Pancras Station, London, and Philip Larkin in . Hull. The over life-size statue in bronze, which cost £140,000, features Dickens sitting down surrounded by books. It is not the first of Dickens' posthumous requests to be ignored - his decision to be buried at Rochester Cathedral was over-ruled and he was instead laid to rest at Westminster Abbey . While it may be the first statue in Britain, another statue was erected in Philadelphia, USA, in 1891 and another created later in Sydney, Australia . Following his stroke in 1870, the writer's other wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral was over-ruled . Mr . Jennings said: 'I wanted the statue to express Dickens's energy, the . richness of his imagination and the abundance of his output. 'It's also quite theatrical, fitting I . hope for a man who loved the stage. It's taken many months to make but I . hope people think it does justice to the great man.' Having the statue built is not the first of Dickens' dying wishes to be ignored. Following . his stroke in 1870, his other wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral . was over-ruled and he was laid to rest in Poets' Corner at Westminster . Abbey. Another statue was erected in Philadelphia, USA, in 1891 and another created later in Sydney, Australia. Defending . the decision to create a statue for Portsmouth, Professor Tony Pointon, . chair of the Charles Dickens statue committee, said: 'He did not . mention a statue, he didn't say 'I do not want a statue', he didn't want . a monument for his funeral, he didn't want a funerary monument, in fact . he sat for three sculptors when he was alive.' Oliver . Mark Charles Dickens, 21, another great-great-great-grandson, from . Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: ""Dickens touched so many people and the . best thing about the statue is that it is at ground level so people can . interact with it, can touch it. While Dickens' family said they were happy with the likeness, one protester objected and covered the statue with a sheet saying 'it's not what he would have wanted' The statue is in Guildhall Square, less than a mile away from the house where he was born . The statue was created by sculptor . Martin Jennings (left) whose previous subjects include Sir John Betjeman and Philip Larkin. Dickens was born in Portsmouth in this house (right) 'We are 202 years from his birth, he has made us so proud as a family and we are giving something back. 'I do not feel we are taking liberties, we want to celebrate him, not annoy him.' Stage . and screen actor Edward Fox and his wife Joanna David gave a reading at . the unveiling and they were joined in the Guildhall Square by members . of the Pickwick Cycle Club on their penny farthing bicycles. Mark . Charles Dickens, a great-great-grandson, and head of the Dickens family . said: 'The Dickens Family is delighted that a statue of our famous . ancestor will at long last be erected in this country, and most fitting . that it should be on his 202nd birthday in the city of his birth, where . by coincidence his mistress and childhood sweetheart are also buried. 'This . is the culmination of years of hard work by many dedicated people and . we really hope that this magnificent statue will stimulate and inspire . future generations to discover the genius of his writing and his . passionate campaign for social justice.' Ian Dickens, a great great grandson of Charles Dickens, stands with the statue. The Charles Dickens statue committee has spent 20 years raising funds for the sculpture . Councillor Lee Hunt, Portsmouth City Council cabinet member for culture said: 'Everyone living, working or visiting in the city is welcome to witness the first UK Charles Dickens statue. 'This is a marvellous tribute to an incredible man. Everyone in Portsmouth should feel immensely proud that the statue of Dickens is here in his home town.' Other guests at the event included the youngest member of the family 26-month-old Joe Robinson who is a great-great-great-great-grandson while two members of the Dickens Pickwick Club, Michael O'Reilly and Dennis Babcock travelled from America specifically for the unveiling.","A statue to Charles Dickens has been unveiled in Portsmouth .

"Europe faces being crippled by debt until 2021, with devastating consequences for its population of 500million people, including those in Britain, Angela Merkel warned yesterday. The German Chancellor’s gloomy forecast of ten years of economic misery followed the failure at the G20 summit in Cannes to agree how to bail out bankrupt Greece. ‘This debt crisis will not simply go away,’ Mrs Merkel said. ‘It will certainly be a decade before we are in a better position.’ Warning: Angela Merkel has predicted that Europe's debt crisis is unlikely to be resolved any time soon . In her weekly podcast to the German people, she added that to have any chance of solving the crisis, everyone in Europe had to ‘make an effort and do their homework’. The grim message came as economic forecasters warned that the eurozone crisis could knock back Britain's economy by six years. The Ernst & Young Item Club predicted that Britain's gross domestic product could fall by 4 per cent to below its levels during the 2008-09 recession, reported The Sunday Times. Marie Delon, senior economic adviser at the firm, said: 'We could see a contraction of 5 or 6 per cent in the eurozone. Share prices could fall by 30 or 40 per cent and credit conditions would tighten as they did after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers.' David Cameron, meanwhile, has stepped up the pressure on Mrs Merkel to use her clout as the eurozone’s most powerful leader to sort out the financial crisis. The summit resulted in a poker-like stand-off that saw the British Prime Minister form a powerful new alliance with Barack Obama and the Chinese, with Mrs Merkel, France’s Nicolas Sarkozy and the rest of the EU on the other side. Britain, the U.S. and China angered the German and French by vetoing a multi-billion rescue package for Greece by the International Monetary Fund. They said Germany, France and other eurozone countries must reach deeper into their own pockets first. It led to angry exchanges, including another attack on Mr Cameron by Mr Sarkozy, who said the English ‘don’t understand Europe because you come from an island’. Demonstrators protest against job cuts in central London yesterday. Leading economic forecasters have warned that the eurozone crisis could push back Britain's economy by six years . Meeting: Last week's G20 summit failed to find a resolution for the eurozone's problems . The row came as the Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, who is clinging to power a day after narrowly winning a confidence vote from MPs, admitted his country was facing ‘critical times’ ahead of his attempt to push the EU’s bailout deal through parliament. Without the money - contained in an agreement hammered out by EU leaders on October 27 - Greece would go bankrupt by Christmas, leaving the country unable to pay the wages of public workers such as doctors, nurses and police officers. Mr Papandreou held talks with Greek president Karolos Papoulias in which he signalled his intention to form a ‘government of national unity’ focused on ratifying the deal, which offers loans and a write-off of Greece’s international debts in exchange for drastic spending cuts and other austerity measures. The prospect of further cuts to their living standards has led to strikes and protests on the streets of Athens. ‘Co-operation is necessary to guarantee for Greece and for our partners that we can honour our commitments,’ Mr Papandreou said. Under fire: George Papandreou's position as Greek prime minister hangs by a thread . Potential successor: Finance minister Evangelos Venizelos could take over from Mr Papandreou . Reports from Athens last night . suggested that despite Mr Papandreou surviving the no-confidence vote, . he could be soon replaced by his finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos. Mr . Venizelos was at the centre of farcical scenes last week when Mr . Papandreou shocked his EU partners, and sent the financial markets into . turmoil, by calling for a national referendum on the deal that they . thought had already been agreed. Mr . Venizelos complained that he had not been consulted ahead of the . announcement, and was then admitted to hospital with stomach pains. He publicly criticised the referendum decision, cranking up the pressure that led Mr Papandreou to later abandon the plan. Mr Papandreou won Friday’s late-night, knife-edge confidence vote by 153 votes to 145. The markets will be watched nervously for their reaction when they open tomorrow after another weekend of economic turmoil. The bond market – which determines . the interest charged to  governments – has been particularly influential . in determining the pace of the crisis. Italian borrowing costs have soared in particular, with the interest on ten-year loans now priced at more than 6.3 per cent. Defiant: David Cameron opposes an IMF bailout for the troubled eurozone . Anything . over six per cent is said to signal that a government is heading for a . default on its debts and tends to lead to a knock-on rise in the . interest rates charged to other vulnerable economies, such as Spain and . Portugal. Italian and . French banks are heavily exposed to the sovereign debt problems in . Athens and Rome, and have seen their share prices slide steeply . throughout the year. If major institutions collapsed it could have a domino effect on dozens of other banks, including those in the UK. Mr . Cameron is determined to stand by his refusal to approve an IMF rescue . for Greece until the EU finalises plans for its own bailout. ‘How can the world economy do this kind of thing when Europe cannot sort out its problems?’ said a senior Government source. ‘We were ready to back the IMF deal but the Germans must do more to push the EU deal. Something has got to give.’ Another British source said the Germans’ reluctance to go further in helping out Greece stemmed partly from their fear that it might trigger a repeat of Thirties-style hyper-inflation in Germany that fuelled the rise of Adolf Hitler. And it is believed that Mrs Merkel fears a backlash from German  voters if they are asked to give more money to prop up countries such as Greece. If a UK-backed multi-billion IMF rescue goes ahead, Mr Cameron is ready to resist moves to block it by Eurosceptic Tory MPs. ‘Countries which give money to the IMF always get it back,’ said a  senior Whitehall aide. ‘If we gave £10 billion to the IMF it does not mean £10 billion less for schools and hospitals here. We would get it back.’ And Tory officials say there is no need for a Commons vote to approve any such deal, removing the threat of Conservative rebels teaming up with Labour to defeat Mr Cameron. The turmoil in Greece has increased expectations that the country will crash out of the eurozone, with chaotic knock-on effects for economies across the continent. Chancellor George Osborne has admitted that the return of the drachma would be ‘pretty traumatic’ for the UK. Treasury officials have been ‘war gaming’ about how to best protect the British economy if that happens. ‘The British Government prepares for all contingencies. You would expect us to do that. It is our responsibility to the British people,’ Mr Osborne said. ‘We are dealing with our debts, dealing with our situation, but we are also planning and prepared for whatever the world and whatever the eurozone throws at us.’","German Chancellor warns 500million population will suffer for years to come .

"BBC director-general George Entwistle, offered a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to the alleged victims of Sir Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse . The BBC could be sued for millions of pounds as the scandal around the Jimmy Saville sex claims grew even larger. The former Top Of The Pops presenter has been accused of a slew of vile crimes, including sexually assaulting hospital patients while they lay in their beds, having sex with underage girls, and molesting youngsters. A number of alleged victims have contacted lawyers and could sue any institution that is discovered to have links with Savile's alleged crimes, it was reported. A partner at Farleys Solicitor told The Sun that the costs could mushroom into millions of pounds worth of compensation. He said: 'You are looking at a potential cost of millions.' Liz Dux, a partner at Russell Jones & Walker, is representing some of the alleged victims of Jimmy Savile. The personal injury lawyer, who specialises in abuse cases, said 'a couple' of women had sought legal advice. 'They may well have grounds to sue on . the principles of vicarious liability,' Dux said. 'If Savile was acting . as an employee or agent of the BBC or a health organisation, then that . organisation with whom he had a close connection can be held vicariously . liable. Dux added that the women were not motivated by compensation. 'What motivates people is not money,' she said. The developments came after a TV . director who allegedly reported Savile to BBC bosses decades ago – when he caught . the star having sex with a 15- or 16-year-old girl in his dressing room – . revealed he was ignored. David Nicolson, 67, who had been a . director on Jim’ll Fix It, said he made several attempts to expose . Savile to the BBC, but was told: ‘That’s Jimmy’ and ‘that’s the way it . goes’. On Mr Nicolson’s claims, a BBC . spokesman said: ‘We have been disturbed to hear these allegations. 'Sexual predator': The BBC could be forced to pay compensation if they are found to be linked to the claimns that Jimmy Savile molested children . 'All . staff past and present who have any information relating to allegations . of this kind should raise them with the BBC’s internal investigations . unit or the police.’ Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party . chairman, told BBC1’s Question Time it ‘seems unimaginable’ people at . the BBC were unaware of the child abuse allegations. The police investigation into Jimmy . Savile’s abuse of youngsters has tripled in scale to 340 separate lines . of inquiry, Scotland Yard revealed. There are now 40 potential victims and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s reign of child abuse. It . prompted the BBC’s Director General to issue his second grovelling . apology of the week – and announce a total of three independent . inquiries. George Entwistle offered a ‘profound and heartfelt apology on behalf of the BBC to every victim’. He . added: ‘I have made clear my revulsion at the thought that these . criminal assaults were carried out by someone employed by the BBC and . that some may have happened on BBC premises as well as, we now discover, . in hospitals and other institutions.’ Stoke Mandeville Hospital in . Buckinghamshire says it is 'shocked' by the claims made by former patients . Celebrities . and former BBC staff potentially face arrest for alleged sex offences . as police hunt accomplices of Savile’s four decades of attacks. He is . alleged to have raped and molested children as young as ten. The reported potential law suits follow the revelation that he was given his own keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital. It also comes as former patients Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Leeds General Infirmary claim they too were vulnerable to Savile's predatory assaults. Scotland Yard has branded Savile a . ‘predatory sex offender’ who preyed on children as young as 13 for four . decades in a nationwide campaign of abuse. Buckinghamshire . Healthcare NHS Trust, which is responsible for Stoke Mandeville, said . it was supporting the police inquiries and would take further action ‘if . their findings suggest that we do need to’. It also said it had advised . staff to contact police if they had any concerns. West . London Mental Health Trust, which covers Broadmoor, said it had not . received any allegations of abuse from patients, their representatives . or from staff, but would co-operate with police if they investigated.

In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cameron expressed frustration at the Algerian handling of the crisis and failure to accept help. ‘I was disappointed not to have been informed of the assault in advance,’ he said. ‘I offered UK technical and intelligence support – including from experts in hostage negotiation and rescue – to help find a successful resolution.’ Of the SAS, Mr Cameron said: ‘They are on standby, hostage-negotiating experts and other sorts of technical expertise that we can provide.’ The Prime Minister said Britain would help lead a ‘robust security response’ to the crisis and ‘will do everything we can to hunt the people down who were responsible’. Lucky: Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Youcef Yousfi (centre) visits an injured hostage at a clinic - 10 UK hostages are still thought to be held captive . Rescued: One of the rescued workers speaks with Yousfi. David Cameron will be hoping to be in a similar position with the UK captives in the future . He held talks with US defence secretary Leon Panetta in Downing Street yesterday to coordinate an intelligence effort to locate Belmokhtar who is dubbed the Marlboro Man because he raises funds for terrorist atrocities by smuggling cigarettes. Mr Panetta said that the terror gang ‘will have no place to hide’. A bounty on the Blood Battalion leader’s head – currently $100,000 – is expected to be put up to $1million – around £700,000. Mr Cameron yesterday chaired two meetings of the Cobra crisis committee and spoke twice to his Algerian counterpart Abdelmalek Sellal, their fourth and fifth conversations since the terrorists struck on Wednesday. The Foreign Office flew some victims of the crisis home yesterday and sent a crisis response team to Algiers. MI6 officers and Metropolitan Police hostage negotiators were travelling to the scene last night. The Algerian government said that 98 out of 132 foreign hostages held were safe, leaving 34 unaccounted for. But some reports put the number missing as high as 60. Anger: Prime Minister David Cameron has spoke of his disappointment at the way the Algeria crisis has been dealt with so far as he prepares to send the SAS in . Hunt is on: U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has pledged that Belmokhtar will 'have no place to hide' Freed hostages revealed yesterday how Algerian forces had launched their attack on the heavily armed militants with a blitz from helicopters on five jeeps carrying foreign workers and their abductors. Four of the jeeps suffered direct hits – one is said to have burst into flames and another was blown several feet into the air. There were few survivors and witnesses said bodies were ‘everywhere’. But as a fierce gun battle broke out, the fifth jeep crashed allowing some of those held with explosives belts around them to make a break for freedom. The Secret Intelligence Service and MI5 are also examining the possibility that one of the terrorists is British after reports that a man speaking impeccable English was among the hostage takers. Many of the foreign workers hid throughout the drama – three Britons climbed into the ceiling of a canteen – to evade the terrorists as they searched for more captives. Questions: The attack suggests either a lapse in stringent security at the base, or an emboldening of Islamist insurgents . Remote: The In Salah gas project is located in the Sahara desert in Algeria. Although the desert complex was heavily guarded, it is vulnerable to attack due its lone proximity . Last night seven military helicopters were said to be searching in the desert with floodlights while making appeals to terrified gas workers they believe are still in hiding. Algeria claimed their special forces had captured one terrorist alive and he said the group were 32 strong and under the command of Belmokhtar. It was claimed last night that a video from Belmokhtar would be released in which he would offer to free American hostages in exchange for Egyptian Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and Pakistani Aafia Siddiqui. Both are in jail in the US on terrorism charges. Belmokhtar also apparently calls on the French and Algerians to negotiate an end to the war in northern Mali. MI6, GCHQ and the CIA have all been tasked with finding Belmokhtar. GCHQ and the American NSA listening stations will use satellite and electronic surveillance and voice match software to locate him. That would pave the way for a drone strike on his hideout.

"The father of the man charged with brutally murdering four people at a Washington mansion calls the crime 'egregious and heartless' and hopes whoever committed the crime 'will suffer the consequences'. Dennis Wint said in a statement that it pains him that his son, Daron, is charged, but he doesn't discuss his son's guilt or innocence. Daron Wint is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of parents Savvas and Amy and 10-year-old Philip Savopoulos, along with housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa. Dennis Wint (left) said in a statement that it pains him that his son, Daron (right), is charged, but he doesn't discuss his son's guilt or innocence . This is the moment Wint was arrested on Thursday night after police tailed his car for five miles . Company CEO Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife Amy, who were found murdered in their Washington D.C. mansion two weeks ago, were remembered in an obituary . Slain: Philip Savopoulos, ten, left, was also found dead with housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa, 57, right . Authorities say in court papers that they believe others were involved. Wint is the only person charged currently. As first reported by The Washington Post, Dennis Wint says his family and friends grieve the 'tragic and senseless loss' but they didn't know the victims. He also says 'we hope that whoever committed these heinous crimes - my son included - will suffer the consequences of their actions.' The Savopoulos family is being described as always willing to help those less fortunate. Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife Amy, their 10-year-old son Philip and housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa were slain in their home after being held captive for 18 hours on May 14. Ex-convict Wint has since been charged in connection with their deaths after he allegedly tortured Mr Savopolous into getting a $40,000 ransom delivered to the home. They are now being remembered in a touching and poignant obituary that recalls the last time Phillip and his two sisters, Abigail and Katerina, were together watching Finding Nemo. 'They are remembered for their devotion to family and charitable efforts for the less fortunate,' read the obituary in The Washington Post. Abigail and Katrina were away at boarding school at the time of the tragedy. 'Abigail and Katerina doted on their little brother Philip. The three siblings took an active interest in each of the others lives and were always eager for opportunities to spend time together,' reads the obituary. 'Watching movies together was a favorite pastime. Most recently the three cuddled together to watch a favorite movie, Finding Nemo. 'This was a family that maintained an unusually close bond for each other and for those less fortunate.' The obituary also says that the martial arts center that was set to open the day after the murders was part of a lifelong dream. Police vehicles are seen outside the $4.5 million fire-damaged home where the family and their housekeeper were found killed a two weeks ago in Washington, DC . The four bodies were found on the burned-out second floor of the home, which smelled like gasoline, according to court documents . 'His love for the martial arts started at the young age of seventeen and it was his dream to have a Japanese style center both in architecture and spirit of teaching traditional Japanese martial arts,' it reads. As for the mother of the family; 'Amy was extremely charismatic and had a huge heart. 'To her family and many friends, Amy represented the same loyalty and devotion, integrity, compassion, and courage as Savvas-values and behaviors they instilled in their children.' The family's funeral is taking place at the St. Sophia Greek Orthodox church they regularly attend at noon on June 1. Amy and Savvas were known in their local community for being active in a number of charities. They were known in their neighborhood as regular parishioners and maintained strong ties with Greece. According to charging documents, Wint and his alleged accomplices held the American Iron Works CEO and his family captive for at least 18 hours in their home on Embassy Row, near Joe Biden's property. Police believe Wint, a former American Iron Works employee, captured the family at around 6pm. Two pizzas were delivered to the property at 9.15pm. At 9am the next day, Mr Savopoulos called his assistant asking that $40,000 be withdrawn from his Bank of America account and delivered to the house. By midday, the house was ablaze. The affidavit says Mr and Mrs Savopoulos and Ms Figueroa were stabbed to death, Philip died in the fire. Police identified Wint as a suspect after finding a half-eaten pizza at the scene, with his DNA on the crust. Wint was arrested on Thursday, a week after the quadruple homicide, after reportedly paying a New York taxi driver $1,000 to drive him back to the capitol from Brooklyn, where he was staying with his girlfriend. Police attempted to detain Wint at a motel in Prince George's County, Maryland, but when they arrived he was in a vehicle bound for D.C., driving in convoy with a box truck. The officers followed the convoy for five miles before cornering the vehicles and detaining Wint along with four others, who have since been released. Domino's told police their delivery worker arrived at the property at 9.15pm with two pizzas - a whole cheese and a pepperoni. The worker was instructed to leave the pizzas on the porch, ring the doorbell and leave. The next day, after fire fighters were called to the burning home, detectives found the whole cheese pizza untouched, and about three quarters of the pepperoni pizza left half-eaten in the box. It was by running tests on this pizza that detectives found Wint's DNA and named him as the prime suspect.","Dennis Wint said in a statement it pains him that his son is charged .

"Still patron: Esther Rantzen denies rumours she will be removed as patron of a charity for victims of child abuse after claims she failed to act on Jimmy Savile allegations . Esther Rantzen has strenuously denied rumours she is facing the sack as patron of a child abuse charity after she failed to act on allegations that Jimmy Savile molested youngsters. Ms Rantzen, a patron of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), had said earlier that some in broadcasting 'blocked their ears' to the claims against the Jill'll Fix It star 18 years ago. Founder of NAPAC, Peter Saunders told . The Sun today: 'In the light of her admission that she heard rumours . about Savile but did nothing, I am going to ask the trustees if they . feel she is an appropriate patron.' But speaking to MailOnline today, in light of the comments made by Mr . Saunders, Ms Rantzen said he had told her the trustees would simply 'discuss the whole subject of adult survivors' and 'there was no . change to her position'. She said she had received a long email . from Mr Saunders on Friday assuring her that she would remain the . charity's patron. Ms Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, earlier said: 'I had a long email correspondence with the chief executive of . NAPAC - friend and colleague - Peter Saunders and he assured me that I . have not been removed as a patron. 'Peter Saunders has told me that the rumour that I have been removed as a patron is untrue. 'Certainly . last night (Friday) he said he was exhausted and emotional in his email . but was absolutely supportive of both me and ChildLine. 'At the end of the day it is their (the trustees) decision if they remove me as patron, that's for them to decide.' The . rumours surrounding Savile claim that he molested underage children and abused sick children in their . hospital beds. The Sun also claimed that Ms Rantzen's photo and details had been removed from NAPAC's website. Ms Rantzen said today she didn't know anything about her photo being removed from the website. She told MailOnline: ‘The only . information I have had came from chief executive Peter Saunders, who . said, in direct quotes, “I think probably the trustees will have to . discuss the whole subject of adult survivors because they have been . inundated with calls”. ‘There is no change to my position, he very kindly said “the children have got ChildLine and you, thank god”. Esther Rantzen with Jimmy Saville, pictured in 1988 . The claims come as a woman said she confided in Ms Rantzen about Savile, but nobody acted on her concerns, it was reported. Shy Keenan, 49, who founded Phoenix . Survivors, a charity that supports child sex abuse victims and their . families, says she heard the rumours and believed she a had a 'duty' to . raise the alarm and so told Ms Rantzen after they were introduced through a sex offender specialist. Ms Rantzen told the MailOnline how . she had 'absolutely no recollection' of meeting Shy Keenan, who claimed . she spoke up about the claims against the Jim'll Fix It star 18 years . ago. Ms Rantzen, 72, said: 'If it's true I'm afraid I have absolutely no recollection of the conversation with her (Ms Keenan). But she did concede that she had . 'literally had hundreds of conversations about child abuse but I'm sure I . do not remember meeting this woman'. She said: 'But I'm afraid that in my television life I did meet thousands of people.' 'It . could have been after a program... It said in The Sun that Ray Wyre . [the pioneering probation officer who worked with paedophiles] . introduced us and I did know him very well.' Shy Keenan claims she tried to warn Ms Rantzen about the predatory presenter but Ms Rantzen says she had 'absolutely no recollection' of meeting her . She added today: 'I find it very disappointing . that Shy Keenan did not discuss any concerns she had with me first.' When asked if she had any regrets . about claims she didn’t follow up on any information from Shy, she . said: ‘Rumours are not something you can act upon.’ Ms Rantzen had said earlier that she was 'fooled' by Jimmy Savile into . thinking he was a saint, and berated herself for ignoring rumours that . swirled around the star at the time. She said: ''I felt to blame. I felt . Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, . even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became . untouchable.' Ms Keenan had told The Sun newspaper earlier: 'I was shocked by what I had heard so I thought I would tell Esther about it.' Ms Keenan says following the conversation with Ms Rantzen, during which she suggested ideas about to help victims like herself, nothing was done. Ms Rantzen said: 'I think it is very disappointing... I . would've hoped she could've picked up the phone and talked to me because . it says in The Sun that if she had any more information than that about . the Jimmy Savile rumours I would have urged her to take it to the . police. 'I am very disappointed about what this lady has said, I never worked with her.' She told The Sun: 'I do not believe she ever named Jimmy Savile or any other perpetrator .' Ms Rantzen founded ChildLine, a 24-hour confidential helpline that takes more than a million telephone calls a year providing free counselling for children to discuss abuse and neglect, in 1986. Ms Rantzen, who presented TV show That’s Life, announced she would stand against Margaret Moran in Luton South as an ‘anti-sleaze’ candidate after allegations the MP had fiddled with Government expenses. Ms Rantzen launched her campaign in July 2009 but lost her deposit in the 2010 general election. The fresh claims come as Scotland Yard revealed the investigation into Jimmy . Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale to 340 separate lines . of inquiry, Scotland Yard revealed last night. There are now 40 potential victims and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s reign of child abuse. A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them . It . prompted the BBC’s Director General to issue his second grovelling . apology of the week – and announce a total of three independent . inquiries. Celebrities and former BBC staff . potentially face arrest for alleged sex offences as police hunt . accomplices of Savile’s four decades of attacks. He is alleged to have . raped and molested children as young as ten. As well as the BBC, three NHS . hospitals, a former children’s home in  Jersey and a now-defunct school . in Surrey are accused of giving him free rein to attack children. Some . victims have named people ‘around Savile’ as being complicit in his . abuse. Mr Entwistle . revealed that police warned him last week they would pursue ‘live . active criminal investigations’ against suspects. The . BBC chief's apology comes as a slew of patients from Broadmoor mental . hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Leeds General . Infirmary claim that the the former Top Of The Pops host abused them. Founder: Ms Rantzen, who presented on television show That's Life, founded ChildLine in 1986 . Savile boasted about 'having his own bedroom' at the mental hospital and having a set of keys to the unit. The gold-plated set was presented to the . predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him . access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed. Now the Department of Health has . launched an inquiry into how Savile was appointed a role in overseeing . the management of Broadmoor hospital, where he is accused of molesting . patients in their beds. A spokesman said: 'We will investigate the Department of Health's conduct in apparently appointing Savile to this role. 'Although . the framework for child protection and safeguarding for Broadmoor and . other Special Hospital patients changed radically in 1999, we of course . want to establish the circumstances and see if any lessons can be . learned. The Department of Health will launch an inquiry into how Savile came to be appointed to Broadmoor's taskforce . 'In hindsight he should very obviously not have been appointed. 'Had anyone involved in the appointment been aware of allegations of abuse against Savile, we would not have expected him to have been appointed.' The spokesman stressed that they were not investigating individuals' claims that the presenter sexually abused them. Ms Rantzen said that since the allegations against Savile have come to light, more people have called Childline to speak about their own child abuse experiences. She said: When the documentary came out I received lots of calls from people saying how can you say such things about a great man? 'Now lots more people are talking about their own experiences of child abuse in general.'","Rantzen is a patron of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood .

"The Gospel of St Luke was actually written by Jesus' mother, Mary, making it the first female book in the Bible, a writer has claimed. Dr Adam Bradford believes the document people have come to know as the Third Gospel began life as a legal defence document in a trial. Luke, a Greek physician, was tasked with writing a letter of support for St Paul who was imprisoned in Rome for the political crime of supporting Jesus. The Gospel According to Luke (pictured in a folio from one of the oldest extant New Testament manuscripts in Greek) was actually written by Jesus's mother Mary- making it the first female book in the Bible, a London historian has claimed . Dr Bradford, who also works as a GP and lives in Blackheath, London, claims Luke needed to find out who Jesus of Nazareth was and turned to the one person who would know, Jesus's elderly mother Mary. His claims emerge in the most sacred week of the Christian calendar, Holy Week, when believers reflect on the days leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. The amateur historian said: 'Key information about Jesus' birth and childhood in the Gospel of Luke could only have come from Mary"". 'As she was the only surviving eye-witness of those events when Luke was writing. 'Records at that time were almost . exclusively male, yet Luke's manuscript is overwhelmingly female, and . his early information was witnessed by one person and one person only, . Mary, the mother of Jesus. Dr Bradford, from Blackheath, claims Luke needed to find out who Jesus of Nazareth was and turned to the one person who would know, Jesus' elderly mother Mary. Pictured is a tapestry in Rome depicting Mary and the baby Jesus . The Gospel of Luke is the third and longest of the four Gospels. The gospel provides an account of the life  of Jesus, from his birth to his ascension. The preface states that the reason behind the gospel is to provide an historical account, while bringing out the theological significance of the history. Dr Adam Bradford believes the document . people have come to know as the Third Gospel began life as a legal . defence document in a trial. Luke, a Greek physician, was tasked with . writing a letter of support for St Paul who was imprisoned in Rome for . the political crime of supporting Jesus, he said. 'All of the other players were long since dead. 'Only Mary had the knowledge and only Luke's Gospel provides them. 'Luke, a Roman physician, must have gone to the mother of Jesus.' Dr Bradford drew his conclusions after studying and comparing the original Greek and Hebrew scriptures. In his book, 'Luke's Gospel - as told by Mary', he claims that the number of feminine words contained in the scripture give away the true author. The doctor, who runs an NHS practice in inner-city London, added that the writing also suggests Mary was far from being an uneducated peasant girl and was instead well-educated. 'Of the Gospel biographies of Jesus, Luke's stands head and shoulders above the others in terms of feminine references,' he said. 'While the Gospel of Mark has a feminine word content totaling 116, Luke has more than double that at 247. St Luke (pictured here in a stained glass window in Coulommiers, France) was tasked with writing a letter of support for St Paul who was imprisoned in Rome for the political crime of supporting Jesus, claims Dr Bradford . 'Luke was being informed by a woman, and given the number of ""widow"" references - nine as compared to John's Gospel's none - most likely a woman who had been widowed.' 'Luke's opening content points to one widow in particular, Mary, the wife of Joseph and mother of Jesus. 'Far from being an uneducated peasant girl, Dr Bradford's analysis of Mary's song ""The Magnificat"" in the original Greek manuscript reveals separate quotations from each section of the Bible of her day, numbering ten in total, showing that she had, unusually for the time, been well-educated.' His newest book follows on from his revolutionary claims that Jesus was the son of a middle-class, highly educated architect, disputing the previous theory he worked as a carpenter. Dr Brandord added: 'The first-century was a male-dominated world. My aim is to give Mary the credit she deserves. Without her Luke would have had much less of a story to tell.' It's a somewhat different version of the greatest story ever told. Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect. The claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30  -  the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus's life, when little is known about him  -  he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea. The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience. Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background. He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character. Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son.","Dr Adam Bradford believes third Gospel was originally a legal document .

"More than a year after George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges for killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, he and his family still live in a state of  secrecy paranoia - believing their lives are in constant danger. A new interview with the Zimmermans reveals that the family is still reeling from the intense national attention that focused on George after he shot 17-year-old Martin and claimed self defense. George's brother Robert to GQ magazine that the family is still holed up in a secluded house in central Florida. They learned CIA tactics from watching the Ben Affleck film 'Argo,' and Secret Service-style threat identification from a documentary about the assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan. The family also has a color-coded threat system they used at the house: Code Blue means police are at the door, Code Brown means 'draw your weapons.' Code Black: 'Come out guns blazing.' CNN agreed to put George Zimmerman and his brother up in the Ritz-Carlton for an interview. But when the $3,600 bill came through, a producer for the network intially refused to pay and called them 'evil,' Robert Zimmerman Jr. caims . Standing by him: George's little sister Grace (left), his father Robert (second from left) and his mother Gladys (second from right) are still living in a world of fear and paranoia after George's acquittal . Robert Zimmerman Jr, George's openly-gay brother, has been the spokesman for the family . Robert, who believes his 30-year-old brother is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, has also come up with a number of get-rich-quick schemes over the past two years. His ultimate aim was reportedly to capitalize on Zimmerman's notoriety by turning him into a reality TV star - like other celebrities have done in the past. He cited John Walsh, who began hosting America's Most Wanted after his young son was abducted and killed, and Kim Kardashian, whose leaked sex tape propelled her to fame, as examples. 'I learn a lot from ""Keeping up with the Kardashians,""' Robert told GQ. Robert also had an idea for a security company - Z Security Products, that would sell branded home security devices including the Z Bar, the Z Rock and the Z Light. The latter is a flashlight designed by George that had an alarm that would shout 'Help me! Help me!' 'They're all targeted at women,' Robert said. George Zimmerman and his brother, Robert, were also accused of being ‘evil’ after they ran up a $3,600 hotel tab while staying at the Ritz-Carlton on the tab of CNN. Prior to George Zimmerman’s 2013 acquittal on second degree murder charges related to the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon, the news network had agreed to fund the brothers stay at the hotel in Miami in exchange for an exclusive interview. But then a CNN producer accused the Zimmerman brothers of shamelessly taking advantage of their offer to pay for two hotel rooms for three nights and ‘everything’ else they needed. At the end of their stay, CNN was given a $3,600 tab that included a large room service bill, spa treatments and ‘swag’ from the gift shop, according to GQ. When the bill was sent to a CNN producer, he reportedly told Robert Zimmerman, ‘You and your brother are evil!’ The brothers stand accused of emptying minibars, getting their clothes laundered, making several trips to the spa, treating a party of ten to dinner at the hotel restaurant, and even buying good – including bracelets and bath fizzies – from the hotel gift shop. The hotel manager threatened to call the police, until CNN eventually agreed to settle the large bill. Robert Zimmerman was reportedly so upset over the incident that he retired to his room shaking after his conversation with the CNN producer. ‘He wrapped all the blankets around him, ordered shrimp, chain-smoked cigarettes, got roaring drunk. Nothing helped. He called his mother in a panic. “I can’t get warm,” he sobbed. “I just can’t get warm,”’ according to the GQ profile. CNN agreed to pay for the Zimmerman brothers to stay at the Ritz-Carlton in Miami for three nights in return for an exclusive interview . Next an inconsolable Robert attempted to call Dr Drew, the TV doctor, who he had met when he had appeared on Drew’s TV show shortly before his brother’s trial. Dr. Drew wasn’t available, but fortunately a producer for the show was able to talk Robert down from his frenzy. The next morning he returned the only purchases he could to the hotel store, namely a bottle of Mercedes-Benz cologne and a Ritz-Carlton wallet that his brother had bought him to say thanks. Zimmerman's parents, Gladys and Bob, and younger brother Robert spoke to GQ about their new life with the killer, who was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter last summer. The family, who describe themselves as 'victims', said they already owned at least ten guns before Zimmerman  shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26, 2012. But they said as soon as his younger sister Grace saw the news report on her phone, she screamed, 'We need to get guns!', before buying a new Taurus pistol. As  violent threats flooded in and a $10,000 bounty was placed for Zimmerman's 'citizen's arrest', the family then decided they could no longer stay put. Zimmerman, who was not charged with murder until six weeks after the shooting, and his then-wife Shellie went to stay with a federal air marshal friend, while the rest of the family fled to Florida. Free man? George Zimmerman said he still lives in fear that he will be assassinated and has racked up a $2.5million debt from his legal bills . Robert, who bears a strong resemblance to his brother, was living in suburban Washington D.C. at the time and was seen as especially vulnerable. Following the shooting, a special agent from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reportedly told him he had been identified as a target, saying: 'You need to go, and you need to go now.' The family still live in a safe house in central Florida, where they rarely go out or see Zimmerman, fearing an attack from the public as payback for Mr Martin's killing. 'I am sure there are people, you know, some young kid that has nothing going for him, but he's able to get a pistol, wants to make a name for himself,' Bob, who often sleeps with a gun, told GQ. 'Maybe I'll kill one of the Zimmermans. Maybe George, maybe one of his family members. I'll be famous.' You know? That happens. And that's what worries me.' As well as living in fear, the family are reportedly battling financial issues, having spent around $35,000 on hotel rooms and safe houses, and Zimmerman owing $2.5million in legal fees. Victim: Trayvon Martin was shot by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator, on February 26, 2012 . Due to his notoriety, Zimmerman remains unemployed and reluctant to find a job, according to the magazine article, which is published in GQ's October edition. 'When your name, Social Security number, and everything is out on the Internet, it's hard to do anything,' said Bob. Since his acquittal, Zimmerman, who claimed he shot Mr Martin's in self defense, has faced several allegations of violence, including one by his ex-wife, who divorced him just weeks after the verdict. Angry: Following the shooting, the New Black Panther Party (pictured) put  a $10,000 bounty on Zimmerman . Bob said the former neighborhood watch co-ordinator's biggest fear is that he will now be charged with federal civil rights violations for killing Mr Martin. 'He's worried,' he said.

"The feeling is familiar and not entirely comfortable. I'm outside Starbucks, digging through my purse, pockets and handbag for some spare coins or - oh, please! - a stray £5 note. I want a latte, but I don't think I can afford one. I remember this feeling of counting the pennies - literally - only too well. But I thought I'd left it behind in my university days, when I'd had to eke out my allowance to see me through term. I didn't imagine I'd still be making these calculations over such trivial transactions aged 43. It turns out I have the misfortune to be part of the first generation that can expect to be worse off than their parents. Struggling to stay afloat: Ursula in the kitchen of her £1m home - but she says she's not a wealthy woman . There's even a name for us: we're the 'dumpies', the downwardly mobile, urban middle-aged people. But curiously, I find myself in another category entirely: a dumpy who is hiding behind a facade of opulence. For, as I shuffle home, without my latte, I turn the key in the door of a five-bedroom house worth £1 million. To anyone looking on, I am a wealthy woman. But the hole in my bank balance tells another story. Yes, I live in a lovely house in a nice area of North London, but unless I sell up there will be no money in my threadbare pocket. With the mortgage market tightened up as it is, it would be virtually impossible for our family to move anyway, as we would never get a loan to buy a new house. Since last April - the month we completed on our house - lending is based strictly on what you earn and your outgoings, not the size of your deposit or the equity in your home. As such, it would be impossible for us to get a mortgage with our finances as they stand. While our mortgage repayment is fixed at £2,000, factor in bills, food, loans and the general upkeep of four growing boys and it adds up to more than £4,000. My husband, Mike, runs his own business, so his income can fluctuate hugely, while my earnings as a freelance writer are unpredictable. Add to this the fact our savings were wiped out by buying and renovating our house and we can never be sure we will earn enough to support our family from one month to the next. From the outside we might look like a prosperous, middle-class family, but underneath we are paddling madly to keep the whole thing afloat. I know I won't get much sympathy, but we didn't buy this house for its status. We simply wanted a home where our four boys - Jacob, 11, Max, nine, and five-year-old twins Jonah and Zachary, - could each have their own room, like we did. We've spent six months renovating it from a wreck that had lain untouched for 40 years. Ursula and her husband Mike need a big home so their four sons can all have a room of their own . Much-needed family home: The couple drained their savings to buy and renovate the house in North London . During this time, I was unable to work much due to ill health, and my husband's sports equipment business suffered as we focused on the demanding - and costly - build project. Unforeseen costs - such as the extension that turned out to have no foundations and had to be rebuilt for £20,000 - drained our savings and forced us to borrow way more than we'd planned. But I am not alone. While most of my contemporaries enjoyed all the perks of a middle-class upbringing in the Eighties - living in a spacious family house, private schooling and at least one foreign holiday a year - few of us can offer our children such luxuries. Take private school. Both my husband and I were privately educated, but with four sons, we always knew we couldn't do the same for them. Just the basics are hard enough to cover. Each month we are juggling funds to cover school dinners, never mind the music and riding lessons that were part of our childhoods. Our eldest son recently sat entrance exams for a place at our local grammar school. As we celebrated his success in passing, I am not sure we weren't even happier we could finally stop shelling out £45 a week for his tutor. My wardrobe comes from supermarkets and discount stores. Lavish: But Ursula said the money spent on their family home means they can't afford many other luxuries like holidays or a private education for their children . But it's not just me, as more often than not when I compliment a girlfriend on her new top or pair of boots she will reply: 'It was a steal at Primark.' As a child it was a simple pleasure to shop for groceries with my mum. My parents had a successful furniture import-export business, and we'd go to Waitrose to pick out fillet steak, fine wines and perhaps an elegant fruit tart for pudding. For me, Waitrose is strictly for the odd luxury. Our weekly shop is done scouring the shelves of Aldi for bargains. I know my mother never checked the price of a thing during her supermarket outings; I have to stick to a strict budget of £100 for our family of six. While I love my house, I will sometimes lie awake at night worrying whether we will be able to keep up the payments on the mortgage, which is almost half the value of our home. It just doesn't seem fair that hard working people should be condemned to penny-pinching thanks a toxic storm of sky-rocketing house prices, rising living costs and stagnating wages. Our parents never faced such financial challenges - in fact, for them providing a comfortable lifestyle seemed easy in comparison. Do I resent that? You bet I do! Different upbringing: Ursula and her husband (pictured skiing and at Disney World) had expensive holidays growing up but won't be able to afford for their children to do the same . When I look at their generation, I am green with envy. My in-laws still live in the detached, five-bedroom home in which my husband grew up. It is worth at least £1.2 million, but it set them back only £20,000. By the time they were my age, they had paid off their mortgage and sent both their boys to private school. Fees have quadrupled since 1990, from an average of £2,985 per year to £12,700 in 2014 - a prohibitive cost for most of my friends. My in-laws also enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle, going skiing and on exotic foreign holidays every year, and there was always a shiny sports car parked on the drive. Nowadays such a lifestyle is restricted to City big shots and foreign billionaires, a fact that is reflected at my husband's old school. Where his contemporaries were the children of lawyers, doctors, teachers and journalists, now the pupils are the sons of celebrities and Russian oligarchs. I am aware that I may sound like a whining privileged woman who has failed to manage her money, but it is a bitter pill to swallow that Mike and I will never be able to provide our children with the lifestyle we enjoyed. It seems painfully ironic to me that as I step out of the eye-wateringly expensive (£4,500 since you ask) bifold doors, into my beautiful garden, that I can't afford to replace the boots that are letting in dew from the lawn thanks to the holes in both the soles. But this is the badge of the growing band of property-rich and cash-poor middle-class families who hide their struggles to stay afloat behind the shiny front doors of their beautiful homes.","Ursula is a 'dumpy' - downwardly mobile, urban and middle-aged .

"Investigation: Bishop Mario Oliveri (pictured) has run the Albenga-Imperia diocese for the last 25 years . Pope Francis has ordered a secret sex inquiry into an Italian bishop who has presided over a diocese of 'playboy priests', it has been reported. An independent investigator has been called in to the Albenga-Imperia diocese in northern Italy, which has been rocked by scandal after scandal. Priests have variously been caught naked pictures of themselves on Facebook, having affairs with parishioners and moonlighting as barmen. Others, more seriously, have been investigated or convicted for child abuse. Pope Francis has sent an apostolic visitor to assess the capability of Bishop Mario Oliveri, who has been in charge for 25 years. The decision follows a primary investigation by a papal Nuncio sent in after Francis was warned about the wayward diocese, La Repubblica reported. The bishop is accused of having welcomed aspiring priests into the seminary without discernment, including former models, reality stars, priests with tattoos, bodybuilders and trainees who had been expelled from the seminary, generated a body of 'weak' priests, the newspaper reported. Among the worst scandals was Father Luciano Massaferro who was sentenced to 7 years 8 months for abuse of a minor. Another, a former competitor in an X-factor style competition, allegedly scammed parishioners out of Euro 200,000 intended for poor children. One priest in the diocese of Bastia Albenga was sacked for having an affair with a parishioner only to be replaced by one who was caught putting naked pictures on gay chat sites. Investigation:  The Vatican has sent an investigator to assess the capability of Bishop Mario Oliveri (pictured third from left with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI ) who has been in charge of the diocese since the late 1980s . The bishop did not respond to request for comment. But he has previously said that he is 'My community is open to everyone. No priest will ever be rejected: I think it's right to leave the 99 sheep to look for the lost one.' Pope Francis was alerted to the scandals earlier this year by a local doctor who handed him a dossier compiled by parishioners. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that the diocese 'may be expecting an apostolic visitor,' but would not disclose any further details. The supervisor is expected to be Alberto Maria Careggio, former bishop of Sanremo-Ventimiglia, the 77-year-old former mountain guide to John Paul II.","Independent investigators called to Albenga-Imperia diocese in Liguria .

"Amid the violence and political upheaval in Ukraine, a young female protester has told how she fell in love with a police officer after a stand-off in the capital Kiev. Lidia Pankiv, 24, said she had been one of the protesters out on the streets campaigning against corruption and demanding a change the day she met police officer Andrei. The journalist had been one of a group of women acting as a human shield and standing between the police officers and a group of protesters hoping that by their presence there they would stop the violence. Scroll down for video . A young Ukrainian woman protester who fell in love with a police officer after she and a group of female friends faced him unarmed in the capital Kiev . Journalist Lidia Pankiv, 24, had been one of the protesters out on the streets campaigning against corruption and demanding a change the day she met police officer Andrei . She said: 'We were up close to the police officers and I got a call from a friend, the officers were only just in front of us and she was asking me to help find a friend of hers that had been arrested. 'She wanted me to write something. I told her to call me, and I gave her the number she should call. I told her it twice as it was loud and there was shouting.' Instead of the call she was expecting, however, she got a text and it was not from a protester, it was from one of the police officers who had been standing in the police line opposite her. Andrei did not want to reveal his full name for fear of losing his job, but told her he wanted to marry her. He said that when he had seen her standing there defenceless and putting herself between armed men and those that she was trying to protect, he had been smitten. Andrei had been even more impressed when the police line had actually turned round and moved away. The short message said: 'Despite all the commotion I remembered your phone number when you gave it to your friend. I don't even know your name. 'I was standing in the night with a shield in front of you. When you stopped us from advancing, I realised that I want to marry you. Andrei.' Lidia Pankiv, 24, was one of a group of women acting as a human shield and standing between the police officers and a group of protesters hoping that by their presence there they would stop the violence . Human shield: Pankiv received a text from one of the police officers who had been standing in the police line opposite her . Independence Square in Kiev today, where people people flocked to protest against President Viktor Yanukovych before he stepped down . The first meeting was in front of the barricades on Maidan square, where surrounded by the wreckage of the battles they had their first date. She said: 'I was really surprised that the message and don't know why I agreed to meet him, I thought perhaps it might be possible to convince him that the side he was on was wrong and I certainly didn't expect to find myself falling in love with him. But when I saw him when I started to speak to him - that is what happened.' But the young woman's standing went even further when she was invited onto a local television station called Inter to talk about her love affair with the police officer from the other side. A demonstrator holds up a chain and a riot police shield as protestors clash with police in the centre of Kiev on January 22 . A portrait of Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is seen during a rally on Independence Square in downtown of Kiev today . When she found out that the broadcast was live she agreed, but left the host speechless after, instead of talking about her love for the police officer, she slammed the TV station for its coverage prior to the collapse of the government and for spreading lies about the protesters. She got a standing ovation from the audience, and said: 'You probably want to hear a story from me about how with my bare hands I restrained a whole riot unit, and how one of the officers fell in love with me, and I fell in love with him. 'It is true that I fell in love with the policeman that I met, but I'm going to tell you another story. I did use my bare hands when I met them, but it was not to fight them, it was so I could drag the bodies of those killed the day before and the day before that of the streets. It is about how two of my best friends killed peacefully protesting.' Referring to Ukraine's former president, she said: 'I can tell you how I hate Yanukovych and all those who carry out their criminal orders. 'I came here today only because I found out that this is a live broadcast. I want to say that I also despise Inter because for three months it deceived viewers and spread enmity among citizens of this country. And now you are calling for peace and unity. 'Yes, you have the right to try to clear your conscience, but I think if you really want to show how sorry you are you should run this program on your knees. 'I've brought these photos here for you, so that you see my dead friends in your dreams and understand that you also took part in that. And now, I'm sorry, I don't have time. I'm going to Maidan. Glory to Ukraine.' She then showed the pictures live on television before getting up and walking out - leaving the host speechless and the audience cheering and clapping. The young woman's story was first reported in December but was not excessively covered by local media which was still under the control of the government and where the policeman was in danger were his name to be made public. The only pictures of the couple together include his face pixelated and his surname has still not been made public. But the woman's story became front-page news after her television appearance where she turned the tables on her host.","Opposition protester Lidia Pankiv, 24, confronted riot police in Kiev .

"Ed Miliband is facing a battle to hold off Ukip in his own back yard today – as voters go to the polls in South Yorkshire to elect a new police commissioner. A defeat for Labour would be seen as a major blow for Mr Miliband whose Doncaster constituency lies in the South Yorkshire police force area. Today’s contest was sparked by the resignation of Labour’s previous police commissioner Shaun Wright – who stood down in the wake of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal, where an estimated 1,400 children were abused over 16 years by Pakistani gangs. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing a fight to hold off the growing Ukip threat in the party's heartlands . Ukip has exploited the child abuse scandal to attack Labour. Last week, the party launched a poster featuring a young woman with the slogan: ‘There are 1,400 reasons why you should not trust Labour again’. Nigel Farage told MailOnline the election was be close – despite his party finishing a distant fourth in the 2012 contest. He said: ‘It will be nip and tuck. We definitely feel that if we win this it will add fuel to the fire that from Birmingham northwards, if you vote Conservative you get Labour.’ Mr Farage hopes it can keep its current momentum going by securing the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner post following its recent by-election success in Clacton. Voters are going to the polls across the Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster - but the turnout is expected to barely top 10 per cent amid widespread disinterest. Ukip’s candidate for the position is the retired police officer Jack Clarkson. Labour has chosen retired Anglican priest Alan Billings as its candidate – in a bid to distance itself from the Rotherham scandal. A lone voter enters an empty polling station on Herringthorpe Valley Road, Rotherham today, which had seen only nine voters by 10.30am . An empty polling station in Brinsworth, Rotherham today , which had seen less than five voters by 10.30am . An empty mobile library being used as a polling station on Rotherwood Avenue, Rotherham today, which had seen only two voters by 11am . There will be almost as much interest in how many of the 1,010,599 electorate bother to cast their votes as there will be on which of the four candidates wins when the by-election result is announced in Barnsley tomorrow. Mr Wright's initial refusal to step down highlighted the fact that there was no way to get rid of a PCC unless they had committed an offence. The saga surrounding his future further undermined confidence in the new PCC system, which had been dented first by the record low turnouts in 2012, and provoked furious calls for the law to be changed or the post to be simply abolished. The Lib Dems have branded the coalition experiment with directly-elected commissioners a failure and pledged to scrap them. The party decided not to field a candidate in the by-election for this reason . Labour has declared it is committed to scrapping them if it wins power in 2015. Ukip leader Nigel Farage with the party's candidate for the position of South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Jack Clarkson (right) Mr Wright only resigned after weeks of pressure following the Jay Report which revealed how more than 1,400 children had been exploited by gangs of men in Rotherham. He was the councillor who oversaw children's services in the town between 2005 and 2010. But Labour's campaign to retain the post has been hampered by the controversy in Rotherham. Mr Farage has insisted Ukip can build the party's recent by-election victory in Clacton and close second in Heywood and Middleton by getting its first PCC elected. And his confidence has also been supported by strong Ukip showings in Rotherham's council elections this year and in the European elections in parts of South Yorkshire. But Ukip only came fourth when Mr Wright was elected in 2012. The English Democrats, came second two years ago and they believe they will still be the biggest rivals to Labour today's poll. Former police officer Jack Clarkson hopes to replace former Labour police commissioner Shaun Wright who stood down in the wake of Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal . Ukip has exploited the Rotherham child abuse scandal - where 1,400 children were abused - to attack Labour . English Democrats chairman Robin Tilbrook said his party has a high profile in South Yorkshire in the wake of it winning the Doncaster mayoral election in 2009 and pushing Labour hard in 2012. Four candidates have declared for the by-election: David Allen (English Democrats), Alan Billings (Labour), Jack Clarkson (Ukip), Ian Walker (Conservatives). Mr Allen came second to Mr Wright in the 2012 election. He is a trained foundry engineer and a sales manager from Doncaster who is married with two children. Dr Billings is a former deputy leader of Sheffield City Council and was once a parish priest in Sheffield. Mr Clarkson is leader of the Ukip group on Sheffield City Council. He is former police inspector in the city. Mr Walker is an engineer and a company managing director in Sheffield. He is married with four children. The turnout in South Yorkshire in 2012 was 14.93 per cent.","Defeat for Labour a major blow for Mr Miliband who is MP for Doncaster .

"Earnest Satterwhite had a history of traffic violations - but never violence . The killing of a unarmed black great-grandfather by a white police officer who shot him through his car door in the driveway of his own home is causing outrage in South Carolina. The fury grew again when prosecutors announced earlier this month that a grand jury in had handed down charges against North Augusta Public Safety Officer Justin Craven, 25 - but that he faces only a misdemeanor 'misconduct in office.' According to police reports, 68-year-old Ernest Satterwhite refused to pull over when Craven spotted him making a traffic violation in North Augusta on February 9. He led Craven and other officers on a nine-mile low-speed chase to his home in the next county. When Satterwhite finally stopped - in his own driveway - Craven ran up and fired several shots into the car door, fatally wounding him. Satterwhite's door was still locked. Investigators determined that North Augusta Public Safety Officer Justin Craven broke the law. A prosecutor, in a rare action against a police officer, sought to charge him with voluntary manslaughter, punishable by up to 30 years in prison. But the grand jury disagreed, indicting him on a misdemeanor. The debate over how police use force against unarmed people has become a national issue since an unarmed 18-year-old black man was shot to death in August by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, where unrest still lingers. But most police shootings make only local headlines, and just for a day or two. The refusal of authorities to release public information about these on-duty actions by taxpayer-paid officials is a big reason why. As with many such killings, Satterwhite's death in February remains shrouded in mystery. Video can make a difference: South Carolina gained the national spotlight last week after a dashboard camera showed how in just a few seconds Trooper Sean Groubert went from asking motorist Levar Jones for his license for a supposed seat belt violation, to shooting at him repeatedly without provocation, even as Jones put his hands in the air. Jones was hit once and is recovering. State Public Safety Director Leroy Smith called that shooting 'disturbing,' and Groubert was promptly fired and charged with felony assault. Sometimes, the video can exonerate officers: In August, a South Carolina prosecutor refused to file criminal charges against a York County deputy who wounded a 70-year-old man after mistaking his cane for a shotgun during an after-dark traffic stop. Using video, the sheriff showed how the cane's shaft could be mistaken for a gun barrel in the dim light. So far, 35 people were shot by police in South Carolina this year; 16 were killed. The state is on pace to surpass last year's total of 42 people shot by police. In Satterwhite's case, prosecutors won't say why they sought a felony charge against Craven, who chased Satterwhite for 9 miles, beyond city limits and into Edgefield County. Police initially claimed that Satterwhite had gotten out of his car before the shooting - though a police report later revealed that his door was locked when he was shot . Experts say it's the first time an officer was charged in a fatal shooting in roughly a decade. But the grand jury opted for 'misconduct in office,' a charge used for sheriffs who make inmates do their personal work, or officers who ask for bribes. Their single-page indictment, returned in August, contains no details other than accusing Craven of 'using excessive force and failing to follow and use proper procedures.' Black leaders were astonished that an officially unjustified shooting of an unarmed man should merit such a light charge. 'It diminishes the nature of the violation — of the death. This man's life is only worth a misdemeanor?' said state Representative Joe Neal, a Democrat who has spent decades speaking out against racism in law enforcement and demanding accountability through data and police cameras. Neal, who is black, also wants authorities to release evidence more quickly in police-involved shootings. Authorities often say doing so could taint potential jurors. Neal says that doesn't give people enough credit. The State Law Enforcement Division denied requests filed by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act to learn what evidence was gathered against Craven. Solicitor Donnie Myers, who is handling the case, didn't return phone calls. North Augusta Police, the Edgefield County Sheriff's Office and Craven's lawyer, Jack Swerling, declined to comment. The few details released raised concerns among law enforcement experts. In the likely 10 to 15 minutes he trailed Satterwhite, Craven should have had time to learn he was headed home and had no violent incidents on his criminal record, said University of South Carolina criminology professor Geoffrey Alpert. Police records show Satterwhite had been arrested more than a dozen times for traffic violations, most of them for driving under suspension or under the influence. Most of the charges led to convictions. He also was charged at least three times for failing to stop as officers tried to pull him over. But his record shows no evidence he ever physically fought with an officer. Edgefield County deputies who joined in the chase reported that Craven ran up to Satterwhite's parked car and fired several shots into the driver's side door, telling the other officers that Satterwhite tried to grab his gun. The other officers couldn't get Satterwhite's door open, so they broke the passenger side window, unlocked that door and dragged him out. 'Why would he run up to the car like that?' asked Alpert. 'Why would he put himself in a situation to use deadly force? Why would he put his gun close enough for him to grab it?' Satterwhite, who worked for years as a mechanic, liked to fish and was remembered by his family as a laid-back man who kept to himself, left behind six children, 16 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Seven months after the funeral, and eight days after his indictment, Craven was put on administrative leave — with pay. Satterwhite's family then sued the North Augusta Department of Public Safety, Edgefield County and its sheriff's office. The lawsuit alleges Craven ignored the Edgefield deputies' orders to stop and let them manage the chase when it entered their county, about 2 miles from Satterwhite's home. It claims Satterwhite never tried to grab the officer's gun when Craven fired five times, hitting him with four bullets — two in the chest. The family says the officers yanked the mortally wounded man out of the car, restrained him and left him on the ground unattended until paramedics arrived. Their lawyer, Carter Elliott, hopes to force authorities to release any video and other evidence. North Augusta's Public Safety Department has refused to release any details about Craven's history. City officials didn't make him available for interviews, and he didn't respond to emails. Police agencies hurt their own credibility when they withhold information, allowing rumors and speculation to fill the void, Alpert said. 'They work for us - the public,' Alpert said. 'You need to put as much accurate information out there as you can to get in front of the issue and create your own story.'","Ernest Satterwhite, 68, was gunned down by Officer Justin Craven after leading a low-speed chase to his home on February 9 .

"No show: Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson did not show up for court proceedings in the drug bust that earned him a police medal on Monday . The drug bust that earned Darren Wilson a police commendation may be thrown out since the officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown has been unable to testify while in hiding. When Wilson didn't show up in court on Monday, a judge approved the request by county prosecutors Monday to postpone the case of 28-year-old Christopher Brooks, who was arrested by Wilson in February 2013 on drug charges. Brooks' attorney wants the marijuana distribution charge dismissed because he doesn't expect Wilson to show up in court to testify. 'Wilson is compromised as a witness,' said defense attorney Nick Zotos, who opposed the request by Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch's office to shift the drug case to a panel that meets behind closed doors. The case is now going to a grand jury, but Zotos says he has talked with Wilson's attorneys who allegedly say he wouldn't attend either a preliminary hearing or grand jury hearing on the matter. Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch, told St Louis Today that Brook's case could not go to trial without Wilson as a witness. Wilson, 28, received a Ferguson City Council commendation for his role in Christopher Brooks' arrest. But Zotos said Brooks was 'roughed up' by Wilson after he refused to hand over the keys to a locked car parked in his grandmother's driveway, where Ferguson police say they found drug paraphernalia and several ounces of marijuana. Zotos also questioned whether Wilson's actions merited special recognition by the city. 'We give trophies every day for just showing up,' he said after the brief hearing. 'If you play on the team, you get a trophy.' Scroll down for video . Up in the air: Wilson has been identified as the police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown (left) earlier this summer. He was previously awarded a police commendation for arresting 28-year-old Christopher Brooks (pictured on Monday, right) in February 2013 on drug charges. Brooks' case remains in limbo while Wilson is unable to testify from hiding . And Zotos believes the case could be thrown out since Wilson was the main officer who made the arrest, with other officers only responding later and therefore ineffective witnesses for a court case. Brooks was pictured outside of court on Monday but he gave no comment. However he has spoken out on Facebook about the possibility the case may be dropped. Brooks has also claimed that Wilson 'beat my a** in my front yard while I was handcuffed then gave me 6 felonies.' The same grand jury also is reviewing evidence in the early August death of Michael Brown to determine whether Wilson should face criminal charges in a shooting that led to violent protests, hundreds of arrests, the summoning of the Missouri National Guard for security and international attention. McCulloch has said he expects the grand jury to complete its work on the Brown shooting by mid-October or early November, though its term has been extended until January. The assistant prosecutor, who did not publicly identify himself in court, did not indicate during Brooks' hearing why the county wants to shift the case to the grand jury. A McCulloch spokesman said later that he was not familiar with the case. Marching: Browns' death sparked protests in the city of Ferguson, where locals were outraged by the act of police brutality.

While rescuers were able to pull Mr Hardy’s girlfriend Jo to safely, they were forced to call off the search for the father-of-two due to the encroaching darkness. The security guard’s body was discovered close to Hendon Beach, Sunderland, on yesterday morning when the search was resumed at low tide. Mr Hardy’s dog made its way back to the beach after the ordeal and is thought to be unharmed. Mr Hardy’s family last night revealed that the 32-year-old could not swim, praising him for risking his life to save his beloved pet. His mother Michelle Taylor said: ‘He jumped in to get his dog even though he knew he was putting his life at risk.’ Two lifeboats, a helicopter and a search and rescue team from Humber Coastguard joined the search for Mr Hardy at the Sunderland beach . Coastguard crews scoured the water in a bid to find Mr Hardy after his girlfriend Jo was rescued . Mr Hardy’s sister Clare Hall also paid tribute, adding: ‘He went in for his dog because he had a big heart and just loved his animal.’ Posting a picture of him with his beloved caramel-coloured cocker spaniel on Facebook she thanked rescue services for their efforts. ‘Sadly we have lost our brother today.

Just knowing he didn’t suffer is the comfort our family need.’ The 32-year-old's body was discovered close to Hendon beach, pictured, yesterday morning . Mr Hardy was separated from the mother of his two children, aged 11 and 12, who have been informed of their father’s death. He had recently moved to Sunderland from Stockton-on-Tees with Jo, who he had only met recently. Former neighbour Joanne Roach, 43, said: ‘He was a really nice lad and it doesn’t surprise me he tried to save his dog because he loved it, it was a beautiful dog. ‘Alex was all about his kids too, he really loved them and my heart goes out to them and the whole family, they must be devastated.’ ‘I know he was happy as he’d started a new relationship with a girl from the Sunderland area.’ Mr Hardy’s dog made its way back to the beach after the ordeal and is thought to be unharmed . A spokeswoman for Humber Coastguard said: ‘Eyewitnesses who called 999 said they believed the two people went into the water after their dog who had got into trouble in the water. ‘The lifeboat crew had just finished another incident to the north of Hendon, when the call came in so they couldn’t have got there any quicker.’ James Jamieson, Sunderland Lifeboat operations manager, said: ‘Shortly after being called to an incident at Marsden, the volunteer crew were diverted to Hendon to begin searching for the man and woman. ‘We were stood down by the coastguard as it became dark, both lifeboats and all our volunteers returned to the station at 8.20pm. ‘Our thoughts are very much with the casualties and their friends and family.’","Alex Hardy was walking his dog along the seafront with his girlfriend .

"As a billionaire playboy who claims to have bedded 10,000 women, Cecil Chao has no doubts about his own sexuality. Now he is trying to dictate the sexuality of his children too. The 76-year-old property and shipping tycoon is offering a £40million ‘marriage bounty’ to any man who can win the heart of his lesbian daughter – and turn her straight. Definitely not single: Gigi Chao, right, and her partner Sean Eav, have been together for nine years and married in Paris in 2012 . He announced the reward after his daughter, Gigi, married her same-sex partner in France. Refusing to accept the gay union, he pledged the fortune to any potential male suitor able to walk the 33-year-old University of Manchester graduate down the aisle at a traditional wedding. Dismissed nuptials: Father Cecil Chao has dismissed 'false reports' of his daughter's lesbian nuptials and insists she is still single .

"A unique species of fish that has remained virtually unchanged for more than 300 million years could reveal the secrets of evolution after scientists decoded its genome for the first time. The Coelacanth is a sea-cave dwelling, five-foot long fish with limb-like fins. It was once thought to be extinct, until a living coelacanth was discovered off the African coast in 1938. Staff at the department of Fish Studies at the National Museum of Kenya display a coelacanth caught by Kenyan fishermen at the coastal town of Malindi in April 2001 . Coelacanths today still closely resemble the fossilised skeletons of their 300-million-year-old ancestors. Its genome confirms what many researchers had long suspected: genes in coelacanths are evolving slower than other organisms'. 'We found that the genes overall are evolving significantly slower than in every other fish and land vertebrate that we looked at,' said Jessica Alföldi, a research scientist at the Broad Institute and co-first author of a paper on the coelacanth genome, which appears in Nature this week. 'This is the first time that we've had a big enough gene set to really see that.' Researchers believe the slow rate of change may be because coelacanths simply have not needed to change: they live primarily off of the Eastern African coast (a second coelacanth species lives off the coast of Indonesia), at ocean depths where relatively little has changed over the millennia. 'We often talk about how species have changed over time,' said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, scientific director of the Broad Institute's vertebrate genome biology group and senior author. The Coelacantha is a sea-cave dwelling, five-foot long fish with limb-like fins . This 2008 image by the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History shows an African coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) 'But there are still a few places on Earth where organisms don't have to change, and this is one of them. Coelacanths are likely very specialized to such a specific, non-changing, extreme environment – it is ideally suited to the deep sea just the way it is.' Because of their resemblance to fossils dating back millions of years, coelacanths today are often referred to as 'living fossils', a term first coined by Charles Darwin. However, the team stress the coelacanth is not a relic of the past brought back to life. They say it is a species that has survived, reproduced, but changed very little in appearance for millions of years. 'It's not a living fossil; it's a living organism,' said Alföldi. 'It doesn't live in a time bubble; it lives in our world, which is why it's so fascinating to find out that its genes are evolving more slowly than ours.' Family tree: Coelacanth's closest relatives . The unique 'living fossil' has a 300-million-year fossil record, shown here. During the Devonian geological period, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish – like Eusthenopteron – exhibited a sequence of adaptations: . Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; . Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it up on to land . Acanthostega, which had feet with eight digits . Ichthyostega with limbs. Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species . The coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long-debated questions, such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land, including 'lobed' fins, which resemble the limbs of four-legged land animals (known as tetrapods). Another odd-looking group of fish known as lungfish possess lobed fins too. It is likely that one of the ancestral lobed-finned fish species gave rise to the first four-legged amphibious creatures to climb out of the water and up on to land, but until now, researchers could not determine which of the two is the more likely candidate. The coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long-debated questions, such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land . The coelacanth genome may hold other clues for researchers investigating the evolution of tetrapods. 'This is just the beginning of many analyses on what the coelacanth can teach us about the emergence of land vertebrates, including humans, and, combined with modern empirical approaches, can lend insights into the mechanisms that have contributed to major evolutionary innovations,' said Chris Amemiya, a member of the Benaroya Research Institute and co-first author of the Nature paper.","Coelacanth, a 5ft fish with limb-like fins, could give a glimpse into evolution .
First analysis of its genome show it is evolving slower than other animals .

"A nurse is facing the death penalty after she was found guilty of injecting dialysis tubes with bleach, killing five patients and injuring five more. Kimberly Saenz, 38, was last night found guilty of capital murder in the deaths and aggravated assault in the injuries at the DaVita Dialysis clinic in Lufkin, Texas. As her trial, which began on March 5, moves to the punishment phase, the mother-of-two will face either life imprisonment or the death penalty. Prosecutors had said they would seek the death penalty if she was convicted. Guilty: Kimberly Saenz, accused of killing five of her patients and injuring five others by injecting bleach into their kidney dialysis tubing, was found guilty of capital murder . Distress: Carla Mott, daughter of murder victim Cora Bryant, hugs her nephew Torrance Agnew after verdicts were read in the murder trial of Kimberly Saenz . Condemned: Kimberly Saenz, 38, will face either life imprisonment or the death penalty . Saenz was caught after a top fire . official wrote an anonymous letter pleading for state health department . inspectors to visit a clinic because of numerous calls for paramedics. The April 2008 letter said: 'In the last two weeks, we have transported 16 patients.This seems a little abnormal and disturbing to my med crews. Could these calls be investigated by you?' Within days, surveyors arrived. By that time, emergency crews had been called 30 times that month, including seven for cardiac problems. Four people had died. This was compared to just two calls during the previous 15 months, according to the Texas Department of Health Services. A review of clinic records by an . inspector found Saenz was on duty for 84 per cent of instances where . patients suffered chest pain or cardiac arrest. Victims: Thelma Metcalf, left, and Garlin Kelley, right, were both killed . Scene: In April 2008, two patients at the DaVita Dialysis Center said they saw Saenz inject bleach into tubing used by two patients who later died . On April 28, 2008, two dialysis patients said they did not feel well and two others reported that they saw Saenz inject bleach into tubing used by patients Marva Rhone and Carolyn Risinger. Patients visited the DaVita Dialysis clinic in Lufkin, Texas, for dialysis treatment, which is required to filter the blood when kidneys are no longer able to do so. In the treatment, blood is allowed to flow a few ounces at a time through a filter that removes wastes and extra fluids. The clean blood is then returned to the body. Traces of bleach were found in the dialysis tubing, which is made from a cellophane material and used to ensure a steady filtering flow of molecules to the patient. Ingesting significant quantities of bleach can lead to vomiting, respiratory problems and cardiac arrest. Prosecutors claimed Saenz injected these bags with bleach. Her defense team said that bleach is widely used in clinics and traces do not indicate Saenz put it there. They suggest someone else might have or that she is being used as a scapegoat for the clinic's mistakes. Saenz's attorneys argued that she and others used syringes rather . than measuring cups for bleach to ensure precise amounts were being used . for proper mixing of cleaning solutions. They said she was spotted . measuring bleach into a syringe because she wanted to put the right . amount into cleaning water. Former DaVita employees who testified for prosecutors told jurors that . they never used syringes instead of measuring cups to ensure the proper . amounts of bleach were being used in cleaning solutions. Saenz, who had held her entry-level position as a licensed vocational nurse for eight months, was sent home and fired the next day. A year later, an indictment listed sodium hypochlorite, also known as bleach, as the 'deadly weapon' used by Saenz to kill five people, including Rhone and Risinger. Saenz's lawyers previously said she had no motive to kill. 'Kimberly Saenz is a good nurse, a compassionate, a caring individual who assisted her patients and was well liked,' defense attorney T. Ryan Deaton said. He argued that Saenz was . being targeted by the clinic's owner for faulty procedures at the . facility, including improper water purification, suggesting . that officials at the clinic . fabricated evidence against her. Saenz didn't take the stand in her own defense. But in a recording played at trial, she could be heard testifying before a grand jury that she felt 'railroaded' by the clinic and 'would never inject bleach into a patient'. Prosecutors described claims Saenz . was being set up by her employer as 'absolutely ridiculous'. They described her as a . depressed and disgruntled employee who complained about specific . patients, including some of those who died or were injured. Saenz had sworn in an affidavit she had no previous felony record. But documents filed by Angelina County District Attorney Clyde Herrington listed about a dozen instances of wrongdoing. They included allegations Saenz overused prescription drugs, had substance abuse and addiction problems, was fired at least four times from health care jobs and put false information on an employment application, the AP reported. Clinic: Investigators were called to the clinic after a boom in emergency calls . Investigators examined blood . tubing, IV bags and syringes used by the DaVita patients, who visited the clinic to have their blood filtered. They testified that they found . Internet searches on Saenz's computer about bleach poisoning in blood . and whether bleach could be detected in dialysis lines. Saenz . told the grand jury she had been concerned about the patients' deaths . and looked up bleach poisoning references to see 'if this was happening, . what would be the side effects'. She was charged with one capital . murder count accusing her of killing as many as five patients, and with . five counts of aggravated assault for the injuries to the five other . patients. On the capital murder count, jurors could have found her guilty of the lesser charges of murder or aggravated assault.","Found guilty of capital murder in trial that began on March 5 .

"The family of a woman who went missing from Texas two weeks ago after returning from a two-year trip around the world revealed Thursday that she may have left voluntarily. Leanne Hecht Bearden, 33, was last seen January 17 when she told her in-laws in Garden Ridge near San Antonio that she was going for a walk. She has not been heard from since. The woman and her husband, Joshua Bearden, were staying with his parents after returning from their travels earlier this month. Missing: Leanne Hecht Bearden went for a walk in Texas and never returned . In a statement released on a Facebook page dedicated to Bearden's search, her relatives suggested that the 33-year-old woman may have left on her on accord because she was struggling to adjust to life in the U.S. ‘The pressure of transitioning from her two year trip back into what we consider ""normal"" life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,’ the statement read. ‘As a result of this investigation there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area, and we understand this is a strong possibility.’ The local police, sheriff's deputies, the Texas Rangers, a group of friends and volunteers have spent the past two weeks scouring Garden Ridge and its vicinity in search of Bearden, but to no avail, the station KENS5 reported. The theory that the 33-year-old globetrotter took off voluntarily has been supported by evidence found on her computers by private investigator Charlie Parker. Cracked under pressure? Bearden's family said the women may have left on her on because she could not handle the stress of adjusting to a normal life in the United States after her travels . Adventure: The couple pose on a Goa beach during their two-year round the world trip . Garden Ridge police reached a similar conclusion, adding that they have found nothing to suggest that Bearden was the victim of a foul play. Her husband, Josh Bearden, said that while his wife is fit and athletic, she is small in stature. The fear is that the woman may have been bitten by a snake or got injured. ‘Her mental and physical status is uncertain. We fear for her greatly,’ her relatives said. ‘If Leanne has indeed fled the area, she is extremely vulnerable. She left with only a few assets and is traveling very light.’ On Wednesday, the private investigator hired by the family released photos of two diamond rings worn by Mrs Bearden in hopes that someone might recognize them, Houston Chronicle reported. ‘If she's running, she might try to pawn them,’ Parker said. ‘And if someone else has them, they might try to pawn them.’ Earlier this week, Mr Bearden offered a message of hope for his missing wife. Heartbroken: Joshua Bearden made an emotional plea to try to find his wife. Her body was found Thursday . ‘Baby, don’t be scared. We’re looking . for you. And we’re never ever going to stop looking for you,’ Joshua . Bearden told Leanne through a TV camera lens. Bearden . was speaking out in hopes continued public interest in his wife’s . strange disappearance would help his cause, since police have now called . off the official search. ‘As far as any sort of search in the area, we’re on our own on that,’ he . said on Fox & Friends, one of several interviews he’s now done. ‘If . you see Leanne, let somebody know. Call the police. If you live in the . area… could you do me a favor and check out your property and see if . there is anything unusual out there?’ Bearden said he's still looking for his wife in the area of Garden Ridge, Texas where she disappeared and not just for her sake but also for his own. 'The second I lose my hope, Leanne is gone,' he told KSAT. 'My biggest fear is that I lose hope.' Travels: The couple had just returned to the U.S. after their journey around the world . Police and family members are . desperately searching for the 33-year-old woman recently returned from a . two-year, around-the-world trip who disappeared during a visit to . relatives in Texas. Leanne . Hecht Bearden and her husband Joshua traveled the world . for 22 months without a mishap but after returning to the U.S. Leanne . Bearden has gone missing. The . couple was staying with Joshua Bearden's parents near San Antonio last . week after returning from their trip abroad when she went out for a walk . and never returned. Bearden, a marketing graduate, left the house in Garden Ridge on January 17 wearing jeans and hiking boots and carrying about $60 in cash and some credit cards. She also had a red backpack with her that reportedly contained several energy bars. 'We're very concerned,' Bearden's brother Michael Hecht told WSBTV. 'She left of her own free will to go for a walk and that's all we know. We're wondering what's happened. Maybe she went for a hike, saw a nice place somewhere she could hike and maybe is hurt, or has fallen over. We don't know.' The couple had intended to stay briefly in Texas before flying to their home in Denver to begin searching for work. According to CNN, the couple has been married for four years. Grief: Leanne's family are devastated by their loss and thanked the many people involved in trying to find the 33-year-old . 'Her husband is devastated right now and is extremely worried. We're just trying to help out the Police Department as much as we can canvassing the area, even going father out than we think she may be. But we have absolutely no idea where she is,' Hecht told WBSTV. According to My San Antonio, Bearden was planning to return to the home within an hour in order to take a phone call about a job in Denver. She was reported missing by her husband after she had been gone about four hours. At about that time, Bearden's parents returned home from an out-of-town trip. Search: Facebook pages and leaflets were set up to try to find Leanne . 'We could draw up scenarios that range from the sublime to the ridiculous,' Will Bearden told My San Antonio. 'I just stick with what we know. What we know is she was seen leaving our house Friday, and no one has seen her since.' Right now police say there is 'no indication at this time that this is criminal in nature.' Family friend Chris Busch told the Huffington Post that all leads are being followed. 'The area out there is surrounded by very rocky and rugged terrain,' Busch told The Huffington Post. 'There are caves, cliffs and all sorts of other things.' 'The options go from a twisted ankle to a snake bite,' he said. 'Is . it possible she was abducted? Yeah. There were two attacks on women . recently in the area. The police are looking into those. From our . standpoint, we are just out there trying to cover as much ground as . possible.'

"Britain's contributions to the European Union have doubled in five years, even before the latest demand for an extra £1.7billion, it has emerged. After billions have been paid into Brussels coffers - and some returned through the rebate and EU spending programmes - the UK was £8.6billion in 2013, up from just £4.3billion in 2009. It comes as UK ministers launch a fresh attempt to persuade other member states to tear up the £1.7billion bill which David Cameron has refused to pay by December 1. Scroll down to watch video . Figures dating back to 2007 show how the UK's net contribution has risen dramatically in recent years . The British government has been stunned by the demand, which emerged a week ago. The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. However, payments dating back to 2007 show how the payments to the European project have been quietly rising. A major cause has been Tony Blair's decision to agree to a 7 per cut in the rebate during negotiations on the last seven-year budget deal. It cost Britain £7billion over seven years. Margaret Thatcher famously secured the rebate in 1984 by banging the table and demanding 'our own money back' during a summit with European leaders in Fontainebleau, in France. However, the rebate has fallen from £5.4billion in 2009 to only £3.3billion in 2013, figures published by the FT show. At the same time total payments from the UK have risen from £14.1billion to £17.2billion. The revelation will pile pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron, who was in Downing Street with actress Barbara Windsor today to mark Poppy Day in London . Even allowing for £5.2billion of EU spending in the UK, on farming, fisheries and regeneration, the UK was still £8.6billion worse off last year. Ukip leader Nigel Farage told MailOnline: 'Thank you Mr Blair for sacrificing a large chunk of the British rebate in return for absolutely nothing. 'Much of the money that has come back to Britain has been used to make rich landowners richer (through the Common Agriculture Policy). 'The question is no longer can we afford to leave, it is can we afford to stay.' Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of Business for Britain, said: 'We've been pouring more and more money into the EU every year, only to see far too much of it squandered. 'Tony Blair threw away much of our rebate in return for empty promises of reform that never materialised. It's about time Brussels curbed its spending, rather than making extra demands on the UK because our economy is growing.' A new poll today showed there had been a sharp shift in public opinion about the EYU in the wake of the latest demand for more money. YouGov found a week ago that only 40 per cent of people would vote to leave the EU, with 41 per cent wanting to stay. But now 44 per cent say they would leave, with only 35 per cent wanting to stay. Nick Clegg travelled to Paris today for talks with the French prime minister to seek support for renegotiating the EU's demand for £1.7 billion in additional funding. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today insisted the government would 'scrub' the EU's figures to examine how the £1.2billion figure was calculated . In the wake of the row over the £1.7billion bill, there has been a sharp rise in support for leaving the EU, according to a new poll by YouGov . Britain faces the biggest increase to its payments covering the last four years. The UK is being asked for an extra €2.1billion euros. Preliminary figures show that the Netherlands will have to pay an extra €642million (£506million), while Germany will receive a rebate of €779million (£614million), France €1billion (£790million) and Poland €316million (£250million). Mr Clegg warned Manuel Valls that, while France is a winner from the current round of readjustments to national contributions, it could find itself targeted with a massive bill through the 'arbitrary and random' process in future. Speaking ahead of the meeting in Paris, Mr Clegg said that the UK will 'scrub these figures very, very hard' - including an analysis of any impact on the UK's £3 billion-a-year EU rebate - and pledged: 'We will make sure that it is lower.' France is the biggest gainer from the recalculation of national contributions to EU budgets, and is due to receive one billion euro (£800million), while EU partners including the Netherlands, Italy, Greece and Malta face surcharges . Chancellor George Osborne last night insisted he is 'confident' of securing changes to the figures, which shocked David Cameron when they emerged during a European Council summit in Brussels last week. New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . After talks with fellow EU finance ministers on the fringe of an OECD forum in Berlin, Mr Osborne said Italy and the Netherlands were 'allies' in the drive to review the figures. Mr Cameron has insisted the UK will not pay 'anything like' the amount being demanded, and secured agreement at the European Council for the issue to be discussed at a scheduled meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on November 7. Mr Clegg told LBC Radio that he and the Prime Minister were 'as one' on the issue. 'We are not going to pay this money by the December 1 deadline that has been set,' said the Deputy Prime Minister. 'It is a completely arbitrary, random way to behave to suddenly have this bill dropped into your lap without any warning and without any explanation.;' Mr Clegg said the UK needed to 'build alliances' to challenge the European Commission demands, adding: 'We are not going to pay this money. It is not a way to do these things. It is not just a British problem, it is a European problem. 'If it is Britain in the spotlight today, it could be France or Germany next time.' He added: 'We want to have a really close look at this and see what the retrospective effect is. We want to see what the effect is on the UK rebate. We are not going to pay it by that deadline, no matter what they say elsewhere.'","UK was £8.6billion worse off in 2013, up from £4.3billion in 2009 .

"Almost 2,000 women being treated in NHS hospitals in England were reported to have been subject to FGM since April (file picture) Hundreds of women in England are being recorded as victims of female genital mutilation every month, a landmark report indicates. In April this year, hospitals in England were told to start recording cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) they identified. The figures today are from the first batch of statistics collated and released today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. They show that in the last six months, 1,746 cases of the crime were identified in English hospitals. In September alone, there were 467 new cases where women had been subjected to FGM. This adds to a further 1,279 cases of women who already been identified by the NHS in the five months previously as having been subjected to FGM. However it is feared the figures could simply be the 'tip of the iceberg', with the practice a largely 'hidden crime' . The NSPCC described the figure as 'shocking'. Head of Child Protection Operations John Cameron told MailOnline: 'These figures prove that FGM is very much a live public health issue. 'This NHS data shows just how vital it is that health professionals are trained to spot the signs of FGM so we can ensure that women and girls who are subjected to this brutal practice get the post-traumatic support they deserve. 'We also need to make sure that information is shared amongst agencies when a victim is being treated for FGM so that other girls in the same family can be supported and protected. 'We need anyone who is worried about the thousands of women and girls in the UK who are vulnerable to FGM to call our helpline on 0800 028 3550. 'It doesn't matter if you're uncertain, we're here to talk things through and offer advice and you may in turn stop a child from being subjected to this barbaric practice.' Earlier this year Home Secretary Theresa May said that in the UK, more than 100,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM and a 60,000 are at risk. The figures she cited, from a report from City University London in collaboration with Equality Now, estimated that 10,000 girls aged under 15 who migrated to England and Wales are likely to have undergone FGM. In July, the Government launched a £1.4 million programme to tackle FGM, with the aim of ending the practice within a generation. Hundreds of women were treated for female genital mutilation (FGM) in NHS hospitals in England in the last six months. The graph above, from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, shows the number of cases last month (right column) and the number for the five months previously (second right) Earlier this year Home Secretary Theresay May said that in the UK more than 100,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM and a 60,000 are at risk of being mutilated . This included bringing in laws to prosecute parents if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut. It also requires collecting data about FGM in hospitals in England and training both health professionals and police officers to respond appropriately to cases of FGM. Female genital mutilation is the practice in which some or all of the female genitals are removed, typically with a blade or a razor and sometimes without anaesthesia. This includes removing the clitoral and the fold of skin above it, and removing labia – the inner 'lips' of the vagina. Female genital mutilation is the practice in which some or all of the female genitals are removed, typically with a blade or a razor and sometimes without anaesthesia. This includes removing the clitoral and the fold of skin above it, and removing labia – the inner 'lips' of the vagina. In the most severe form, the inner and outer labia are removed and the opening of the vagina is closed with a small hole so the woman can pass urine and menstrual blood. Sometimes the vagina is then cut open for sex or childbirth. Women sometimes bleed to death or can be left with horrifying health effects, such as infections, chronic pain, cysts, infertility and problems giving birth.

Sometimes the vagina is then cut open for sex or childbirth. Women sometimes bleed to death or can be left with horrifying health effects, such as infections, chronic pain, cysts, infertility and problems giving birth. FGM has been a crime in the UK for 30 years, but there have been no convictions for the practice. The first trial, in which two men are alleged to have performed the procedure on a woman after she gave birth, will take place in January. HSCIC chair Kingsley Manning said: 'This is the first national collection of NHS data about numbers of FGM cases and we will continue to collect and publish these figures. 'Having accurate data about this crime is an important step in helping prevent its occurrence in the future. 'The information will support the Department of Health in their FGM prevention programme, and we hope to expand the dataset over time so that it provides a more complete picture across a wider variety of care settings.'

"The jet-setting Bacardi rum empire heiress Monika Barcardi has claimed that she was blackmailed by the playboy stepson of the founder of the Italian car design dynasty Abarth. Europe is now braced for a trial promising to spin a real-life tale of glamour, wealth, stealth and sex. Raphael Abarth, 57, was arrested after demanding a £234,000 'connection fee' for putting Monika in touch with the high society set she was later to marry into. Police say she paid him close to £80,000 before she realised she was being 'shaken down'. She refused to hand over any more cash and called in detectives. Jet set: Monika Bacardi, pictured here with Joan Collins at a party last year, married Cuban-born billionaire Luis Adalberto Facundo Gomez del Campo Bacardi in 2000. He died five years later . Betrayal: Abarth, left, demanded cash from Monika for increasingly bizarre reasons, it is claimed. She helped him with dentist work he needed but then wanted money for a miracle healer, she claimed to police . 'I lived in fear for mine and my daughter's life,' she told police. Italian-born Monika, now 54, who once helped to run her family's real estate business, married the Cuban-born billionaire Luis Adalberto Facundo Gomez del Campo Bacardi after she went to work for him. She allegedly got the job thanks to a recommendation from Raphael's mother, Anneliese, the third wife of Carlo Abarth who died in 1979. He founded a famous Italian motorcycle firm and in 1933 won acclaim across the continent when he beat the Orient Express train in an 800-mile race from Vienna to Ostende in Belgium. He went on to become a top designer for Fiat and Porsche. According to Arbarth, Monika was hired after Anneliese made the introductions and she and Luis married in 2000. Her's was a world ever-after of private jets, presidential hotel suites, exotic villas, servants, jewels and all the glittering prizes money could buy. Luis was a board member of the family rum business for 40 years, and passed away just five years after their marriage. They had one child together, Maria Luisa, who continues to live with her mother for most of the year in Monaco. Media reports have put the widow's wealth at between £500m and £600m. Links: Raphael is the son of Anneliese (above), the third wife of Carlo Abarth, who founded the famous car design company . Legend: Carlo Abarth won acclaim in 1933 when he beat the Orient Express train in a 800-mile race from Vienna to Ostende in Belgium . Fame: Abarth is best known for its partnerships with Porsche and Fiat. Above is the Fiat 595 Abarth . It's understood she had little dealings with Raphael Abarth while Bacardi was alive, but she met him again later at a hunters' ball in the VIP ski resort of Kitzbuhel, a small medieval town in the state of Tyrol, western Austria. She said: 'I wanted to help him because I knew him a long time ago and he always seemed to me to be like a nice man. He said he needed money for dental work.' In fact, Raphael was on his uppers by now, relying on eurotrash friends and acquaintances and seeking handouts from the ultra-rich he used to mingle with. It is believed that he suffered a further setback on a failed supercar project called the Milan Arbath in 2012 and needed the support of people like Monika to help him sustain a little of the high life he loved so much. He claims that the money she gave him was part of a £234,000 fee that had been agreed with her for giving her access to high society. But she told police that when he continued to demand cash for ever more extravagant reasons - such as visiting a miracle healer - she had refused, and he had then become 'aggressive and threatening.' The last demand for money came via his lawyer, Monika told police. Abarth fell from grace, and the orbit of Europe's rich and beautiful set, in spectacular fashion a year ago when he was convicted in absentia for drug smuggling in Italy several years ago. In theory Abarth, who lives in the Austrian capital Vienna, should have been arrested in Austria and extradited back to Italy to serve his punishment for smuggling. The Italians want him to serve a 17 year jail term. Austrian prosecutors are also investigating how it is that he was apparently able to live openly despite the outstanding arrest warrant. Bust: Abarth lost the last of his cash on a failed supercar project called the Milan Arbath in 2012 (above) The Kurier newspaper in Austria quoted a police report which read: 'Surveys by the Federal Criminal Police Office and the Austrian liaison officers in Italy showed the accused to be clearly linked to organised crime'. Austrian police claim to have found proof that he had threatened he would go to the press with lurid tales about her, a story which he said was to do with 'revelations about how she met her husband.' Abarth, who now reportedly lives off just £626 a month, allegedly told Bacardi that he also had 'mafia contacts.' As a result of what they found Austrian police arrested him on August 20 and he is currently in custody and due to appear in the Vienna Regional Criminal Court on November 20. His lawyer Martin Mahrer said: 'My client was never acted with the intentions of a blackmailer.'","Monika Bacardi had Raphael Abarth arrested after he allegedly demanded £234,000 for introducing her to Luis Adalberto Facundo Gomez del Campo Bacardi .

"Scroll down for video . Texas Republican Representative Ralph Hall, 90, spent more than $33,000 in campaign donations on high-end hams and chocolates. According to Federal Election Commission records, Hall, the oldest serving member of Congress, spent more than $14,000 on HoneyBaked hams around the holiday season in 2012 and 2013, and a further $19,000 at Godiva in December 2013. During the holiday season, many constituents receive gifts from their members of Congress such as cards, ornaments or trinkets from the House gift shop. Hamming it up: Congressman Ralph Hall gives very tasty gifts to his supporters . Campaign money may be spent on gifts for constituents, though the House Ethics Committee states that the items should be 'of a nominal value.' 'Such gifts,' the Ethics Committee guidance states, 'may include the relatively inexpensive House or Capitol souvenir items sold by the House gift store or the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, and thus a Member may use campaign funds to purchase such nominal-value gifts for the Member’s supporters or contributors.' It's unclear whether Belgian Godiva chocolates and seven-pound hams are considered nominal-value gifts. Sweet nothings: The gifts were sent out to constituents over the holiday seasons of 2012 and 2013 . No hard feelings: Hall even sent a ham to his rival John Ratcliffe . 'These are gifts that the congressman has been giving out for years to constituents,' said Ed Valentine, one of Hall’s campaign advisers, reports BuzzFeed. 'They’re Christmas gifts. They’re birthday gifts. That’s how Ralph works. He likes Christmas.' Hall even sent a ham to former U.S. Attorney John Ratcliffe, who is running against the nonagenarian. A spokesman for Ratcliffe said Hall sent the Tea Party member a seven-pound baked ham after he announced he was running against the incumbent. 'After six votes to increase the debt ceiling, and support for bloated farm bills, cash for clunkers and billions in earmarks, this level of questionable spending from Ralph Hall is unfortunately not surprising,' Ratcliffe spokesperson Daniel Kroese told BuzzFeed.","Republican Representative Ralph Hall spent more than $33,000 in donations on HoneyBaked hams and Godiva chocolates between 2012 and 2013 .

"David Cameron will today unveil sweeping new restrictions on access to benefits for EU migrants . David Cameron will today unveil sweeping new restrictions on access to benefits for EU migrants. The Prime Minister will insist that he shares the public’s ‘concerns’ about a renewed wave of migration from Europe. Ahead of the lifting of controls on newcomers from Romania and Bulgaria on January 1, he will declare that the founding EU principle of ‘free movement’ for workers has gone too far. Mr Cameron will say Labour’s record of failure meant many people are ‘deeply concerned’ about what will happen when the transitional restrictions come to an end, adding: ‘I share those concerns.’ He has responded with an emergency package of measures within days of a Daily Mail poll, published last Friday, which revealed more than four in five people do not want unrestricted access to the UK for Romanians and Bulgarians. This was the trigger for other polls that signalled similar levels of public concern. ‘We need to face the fact that free movement has become a trigger for vast population movements caused by huge disparities in income,’ the Prime Minister will say, proposing a bar on arrivals from EU countries which do not meet a fixed level of average earnings. By January 1, Mr Cameron will announce EU jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs. There will be time limits before out-of-work benefits can be claimed. Migrants who currently get jobseekers’ allowance after less than a month will have to wait three months before claiming. Benefits will no longer be paid indefinitely, with payments stopped after six months unless people have a genuine prospect of employment. Beggars and vagrants from EU countries will be removed and barred from re-entering Britain for 12 months. Most controversially, the Government is planning a new ‘minimum earnings threshold’ – below which benefits that top up earnings, such as income support, will be cut altogether. Government sources said the threshold had yet to be set, but would aim to prevent EU workers topping up low incomes with benefits. By January 1, Mr Cameron will announce EU jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs . Ministers insist they are powerless to prevent a potential influx of workers from the two countries because of EU rules. Some of the measures can be implemented immediately, but others are expected to require emergency legislation which may not be in place by January 1. It is not known if the plans will face legal challenges  from Brussels. Mr Cameron will accuse Labour of a ‘monumental mistake’ in failing to control immigration from Eastern Europe. He will say its refusal to impose controls on new EU members in 2004 led to a surge in immigration. One million people from central and Eastern Europe now live in the UK. ‘In 2004, the Labour Government made the decision that the UK should opt out completely of transitional controls on the new EU member states. They had the right to impose a seven-year ban before new citizens could come and work here, but – almost alone in Europe – Labour refused it. That was a monumental mistake,’ Mr Cameron writes in an article for the Financial Times today. He will say: ‘That was the moment to address difficult questions about when to allow new entrants full access to each others’ labour markets – but the Labour Government ducked these questions.’ The Immigration Bill, he will add, already seeks to reduce ‘pull factors’ to Britain. He will also unveil four new measures. Bulgarians pictured in 2006 queuing outside the British Embassy in Sofia to apply for visas to work in the United Kingdom. One million people from central and Eastern Europe now live in the UK . ‘We are changing the rules so that no one can come to this country and expect to get out-of-work benefits immediately; we will not pay them for the first three months. If after three months an EU national needs benefits – we will no longer pay these indefinitely.’ He will say: ‘They will only be able to claim for a maximum of six months unless they can prove they have a genuine prospect of employment. We are also toughening up the test which migrants who want to claim benefits must undergo. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'These are sensible and reasonable reforms to ensure that the right to work does not automatically mean the right to claim' ‘This will include a new minimum earnings threshold. If they don’t pass the test, we’ll cut off access to benefits such as income support. ‘Newly arrived EU jobseekers will not be able to claim housing benefit. If people are not here to work – if they are begging or sleeping rough – they will be removed. They will then be barred from re-entry for 12 months, unless they can prove they have a proper reason to be here.’ Mr Cameron will say free movement is key to his attempts to carve out a looser relationship with Brussels ahead of an in/out referendum on EU membership by 2017. ‘Britain, as part of our plan to reform the EU, will now work with others to return the concept of free movement to a more sensible basis.‘And we need to do the same with welfare. For example, free movement shouldn’t be about exporting child benefit – I want to work with our European partners to address this.’ The PM will say he wants to look at various options to stop surges of immigration. ‘One would be to require a new country to reach a certain share of average EU GDP per head before full free movement was allowed. Individual member states could be freed to impose a cap if their inflow from the EU reached a certain number in a single year. ‘I look forward to working with other countries who also want reform – and to putting the choice about our future in Europe in a referendum.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘These are sensible and reasonable reforms to ensure that the right to work does not automatically mean the right to claim.’","PM unveils new restrictions on access to benefits for EU migrants .

"It's a jungle out there. Particularly when you are shaping up to be today's 'special' on the waterhole lunch menu. In an astonishing video shot on the African savanna, a pack of seriously hungry jackals and a lone crocodile lurking just below the water's surface, have cornered a warthog. Now, if you are the prey in this particular scenario - dish of the day for some of animal kingdom's most vicious predators - you already know there is no escape. A little warthog drinks at a watering hole on the African savanna unaware of the jackals who are stalking him for lunch. But they aren't the only predators in town . The jackals are already licking their lips at the prospect of warthog, served extremely rare. But the crocodile in the YouTube video seems almost casual to the point of disinterest. Both sets of hunters have an enviable strike rate in this situation, even though crocodiles eat very rarely and jackals tend to hunt alone or in pairs. Jackals, carnivores with dog-like features and a bushy tail, tend to live singly or in pairs, only coming together to hunt in small packs. They have a reputation for being opportunistic, skulking scavengers and would have no problem taking down a warthog. Crocodiles are amazingly fast when they want to be - swimming at 20mph to catch prey. They use their powerful jaws and teeth to crush their meals, often tearing animals apart in chunks or swallowing them whole. What's on the menu today? Warthog for the pack on the left.  But who is this showing up to the party on the right?  Never underestimate a crocodile . CROCODILES: . JACKALS: . Warthogs are a species of wild pig, who in spite of their ferocious appearance, are omnivorous, eating grasses, roots, fruits, bark, fungi and insects. Its the the only species of pig that has adapted to grazing in the savanna habitat. Far from fighting, it would rather run away from trouble - at speeds of up to 30mph - than attack. Which is a bit unfortunate for our poor warthog in this home movie. Caught between the bank and the water, he had no place to go. So who bagged it for lunch? It was the crocodile of course. Leaving some very disappointed jackals yelping  on the sidelines. The crocodile finally makes its move, lunging forward with its tail and hind legs, jaws open, to grab the warthog . The disappointed jackals can only look on as the crocodile pulls the warthog down with its powerful jaws and drags the prey off for lunch.  The 'dish of the day' is off guys .","Amazing video of warthog being stalked by Africa's sneakiest predators .

"A massive fire caused by an overheating laptop left charging on a bed has destroyed a family's home and all their possessions. Mary Disley, 33, was watching Coronation Street when she heard a smoke alarm and dashed upstairs to find flames shooting from the charger to her new laptop which she'd left on her bed. She fled from her house in Burnley, Lancashire, with children Isabel, eight, and six-year-old son Ayrton, who had been asleep upstairs. She said: 'I shouted for the kids to wake up. I was screaming, telling Izzy to get her brother up and to tell them to get to the front door. 'I got the dogs, a bichon called Mojo and a shi tzu called Dot, and was behind them. I put them in the car and rang the fire brigade. 'We have lived here for around two years. I had just got it how I wanted it. Everything is gone. The only place that's not touched is the kitchen.'

She added: 'There will be no TVs or games consoles in the bedrooms from now on.' She heard a smoke alarm and rushed upstairs to find flames shooting from the charger on the bed where Ayrton had originally wanted to sleep before cuddling up to his sister in another bedroom. The family did not have home insurance, and face a costly repair bill, as well as having to replace most of their belongings. But the community has rallied round to launch a Facebook group, 'Help Mary and her 2 children', which has attracted 500 members, appealing for donations of clothes, toys and furniture. Her brother-in-law, Paul Booth, ran from his home in nearby Gainsborough Avenue after hearing about the fire. The 29-year-old father-of-two said: 'I woke my kids up, left them with a neighbour, and ran around. 'I shouted, ""are the kids out?"" - but they were. Seconds later the fire brigade turned up. 'She is very lucky. If the fire alarm did not go off, she would not have known.' Another picture of Mary Disley's room where the fire originated.

'It was the first time I had it so I put it on charge on the bed and went to watch the rest of Coronation Street before doing my uni work.' Two crews from Burnley were called to the blaze, which ripped through the bedroom in just minutes. Firefighters used breathing apparatus, a thermal-imaging camera, and hose reels to put the fire out. Others climbed a ladder to attack the flames through the bedroom window. An investigation confirmed the fire was caused by 'an overheating laptop power pack which had been left on the bed.' A fire service spokesman said: 'On this occasion, the actions of Mary must be commended and we cannot stress enough the importance of smoke detection in people's property which, on this occasion, has undoubtedly saved lives. 'Electrical items such as hairdryers, straighteners, laptops, and tablets, should not be left on bedding when switched on and should be switched off when not in use.' Mary Disley's brother Paul Booth (pictured) said his sister was 'very lucky' the smoke alarms had sounded . Barrowford Primary School's headteacher Rachel Tomlinson has called for residents to help the family back on their feet.

"If right-wingers catch the wave of an election blowout on Tuesday, four GOP candidates could tilt the scales of diversity in their favor – including one openly gay man whose campaign has been forced to deny that he has exposed himself to staffers and masturbated in public places. Two Republicans aim to join South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott as the only blacks from their party in Congress. Mia Love, a Haitian-American former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, failed in her first attempt to win a congressional seat in 2012, losing to a Democratic incumbent by just 768 votes out of more than 245 cast. This time she's fighting to win an open seat, and polls are tilted in her favor. In Texas, former CIA undercover operative Will Hurd is in a pitched battle against first-term Democrat Pete Gallego in an expansive majority-Hispanic district that winds 830 miles from San Antonio to El Paso. The last black U.S. House Republican was retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Allen West, who won in the 2010 tea party landslide but was defeated two years later. CARL'S JR?: Republican House candidate Carl DeMaio is struggling in a toss-up race because of allegations that he exposed his genitals to staffers and was caught masturbating in his office and in a public restroom . LOVE, UTAH STYLE: Front-runner Mia Love aims to bring diversity to the House GOP . HISTORY: Joseph Rainey (left) was a civil rights activist and the first African-American to serve in the U.S. House, in 1870.  Clergyman Hiram Revels (right) was the first black American to be elected to the US Senate . Democrats have long-enjoyed the perception among African-Americans that they should be the default recipient of blacks' votes – largely, conservatives say, because the Great Society programs inaugurated by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson, and enlarged under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, benefit blacks through a massive government welfare system. But while today's black civil rights leaders cite a history of racism and discrimination as the primary reason to elect Democrats, they tend to downplay the fact that the original black civil rights icon, President Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican. Most of the Deep South's historically loathsome 20th Century segregationists were Democrats. Two openly gay Republicans could also join their states' congressional delegation in Washington, D.C. Richard Tisei in Massachusetts lost his 2012 race against longtime incumbent Democrat John Tierney. This time, however, Tierney was upset in the primary by a little-known Marine Corps veteran, Seth Moulton. The lack of an incumbent could tip the scales in Tisei's favor. He's a former Minority Leader in the Massachusetts State Senate who also lost a 2010 bid for lieutenant governor. Three time zones away in San Diego, California, openly gay Carl DeMaio is challenging one-term incumbent Scott Peters in a race that every major polling organization rates as a toss-up. But DeMaio would likely be leading if it weren't for a trio of sexual-misconduct accusations that are giving some voters second thoughts. His campaign has issued firm denials to all of them. ELECTION DAY: Americans are voting in every state on Tuesday, with implications that will shape the last two years of the Obama presidency and public policy that could stretch decades into the future . OUT: Republican candidate for Congress Richard Tisei hopes to up the GOP's diversity quotient, but Democratic homosexuals would still outnumber Republicans in Congress . BAY STATE MADE HISTORY: Massachusetts Rap. Gerry Studds (left0 was the first openly gay member of Congress, and Barney Frank weathered snarks and cruel jokes until 2013 as a congressman from the same state – but was once embroiled in a rent-boy scandal involving his housemate's 'side business' Will Hurd, a Texas Republican House candidate, is trying to beat a Latino in a majority-Hispanic district . On Oct. 10 CNN broke a story about a former campaign staffer who said he caught DeMaio masturbating in his office in April. 'I came over to his office, door was open. And he was masturbating,' DeMaio's former policy director Todd Bosnich said. 'I saw his hand, his penis in his hand, and he had a smile on his face. And as soon as I came over he was looking at me.' Two days ago a second campaign worker made a similar allegation in an interview with KPBS. 'I was at the urinal, and (DeMaio) came from the stall that was closest to the urinal and was kind of just standing there hovering,' former regional political director Justin Harper claimed. 'I turned around and realized that it was Carl. He had his pants up, but his fly was undone, and he had his hand over, not over, grasping his genitals.' A former San Diego City Council colleague has told CNN that he witnessed DeMaio masturbating in the city hall bathroom on two occasions. It's unclear whether the October Surprise revelations will be enough to doom DeMaio. A California Republican Party aide told MailOnline on background that 'we hope voters are smart enough to see that this is a mean-spirited effort by disgruntled former employees. If anyone made these accusations about a Democrat, they would be pilloried as homophobic and prejudiced.'","Mia Love, a conservative Haitian-American, tries a second time in a tight Utah US House race .

"A disturbing photograph of an indigenous woman from Mexico delivering a baby on a patch of grass outside a medical center has set off a firestorm online and sparked a national debate that led to the  head of the clinic that turned the mother away being suspended. The shocking image, taken by a passerby, shows 29-year-old Irma Lopez , who is of Mazatec ethnicity, squatting after giving birth, her face contorted in pain and her tiny newborn son still bound by the umbilical cord and lying on the ground. The government of the southern state of Oaxaca announced Wednesday that it has suspended the health center's director, Dr. Adrian Cruz, while officials conduct state and federal investigations into the October 2 incident. Scandalous: This disturbing photo of Irma Lopez, 29, squatting in pain outside a Mexican health clinic after giving birth without help from the staff caused outrage after appearing on the front page of La Razon de Mexico . Mrs Lopez, a married mother of three, said that she and her husband were turned away from the Rural Health Center of the village of San Felipe Jalapa de Diaz by a nurse who said she was only eight months pregnant and ‘still not ready’ to deliver, even though the woman was reportedly fully dilated. The couple, who are Mazatecs and do not speak Spanish, could not understand much of what the nurse was telling them beyond the word ‘no,’ so they went outside. Addressing the controversy later, the nurses blamed the incident on the language barrier and claimed that they did not have enough staff on hand to treat the woman due to a partial work stoppage. An hour and a half later, at 7.30am, the woman’s water broke. Knowing that the time has come, Lopez kneeled on the grass outside the clinic and started pushing while grabbing the wall of a house. ‘I didn't want to deliver like this. It was so ugly and with so much pain,’ she said, adding she was alone for the birth because her husband was trying to persuade the nurse to call for help. Eloy Pacheco Lopez, who was among a number of people drawn to the site by the mother’s screams, took the photo and gave it to a news reporter. It ran in several national newspapers, including the full front page of the tabloid La Razon de Mexico, and was widely circulated on the Internet. Happy mother: Irma Lopez stands next to her newborn son Salvador at a clinic in the town of Jalapa de Diaz, Mexico, where a health center director was suspended for failing to help her during birth . Pacheco López also shared the image on Facebook, writing that 'after waiting and demanding attention for two hours, she gave birth in the yard of the hospital after being ignored by personnel under the direction of the supposed doctor Adrian René Cruz Cabrera,' Latin Times reported. The case illustrated the shortcomings of maternal care in Mexico, where hundreds of women still die during or right after pregnancy. It also pointed to still persistent discrimination against Mexico's indigenous people persists. Suspended: Health director Adrian René Cruz Cabrera . ‘The photo is giving visibility to a wider structural problem that occurs within indigenous communities: Women are not receiving proper care. They are not being offered quality health services, not even a humane treatment,’ said Mayra Morales, Oaxaca's representative for the national Network for Sexual and Reproductive Rights. Lopez said she and her husband walked an hour in the dark to the clinic from the family's one-bedroom hut in the mountains of northern Oaxaca. It would have taken them longer to get to the nearest highway to catch a ride to a hospital. She said that from the births of her two previous children, she knew she didn't have time for that. Silvia Flores, the mayor of the town where then now-infamous medical center is located, told the site Clarin that it was the second time in a year that a woman in labor has given birth on the lawn: in July, another indigenous woman delivered a baby on the same grass patch. The Mexican federal Health Department said this week that it has sent staff to investigate what happened at the Rural Health Center of the village of San Felipe Jalapa de Diaz. The National Human Rights Commission also began an investigation after seeing news reports.Nearly one in five women in the state of Oaxaca gave birth in a place that is not a hospital or a clinic in 2011, according to Mexico's census. Health officials have urged women to go to clinics to deliver their babies, but many women say the operating hours of the rural centers are limited and staffs small. Growing brood: The 29-year-old mother of three talks to her children as her newborn son Salvador sleeps on her lap at her hut in the town of Jalapa de Diaz, Mexico . Although some have praised Mexico for improving its maternal health care, the mortality rate still stands at about 50 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the World Health Organization, similar to Libya, Barbados and Kazakhstan. The U.S. rate is 16 per 100,000. Oaxaca is one of Mexico's poorest, most rural states and many women have died of hemorrhaging or preeclampsia - a condition causing high blood pressure and possible organ failure. The Mexican states with the highest indigenous population have the highest rates of maternal deaths, by a wide margin. Lopez was taken in by the clinic after giving birth and discharged the same day with prescriptions for medications and products that cost her about $30, she said. Health officials say she and her baby were in good health. She said that poverty-stricken villagers are used to being forgotten by Mexico's health care system and left to fend off for themselves. ‘I am naming him Salvador,’ said Lopez, a name that means ‘Savior’ in English. ‘He really saved himself.’","Pregnant Irma Lopez, 29, and her husband - both ethnic Mazatec - walked October 2 to clinic in Oaxaca, but were turned away by nurses .

I've been hit with much worse in my day.' Earlier CNN anchors Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo were seen choking and coughing as they were apparently caught in a cloud of tear gas. Even as their reporters started to suffer the affects of the substance, CNN kept the line 'Smoke bombs fired by police' in the news ticker. Amid the melee, Cuomo sent a tweet to his supporters describing the situation on the ground: '#Ferguson we are relocating. We were not ready for gas. Gunfire in spurts here. Some fires. All ok from what I see.' Tear gas is a chemical agent that causes irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin according to the Centers for Disease Control, often experienced as a burning sensation.

The Fox reporter was forced to apologize to his viewers for the use of foul language, explaining that this is what happens on live TV. Harrigan was back on air 10 minutes later, saying that 'the only casualty was the camera.' He continued filming the looting with his iPhone, reportedDeadline.com. Elsewhere a BBC report of the violence was interrupted when anchor Aleem Maqbool coughed and spluttered, apparently due to tear gas. Although the incident was not directly filmed, it could be heard. Maqbool claimed to be somewhere among a large crowd of protesters as a cloud of tear gas swept over them. Smoke?: Chris Cuomo kept reporting as he choked on tear gas that had been lobbed at a crowd of people near the CNN crew . Gassed: Canisters of tear gas were lobbed or fired into the crowd, causing Don Lemon to duck out  and hand the microphone off to Cuomo . Violence flared after the decision ot to prosecute police Officer Darren Wilson was announced by St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch at around 8:25pm last night. The rioting continued throughout the evening and into this morning. President Barack Obama and the family of Michael Brown asked for calm. As Obama spoke live from the White House briefing room, television networks showed him on one side of the screen, and violent demonstrations in Ferguson on the other. Angry crowds took to the streets around the Ferguson Police headquarters after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge Wilson with any crime for the shooting of 18-year-old Brown this past summer. St Louis police reported heavy gunfire late yesterday in the area near where Brown was shot and killed on August 9 and more than a dozen local businesses were razed to the ground by arsonists. So far there have been 29 arrests, 13 injuries – and no fatalities, with police saying they have not fired any shots. Smokescreen: As protesters and reporters confirmed that tear gas was being used, the St Louis County Police Department tweeted that police were using 'smoke' The Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions for the city. After three months of waiting for the controversial verdict, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, collapsed in grief as it was announced, screaming 'This is wrong!' The victim's stepfather screamed 'Burn this b**** down'. Meanwhile, Wilson's attorneys issued a statement in which he thanked 'those who have stood by his side throughout the process'. Within minutes of the announcement by the county's top prosecutor, crowds began pouring into Ferguson streets to protest the decision. Some taunted police, shattered windows and vandalized cars. Several gunshots were also heard. Officers released tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings. Prosecuting Attorney McCulloch said the jury of nine whites and three black jury members met on 25 separate days and heard more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses, including three medical examiners and other experts on blood, toxicology and firearms. He stressed that jurors were 'the only people who heard every witness ... and every piece of evidence'. He said many witnesses presented conflicting statements that were inconsistent with the physical evidence. 'These grand jurors poured their hearts and soul into this process,' he said.","Sara Sidner kept calm despite being struck by a rock thrown from behind .

"A salvage diver has died while working on the Costa Concordia wreck after it is believed he cut himself on metal sheeting 10ft underwater and bled to death. Widely named in Italian and Spanish media as Israel Franco Moreno, from La Coruña, Spain, he was part of a team attaching 30 huge flotation tanks to the side of the 114,500-tonne ship. He is the first person to die in the salvage operation since the cruise liner hit rocks two years ago off the holiday island of Giglio, Italy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: A salvage diver, named and pictured in Italian media as Israel Franco Moreno from La Coruña, Spain, died after it is believed he cut himself on metal sheeting 10ft underwater and bled to death . The man's Facebook profile included several photos of him at the wreckage, spanning a number of months . Worker: Another photo from the Facebook profile of Israel Franco Moreno, widely named as the victim in Spanish and Italian media, showing the wrecked ship . Tragedy: A Spanish diver on the stricken Costa Concordia cruise liner (pictured last week) has become the first person to die on what is believed to be the largest maritime salvage operation in history . Danger: The rusting hulk of the ship was hauled upright in the autumn and is being stabilised with 30 giant flotation tanks. But the work is tricky and workers face difficult conditions with huge pieces of equipment . The tragedy happened just days after investigators boarded the ship for the first time since it sank on January 13, 2012, killing 32 people. According to reports the victim gashed his leg on metal sheeting underwater and was unable to get free, bleeding profusely, until a fellow diver helped him to the surface. Reports say he was conscious when he surfaced and was airlifted to hospital, but later died. An investigation is under way after today's incident. In a statement carried by the Italian ANSA news agency, Titan Micoperi said the diver was working underwater in the area around the wreckage site for the Spanish company UCS (Underwater Contractors Spain). The head of Italy's civil protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, expressed condolences for the death and recalled the dedication of people working on the wreckage, saying they had worked 'for two years without a break, in difficult conditions not without risks, to achieve the common goal of removing the Concordia from Giglio.' Italian and Spanish media widely named the victim as Israel Franco Moreno, aged between 40 and 42, from La Coruña in north west Spain. He has not yet been formally named by authorities. A Facebook page believed to be that belonging to the victim showed several photos of him working on the wreckage and with colleagues. Diver: Italian media named the man as Franco Moreno, 40, from La Coruña in north west Spain. He died today . Rescue: The man was airlifted to hospital but died after his leg may have been trapped, said reports . It appeared he had been working on the . salvage operation for several months and his captions made several . references to how cold the water was. On one he wrote: 'Very cold, but . joyful.' On another, he wrote: 'Another beautiful sunrise in Giglio'. Enrico Rossi, president of the Tuscany region, told La Repubblica: 'Another mourning adds to the long list of victims of this vessel, adding pain to pain.. 'It also adds rage for another death of a young man who was doing nothing more than his duty.' It is the first fatality of a worker on the maritime salvage project, believed to be the largest in history and expected to cost £496 million by the time the ship is removed in June. However, two workers have been injured at the shipyard dealing with the wreck. In April last year a man fell backwards suffering a head injury and fracturing his collarbone, and a month later a worker was hospitalised while carrying out drilling operations, ANSA reported. Massive: To be towed this summer the ship will require a little help, from the 902ft Dockside Vanguard. Completed in 2012, it is the largest semi-submersible vessel in the world and can tow more than 100,000 tons . Wreck: The Costa Concordia hit rocks off the coast of Giglio in January 2012 killing 32 holidaymakers and crew . The ship was righted in autumn last . year as the 'parbuckling' project got under way, with waterlogged . mattresses and furniture clearly visible through smashed cabin windows. It will be floated off the sea bed and to port to be scrapped. Among the 12 firms competing for the vast demolition are ABLE Seaton Port on Teeside, near Hartlepool. The project is expected to cost hundreds of millions more Euros and take 200 people two years to complete. Workers . have used more than 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms . to keep the liner stable, until it is towed away by the Dutch-built . 902ft Dockwise Vanguard, the largest semi-submersible vessel in the . world. Meanwhile the case . against Captain Francesco Shettino rumbles on. Investigators boarded the . ship last week - to collect evidence for his defence lawyers. He . is on trial accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, . facing allegations that he was showboating to onlookers on the holiday . island before the ship grounded. Among more lurid claims are that the married captain held 2am trysts in his cabin with the Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan. His trial began in July last year and is expected to last for several months. He denies the charges. Tragedy: Rescue divers such as the one pictured searched the vessel in September last year, before it was righted, to try and find two bodies on board the ship which were never accounted for .

"Richard E Grant's new fragrance JACK is available exclusively at Liberty . We've heard of perfume having high notes but Richard E Grant's new fragrance may be taking that a little too literally. JACK, a unisex fragrance that launched in Liberty yesterday, contains a combination of the eccentric presenter's favourite smells including the class B drug marijuana. The actor has had a keen interest in fragrance from a young age, so his latest venture into perfumery comes as no surprise. ‘I’ve been led by my nose all my life,' he reveals. 'Having aimed it at plates of food, linen, fruit, books, necks, fabric, flesh, flowers, cars and everything else in between, to finally have a perfume of my own, is the realisation of a boyhood dream’ That is no exaggeration. Growing up in sub-tropical . Swaziland, Grant tried bottling gardenia and rose petals in . jars of boiling sugar water and buried them in the garden in the mistaken belief that they would magically transform into perfume. While his early experiments proved unsuccessful, he never lost is passion for perfume but it took a conversation with handbag designer and friend, Anya Hindmarch, to take the first step to making his dream a reality. ‘I was in the Caribbean two years ago and Anya saw me with my head in a gardenia . bush and said, ""What are you going to do about that?” And I said, “Do . you mean psychiatrically?” And she said, “No, have you thought of making . a perfume?” 'I said, “It’s been my dream.” She gave me a list of . numbers of people to go and see. Roja Dove, the perfumier, told me I . have a very sharp sense of smell, possibly because I’ve never drunk or . smoked.’ Richard has been interested in perfume for his entire life and says that creating his own fragrance is like realising a boyhood dream . With Anya on side, Grant started work on his perfume in January 2012, and after two years of hard graft, his boyhood dream has finally been realised. ‘Two non-stop, chasing-my-tail, . steep-learning-curve years later, that dream has become a bottled, . labelled and packaged reality,' he reveals. Despite his obvious pleasure in finally getting his olfactory dream off the ground, he's under no illusions about the competitive fragrance market. 'There are 1,100 perfumes released every year so this is . like an old guy releasing a record and hoping people are going to buy . it. 'Having never done anything businessy in my life, I think this has . been the steepest learning curve for a man in his late 50s as it’s . possible to get.’ The perfume includes a draw string bag and a luggage tag that can be personalised for gifts . The finished perfume includes all of Grant’s favourite ingredients: lime, marijuana, mandarin, vetiver, pepper, cloves and gardenias. Deciding on the final edit wasn't an easy decision so he enlisted the help of the Liberty staff and asked the store's nose,  Alienor Massenet, to combine two of his favourite blends. ‘Our sense of smell is the shortest synaptic leap in the brain to our memory, and every one of these ingredients is like a sensory trigger. 'I’ve aspired to create a fragrance that is as lickably more-ish as it is addictive’, he says . The bottle itself is far simpler than the cocktail of scents: a clear bottle, encased in a red box and a Union Jack draw string bag. ‘Red is my favourite colour, and having collected Union flags and bunting since the last century, it was logical to design British pillar-box red, high gloss packaging, replete with a faded vintage-style calico bunting bag inside the box, to sleeve the bottle. 'I’ve always been frustrated when buying perfume at not being able to personalise it, to give to friends. So once JACK is unwrapped, buyers will find a luggage label attached to the Union Jack bag, ready for them to write a ‘To’ and ‘From’ message on, as a keepsake’. Grant has overseen every last detail of the process - a process that even included designing five windows for Liberty that he hopes will evoke the quintessential British creativity of . Op-artist Bridget Riley and comedy icons, Monty Python . So, after all that effort, is he happy with the finished product? ‘JACK is my signature in scent,’ he says, unambiguously. We'll take that as a yes. JACK is available now exclusively at Liberty and at Liberty Online.","Richard E Grant has launched a brand new unisex fragrance .

"Senator Tim Scott made history on Tuesday night when he became the first black senator from the South to be elected to the United States Senate by a popular election. Sen. Scott, a Republican from South Carolina and the incumbent in his race, defeated Democrat Joyce Dickerson in a landslide, with the race being called just four minutes after the polls closed. He became a senator in 2013 after being appointed to fill the seat of Jim DeMint in late 2012, who stepped down to join a Republican think tank, by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. Breakthrough: A victorious Tim Scott makes his speech to supporters after beating challengers Jill Bossi and Joyce Dickerson to .

Only nine African-Americans have been elected or appointed to serve in the United States Senate. Of those nine, only three, including Senator Scott, have been from the South. Just as shocking is the fact that the other two senators to serve from the South were Sen. Hiram Rhodes Revels, who was elected by the Mississippi State Senate in 1870 and served just over one year, and Sen. Blanche Kelso Bruce, who was also from Mississippi and served a full term beginning in 1875 after being elected by the state senate. That means that it took over 130 years for the next black senator to enter the United States Senate. Until Tuesday however, none of these men had ever won the office as the result of a public election. Proud mama: Sen. Scott, who is unmarried, celebrated his victory with his mother, Frances Scott (above) President: Six of the black politicians elected to the United States Senate have come from the North, including Barack Obama (above), who was junior senator from Illinois until he gained the presidency .

"Some say graphene is set to be the next super-material, while others claim the humble bamboo could be used in textiles and construction. But perhaps a sweeter option would be to open store cupboards and break out the chocolate, as this Youtube user from Zurich has done. The user, known as Mike C, and his girlfriend created an entire quadcopter out of chocolate - and it not only flies, but it’s edible as well. Forget Amazon's drones that can deliver your food - now you can cut out the middle man and have a drone made of food instead. Mike and his girlfriend claim this is the world's first quadcopter made of chocolate that not only flies but can be eaten after it has landed . On his DIY Drones blog Mike revealed how his love of quadcopters and his girlfriend’s love of baking combined to give rise to the invention. - 1kg (2.2lbs) of dark chocolate . - 100g (3.5 ounces) of white chocolate . - 1 x Naza M V2 (autopilot system) - 4 x Sunnysky X2216 (motor) - 4 x Turnigy Plush 25A ESC (speed controller) ‘I was sceptical at first,’ he wrote. ‘Chocolate is not as stable as aluminium or carbon - which are typically used for copter frames.’ But the duo persevered, and the end result is something that, amazingly, is able to take flight without falling apart. As Mike explains, they began by making a silicon mould in the shape of a quadcopter, which is essentially a cross. The . motors, flight controller and battery were attached to spacers, in order . to separate them from the chocolate and prevent them heating and melting . it. The chocolate was then poured into the mould, which was placed in the fridge until it set. The copter was taken outside and, much to the amazement of Mike C and his girlfriend, flew without issue. And they were even able to have a bite to eat when it landed. ‘When you get hungry during the flight sessions you always have something to nibble with you,’ Mike added. Whether chocolate takes off as the material of choice for future inventions, though, remains to be seen. Mike and his girlfriend poured 1kg grams (2.2lbs) of melted dark chocolate and 100g (3.5 ounces) of white chocolate into a mould to make the chocolate quadcopter. After they had completed the flight Mike C's girlfriend took a bite of the contraption, proving it was fine to eat .","The world's first chocolate quadcopter has been built and flown .

"Televangelist Pat Robertson has been dishing out his own unique brand of marriage guidance advice again, this time telling the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man’s infidelity and start doing more to ensure he doesn’t have reason to wander. ‘Stop talking about the cheating!’ he told the woman during Wednesday's episode of his daily television program, ‘The 700 Club.’ The infamous evangelist was responding to a letter he had received from a woman called Ivy, who had admitted to struggling with forgiveness. Scroll down for video . Pat Robertson has been dishing out his own unique brand of marriage guidance advice again, this time telling the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man's infidelity . ‘We have gone to counseling, but I just can't seem to forgive, nor can I trust. How do you let go of the anger? How do you trust again?’ she wrote. Robertson, known for his forthright views on a wide range of topics including homosexuality and politics, didn’t beat around the bush with his answer. ‘Here's the secret,’ he said. ‘Stop talking the cheating. He cheated on you, well, he's a man.’ Instead of focusing on the misdemeanor, Robertson told the woman to remind herself why she married her spouse and then fall in love with him all over again. ‘Does he provide a home for you to live in,’ he said. 'Does he provide food for you to eat? Does he provide clothes for you to wear? Is he nice to the children... Is he handsome?’ On a roll, Robertson offered further anecdotal advice on the ‘tendency of man.’ Robertson also told the viewer that it wasn't really her husband's fault he had cheated because modern society is filled with so much temptation . ‘Recognize also, like it or not, males have a tendency to wander a little bit,’ Robertson said. ‘What you want to do is make a home so wonderful that he doesn't want to wander.’ Robertson also reminded the woman that it wasn’t really the man’s fault he had cheated because modern society is filled with so much temptation such as the internet ‘filled with pornography’ and magazine full of ‘salacious’ pictures. ‘Thank God that you have a marriage that is together and that you live in America and good things are happening,’ said Robertson. This isn’t the televangelist's first foray into marital counseling, earlier this year he told woman that if their husband isn't paying attention, it's probably because you don't look 'pretty' and 'alert'. 'A woman came to a preacher I know - it’s so funny,' said Robertson on his show in January. 'She was awful-looking. Her hair was all torn up, she was overweight and looked terrible, clothes bad and everything, and she said, ""Oh Reverend, what can I do? My husband has started to drink."" Watch: Pat Robertson dish out his latest marriage advice . Since establishing the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960, Pat Robertson has been no stranger to controversy. 'And the preacher looked at her and he said: ""Madam, if I were married to you, I'd start to drink too.""' Robertson chuckled and added, 'We need to cultivate romance, darling.' 'You always have to keep that spark of love alive,' he said. 'It isn't something to just lie there [and think] ""Well I'm married to him, so he's got to take me slatternly-looking."" You have got to fix yourself up, look pretty, look alert.' But unkempt women aren't solely responsible for failed marriages, Robertson reasoned. That presumption would completely overlook another chief antagonist to an otherwise perfect union: Stubborn women. Stubborn women can also kill a romance in a heartbeat, according to Robertson. Offering his advice to a 17-year-old . whose parents were having marital problems, Robertson suggested that the . boy's mother was at fault. If . your husband isn't paying attention to you, it's probably because you . don't look 'pretty' and 'alert,' Robertson told viewers in January . Writing . to the mens' magazine Maxim, the teenager wrote: 'I’m 17 years old and . I’ve noticed that there has been a change in my father’s behavior. He . spends too much time at the computer playing a war game. I’ve noticed . how alone my mom feels. I just want my father to spend more time with my . mom. What should I do? How can I talk to my father? I feel shame for . him. Please help.' Robertson encouraged the boy to send his parents on a romantic getaway. 'The . romance is obviously going out of the marriage,' he said. 'It's not as . much excitement as it used to be and you know, it may be your mom isn’t . as sweet as you think she is.' 'She may be kind of hard-nosed,' he . continued. 'And so, you say, it’s my father, he’s not paying attention . to mom, but is mom...' Robertson trailed off and started chuckling. His female co-host interjected, 'How are you going to blame the mother?' Robertson shot back: 'It's easy to blame the mother!' The co-host laughed uncomfortably. 'It comes with 58 years of marriage I know what I'm talking about, okay?' Robertson snapped. 'Now what's next?' Robertson tells his female co-host that it's 'easy' to blame women for failed marriages .","He advised a viewer to stop focusing on her husband cheating because that is the 'tendency of man'

"Prince Harry is set to reveal one of his secrets today as part of a campaign to help reduce stigma associated with HIV. The royal is being joined by a host of stars including Nicole Scherzinger, Gemma Arterton and Paloma Faith, who will all lay their secrets bare to the world on video in support of Sentebale's #FeelNoShame campaign for World Aids Day. And the celebrities are not holding back if Joss Stone's surprisingly candid confession is anything to go by. The singer admitted she once wet herself while shopping in Superdrug, and said it had left her with a compulsion to use the lavatory at every service station. Prince Harry, pictured, will reveal a secret in support of a special campaign marking World Aids Day . Prince Harry, right, founded the Sentebale charity in Lesotho to help support children affected by HIV . 'When I was 11, I drank a lot of tea when I was out with my mum, and then I went into Superdrug and I weed myself. Today I cannot stop at a service station... without going to the loo, even though I don't need the loo. I still go - it's ingrained in my brain.' X Factor judge Nicole also revealed her own insecurities when she admitted: 'Sometimes I don't feel I'm enough, and that I don't fit in.' Harry co-founded his Sentebale organisation in Lesotho two years after travelling around the country in 2004 and seeing for himself the problems faced by Aids orphans, disabled children and others with serious issues. Scroll down for video . He said: 'To show our support for the children of Lesotho, and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by HIV, we are turning this World Aids Day into a day in which no-one should feel any shame about their secrets. 'Together, we can tackle the stigma surrounding HIV and give the young people carrying it the childhood they deserve. The childhood so many of us take for granted.' Sharing secrets from worst fears to guilty pleasures, Harry and the A-List line-up hope to raise awareness of the stigma and shame which prevents HIV sufferers worldwide from speaking up and seeking support. He said: 'Globally, HIV is the second-highest cause of death amongst those aged between 10-19 years old, and it is the number one cause of death across Africa. 'One tragic issue in particular is the shame and stigma linked to HIV. 'This causes thousands of children to needlessly die each year because they're keeping their illness a secret and not getting the medical attention they need.' December 1 marks World Aids Day, which aims to counter the stigma associated with HIV and AIDS . Gemma Arterton, left and Nicole Scherzinger, right, will also reveal a secret along with Prince Harry . The campaign aims to raise awareness of how eradicating shame and stigma can save the lives of HIV sufferers, empowering them to seek medical support and education about their condition, and preventing the virus from spreading. Harry launched the campaign himself at midnight, releasing a video from a microsite - FeelNoShame.Today - asking the public to share their own secrets via social media in exchange for his. He will release a second video at 1pm sharing his secret while other celebrities' secrets will be released throughout the day via the same microsite. Cathy Ferrier, chief executive officer of Sentebale, said: 'Too many children are not receiving the treatment and care they so desperately need due to the stigma attached to HIV. 'Today we will celebrate the sharing of secrets with £FeelNoShame to help spread the word that eradicating the stigma surrounding HIV will help save the lives of many HIV-positive children.' Prince Harry co-founded Sentebale in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Lesotho has the third highest HIV/Aids prevalence in the world after Swaziland and Botswana. More than 37,000 of Lesotho's 500,000 children are HIV positive and approximately 200,000 have lost parents to Aids, forcing them out of school and into hazardous forms of labour including prostitution and trafficking. Since 1996, the country's average life expectancy has fallen from 59 years to below 48.7 years. Sentebale provides accommodation, hot food, access to medication and education for Lesotho's children, as well as vital psycho-social support to help them tackle stigma and cope with the emotional repercussions of their condition and live normal lives.","Prince Harry has roped in a host of celebrities to share their secrets .

"An extraordinary letter from the nephew of Adolf Hitler has been discovered in which he begs to be allowed to enlist in the U.S. Army to fight against his uncle's facist regime. William Patrick Hitler fled Nazi Germany when war broke out in 1939 to come and live with relatives in New York. After being rejected from the U.S. Army because of his family connection, he wrote an emotional plea to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942 on why he so strongly wanted to fight for Allied Forces. One of the good guys: Adolf Hitler's nephew William, pictured with his mother Bridget, wrote to President Roosevelt in 1942 begging to be allowed to fight for the U.S. against his uncle's regime . Fighting evil: Seaman First Class William Patrick Hitler, 34, receives his papers before heading off to war against his uncle's Nazi forces . In the letter, he wrote: 'I am the nephew and only descendant of . the ill-famed Chancellor and Leader of Germany who today so despotically . seeks to enslave the free and Christian peoples of the globe. 'More than anything else I would like to . see active combat as soon as possible and thereby be accepted by my . friends and comrades as one of them in this great struggle for liberty.' The letter made its way into the hands of then FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover who approved Hitler for service against the Nazis. William Hitler joined the Navy in 1944 but was removed from service three years later after being wounded. Reign of terror: Adolph Hitler salutes passing tanks during a military parade with high-ranking Nazis . William Patrick, who later changed his last name to Stuart-Houston, was the son of Adolf's half-brother Alois and first wife Bridget Dowling. He was born in Liverpool, England on March 12, 1911. Three years later, Alois left his wife and son and took off for Europe. He remarried, becoming a bigamist, but kept in contact with his first wife. He settled in Germany asking Bridget to send William for a visit. She agreed in 1929 when William was 18. William had a half-brother Heinz Hitler - however he became a committed Nazi (and was later tortured to death by the Soviets). In 1933, William found himself in Nazi Germany where he planned to cash in on his uncle's rise to political fame. He badgered his uncle for a better job than the one he was given working in a bank. In 1938, Adolf offered his nephew a high-powered position within his organization but William fled to Britain, as he was suspicious that it was a trap. Plea: William Hitler's letter begging to fight against the Nazis was sent to President Roosevelt (left) and appears in a book of correspondence from American Wars . He escaped from Germany in 1939 with the help of a British spy and quickly left for the U.S. with his mother. After serving his stint with the U.S. Navy, William dropped the name Hitler. He married Phyllis Jean-Jacques and had four sons. The family settled in Patchogue, Long Island where he set up a medical laboratory business. He died in 1987 at the age of 76 and was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Coram, New York. The letter appears on the blog Letters Of Note after it was included in the book, War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars. The correspondence comes from varying conflicts - reaching as far back as the Civil War to letters from American soldiers who fought in Bosnia in the 1990s. The letters come from ordinary soldiers, sailors, airmen and medical staff - but also include some famous voices. Among the notes are the words of General William T. Sherman, Clara Barton, Theodore Roosevelt, Ernie Pyle and Julia Child. March 3rd, 1942.His Excellency Franklin D. Roosevelt.,President of the United States of America.The White House.,Washington. D.C. Dear Mr. President: . May I take the liberty of encroaching on your valuable time and that of your staff at the White House? Mindful of the critical days the nation is now passing through, I do so only because the prerogative of your high office alone can decide my difficult and singular situation. Permit me to outline as briefly as possible the circumstances of my position, the solution of which I feel could so easily be achieved should you feel moved to give your kind intercession and decision. I am the nephew and only descendant of the ill-famed Chancellor and Leader of Germany who today so despotically seeks to enslave the free and Christian peoples of the globe. Under your masterful leadership men of all creeds and nationalities are waging desperate war to determine, in the last analysis, whether they shall finally serve and live an ethical society under God or become enslaved by a devilish and pagan regime. Everybody in the world today must answer to himself which cause they will serve. To free people of deep religious feeling there can be but one answer and one choice, that will sustain them always and to the bitter end. I am one of many, but I can render service to this great cause and I have a life to give that it may, with the help of all, triumph in the end. All my relatives and friends soon will be marching for freedom and decency under the Stars and Stripes. For this reason, Mr. President, I am respectfully submitting this petition to you to enquire as to whether I may be allowed to join them in their struggle against tyranny and oppression? At present this is denied me because when I fled the Reich in 1939 I was a British subject. I came to America with my Irish mother principally to rejoin my relatives here. At the same time I was offered a contract to write and lecture in the United States, the pressure of which did not allow me the time to apply for admission under the quota. I had therefore, to come as a visitor. I have attempted to join the British forces, but my success as a lecturer made me probably one of the best attended political speakers, with police frequently having to control the crowds clamouring for admission in Boston, Chicago and other cities. This elicited from British officials the rather negative invitation to carry on. The British are an insular people and while they are kind and courteous, it is my impression, rightly or wrongly, that they could not in the long run feel overly cordial or sympathetic towards an individual bearing the name I do. The great expense the English legal procedure demands in changing my name, is only a possible solution not within my financial means. At the same time I have not been successful in determining whether the Canadian Army would facilitate my entrance into the armed forces. As things are at the present and lacking any official guidance, I find that to attempt to enlist as a nephew of Hitler is something that requires a strange sort of courage that I am unable to muster, bereft as I am of any classification or official support from any quarter. As to my integrity, Mr. President, I can only say that it is a matter of record and it compares somewhat to the foresighted spirit with which you, by every ingenuity known to statecraft, wrested from the American Congress those weapons which are today the Nation's great defense in this crisis. I can also reflect that in a time of great complacency and ignorance I tried to do those things which as a Christian I knew to be right. As a fugitive from the Gestapo I warned France through the press that Hitler would invade her that year. The people of England I warned by the same means that the so-called ""solution"" of Munich was a myth that would bring terrible consequences. On my arrival in America I at once informed the press that Hitler would loose his Frankenstein on civilization that year. Although nobody paid any attention to what I said, I continued to lecture and write in America. Now the time for writing and talking has passed and I am mindful only of the great debt my mother and I owe to the United States. More than anything else I would like to see active combat as soon as possible and thereby be accepted by my friends and comrades as one of them in this great struggle for liberty. Your favorable decision on my appeal alone would ensure that continued benevolent spirit on the part of the American people, which today I feel so much a part of. I most respectfully assure you, Mr. President, that as in the past I would do my utmost in the future to be worthy of the great honour I am seeking through your kind aid, in the sure knowledge that my endeavors on behalf of the great principles of Democracy will at least bear favourable comparison to the activities of many individuals who for so long have been unworthy of the fine privilege of calling themselves Americans. May I therefore venture to hope, Mr. President, that in the turmoil of this vast conflict you will not be moved to reject my appeal for reasons which I am in no way responsible? For me today there could be no greater honour, Mr. President, to have lived and to have been allowed to serve you, the deliverer of the American people from want, and no greater privelege then to have striven and had a small part in establishing the title you once will bear in posterity as the greatest Emancipator of suffering mankind in political history. I would be most happy to give any additional information that might be required and I take the liberty of enclosing a circular containing details about myself. Permit me, Mr. President, to express my heartfelt good wishes for your future health and happiness, coupled with the hope that you may soon lead all men who believe in decencey everywhere onward and upward to a glorious victory. I am,Very respectfully yours,Patrick Hitler .","William Patrick Hitler fled Nazi Germany in 1939 for New York .

"When it comes to avoiding the beady eyes of border officers, you can't say they didn't try. These are the bizarre methods used by the world's drug smugglers to stow away their hauls - but all of them were caught before they could cross the border. The cleverest failed missions have included cocaine bras, wigs and nappies, cannabis garden hoses and heroin thigh bandages. Scroll down for video . Happy nappy: Customs officials at New York's airports have released some of the most bizarre ways in which people have tried to slip drugs past them - including these taped-up underpants stuffed with cocaine . Too much junk in the trunk: After the nappies were emptied on the floor, it was pretty clear what they contained . Headrush: One failed smuggler tried to hide a skull-shaped packet of cocaine (bottom) under a black wig (top) What a boob! Customs officials seized this cocaine bra in New York. Spokesman Anthony Bucci said he had seen everything: 'One person we caught at JFK had inserted narcotics anally, vaginally and swallowed pellets' Some of the most unusual have been released by customs officers working in two busy airports on the U.S. east coast. They reveal the desperate and inspired lengths smugglers will go to in their attempts to pass muster at New York's JFK Airport and Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey. Anthony Bucci, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection for New York and New Jersey, admitted he has seen so many odd attempted concealment methods he is rarely surprised. 'Some of the more interesting concealment methods include narcotics concealed in prosthetic limbs, wheels on luggage made of heroin and cocaine and heroin secreted into book covers,' he said. 'One person we caught at JFK had inserted narcotics anally, vaginally and swallowed pellets. Full of beans: Thousands of dollars worth of cocaine were found hidden inside these cans of black beans . Meaty haul: One smuggler fitted packages of cocaine into cylinders of goat meat before freezing them solid . That pepper's got a kick: One tourist tried to sneak marijuana into these souvenir jars coming in to New York . 'We even intercepted a dog years ago that had narcotics sewn under his skin. 'I have been with the CBP approximately four-and-a-half years. The longer I am here the less surprised I am by the attempted concealment methods.' But the phenomenon has never been confined just to New York - as our collection of photos over the years from around the globe shows. The world's drug dealers have tried to smuggle cocaine in an avocado, a can of Stella Artois and a champagne couple. One British pair surgically implanted drugs into their pet Labrador on the way home from Colombia. Caught with their pants down: Meanwhile in China, these trousers (left) almost helped a drug trafficker, 64, get 5kg of cocaine through Macau. Right: A man in China had 1.03kg of heroin hidden inside bandages on his legs . That's got to hurt: The unusual drug hauls were not limited to the U.S. - they happen all over the world. This photo shows a taped-up drug packet which UK officials said was stowed inside a smuggler's 'body cavity' Junk... but not in the trunk: Heroin packages hidden in the gear mechanism of a car on the U.S./Mexico border . Road trip: Customs officers on the U.S./Mexico border also found drugs under the seat of a motorcycle . Keen gardener: This hose reel found on the U.S./Mexico border contained several packages of marijuana . In China, a 64-year-old smuggler tried to sneak 5kg of cocaine into the vice capital Macau by secreting more than 100 tiny packages of the drug into little pockets in his trousers. And the border between the U.S. and Mexico is where officials see some of the most brazen attempts to bring drugs into the country. The lure of profit from drug smuggling has seen substances concealed in items including a baby's stroller, a lawn mower, a garden hose and concrete garden furniture. In June 2009, a 30-year-old Mexican man was even arrested trying to smuggle more than 10kg of marijuana ashore on a surfboard. Beach bummed out: A surfer tried to smuggle marijuana into the U.S. inside their board, but to no avail . That's a lot of munchies: Cannabis traffickers filled up furniture with more than five tonnes of the drug worth £12million which they tried to smuggle through a port on the east cost of England in 2005 . Narnia's this way: This wardrobe seized by British police was more enchanted than most (left). Right: Drug parcels swallowed by a drug mule show up on an X-ray commissioned by customs officers .

"Cuba's attempt to hide retired leader Fidel Castro's ailing condition by doctoring a series of photos has been exposed. Seven images of the 87-year-old were handed out by the Cuban government were digitally altered to remove what appears to be a hearing aid from Castro's ear. The images in question were released through the government-run Estudios Revolucion, an entity that distributes photos of Cuba's top leadership, during a recent Latin America and Caribbean summit in Havana. Scroll down for video . This is the picture that has caused the controversy, showing Cuban leader Fidel Castro, right, with nothing in his ear, but the original, left, with an earphone . They were retransmitted by the AP and other international news organizations to clients around the world. But today AP, which also transmits to MailOnline, said it was removing the pictures from its archive after discovering they were faked. AP vice president and director of photography Santiago Lyon said: 'We have concluded that a number of official photographs of Fidel Castro were manipulated. 'Removing elements from a photograph is entirely unacceptable and is in clear violation of AP's standards.' The AP informed Cuban officials of its decision regarding the photos, but there was no public reaction or comment. Under AP standards, photos must depict reality and cannot be manipulated to add or subtract elements that alter that reality. Unaltered: The image how it should look showing Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez, left, with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, right, and Fidel's wife Dalia Soto del Valle during a private meeting in Havana . AP is deleting the images from its archive because doctored images are against its policy . The news agency's policy is to use handout photographs only when there is no other option, and to scrutinize them carefully for possible manipulation. It was during such screening that photo editors noted an anomaly in a picture that showed Castro meeting with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Havana on January 29. The AP acquired the original, high-resolution image files from the photographer, Alex Castro, the former leader's son. In this photo released by Cubadebate, Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega, left, embraces Cuba's former President Fidel Castro during a visit, in Havana, Cuba, on January 29 . The original clearly showed a thin wire snaking into Fidel Castro's ear that was missing from the altered photo released through Estudios Revolucion. The AP did not transmit the Correa photograph or any official photos of Castro handed out subsequent to it to customers. But a review of other handout images, including a photograph of Castro meeting with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez, showed similar signs of manipulation. The photo was transmitted by the AP, as well as by other news organizations. Cuban President Fidel Castro speaks in 1997: Since retiring in 2006, Fidel Castro has kept a low public profile . Photographs published as recently as a month earlier showed a thin, transparent device in Castro's ear, believed to be a hearing aid. Alex Castro has taken most of the pictures of his 87-year-old father that have been released since a near-fatal illness forced him from office in 2006. The younger Castro immediately provided the original unaltered image files when the AP requested them and told the AP he was unaware they had been manipulated prior to their distribution. His pictures were first submitted to Estudios Revolucion, then redistributed through other official Cuban news outlets. In addition to eliminating the seven images, the AP is conducting a review of all Cuban handout pictures of Castro from recent years, about 150 images in all. Former revolutionary leader Castro led Cuba for nearly 50 years before handing over power in 2006 to his brother, Raul, for health reasons. Since retiring in 2006, Fidel Castro has kept a low public profile, with rare appearances In January, he appeared in public for the first time in nine months. Castro attended the opening of an art studio in the capital, Havana.","Seven images of Castro were handed out by the Cuban government .

"Gasping for fresh air as she was pulled out alive from the ruins of a clothing factory 17 days after it collapsed around her, worker Reshma Begum was hailed as ‘the miracle woman’. Now the seamstress, whose extraordinary survival story made headlines around the world last month, is accused of being part of a massive hoax. Miss Begum was dramatically discovered among the tangled steel and concrete of the Bangladesh garment factory, where clothes were manufactured by suppliers for high street brands including Primark. Scroll down for video . Lies? A man claiming to be a colleague of Reshma Begum, the woman who was dramatically pulled from the rubble of the Bangladesh clothing factory collapse, claims her inspiring rescue is a fabrication . Its collapse is considered to be the deadliest garment factory accident in history. But a co-worker is now accusing the . 19-year-old of faking the length of time she had been trapped in the . ruins, and being part of a hoax by the authorities to make up for the . bad publicity following the disaster, in which 1,221 people died and . about 2,500 were injured. The male co-worker told local . journalists that she had in fact escaped from the eight-storey Rana . Plaza building in Savar, Dhaka, on the day it came down, scrambling from . the rubble alongside him. The man told local journalists: ‘We escaped . together. We both walked away from the rubble. We spent two days in . hospital but then she vanished. The next time I saw her was on TV 17 . days later. They said it was a miracle, but it was a fake.’ Reshma and her family's lives have been transformed since the accident. She now has a lucrative job at a luxury hotel . Miss Begum told local television – in . an interview beamed around the world – how she had managed to survive . those long days by eating leftover food she found in fellow workers’ lunch boxes and drinking water dribbling from a broken pipe. It was reported at the time that she . had been trapped under a concrete slab but stayed alive thanks to an air . pocket left by a Muslim prayer room in the basement. She was photographed being carried on a . stretcher from the ruins of the building on May 10, her face and . clothes covered in white dust. But Miss Begum’s landlady told . journalists from Dhaka’s pro-opposition newspaper Amar Desh she had . escaped from the building on the same day it had collapsed and had . received treatment at the nearby Enam hospital. It is now being claimed that in order . to cover up the hoax, people living near the factory were curiously . forced to move out of their homes the day before the young woman’s . ‘rescue’. They were allowed back once she was ‘saved’. To add to the mystery, police imposed a 24-hour ban on filming of the continuing rescue operation. Investigative journalists have also . questioned Miss Begum’s apparently ‘good condition’ for someone who had . supposedly spent 17 days trapped in the ruins of a building. ‘She said she had to claw her way . through bricks and debris to reach water in dead victims’ rucksacks but . her hands and fingernails did not show the marks you would expect,’ said . Shishir Abdullah, a local journalist. Investigators claim Miss Begum's appearance and injuries in the famous pictures are not consistent with 17 days trapped under rubble . Collapse: The building housed factories that made low-cost garments for Western brands. Authorities vowed to clamp down on unsafe working practices in the wake of the disaster . ‘Also, her eyes were wide open when . they pulled her out and she did not appear to be sensitive to the bright . sunlight. Her sari was not ripped or torn and appeared clean. ‘People were suspicious but the . government made a huge fuss of hailing it as a miracle. People were . taken in. Everyone was fooled.’ Miss Begum, who has since been . ‘awarded’ with a £600-a-month job at a luxury hotel in Dhaka, hit back . angrily at the accusations. ‘Where I was, you were not there, so you have no idea,’ she said. Her mother, Jobeda, who says she is . thankful that because of her daughter’s courage the family have a new . life, insisted: ‘Her escape is the miracle everyone thinks it is.’ The Bangladesh army, which led the search, rescue and body-recovery operation, has yet to respond to claims of a hoax. When the Rana Plaza factory building crashed down in April, 1,129 people were killed. Many of those freed are still recovering.Rescuers with no medical training were forced to perform amputations on the spot to free them without anaesthetic. Bangladesh's government and garment manufacturers are campaigning to close dangerous factories and to make safety a priority for the country's most valuable export industry. Bangladeshi garment factories are routinely built without consulting engineers. Many are located in commercial or residential buildings not designed to withstand the stress of heavy manufacturing. Some add illegal extra floors atop support columns too weak to hold them, according to a survey of scores of factories by an engineering university that was shown to The Associated Press. A separate inspection, by the garment industry, of 200 risky factories found that 10 per cent of them were so dangerous that they were ordered to shut. The textiles minister said a third inspection, conducted by the government, could show that as many as 300 factories were unsafe.","Male colleague claims she escaped on the day the building collapsed .

"One moment of inexcusable thuggery is all it took to change one Australian man’s life forever. Jack Hansen-Bartel, from Adelaide, suffered horrific injuries to his face from a brutal bashing on the night of his celebration after graduating from high school in Bangkok. The trip to Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand back in June was supposed to be ‘the best time’ of his life but instead, he was left in and out of consciousness on the floor of a nightclub. The 20-year-old received injuries so severe that it will take around one and a half years for all required surgeries to be completed. Jack Hansen-Bartel suffered a brutal bashing to his face on the night of his celebrations after graduating from high school in Bangkok . ‘I had no ability to defend myself as I was hit with cowards' punches,’ he told Fairfax Media. The case has sent alarm bells and has revealed a dark underbelly in southern Thai resorts that attracts thousands of Australian tourists each month. The former Adelaide man has been in and out of hospital but his doctors have told him that he is looking at an 80 per cent recovery. Witnesses said after his attack, he was lying on the ground with some of his teeth missing, a flap jaggedly torn from his gum and swallowing his own blood, which made it difficult to breathe. Hansen-Bartel’s 24-year-old brother Jesse and five friends dragged him outside and he described the moment his world was closing in and thought he was dying as blood gushed from his eye and mouth. The trip to Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand back in June was supposed to be ‘the best time’ of his life but instead, he was left in and out of consciousness on the floor of a nightclub . He received no help from staff at Samui's famous Green Mango club and was told by security to ‘keep it moving’ and ‘leave the club’ because Hansen-Bartel was ‘creating a scene’, according to Samui Times. Hansen-Bartel was taken to the front gutter of a go-go bar called Dream Girls before he collapsed when he could no longer walk. Described as an unprovoked attack, Samui police have charged two graduating students from an international school in China over the incident. But six weeks later, the students created charges of their own against Hansen-Bartel, alleging they were protecting a female friend and claiming he was ‘molesting’ her, according to Fairfax Media. Hansen-Bartel denied the claim but said he had met the female on the beach earlier that day and again at the bar in Soi Green Mango. CCTV footage from the Green Mango Club showed Hansen-Bartel walking into the club with the woman before he was stopped by the students. ‘One said to me, 'she is with my friend…don't mess with her', Hansen-Bartel told Fairfax Media. ‘I said, 'Sorry, I didn't know.' Hansen-Bartel said he then asked the woman if she knew the men and she said she did and wanted to stay with them. But he was later found severely injured that night. Hansen-Bartel was working as a part-time model to put money aside to pay for university in Australia when he planned to return home but those plans will have to wait . His mother, Annie Hansen-Bartel told Fairfax Media that in the weeks following the complaint against her son, the family received harassing phone calls and threats from Samui. ‘We were terrified….we were trying to find a safe house to take Jack,’ Ms Hansen said. ‘It's unbelievable. We feel like we are fighting a mafia and money while Jack did nothing wrong. The family have also attempted to transfer the case from Samui to a Bangkok court but was rejected. 'We fear we will not be able to get justice on the island,' she said. Ms Hansen-Bartel said the case has been upsetting for her family as they struggle to deal with Thai government departments and police agencies. Hansen-Bartel was working as a part-time model to put money aside  for university in Australia when he planned to return home but those plans will have to wait. He said his life has changed since and now suffers agoraphobia, severe depression and struggles to sleep at night because of the pain from his injuries. ‘I was to continue to work as a model in order to save to help pay for university and to have this sideline as my main source of income,’ he told Fairfax Media. ‘This will no longer happen and I have no source of income.’ A judge is scheduled to hear evidence in the case in January.","Jack Hansen-Bartel's end of school celebration ended by a brutal bashing .

"A Sydney drag racer has made an incredible escape from a burning inferno after his race car mechanics malfunctioned and he hurtled into a wall at more than 250km/h. Wetherill Park pizza maker Frank ""MrHeli"" Cannistra was competing in an Australian Pro Street Association meet at Sydney Dragway on Saturday when the throttle in his car gave way. The 39-year-old recounted the moment, just a second after crossing the finish line of the quarter-mile straight, made the split decision to career head-on into the safety wall which sent his car up in a ball of flames. Instead of threatening the safety of his rival, who was ahead of Cannistra, he made the decision to hurtling at top speed into the wall. 'The car was on fire (with its performance), then literally on fire,' he told Wide World of Sports. 'The initial contact I thought I was going to get hurt and when the fire came I really panicked.' Incredibly, the 39-year-old unbuckled his seat belt on impact in anticipation of a quick escape. He said if it wasn't for the makeup of the car and  the ease at which he could release the door, he would have been trapped inside. 'I came out of it without a scratch.' But the lightweight souped-up Mazda RX3 was a wreck following the ordeal which lasted just 20 seconds from start to finish. Not for the faint-hearted, drag racing can reach forces of up to 6g's and top speeds variate between 200-300km/hr at top speeds. On the weekend Cannista said he reached 230km/hr in under five seconds.

"The mother of a young man who was brutally bashed while holidaying on one of Thailand's most popular islands has revealed her heartache over the fact her son could now face time behind bars. In June of this year Australian-born Jack Hansen-Bartel, 20, who has lived in Bangkok for the past 15 years, took a trip to Koh Samui to celebrate his high school graduation. While partying at popular nightspot Green Mango, Jack was beaten so severely he sustained irreversible disfiguration to his jaw and mouth. His family said it was a completely unprovoked attack which has put the 20-year-old's modelling career in jeopardy, and prevented him from returning home to Melbourne to begin his university degree. Scroll down for video . Annie Hansen (right) has spoken of the difficulties her and son Jack Hansen-Bartel (left) have faced after he was brutally attacked while holidaying on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand . Jack's two alleged attackers Raymond Tony Chang and Ryan Yunshang Wang - both 19-year-old international students from the Shanghai American school - had just completed their studies at the Shanghai American School. They pair were arrested just days after the attack, and charged by the police with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. But the Hansen-Bartel family said there had been suspicious behaviour during the course of the case, and the accused pair were returned their passports and allowed to travel freely to and from Thailand as proceedings continue. Jack's mother Annie Hansen said the legal system in Samui is making life extremely difficult for her family, despite having a great deal of help from officials in Bangkok, and her son is the victim not the perpetrator. 'Jack was lucky to live through the ordeal', Ms Hansen revealed to Daily Mail Australia. 'At the end of the day, Jack's now facing three charges, possibly a permanent criminal record, and maybe time in a Thai jail', she continued. 'We're living through this every day, Jack and I, either we're sitting here just crying our eyes out holding each other or we're working on the case.' The Hansen-Bartel family have been struggling to get justice on Koh Samui, but have had a lot of assistance from army and government officials in Bangkok, seen here with Jack . Jack has already undergone a number of surgeries with many more to go, and even then will never fully recover physically . Jack is trapped recovering in Bangkok, having undergone some of a potential dozen surgeries he will need to reconstruct his mouth over the next couple of years. He has been told by doctors he will never make a full physical recovery. Six weeks after he was viciously attacked, counter charges were filed against Jack. These charges accused the young man of instigating the altercation, but Jack's mother Annie Hansen believes there is something more sinister at play behind the scenes. However, police have admitted there is no evidence to back up these counter-claims, and the Forensic Institute of Thailand have also been involved in the case and believe a blunt weapon was also involved in the attack. In a victim impact statement he sent to Chang and Wang's future colleges in the United States, Jack outlined the severe and brutal nature of the alleged attack by the pair. 'I had no ability to defend myself as I was hit with a cowards punch, as I did not see the punches coming, I was completely oblivious to the situation. 'To add further injury and to send some kind of message, one of them dealt the final blow when I was on the ground about to black out, causing me to lose total consciousness,' he wrote. Jack, seen here being transported from Koh Samui to Bangkok, has been recovering in the months following the attack . The 20-year-old had counter charges filed against him which accuse the young man of instigating the attack . 'When I regained some consciousness after this horrific attack, I found myself bleeding profusely from my right eye and mouth area missing teeth bone and gum tissue.' Jack also wrote about the impact the assault would have on the rest of his life. 'I intended to move back to Australia to embark on a new chapter of my life and reconnect with family ... 'Both attackers have been charged by the police with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. They have also been hit with a private criminal lawsuit. 'My family and I spend every day trying to fight... when all I want to do is be given time to rest and hopefully heal. It is time someone takes a stance against violence.' Ms Hansen revealed Purdue University launched a full disciplinary inquiry into the case, and requested the above impact statement. They have suspended Ryan Yunshang Wang for a year. Cornell University where Raymond Tony Chang is set to attend responded to the documents saying as the incident occurred before he had commenced classes at the establishment, they would not suspend him. Ms Hansen revealed the struggle to get justice for her son, saying Jack would go to prison rather than admitting guilt to something he didn't do . On the account of Jack's brother Jesse Hansen-Bartel, the night his sibling was beaten Jack headed out to a club called Green Mango with a girl he had met earlier in the day. Jesse, 24, and some of their friends were also at the establishment. When Jack arrived at the club, he was approached by two men who claimed the girl was with them. Jesse told Daily Mail Australia CCTV footage from the evening shows his brother walking away without any trouble. Later in the evening Jack was blindsided by two attackers and the bashing left him missing three teeth from his disfigured jaw, with blood spilling from his mouth and face. Ms Hansen said there has been suspicious and questionable circumstances surrounding her son's case. Jack's mother said she witnessed the public prosecutor in a meeting with the families of the two accused, which an army official told her was a 'highly irregular' occurrence. 'We're not playing that game, the charges against Jack don't exist', Ms Hansen said. 'Jack has said he will go to prison than plead guilty to something did not do.' '(And now) it looks like he could be faced with a choice between his freedom or potentially a Thai prison', she said. The case of murdered British travellers Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, on nearby Koh Tao last month is another where locals say suspicious activity has taken place. Ms Hansen said her story is apparently just the 'tip of the iceberg' when it comes to the treatment of such cases.","Jack Hansen-Bartel was viciously attacked at a nightclub earlier this year .

"'Devastated': Damien Hirst threw a party this weekend at his Toddington Manor home . He is said to be devastated by the end of his relationship with the mother of his three children. But Damien Hirst appeared to be putting on a brave face yesterday. The one-time bad boy of British art, who turned 47 last Thursday, went ahead with a party in the grounds of one of his country homes only hours after news broke that his partner Maia Norman had left him for former mercenary Colonel Tim Spicer. Hirst, the world’s richest artist, . had hired a funfair ride named ‘Freak Out’ for the party, along with a . full-size helter-skelter and another white-knuckle ride named The Rotor. Neighbours . said Hirst’s staff and their families were among the guests invited to . the bash in the grounds of his £3.5million farmhouse in Combe Martin, . North Devon. Yesterday . fans expressed their sympathy to Hirst after Miss Norman confirmed she . was leaving him after 19 years for former soldier-of-fortune Spicer, who . is 12 years older than the artist. Hirst was said to be shocked and devastated after she confessed to the affair several weeks ago. Eleven . days ago, California-born Miss Norman, 49, was photographed in . Hollywood tenderly kissing Spicer in front of 150 journalists attending a . car rally. She embraced her lover for a second time before the pair walked arm-in-arm into a hotel lobby. An . onlooker said: ‘They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see . each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a . fling.’ When approached and asked whether she was leaving Hirst for Spicer, Miss Norman said ‘yes’ before declining to speak further. Happier times: Hirst with Maia Norman last April. He went ahead with his party despite the separation . New man: Ms Norman with mercenary Tim Spicer at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel less than two months ago . Miss Norman and Mr Spicer were seen in a passionate embrace in Hollywood last month . Divorced Spicer, the father of a teenage son, remained silent, although yesterday a spokesman confirmed he did not deny the story. Spicer, 59, is a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Scots Guards and a Falklands veteran. He came to prominence through his company Sandline during the ‘arms-to-Africa’ controversy in 1998. He now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm that has won multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan. For his part, Leeds-born Hirst is the most successful living artist. His controversial works, which include a dead shark encased in formaldehyde and a skull made from diamonds, have helped him earn what is believed to be a £215million fortune. Last night, however, lawyers said Miss Norman might be entitled to very little of that money because the couple – whose children are aged 16, 12 and six – never married. Ayesha Vardag, of London solicitors Vardags, said: ‘They are not married and, in England, the rights of cohabitees are extremely limited, even if they have been in a relationship for a long time and even if they have three children. ‘It all depends on whether they have a . joint bank account and if her name is on the title deeds of the various . properties. If not, she could be entitled to very little for herself.’ As . well as the 300-year-old Grade II-listed Devon farmhouse, which is the . main family home, Hirst also owns a restaurant, a pub and an art studio. Toddington Manor: The £3 million home houses Hirst's art collection . In 2005, he paid £3million for Toddington Manor, a gothic pile in Gloucestershire that he is renovating to house his art collection, and he also owns a house in Thailand, a beach home in Mexico and a houseboat moored on the Thames in Chelsea. Although they never married, Hirst and Miss Norman used to refer to each other as husband and wife, and their relationship was seen as one of the art world’s most stable. Sources stressed their main priority now was the welfare of their children. It is not known how Spicer came to know Miss Norman but neighbours in Devon have speculated he could have helped to arrange the security guards who monitor the entrance to Hirst’s home.

"A 19-year-old woman who was victim of a horror smash where she became trapped in a flaming car has made a miraculous recovery. Psychology student Danica Pringle, from the Melbourne suburb of Cranbourne, was hospitalised for over three months and left in an induced coma for weeks following what police believe to be a street racing accident on June 5. Two of Ms Pringle's friends, who were behind the wheel also faced court on Tuesday charged over the crash. Danica Pringle, 19, (left) is in a critical condition after being trapped inside a flaming car on Thursday. Sam Newman, 19, and Brodie McGregor, 18 (right), also suffered injuries during the crash . Ms Pringle was left in a critical condition after the car she was in collided with a concrete pole and burst into flames on Thursday night in Melbourne's southeast . The 19-year-old was in the passenger side of a silver Ford Falcon (pictured) which is believed to have been involved in a drag race at the time of the incident . Despite being expected to die, after suffering significant burns to her body and going blind in one eye, the teenager has walked from hospital and spoken about the night that has changed her life forever. 'I've never really felt like I've had anything to overcome, I still feel really normal, I guess we could call that my fighting spirit,' she told the Herald Sun. 'I just really learnt to laugh and see the brighter side of things. The only thing I have trouble with is knowing what my friends will face for a silly mistake.' Ms Pringle, who is unable to remember the crash, was sitting in the passenger side of a silver Ford Falcon which was seen speeding down the South Gippsland Highway alongside a blue Holden Commodore, before it smashed into a pole and burst into flames. The driver of the Ford, Ms Pringle's friend, Brodie James McGregor,18, from Lynbrook, lost control of his vehicle at about 11:30pm before smashing into his friend's car which was driving beside him, veering the two vehicles off of the road and finally colliding with a concrete pole. Police believe the driver of the Ford, which was travelling in the inside lane, lost control of his vehicle and hit the commodore. 'Both cars ran off the road way, mounted the centre median strip and collided with a concrete pole.' said senior constable Adam West. Both drivers, Brodie James McGregor and another one of Ms Pringle's friends, Adam Phillip West, have been charged over the crash, which police believe was caused by street racing. But Ms Pringle, who isn't able to speak to both boys due to bail conditions preventing them, says she will support both boys in court. 'There wasn't a second I was with those boys and believed they were being unsafe behind the wheel,' she said to the Herald Sun. 'I just want people to know that it wasn’t a case of forgiveness for me, these people are and always will be in my heart no matter what.' After the crash happened, Ms Pringle remained trapped in the car from which she could hear screaming. Neighbours who heard the crash, soon attempted to aid the group of friends by throwing water onto the flaming vehicle, however the 19 year old remained trapped until emergency services arrived to free her. Once removed she was flown to the Melbourne's Alfred Hospital where she continued to fight for her life. The passenger in the Holden Commodore which was also involved in the race (pictured) was also rushed to hospital with serious abdominal injuries . The drivers of the cars were both taken to hospital however they only suffered minor injuries . Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Bentley told the Sun Herald, paramedics arrived at the scene within four minutes where they found both cars in flames. 'The CFA managed to put out the fire pretty quickly but she was trapped for about half-hour,' he said. The two drivers suffered minor injuries, while 19 year old passenger, Sam Newman was also injured in the crash. Detective Acting Sergeant Ben Howie told radio 3AW at the time, it was amazing that no one was killed in the crash. 'It's staggering that someone has survived, or anyone has survived this ... You've essentially got one vehicle on top of the other,' he said. The concrete pole which crushed the Ford¿s passenger door, trapping the woman from Cranbourne inside the fiery vehicle and is seen lying by the South Gippsland Highway . Police are still investigating the incident and are encouraging anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who has any information, to come forward . Ms Pringle has thanked family and friends and medical staff for helping her pull through and plans to use her degree as a psychology student, which she plans to finish in the future, to counsel people who have been through similar accidents. But before she does that, there will be a long road to recovery which will include rehabilitation to get things back to normal. 'I’m weaker but I feel like everything’s slowly going back to normal, some of these things will heal and we won't know how much until we can see it first-hand.,' she told the Herald Sun. 'I don't have the freedom I did, I can't go wherever I want whenever I want.'","Danica Pringle walks from hospital three months on after being the victim of a horror 'drag racing' crash in Melbourne .

"BP has pulled its entire fleet of trucks off the road in Victoria after three people were killed in an accident involving one of their vehicles on Thursday morning. Around 9am one of its tankers was travelling down Wodonga-Yakandanda Road in north-east Victoria when it lost its trailer.

"A father has told how he watched his drag racer son flip his super-charged car at more than 300km/h only to race in his own high-speed run 30 minutes later. Victor Bray witnessed Ben Bray's horrific accident in Queensland on Saturday but, as Ben was rescued by medics from his wrecked car at Willowbank Raceway, the 30-year-old told his dad to still compete. Neither of them were aware that Ben had suffered potentially life-changing injuries - he was left with six fractured ribs and three fractured vertebrae. 'After watching the crash I had to race myself in 30 minutes. I didn't know how injured he was,' Victor told the Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Flipped: Ben Bray's car crashed just 150 metres off the start line in Queensland on Saturday . It started off well: Ben was competing in the Winternationals at the Willowbank Raceway . 'It wasn't easy... Ben told me to go. It was nerve wracking getting in the car. I kept thinking about what I had just seen.' The crash can be seen in a dramatic video from the day, which shows how Ben's black Nissan Altima veered to the right about 150m off the start line. It smashed into the wall roof-first before sliding meters down the track upside-down, crushing Ben. The family drag racing team were competing in the Winternationals - the biggest drag racing event outside America - and it was a big date on the calender for Team Bray, who live in Queensland. When it went wrong: The car got air under it and lifted off the ground . Dramatic: The car began flying towards the wall of the race track as onlookers watched horrified . On its side: Ben's father Victor also witnessed the huge crash . Telling his dad to go and race wasn't the only unlikely thing Ben, 30, did when he escaped from the ravaged vehicle. 'He was out of the car and in a bit of pain but grabbed a selfie with the medics,' Victor laughed. Unfortunately as the swelling set in on his injuries the pain also set in. Victor explained his son is still undergoing tests but 'the main thing the doctor is worried about is a really bad vertebrae break'. Scary: Victor Bray (right) watched as his son Ben (left) rolled his car in the dramatic crash . Smash: Parts of the car flew into the air as it hit the wall . Ravaged: The car was destroyed by the time it came to a halt . The drag racing champion said that Ben has got full feeling in his legs and arms but they are not sure about the extent of damage yet. 'One of the operations we've been offered is very severe and it could limit his movement forever,' he said. Ben is not talking properly but is conscious. 'He's still drugged up and in a lot of pain... today is the first day he can say 'yes' or 'no',' Victor revealed on Monday. The father also described how awful it was to watch his son in the dramatic crash, doing the thing that they both love. Record breaker: Ben had just set a world record before in the same car . 'It was bad. You always wonder and know it's going to happen down the track.' 'The car got air under it and lifted off the ground... It all happened real quick, he lost control of the area package in the car once it lifted.' The racing expert explained: '99 per cent of the time when you crash you are going to run straight into a wall but the aeordynamics in this car led it to lift.' The proud father said: 'Ben just set a world record before that in the same car... now we know it obviously needs more downforce. Stepping into the world record zone you are taking risks' 'He's very lucky... he's got a lot to be thankful.'","Ben Bray, 30, crashed at the Willowbank Raceway in Queensland .

"The US and Russia have promised to set a date for a long-awaited 'peace conference' aimed at ending the bloodshed in Syria once and for all, Secretary of State John Kerry has revealed. Dubbed 'Geneva 2', the summit will see top brass from both countries meet to thrash out a solution to the civil war that has raged since March 2011 at a cost of more than 100,000 lives. Speaking after today's talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Mr Kerry said they planned to meet again on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month to try and set a date for the conference. However, the vow comes as rebels claim President Assad is simply using the Russians to 'buy time' so he can continue killing with the conventional arsenal he still has at his disposal despite a promise to relinquish his chemical weapons. US officials also claimed one of Assad's secretive military units has been moving chemical weapons to as many as 50 different sites over the last few months, just in case America attack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Vow of action: Speaking after today's talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Mr Kerry said they planned to meet again on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month to try and set a date for the conference . Free Syrian Army spokesperson Louay Moqdad told the BBC Assad still . has plenty of conventional weapons at his disposal and he is attempting . to 'buy time' with the help of the Russians. Meanwhile, as American and Russian chemical weapons experts huddled in a Geneva hotel to haggle over technical details that will be critical to reach a deal, Mr Kerry and Mr Lavrov met with UN-Arab League envoy Lakdar Brahimi to examine political developments and plot a new international conference to support the creation of Syrian transitional government. Mr Kerry, flanked by Mr Lavrov and Mr Brahimi, told reporters at the UN in Geneva after an hour-long meeting on the second day of their talks that the chances for a second peace conference in Geneva 'will obviously depend on the capacity to have success here ... on the subject of the chemical weapons.' Mr Brahimi also met privately with Mr . Kerry at a Geneva hotel yesterday to explore ways to resume . international negotiations last held in Geneva in June 2012 aimed at . ending the Syrian civil war. Agreed: Dubbed 'Geneva 2', the summit will see top brass from both countries meet to thrash out a solution to the civil war that has raged since March 2011 at a cost of more than 100,000 lives . Mr Lavrov said it was 'very unfortunate that for a long time that the Geneva communique was basically abandoned.' Mr Kerry and Mr Lavrov announced they . would meet again in New York toward the end of the month to try to fix a . date for second conference. When the talks began yesterday, Mr . Kerry bluntly rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a 'standard process' by . turning over information rather than weapons - and nothing immediately. The American diplomat said that was not acceptable. 'Buying time': However, the vow comes as rebels claim President Assad is simply using the Russians to 'buy time' so he can continue killing . 'The words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough,' Mr Kerry declared as he stood beside Mr Lavrov. 'This is not a game.' The talks were the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the August 21 gas attack on suburbs in Damascus. The US blames Syrian President Bashar Assad for the use of chemical weapons, although Mr Assad denies his government was involved and instead points to rebels engaged in a two-year-old civil war against his government. President Barack Obama began building a case for support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on Mr Assad's forces, then changed course and asked Congress to give him explicit authority for a limited strike. With the prospect that he might lose a vote on action, Mr Obama said he would consider a Russian proposal calling for international control of Mr Assad's chemical weapons and their eventual destruction. Mr Obama dispatched Mr Kerry to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of US military action. 'We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,' Mr Kerry said on the opening day of talks. The turnover of weapons must be complete, verifiable and timely, he said, 'and, finally, there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place.' Mr Lavrov seemed to contradict Mr Kerry's negative view of Mr Assad's offer to provide details on his country's chemical arsenal beginning 30 days after it signs an international convention banning such weapons. Syria's ambassador to the United Nations said that as of yesterday his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons. Big decisions: Barack Obama (left) dispatched Mr Kerry (right) to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of US military action in Syria . While the diplomacy continues, the conflict rumbles on. A Syrian government solider is pictured in Maaloula village, northeast of the capital Damascus . The Russian said the initiative must proceed 'in strict compliance with the rules that are established by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.' That suggests Russia does not agree with the US that this is an exceptional case and that Syria should face tougher standards than other countries. 'We proceed from the fact that the solution to this problem will make unnecessary any strike on the Syrian Arab Republic, and I am convinced that our American colleagues, as President Obama stated, are firmly convinced that we should follow a peaceful way of resolution to the conflict in Syria,' Mr Lavrov said. The distrust in US-Russia relations was on display even in an off-hand parting exchange at the news conference. Just before it ended, Mr Kerry asked the Russian translator to repeat part of Mr Lavrov's concluding remarks. When it was clear that Mr Kerry wasn't going to get an immediate retranslation, Mr Lavrov apparently tried to assure him that he hadn't said anything controversial . 'It was OK, John, don't worry,' he said. 'You want me to take your word for it?' Mr Kerry asked Mr Lavrov. 'It's a little early for that.' They were smiling at that point. Shortly after making their opening statements, the two went into a private dinner. Mr Assad, in an interview with Russia's Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also said the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the US halted threats of military action. Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that Syria's efforts have demonstrated its good faith. 'I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis,' Putin said at a At a meeting in Kyrgyzstan of an international security grouping dominated by Russia and China. Even as diplomacy took centre stage, word surfaced that the CIA has been delivering light machine guns and other small arms to Syrian rebels for several weeks, following mr Obama's statement in June that he would provide lethal aid to the rebels. US intelligence officials said the CIA has arranged for the Syrian opposition to receive anti-tank weaponry such as rocket-propelled grenades through a third party, presumably one of the Gulf countries that have been arming the rebels.","'Geneva 2' will take place on fringes of UN General Assembly later this month .

"A never-before-heard tape of Monica Lewinsky reportedly telling then-President Bill Clinton that she could 'take all my clothes off' if he agreed to an illicit meeting with her has surfaced today. The tape, which records the White House intern desperately trying to lure him into meeting her, was reportedly released to the National Enquirer after it was obtained by a cleaner hired by friends of Lewinsky. It was long thought that the raunchy four-minute tape, which was recorded in November 1997, had been destroyed after the sexual affair was revealed in 1998, according to the Enquirer. The recording, made months after their final alleged trust in March 1997, reportedly shows a determined Lewinsky, then 24, pleading with the married president to meet her - and telling him she plans to be persistent because 'I really want to see you'. Revelations: An image from November 1995 shows President Bill Clinton and intern Monica Lewinsky - two years before she reportedly made an audio tape begging for him to meet with her . She adds that she is 'too cute and adorable' to be ignored, according to the magazine. MailOnline has contacted a Clinton representative for comment on the latest reports. On the recording, she offers Clinton two choices - that she could meet him at his office, or that they could watch a movie together. 'Since I know you will be alone tomorrow evening, I have two proposals for you, neither of which is you not seeing me,' she says, the National Enquirer reported. 'I could take my clothes off and start… . well… I know you wouldn't enjoy that? I hope to see you later and I hope . you will follow my script and do what I want.' Former life: Lewinsky, who is pictured in March this year, was just 24 at the time of the recording . Together: At the time of the affair between 1995 and 1997, he was married to Hillary Clinton, pictured in April. There are concerns that these revelations could upset her expected run for the White House . She tells Clinton that his secretary, . Betty Currie, should plan his schedule so that they could get away with . not formally recording the meeting, according to the magazine. For one plan, she instructs him to tell Currie that he was going to leave the office around 7pm the next evening before returning later that evening. 'In the meantime I quickly sneak over and . then we can have a nice little visit for, you know, 15 minutes or half . an hour. Whatever you want,' she says. Her second suggestion is meeting him for a movie 'and just have kind of, I don¹t know, boxed dinners or . something like that', she says. She adds: 'You can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over.' Look of love: Lewinsky and Clinton are pictured together in December 1996. On the tape, she reportedly told him she could take off her clothes or suggested they went to a movie and had dinner together . Close: The pair embrace on November 6 1996 during a ceremony gathering the White House interns . Tapes and letters obtained by the National Enquirer reportedly show Monica Lewinsky desperate to meet with Clinton as their affair came to an end. Excerpts from the tape: . 'Since I know you will be alone tomorrow evening, I have two proposals for you, neither of which is you not seeing me. So just deal with it!' 'I [can] quickly sneak over and then we can have a nice little visit for, you know, 15 minutes or half an hour. Whatever you want. I would really, really, really, really, really like that... 'My other proposal... maybe we could go over and watch a movie together and just have kind of, I don't know, boxed dinners or something... 'Those are the two proposals and you can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over... 'I'm very persistent but I really want to see you... I could take all my clothes off and start...' Excerpts from the letters: . 'It was so sad seeing you last night . because I was so angry with you that you once again rejected me and yet, . all I wanted was for everyone else in the room to disappear and for you . to hold me. I loved you with all of my heart, Bill. 'For the life of me, I can't understand how you could be so kind and so cruel to me... 'What did I do to deserve this? I am seriously depressed . because of everything that has happened... I have lost profoundly both . professionally and personally, and in a toss-up, our personal . relationship changing has caused me more pain.' She tells him that he should tell Currie what he wanted to do so she could call her 'so I don¹t have to stress out all day and . I don¹t have to call her every two hours and bug her because, I know . you will find this very hard to believe, but I can be a pain in the ass . sometimes'. 'I'm very persistent, but um… I really want to see you,' she says. The Enquirer reported that Lewinsky played the tape for Linda Tripp, who later revealed telephone tapes of the intern which led to Clinton's impeachment. Tripp reportedly heard it on November 20, 1997 and it was taken to the Oval Office the next day, but it is not known if a rendezvous ever occurred. In the audio, Lewinsky explained that she had decided to record it because she couldn't face writing him another letter. The Enquirer reported that the tape - and begging love letters Lewinsky wrote to Clinton - were obtained by a cleaner who was hired by friends of Lewinsky's. 'I was supposed to shred everything in late 1998, but for some reason I kept this material,' the cleaner told the Enquirer. The pleading notes reportedly reveal Lewinsky . begging Clinton to make time for her and to explain why he ended their . illicit romance. 'It was so sad seeing you last night . because I was so angry with you that you once again rejected me and yet, . all I wanted was for everyone else in the room to disappear and for you . to hold me,' she wrote. 'I loved you with all of my heart, Bill. 'For the life of me, I can't understand how you could be so kind and so cruel to me.' Another . letter asks: 'What did I do to deserve this? I am seriously depressed . because of everything that has happened... 'I have lost profoundly both . professionally and personally, and in a toss-up, our personal . relationship changing has caused me more pain.' Vehement: Clinton initially denied the affair with Lewinsky in January 1998 - but later admitted to it . Lewinsky was just 22 when she allegedly had the first of nine sexual encounters with the president between November 1995 and March 1997. Details of the affair emerged in 1998. In the wake of the scandal, Lewinsky became the center of a political storm and gave a series of high-profile interviews. But unable to escape the shake the . reputation, she moved to England in 2005 where she earned her master's . degree and worked as a news correspondent for the UK's Channel Five . News. Though it has been 15 . years since her claims, her presence still looms in the life of . Clinton's post-presidency and Hillary's political career. And . sources told the National Enquirer that this most recent revelation . could derail Hillary's expected bid for the White House in 2016. Out and about: Lewinsky, who is now 40, is pictured out in New York last October . Damage? Hillary and Bill Clinton are pictured in Little Rock, Arkansas earlier this month . 'The Clintons thought this sex tape was dead and buried,' said the source. 'If this tape and other material are surfacing now, imagine what else must be out there?' It comes at an already embarrassing moment for the Clintons as they deal with yet another sexting scandal surrounding mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner. His wife, Huma Abedin, is one of Hillary's top aides - but is taking an extended vacation to deal with the upset following news of her husband's latest indiscretions.","Newly-released tapes 'reveal White House intern, then 24, asking the president to meet her for a movie or at his office in November 1997'

"Lucky: Seven is seen as the world's favourite number - and it appears across many cultures and religions . Stop any person in the street and ask them to choose an odd number between 1 and 10. More often not, they will say the number 7. For ‘lucky 7’ is the world’s favourite number. There are seven days of the week, seven colours of the rainbow, seven notes on a musical scale, seven seas and seven continents. Snow White ran off to live with seven dwarves, there were seven brides for seven brothers, Shakespeare described the seven ages of man, Sinbad the Sailor had seven voyages. And when Ian Fleming was looking for a code for James Bond, he didn’t go for 006 or 008. Only 007 had the right ring. This week, a poll of 30,000 people confirmed that 7 is overwhelmingly our favourite number — with 3 in second place. A remarkable ten per cent of those surveyed gave 7 — from the infinite choice of numbers available — as their lucky number. But why do we prefer some  numbers to others? What is so special about 7? And how can something  as dry as a number generate such strong emotions? Our fascination with certain numbers goes back to the dawn of recorded history. For the Ancient Babylonians the most meaningful number was 60. They based their mathematics and calendar around it — and we, many centuries later, have inherited their system. That’s why an hour has 60 minutes, and a minute 60 seconds. In Ancient Egypt, 12 was considered special. In Egyptian mythology there were 12 realms of the dead. Indeed, 12 crops up throughout history — inches to a foot, pennies to a shilling, months of the year, the number of apostles. A day is split into two cycles of 12 hours. There are sensible reasons to venerate 60 and 12. Both divide neatly into halves, quarter and thirds, making them ideal units of currency and measurement. But that doesn’t explain why humans are still so hung up on 7 — a prime number that cannot neatly be divided by anything other than itself and number 1. Ian Fleming chose 007 over other numbers and Walt Disney chose seven dwarfs for Snow White . Mathematician Alex Bellos, who carried out the survey as part of research for his book on maths, Alex Through The Looking Glass, says an emotional attachment to numbers — and 7 in particularly — is surprisingly common. ‘When I give talks about maths and ask the audience if they have a favourite number, half stick up their hands,’ he says. ‘I suppose we are all a little bit obsessive compulsive. It’s comforting to have a favourite number.’ Favourite numbers are usually linked to birthdays, anniversaries or house numbers. But some people have the strangest reasons. When asked why she voted for 7 in the poll, one woman said: ‘It is a bit awkward; it can’t be equally divided and won’t bend to the rules so easily.’ Bellos argues that some numbers are inherently more appealing than others. Small numbers tend to be more popular than large ones, for example. We are most familiar with the numbers 1 to 10, and tend to pick our favourites from those. Most people see odd numbers as more exotic than even ones. ‘Our brains see numbers and want to try to split them in two,’ says Bellos. ‘They can’t do that with odd numbers so people feel their “personalities” are different and more appealing.’ Can numbers be funny? Author Joseph Heller spent some time deciding that 22 was funnier than 11 or 14 . We also seem to be attracted to prime numbers. Again, the fact that we can’t divide them cleanly makes them more distinctive. So when looking for a favourite number, that makes 3, 5 and 7 the most likely candidates. But Bellos’s survey also revealed people don’t like numbers ending in 5. We are so used to rounding up numbers to the nearest multiple of 10 that numbers finishing in 5 seem oddly unsatisfactory. That knocks 5 out the running, and three — the second favourite — misses out on first place, possibly because it is just too mundane. After all, we see groups of 3 everywhere we look: traffic lights with 3 colours, sets of knives, forks and spoons, 3 hands on a clock, 3 meals a day. So the less common 7, then, takes the crown. If you don’t believe our brains behave as predictably as this, try this mind-reading test on a family member or friend. Ask them to think of a two-digit number less than 50. Tell them both the digits must be odd and different. Say that they can’t have 11 but could have 13. When psychologists tried this in experiments, more than a third chose 37. The trick works because there are actually only eight numbers someone is allowed to choose from — 13, 15, 17, 19, 31, 35, 37 and 39. And by mentioning the number 13 in the preamble, you put them off that one. But time after time, despite having 7 combinations of numbers to choose from, the lure of 7 combined with the second favourite number 3 draws people to choose 37. It’s a prime number and the most ‘exotic’. And what about the numbers we don’t like? In Alex Bellos’s poll, people could nominate any whole number they liked. The lowest number that had no nominations was 110. Hebrew tradition states seven is the number of intelligence, and there are seven Great Holy Days in the Jewish year. Elsewhere, the traditional Menorah, pictured, has seven branches . Bellos is unsure why. However, his research has shown people aren’t as keen on numbers ending in 0 — perhaps because we are so used to seeing numbers rounded to the nearest 10 and so it loses its distinctiveness. If numbers can be attractive, can they also be funny? Are there people for whom 88 brings a wry smile, but who’d never laugh at 50? Joseph Heller, author of the war satire Catch-22 spent ages discussing numbers with his agent before deciding that 22 was funnier than 11 or 14. Douglas Adams, the creator of A Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, said he chose 42 as the answer to the ‘ultimate question of life, the universe and everything’ because it was an ‘ordinary, smallish number’. He was right. The joke works because the answer — worked out by the most powerful computer in existence over seven-and-a-half-million years —is a crushing anti-climax. Fear of the number thirteen is called Triskaidekaphobia, a word coined in 1911, and superstitious sufferers associate the number with bad luck and misfortune. In Tarot cards, Death is the thirteenth card in a deck, while the end of the Mayan calendar's 13th Baktun, or cycle, was said to be the time of the apocalypse in 2012. In religion, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ in the Bible, was the thirteenth member at the last supper. Friday the 13th is considered the unluckiest day of the month. But in Italy, 13 is considered a lucky number, especially when gambling, whereas 17 is considered unlucky. Although it is not known why these numbers hold this significance in Italy, 17 is linked with bad luck because when written in Roman numerals XVII, it can be rearranged to spell the Roman word VIXI meaning ‘I have lived’ - found on ancient tombstones. Alex Bellos’s poll only asked people for their favourite number. But if it had asked for the number they hate, the answer would inevitably have been 13. The fear of 13 — or Triskaidekaphobia — is so widespread that one in ten people are thought to suffer from it. Many large hotels go straight from the 12th to the 14th floor. No one knows why 13 is thought to be unlucky, but there are many theories. One is that it represents Judas Iscariot, the 13th apostle, who betrayed Jesus at the Last Supper. Another is that it comes from Norse lore, where evil was introduced to the world by the mischievous god Loki at a party in Valhalla, the home of the gods. According to the legend, he was the 13th guest to arrive. The grip of 13 is so great that the risk of having a road accident goes up on Friday the 13th. Not because the day is unlucky, but because superstitious drivers tended to be more anxious — and so more accident prone. Getting hung up about numbers can also reduce your odds of winning a fortune. People who pick ‘lucky’ numbers such as 3 and 7 are just as likely to win the lottery as people who pick numbers out of the hat. But if they hit the jackpot, they have to split the cash with more winners. That’s what happened on November 14, 1995, when 133 tickets shared the £16 million prize — each winner got just £120,000. The winning numbers were 7, 17, 23, 32, 38, 42 and 48 — all popular numbers with players. There are some occasions when 7 is not so lucky after all.","Seven is the most significant number across religions and cultures .

"Alan Pardew has been named as Crystal Palace boss after being released from his contract at Newcastle United. The former West Ham United and Charlton Athletic manager will take charge of the FA Cup tie with Dover Athletic on Sunday after signing a three-and-a-half year deal at Selhurst Park. Palace confirmed the appointment of Pardew, a former midfielder at the south London club, on Saturday morning, for a compensation package believed to be £3.5million. Alan Pardew has been unveiled as Crystal Palace's new manager after leaving Newcastle United . Newcastle United confirmed the departure of their former management on Saturday morning . Pardew will manage Crystal Palace's FA Cup third round clash at Dover after leaving Newcastle . Pardew was at Palace's training ground on Friday for just under 12 hours as he started life at his new club . Pardew will lead his first game with Palace after they agreed a £3.5million compensation deal with Newcastle . Upon taking the role, Pardew said: 'I am absolutely delighted to be the new manager of Crystal Palace. 'Everyone knows my history here, what's important now is to move the club to the next level. I believe with the backing of Steve and the board I can help achieve that and create some new exciting history for the club.' In a statement, Eagles chairman Steve Parish said: 'We wanted a manager with a great track record and proven experience in the Barclays Premier League. In Alan we have both these things as well as a man who has great affection for this club and shares my determination to take us to the next level.' Football's worst-kept secret was finally made public on Saturday morning, two days after the 53-year-old, who spent more than four years on Tyneside, sat in the stands and watched his Palace team draw 0-0 at Aston Villa. In his first interview with the Crystal Palace website, Pardew continued: 'It's been a while since I've been here but of course it's nice to be back to a club that's close to my heart in terms of my playing career. I think it's an opportunity where I think I can help the club. Caretaker boss Keith Millen took charge of Palace's 0-0 draw at Aston Villa on New Year's Day . Pardew (centre) stands with Palace chairman Steve Parish in the stands during the Villa game . 'It was difficult because I'm leaving a big club in Newcastle and it was a choice which I decided to make because I felt it was right for myself and for my family and my career. 'Every time I've come back here it's always been a lovely welcome and a nice feeling and I knew at some point I would have worked for this club because really my home is in this area. This is about as close as I can to class a club as my own club. 'We need to bring something back to those fans who are so noisy it's unbelievable. We need to give something back to those fans, particularly that little corner who just never stop, and we need to keep them because they give real power to this club. 'Without putting any undue pressure on the chairman or the board, we've had a few discussions where I feel we're going to need a player or two at least and that's what we're going to try and do.' A statement from the Magpies said: 'Newcastle United can confirm that Alan Pardew has been released from his contract in order to be installed as the new manager of Crystal Palace. 'John Carver and Steve Stone will be in the dug-out for at least today's fixture, the club's FA Cup third round fixture at Leicester City. The search for a head coach has begun and an announcement will follow in due course.' Stone and Carver will take charge of Newcastle's trip to Leciester City in the FA Cup on Saturday having already been in control for Thursday's 3-3 draw with Burnley in the Premier League. Speaking to Newcastle's website, Pardew said: 'It has been a privilege to manage Newcastle United and I want to thank my captainFabricio Coloccini and all the players, John Carver, Steve Stone, Andy Woodman and all the staff, all of who have been outstanding servants to Newcastle United. Eagles midfielder James McArthur (right) is a doubt for the match after injuring himself at Villa . 'A special thanks also goes to the fans for all their support over the last four years. I must also thank Mike Ashley and the board for their unwavering support during my tenure at the Club.' Meanwhile, Newcastle managing director, Lee Charnley, said after Pardew's departure: 'I would like to thank Alan for his service to the Club. 'Despite public perceptions, fuelled by the media, Mike Ashley had never met nor spoken to Alan before his appointment. However, what developed over the last four years was a very strong and positive relationship between all parties. 'It is these relationships that, four years later, means the Club is in a far better position, both on and off the field, and Alan has had a big part to play in that. 'During his time with us, Alan achieved two top-ten Premier League finishes, including a fifth-place finish in 2012, as well as taking us to the quarter-final of the Europa League. He goes with our best wishes and thanks.'

"Finding yourself in dangerous situations is something of an occupational hazard for nature and wildlife documentary presenters. But vet turned television host Steve Leonard had a closer call than many when he took a speed boat ride around glaciers with Arctic expert Jason Roberts. While filming the BBC documentary Incredible Journeys, the pair got a little bit too close to a glacier as huge chunks of ice crack and fall off the giant frozen mound and crash into the water. Scroll down for video . Close call: Steve Leonard and Jason Roberts had a lucky escape when a glacier crashed down just yards from their boat while they were filming a BBC documentary . Crash: The pair's boat rocks violently as sheets of ice crash into the sea causing waves and sending frozen debris flying towards the boat . Dangerous: Steve Leonard shields his face as shards of ice fly towards the boat . Just moments earlier the pair had been directly underneath the section of the glacier that collapsed when their boat's engine got clogged up by floating ice particles. As Steve and Jason sat in the cove trying to get the engine running again, small pieces of ice began dropping into the water creating small waves that made the boat start to rock. As the smaller sections of ice collapse, Steve watches in awe and exclaims: 'I don't want that in the boat.' They manage to get the boat going again and move out of the glacier's cove around the face of the ice which stands at around 40 or 50 metres high. Racing away: Steve looks back as Jason puts the boat into full throttle and speeds away from the glacier . Collapse: A huge section of the ice tumbled off the giant frozen mound and into the ocean . Just as the pair have passed a second sheet of ice tumbles from the glacier into the icy sea. Steve points out that an enormous block right at the top of the glacier looks almost certain to fall at any time and he and Jason move the boat slightly further away to safety. He tells Jason: 'That whole front is going to go at some point.' Suddenly, a giant chunk of ice splits from the glacier's top making a thundering cracking sound and turning the water beneath it choppy. Treacherous: The pair had sailed dangerously close to the glacier which shows huge cracks . Jason is startled into life and puts the boat to full throttle to get as far away from the falling ice as possible. As the boat speeds off chunks of flying debris fly towards Steve and Jason narrowly missing them as they gleefully shout. Thankfully, both men and their boat make it to safety without getting hurt. And it seems that Steve might think twice before getting up so close to a glacier again. He tells the camera: 'That was a bit too close for comfort'.

"Silicon Valley proved on Tuesday that the tech world wants you to vote -- but who do they want you to vote for? Tech giant Google, based in the Democratic stronghold of California, teamed up with youth turnout-focused Rock the Vote along with other groups to create a tool on their homepage that directs uninformed voters to their polling place. 'The voting process can often feel complicated, with the information about how to head to the polls spread across multiple official sources,' wrote Google executive and former Obama campaigner Anthea Watson Strong. Are you voting? Facebook and Google want to know. And apps like this, which sprung up for Facebook users across America today, want to spread the word...but who are they targeting? Polling places: Google built a widget into certain search results today that allows uninformed users to easily find their poling place . In order to remedy this, Google homepage users who click on an animated ballot box are whisked over to a list of how-to-vote results. At the top of the page is a box where users must simply enter their address to be shown their polling place. As WebProNews notes, 'register to vote' or 'how do I vote' searches will lead users to a list of area-specific results. Facebook, another San Francisco Bay area company, has gotten in on the action, too. Users of the social media site have the option of clicking an 'I'm a voter' button at the top of their page to brag to friends, family and co-workers that they cast their ballot this year. Left wing magazine The New Republic boasted after Election Day 2010 about a study that showed the tactic 'ultimately caused an additional 340,000 votes to be cast that day' after the Facebook app mobilized 60,000 voters. Ballot box: The homepage of Google on Tuesday looked like this. A click on the rotating ballot box took users to a tool that showed them where to vote and for whom they could cast their ballots . Uber suspicious? In Colorado, where incumbent Democrat Mark udall is having a tough time of it this election year, Uber  in Denver has offered a cut rate for voters who want to use the car service to get to the polls . The rest of the votes, the study concluded, were caused by a ripple effect within Facebook communities. Another hard left wing publication, Mother Jones, wrote--as if it were someplace to celebrate--of how Facebook tweaked its analytics prior to Election 2012 in order to goad users into hitting the voting booths. Via NPR: . 'Facebook increased the amount of hard news stories at the top of the feeds of 1.9 million users. According to one Facebook data scientist, that change—which users were not alerted to—measurably increased civic engagement and voter turnout.' Up-and-coming tech giant Uber is also helping people get to the polls, reports the Hill. In Denver--where Democratic incumbent Senator Mark Udall is desperately trying to fend off a Republican challenger--the company has offered carless voters a cut rate if they use the app to get to their polling place. It's clear that Silicon Valley wants Americans to vote, but less clear is why. Google's campaign spending has increased forty-fold in the last eight years, writes the National Journal, and while the beneficiaries are split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, the minds and executives behind the company may not be. CEO Eric Schmidt has personally donated $527,214  to political causes in 2014, $250,000 of which went to the Democratic Senate Majority PAC. Previous recipients of the billionaire's campaign contributions include Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and liberal U.S. Senate stalwart Barbara Boxer.

"Rep. Trent Franks got in hot water Tuesday when his argument against a rape exception in a bill limiting access to abortion was compared to campaign-ending comments last August from Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin . Congressman Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican who is advocating for a bill that would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, putting back on the front burner an embarrassing episode from the 2012 election season. A Missouri Republican Senate candidate lost the female vote by 22 percentage points last year after claiming in August that the human body naturally protects victims of 'legitimate rape' from becoming pregnant. Franks similarly dismissed on Tuesday the idea that women who have been raped should be permitted to terminate their pregnancies whenever they choose. He recalled past debates 'when my friends on the left side of the aisle here tried to make rape and incest the subject.' 'Because, you know, the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.' 'But when you make that exception, there’s usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours. And in this case that’s impossible because this is in the sixth month of gestation.' Todd Akin, a former congressman who lost his bid to unseat Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in a landslide in November, faced national condemnation - and was abandoned by the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee - after saying that ‘if it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down.’ Akin later tried to walk his statement back, clarifying that by 'legitimate rape,' he meant to focus on cases where women have made false claims about being sexually assaulted. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin's campaign came to an ignominious end after he said in August that victims of 'legitimate rape' are protected from pregnancies by their own female bodies . Rep. Franks and his staff have been similarly backing off of Tuesday's statement, and insisting that he didn't mean to suggest anything along the lines of Akin's controversial foot-in-mouth moment. 'The congressman's intended point,' wrote communications director Ben Carnes in an email to MailOnline, 'was regarding the number of abortions after the beginning of the 6th month' of pregnancy ... not the number of rapes that result in pregnancies.' The bill under debate, which Franks sponsored and which the House Judiciary Committee approved Wednesday on a 20-12 vote, would take effect in the third trimester of gestation, and Franks addressed this directly in a statement to MailOnline. 'Pregnancies from rape that result in abortion after the beginning of the sixth month are very rare,' he claimed. 'This bill does not address unborn children in earlier gestations. Indeed, the bill does nothing to restrict abortions performed before the beginning of the 6th month.' California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren let loose on Franks: 'The idea that Republican men on this committee think they can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous' Still, Democratic partisans are hopping mad and quickly tried to link Franks with Akin. 'Like Akin's, Franks's claim is not supported by research,' wrote the liberal Huffington Post. 'Medical experts agree that rape does not lower the incidence of pregnancy, and one study by the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that more than 30,000 pregnancies result from rape in the United States each year.' And The Washington Post noted a 2011 study from San Francisco State University that studied women in the South American nation of Colombia, concluding that 'female youth who have experienced sexual violence report significantly higher levels of unintended pregnancy ... compared to those who have not experienced sexual violence.' After Akin's comment made national news in August 2012, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reported that between 10,000 and 15,000 women in the U.S. obtain abortions each year following rape- or incest-related pregnancies . The Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University found that rape victims in Colombia were more likely to become pregnant . 'There is absolutely no veracity' to Akin's claim, the organization insisted. to the claim that . 'A woman who is raped has no control over ovulation, fertilization, or implantation of a fertilized egg (ie, pregnancy). To suggest otherwise contradicts basic biological truths.' Franks' bill, The District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, includes an exception for women whose pregnancies are measured at 20 weeks or longer whose lives are threatened if they don't abort their pregnancies. Frank Thorp, an NBC News producer who covers Capitol Hill, interviewed Franks Tuesday evening and reported that the congressman said 'the reality is, it's not Republicans that are talking about this. It's Democrats that keep forcing the rape issue into this debate. They've done it ever since Roe v. Wade.' Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, leapt into the debate Tuesday after Franks made his position known, arguing that no man should be making health policy which could affect young women.. that her colleagues were in not a position understand what goes on in the life or mind of a young girl in crisis. 'The idea that Republican men on this committee think they can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous,' she said. Franks said in a statement after the Judiciary Committee's vote that “[k]nowingly subjecting our innocent unborn children to dismemberment in the womb, particularly when they have developed to the point that they can feel excruciating pain every terrible moment leading up to their undeserved deaths, belies everything America was called to be.' 'This is not who we are.'","Rep Trent Franks claimed during a House committee debate that 'the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low'

"Once relatively thin, the ‘Butcher of Brooklyn’ has bulked up whilst at Rikers. Levi Aron, who is accused of slaughtering and dismembering 8-year-old Leiby Kletzky after giving him a ride in a Hasidic neighbourhood in Brooklyn last year, has ballooned out considerably, adding at least 50 pounds to his 5ft8 frame. He has also grown a full beard during his time behind bars, looking almost unrecognizable from the grim-faced arrested last year. Heavy matters: Levi Aron, the confessed killer of an 8-year-old Hasidic boy, has gained a significant amount of weight while in jail at Rikers . Lean times: Aron, seen in an undated picture, left, and during his July 14, 2011 arraignment in Brooklyn criminal court in New York; the 5ft8 man has become heavy in his time at Rikers . Tragic: Leiby Kletzky, 8, asked Aron for directions home on July 11, 2011, and was then brutally murdered and mutilated . Aron was last seen in court in March looking relatively thin, but made a video appearance from Rikers Island today looking bloated. A lawyer in the courtroom during Aron’s video appearance quipped: ‘He’s definitely not working out,’ according to the New York Post. In the video, Aron is seen in a dark, long-sleeved shirt, wearing a wristwatch and a yarmulke, reclined slightly and with his gut protruding. Aron’s defence lawyers said in court last year that their client suffered from psychotic disorders, and he was placed on suicide watch. He is next scheduled to appear in court July 27. Last July, Leiby got lost on his walk home from a religious day camp - called yeshiva - and asked Aron, whom he met on the street, for help. It was the first time the little boy was allowed to walk alone, and he was supposed to travel seven blocks to meet his mother but missed a turn. Aron, a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home and when they returned, they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said. He remained there the next day when Aron went to work, and the disappearance sparked a major search effort in his insular community, which teaches its children to be wary of the secular world and avoid interactions with strangers. Standing guard: Members of the NYPD stood guard in front of the residence of Leibby Kletzky, whose dismembered body was found partially in a suitcase inside a dumpster and partially in a refrigerator in a nearby apartment . Booking: Levi Aron, right,  is seen being led into the 67th Precinct by police July 14, 2011 . Saying goodbye: The close-knit Hasidic community said goodbye to the boy in a funeral in Borough Park on July 13, 2011; the crime rocked the Jewish sect to the core . The boy's picture was plastered on light posts around the area. ‘When I saw the fliers, I was panicky and afraid,’  Aron explained, according to police.

"Slumping sales have America's most iconic beer scrambling to catch the attention of the coveted milennial market with quirky ads aimed at the Pabst-swilling set. Budweiser's holiday advertising won't heavily feature the iconic Clydesdale horses galloping through snow, which have dominated the brand's Christmas spots for years. The beard- and spectacle-wearing actors have replaced the horses just as the King of Beers' throne is being challenged by craft beers and imports. Cheers! Budweiser has changed its target audience with holiday ads that feature 20-somethings enjoying the iconic American beer . Prefer Pabst? The ads come as Budweiser's sales slump thanks to a lack of demand for the beer from the under 30 set . Budweiser research has revealed a whopping 44 percent of drinkers aged 21 to 27 have not even tried one of the red and white labeled American lagers, reports the New York Post. Those labels, too, are set for a change. At the start of November, Budweiser began offering an 18-pack that comes in a nostalgic wooden crate with bottles festooned with labels from 1918, 1933 and 1976. The company says the crates are replicas of those that were used to deliver the beer to retailers after Prohibition. Along with the ads featuring young, cheerful people drinking Budweiser, the move appears to be leveled at drinkers who've helped blue collar Pabst become the beer most associated with hipsters. The change comes as Budweiser's share of the U.S. beer market has declined since hitting its peak in 1988. According to Beer Marketer's Insights, Budweiser had 7.6 percent of the market last year, down from 14.4 percent a decade ago. Hip! The beer is also being offered for the holidays in a throwback wooden crate with bottles that have labels from eras gone by . The Clydesdales have been associated with Budweiser since 1933, when the company introduced them to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition for beer. The country's No. 3 beer brand said the horses will not play a role in its traditional advertising for the season, although the company added later Monday that they will be featured in spots promoting responsible drinking. Anheuser-Busch InBev also said the Clydesdales will return to be part of its upcoming Super Bowl ads. 'The Clydesdales play a strong role for the brand, representing Budweiser quality and care for more than 80 years. As icons of the brand — and relevant symbols of integrity, perfection and team spirit for all generations — they are important to the brand and our campaigns,' Anheuser-Busch said in a statement last Monday. Beat it, horses: The Clydesdales have been associated with Budweiser since 1933, when the company introduced them to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition for beer. Their traditional spot in the brand's holiday ads has been taken over by beard and spectacle-wearing millennials . Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, two of the world's biggest beer makers, are posting online what's inside bottles of Budweiser and Miller Lite after pressure from a food blogger. The two companies on Thursday posted the ingredients of some of their most popular brands, and promised to be more transparent in the future. The announcements come a day after blogger Vani Hari posted a petition on FoodBabe.com to get major brewers to list what's in their beverages. Anheuser-Busch posted the ingredients for its two top-selling brands on its website, tapintoyourbeer.com. It lists the same ingredients for Budweiser and Bud Light: Water, barley malt, rice, yeast and hops. The company, which also makes Beck's, Busch and Michelob beers, said it will list the ingredients for all of its other brands online ""in the coming days."" It's the first time Anheuser-Busch has detailed the ingredients of its beers. MillerCoors posted the ingredients of Miller Lite, Coors Light and six other brands on its Facebook page. Most are made from water, barley malt, corn, yeast and hops, the company said. ""We also value transparency and are happy to comply with the request for additional information,"" MillerCoors said in a statement. The company says that consumers can call to ask what ingredients are in their beer, and it will also put more information online ""in the days ahead."" Its other brands in the U.S. include Peroni and Redd's Apple Ale. Both companies said that they are not required to list ingredients, but are doing so voluntarily because customers want it. The online petition, started Wednesday by Hari, now has more than 44,000 signatures. Hari has become a powerful voice in the food industry. She is the same blogger who pushed sandwich chain Subway to remove an ingredient in its bread that's also used in yoga mats. Subway has since removed that ingredient. She chose to petition beer makers because her husband drinks beer and she wants to be able to see what she is buying. Representatives from Anheuser-Busch invited Hari and her family to visit its brewery in St. Louis and see how its beers are made. Hari said she is working with the company to figure out a time to visit. Anheuser-Busch is part of the world's largest brewer, Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev. MillerCoors is a joint venture owned by London-based SABMiller PLC and Denver-based Molson Coors Brewing Co.","The traditional Budweiser Clydesdales won't be featured in the brand's holiday ads this year, choosing instead to put give the beer a youthful feel .

"Pancake day originated as a way to use up spare ingredients in the pantry to avoid temptation during Lent. But one Manchester restaurant has broken with tradition by including only the finest ingredients in their £800 pancake. Layered with lobster, caviar and truffles, and topped with Dom Perignon Rose hollandaise sauce, Opus head chef Matthew Downes has created the most expensive pancake ever. The most expensive pancake in the world will be available at Manchester restaurant Opus . The £800 creation uses Scottish Paradise Lobster, Russian Beluga Caviar, and Dom Perignon champagne . The previous world record holder was created at the same restaurant in 2009 and cost £144 . Despite only being at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel - where the restaurant is based - for three years, Chef Matthew has smashed the previous pancake record of £144 set in 2009 by his predecessor. He said: 'We thought of doing a posh pancake because we knew Pancake Day was coming up and we thought we could make something a bit special out of it. 'We used only the finest ingredients to give it that extra-wow factor. I’m really proud of what we’ve created, the taste certainly lives up to the price tag. 'All we wanted to do was make the finest pancake you could ever taste and it’s turned into the world’s most expensive.' Head chef Matthew Downes, who created the pricy pancake, has been at the eatery for three years . Despite using some of the world's most expensive ingredients, Chef Matthew also uses traditional butter, sugar and milk in order to make the pancake . The dish, which takes 20 minutes to make, is not available on the regular menu but diners can request it . Chef Matthew only takes 20 minutes to create the ‘posh’ pancake and loves experimenting with expensive ingredients. He said: 'In all my years as a chef I’ve never made a pancake so expensive. 'As you know none of these ingredients are cheap and it makes you a very proud chef to be able to work them. 'Although it can be a little nerve wracking in the kitchen as you certainly don’t want to get an order like this wrong. 'The pancake isn’t on the menu but we can take orders especially for people who would love to try it.' The main ingredients for the seafood-inspired dish is Scottish Native Paradise Lobster, Russian Beluga Caviar, as well as Hulle Verge Truffle, Scottish Mussels and Langoustine prawns. Shrove Tuesday, more popularly known as pancake day, was traditionally used to eat up spare ingredients in the pantry before to avoid temptation during Lent . Beluga caviar is the eggs of the beluga sturgeon, native to the Caspian Sea, and usually sells for around £120 for an ounce . The Paradise Lobster and Beluga pancakes with Dom Pirignon Rose hollandaise also uses the more traditional ingredients of eggs, flour, milk and salt. The previous record-holding pancake was made with Madagascan vanilla pods costing £3 each and 23-carat edible gold leaf at £8 a sheet. It was served with organic strawberries plus jelly made from Dom Perignon champagne at £115 a bottle. Shrove Tuesday, otherwise known as pancake day, marks the last day before Lent - a 40 day period of abstinence. The largest pancake was created in Rochdale, Manchester, UK in 1994, by the Co-Operative Union, Ltd. Measuring 15.01 m (49 ft 3 in) in diameter and 2.5 cm (1 in) thick, the pancake weighed 3 tonnes (6,614 lb). Australian celebrity chef Brad Jolly, who holds the record for most tosses of a pancake in one minute, notching up 140 flips in 60 seconds during an event in Sydney in 2012. Dominic Cuzzacrea made a monumental flip measuring 9.47 m (31 ft 1 in) at the Walden Galleria Mall in Cheektowaga, New York, in November 2010 to create the highest ever pancake toss. The most people tossing pancakes is 890 and was achieved at an event in Sheffield, South Yorks in February 2012. While flipping a pancake continuously in a frying pan, American athlete Mike Cuzzacrea completed a 26 mile a marathon in a time of 3 hr 2 min 27 sec on 24 October 1999.","Chef Matthew Downes has created the world's most expensive pancake .

"Republicans weren't just big winners in the U.S. Senate races on Tuesday, as they also scored some major victories in the gubernatorial races. No victory was a bigger upset however than that of Larry Hogan, the businessman who managed to defeat Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown to become the next governor of Maryland. This despite the fact that Brown got support from some heavy hitters in the Democratic party, including Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama - who stumped for the candidate just one day before the election. Scroll down for video . Big name support: Maryland Lieutenant Governor Anthony brown received support from First Lady Michelle Obama (above) a day before the election .

The race was one of the closest of the night, with Brown eventually conceding just after midnight. Brown's loss is likely a very hard pill for the state's current governor, Martin O'Malley, to swallow, as he will be handing over the keys to the governor's mansion to a Republican for just the second time in 40 years. Thumbs up: Hogan celebrates with his supporters following his victory . Down and out: A dejected Brown gets ready to deliver his concession speech . In other gubernatorial races, Wendy Davis' dream of becoming Texas governor went up in flames as she was trounced by Greg Abbot.

"One of three pro footballers named by a woman who 'blacked out' in a hotel suite had called 911 to say she was naked and refusing to leave, according to a newly-revealed police report. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, 26, blasted claims he was being investigated for sexual assault as 'completely wrong' after his name appeared in a Miami police report. Now a second report has emerged which appears to show Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette - another of the trio - had already called police about the 25-year-old woman on the night of the incident. Fresh information: A new report appears to show Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette (right) had already called 911 about a woman in the hotel suite of 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (left) Scene: Police were called to an apartment in the luxury Viceroy Hotel and Spa in the early hours on April 2 . The report, revealed by Miami talk show host Andy Slater, said the woman was 'completely naked laying on comp(lainant)'s friend's bed ref(using) to leave'. A crisis intervention team was dispatched and arrived at the luxury Viceroy hotel at less than 20 minutes later, the report said. The woman was then taken to hospital - by the Miami Fire Department. Miami Fire Lt Ignatius Carroll told the Miami Herald: 'At 12:32, Miami Fire Rescue was dispatched to the Viceroy and transported a 25-year-old female from the Viceroy to the Jackson Memorial Hospital emergency room.' The trio made headlines last week when their names appeared in Miami Police's previous report. It carried her claim that she . had woken up in hospital saying she was unable to remember how she got . there after spending time with Mr Kaepernick, Mr Lockette, 27, and 49ers . wide receiver Quinton Patton, 23. Under the spotlight: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, 26, was named in the report . Denial: The football player issued a three-part statement on Twitter after allegations around sexual assault . Denial: Mr Kaepernick wrote that he takes 'great pride in who I am and what I do' and people invented facts . Heartfelt: He finished by thanking fans and saying 'I assure you that your faith is not misplaced' The report said her last memory was of being naked on Mr Kaepernick's bed at an apartment in the Viceroy after drinking and smoking marijuana in his company. Noting that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr Kaepernick in the past', the report said the trio watched a basketball game but the woman went to a bedroom to lie down after feeling 'light headed'. Kaepernick then came into the bedroom and kissed her and undressed her, leaving her naked - before walking out and saying he would return, it continued. She was waiting in bed naked when the two other players allegedly peeked inside the room, to which she replied: 'What are you doing? Where is Colin? Get out!' She said the men left - and she could not remember what happened after that. Investigation: Quinton Patton, pictured right with Kaepernick, was also named in the police report . Star footballer: Colin Kaepernick, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, was named in the report . However, speaking after the report was revealed, a police spokesman said: 'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault. This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.' Mr Kaepernick spoke out on Twitter on Friday to deny claims, first reported by TMZ, that he was being investigated for sexual assault. 'The charges made in the TMZ story and other stories I’ve seen are completely wrong,' he wrote. 'They make things up about me that never happened. 'I take great pride in who I am and what I do, but  I guess sometimes you have to deal with someone who makes things up. 'I want to thank all of the people who have shared their encouraging sentiments. I assure you that your faith is not misplaced.'

"Three men dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, a black niqab and a motorbike helmet were refused entry after attempting to walk into Australia's Parliament House on Monday. Identifying themselves as 'Faceless', Sergio Redegalli, Nick Folkes and Victor Waterson told reporters at the scene that they were protesting in favour of a national burqa ban. They clarified that they wanted all facial coverings to be banned in public spaces for cultural and security reasons. Their bizarre demonstration comes one week after the government announced its decision  to overturn the ban on niqab's and burqas being worn inside  Parliament House. Scroll down for video . Three men from 'Faceless' attempted to enter Parliament House as part of a protest on Monday . They were dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, a niqab and a motorbike helmet . The men also stated that they 'couldn't care less' how Muslim women would feel about their stunt, according to the Herald Sun. Upon entering Parliament House, the men were asked to remove their garb by security who refused to grant them entrance. 'It's fantastic that we were not allowed in,' Mr Redegalli said, according to the ABC. However he later added: 'It seems that you're allowed to wear a full-faced covering into Parliament if you're a Muslim woman, but no other group is allowed to have that same privilege. 'We, as males, are not allowed to wear any face coverings in Parliament House.' Identified as Sergio Redegalli, Nick Folkes and Victor Waterson, the protesters were refused entry by security . The men said they wanted all facial coverings to be banned in public spaces for cultural and security reasons . Mr Redegalli, who was dressed in the KKK outfit, revealed that he was also wearing a niqab beneath his white hood. It's not the Newtown business-owner's first time protesting against burqas being worn in public spaces. In 2011 Mr Redegalli was criticized for an offensive mural he painted outside his shop that read 'say no to burqas'. The three men have been slammed on social media for their tasteless protest, with one Twitter user writing: 'BREAKING: Absolute dropkicks at Parliament House'. A spokesperson for security at Parliament House told Daily Mail Australia: 'In this instance, the Parliamentary Security Service followed procedures for screening visitors entering Parliament. The visitors were requested to remove the items obscuring their faces as the items were deemed to be protest paraphernalia. ‘Protest paraphernalia’ may be used in the Authorised Assembly Area, but not in other areas of the precinct.' The men have been slammed on social media for their tasteless protest . The protest comes one week after the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) announced that the ban on face coverings at Parliament House had been dumped . Tassie Codriver is one of the many Twitter users who have slammed the men for their protest . Their demonstration comes one week after the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) announced that the ban on face coverings being worn in public areas of Parliament House had been dumped. Introduced in early October, the ban forced anyone with a face covering to sit behind soundproof glass instead of in the public galleries. Instead,  face coverings will now have to be removed temporarily at the front door so that staff can 'identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk.' The opposition welcomed the overturning of the ban. 'In 2014 for two weeks, the official policy of the Australian Parliament was to practice segregation and we need to ensure this does not happen again,' senior opposition lawmaker Tony Burke said in a statement.","Calling themselves 'Faceless', Sergio Redegalli, Nick Folkes and Victor Waterson attempted to enter Australia's Parliament House on Monday .

"An actress yesterday told how she was targeted by Jimmy Savile when she appeared on Jim'll Fix It in 1988, aged only 14. Julie Fernandez, who appeared in the BBC's The Office and Eldorado, said Savile groped her in the studio and described his behaviour as 'predatory'. She added: 'I was in my wheelchair, but I just remember his hands being everywhere and just lingering those two, three, four seconds slightly too long in places they shouldn't. But it wasn't particularly obvious either.' Julie Fernandez, who appeared in the . BBC's The Office and Eldorado, said Savile groped her in the Jim'll Fix It studio and . described his behaviour as 'predatory' 'It was in a busy room full of people so it was quite discreetly done and you don't kind of realise what's happening at the time, especially when you're 14 and it's the first time you've ever been in a studio and you're very excited. 'But I do remember feeling uncomfortable and he had these huge rings on his fingers.' The 38-year-old said she felt like 'slapping his hand away'. 'My classmates, we all made a joke of . it afterwards for years, but we didn't really bring it up to any adult . and I don't know why, actually,' she added. Miss Fernandez, now a disability rights campaigner, said people were possibly afraid of speaking out against a prominent figure. 'He was a great fundraiser and all of . these things, so possibly people didn't want to say negative things . about him. Maybe they didn't think they would be believed. 'It's a predatory behaviour and it's a bad, bad behaviour. And he's now dead and what can we do?' Ms Fernandez is the latest in a string of women to make claims against Savile and it follows the revelation that he was given his own keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital. The police investigation into Jimmy . Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale with officers now following up 340 separate lines . of inquiry, Scotland Yard revealed last night. Julie Fernandez said 'I was in my wheelchair, but I just remember his . hands being everywhere and just lingering those two, three, four seconds . slightly too long in places they shouldn't . The 38-year-old said she felt like 'slapping his hand away' when the incident happened in 1998 . There are now 40 potential victims and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s reign of child abuse. It triggered the BBC’s Director General George Entwhistle to issue his second grovelling . apology of the week – and announce a total of three independent . inquiries. Mr Entwistle gave a ‘profound and heartfelt apology on behalf of the BBC to every victim’. He . added: ‘I have made clear my revulsion at the thought that these . criminal assaults were carried out by someone employed by the BBC and . that some may have happened on BBC premises as well as, we now discover, . in hospitals and other institutions.’ Celebrities . and former BBC staff potentially face arrest for alleged sex offences . as police hunt accomplices of Savile’s four decades of attacks. He is . alleged to have raped and molested children as young as ten. David Nicolson, 67, who had been a . director on Jim’ll Fix It, said he made several attempts to expose . Savile to the BBC, but was told: ‘That’s Jimmy’ and ‘that’s the way it . goes’. She said: 'It's a predatory behaviour and it's a bad, bad behaviour. And he's now dead and what can we do?' On Mr Nicolson’s claims, a BBC . spokesman said: ‘We have been disturbed to hear these allegations. All . staff past and present who have any information relating to allegations . of this kind should raise them with the BBC’s internal investigations . unit or the police.’ Liz Dux, a partner at Russell Jones & Walker, is representing some of the alleged victims of Jimmy Savile. The personal injury lawyer, who specialises in abuse cases, said 'a couple' of women had sought legal advice. 'They may well have grounds to sue on the principles of vicarious liability,' Dux said. 'If Savile was acting as an employee or agent of the BBC or a health organisation, then that organisation with whom he had a close connection can be held vicariously liable. Dux added that the women were not motivated by compensation. 'What motivates people is not money,' she said.","Office and Eldorado star Julie Fernandez says Savile groped her in studio .

"Amir Khan is not holding out any hope of ever seeing Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao meeting in the ring for the world's most eagerly anticipated fight . A mega-money bout between Mayweather and Pacquiao appeared to be edging closer after the pair met at the half-time interval of the Miami Heat vs Milwaukee Bucks NBA game on Tuesday and then later in a hotel. However, former light welterweight world champion Khan does not believe the waiting public will ever get to witness  the pair trading blows in the same ring.

'I spoke to Manny Pacquiao and, obviously, we speak to Mayweather and his team . 'I can't really see that fight from happening, there is too much politics with that fight. There's different promotions teams and different management teams - I don't think they will let that fight happen. 'If it does happen, I'm a big boxing fan and I would love to see it.

"Arsene Wenger offered a clear reminder of his role in Alex Song’s career as Arsenal prepare to face West Ham today. Song’s midfield performances have inspired Sam Allardyce’s team this season and raised the question of why Wenger did not try to bring the Cameroon international back to the Emirates Stadium when Barcelona made him available on loan. ‘Alex Song is a good player,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘I brought him here at 17 and kept him despite all the opinions against him and he developed into a very good player. You don’t need to convince me he’s a good player. I took him at a very young age and gave him his chance. Alex Song in action for West Ham in their Boxing Day match with Chelsea .

Arsenal can leapfrog West Ham with victory on Sunday, and are just two points behind fourth-placed Southampton, but ahead of Tottenham only on goal difference. With so little between the sides around the Champions League places, Wenger just wants his players to concentrate on continuing their recent positive form, which has seen just one defeat from eight in all competitions. 'I don’t give importance to the table at the moment,' he said. 'There are 20 games to go. It is very tight and it is down to consistency now. 'We know every game now is down to consistency and reproducing the performances. 'We need to prepare quickly, focus quickly and that is an ability we want to show at West Ham.'

"Four elephants who got hooked on opium-laced bananas have gone clean after animal rescuers gave them a year-long course of methadone. Heroin smugglers were using the animals to carry vast quantities of the drug across the border between China and Myanmar, also known as Burma, and fed them opium to make them follow orders. But after the gangsters were caught and their elephants were sent to a sanctuary, keepers discovered some of the animals had become restless and wildly aggressive. Saying goodbye to the circus: These four Indian elephants have been cured of their opium addictions after being given a year-long course of methadone five times stronger than for humans in Yunnan Province, China . Restless: Keepers said the animals became aggressive when they were deprived of opium-laced bananas, which smugglers had fed them to make them more placid and likely to follow orders on the Chinese border . Staff at the Wild Elephant Valley in Yunnan Province, China, ran tests on drug-running elephants joining their reserve on separate occasions over the last nine years. In total, four had traces of heroin in their system. Each elephant was given a lengthy course of methadone lasting up to a year - and keepers have now announced that all four are drug-free. They are so confident of the animals' health that they have released them back into wild herds. Elephant breeder Chen Jiming, who helped the elephants kick the habit, said: 'It has been a long battle but we can safely say that they are now reintegrated into elephant society and in some cases even have families of their own.' He added that there needed to be a change in the law. Cold turkey: Unsure how to treat the animals, keepers took the same approach as doctors do with humans . How it began: Rehabilitated elephants at the sanctuary welcome Xiguang, one of the rescue animals (right) 'There are actually more elephants now in the wild since China made it a crime punishable by death to hunt them,' he said. 'But we haven't increased the penalties for people who turn them into drug addicts by feeding them heroin laced bananas. 'This is also an important issue that needs to be tackled.' The elephants were used to carry heavy quantities of drugs across the border in packages on their backs. Smugglers from China's feared Triad gangs would give the animals drugs to make them more pliant and docile, making them easier to train. Once the animals were addicted to the tainted fruit, they would become desperate for the next fix and obey any command by a gang member as long as they were adequately rewarded. Victory: All four elephants have now been released from the sanctuary (pictured) and back into the forest . Because trainers had never tried to cure an elephant's addiction they decided to use methadone, the same treatment given to humans. The drug, which is an opiate like heroin but without the buzz associated with the drug, was given to the animals in slowly-diminishing amounts over the course of a year. All four elephants now live in the forests of Yunnan Province in south-western China,  a protected area which is home to another 250 wild elephants. Mr Chen added: 'The elephants need at least five times more methadone than a human being would need at the start, and then we slowly reduced that until they no longer needed it. 'It is every bit as hard for the elephants to go through the cold turkey regime as it is for humans.'","Drug gangs fed the animals tainted fruit to make them more placid and docile .

"Arsenal have been given fresh hope in their pursuit of William Carvalho, as the Sporting midfielder admitted he still has Premier League ambitions. Carvalho, who was a target for the Gunners this summer but remained in Portugal, said he has ambitions to play in the best leagues in the world, the Premier League or La Liga, and that he expects the move to happen 'sooner or later'. But the Portuguese international explained that despite interest from Europe's top clubs, including Arsenal and Manchester United, none of them were prepared to match his release clause. William Carvalho tackles Cesc Fabregas in the Champions League, but could be in the Premier League soon . The Sporting star says he will move to a top league in Europe 'sooner or later' with Arsenal interested . 'I would not say I was disappointed [to stay], but despite being very happy at Sporting, we all have ambitions and I hope one day to be playing in the best leagues in the world, the English or Spanish,' Carvalho told the official magazine of the Portuguese Football Federation. 'It did not happen this year, but if I continue to do my job as I have been doing for sure that sooner or later it will happen. 'I understand the proposals, but I think that there was no value for the clause and therefore they have been refused.'

"They star in one of the most violent shows on TV, which regularly sees women  meet sticky ends at the hands of men or be married off to someone unpleasant against their will. Now Game of Thrones stars Natalie Dormer and Lena Headey have thrown their support behind a new campaign to end violence against women and girls. In powerful new photos taken for Plan UK's Because I Am A Girl campaign, the pair appear with a series of phrases, including 'bear the scars' and 'no longer myself', daubed on their cheeks. Standing up for women: Game of Thrones and Hunger Games star Natalie Dormer in the new Plan UK campaign . The Because I Am A Girl campaign aims to help millions of girls in the world’s poorest communities live free from violence, particularly child marriage and FGM. One girl is forced to marry every two seconds, while 130 million girls and women are living with the consequences of FGM worldwide. 'It fills me with hope that someday soon girls can grow up on a world that is free from these harmful practices,' said Headey who plays the manipulative Queen Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones. 'I urge everyone – men, boys, women and girls – to join me in standing up for girls’ rights’ with Plan UK.' Her co-star Natalie Dormer added: 'I believe we all have a part to play in the fight to end abuses like FGM and child marriage. Support: Lena Headey and Natalie Dormer were joined by singer Beverley Knight in supporting the campaign . Familiar: Headey as the manipulative Queen Cersei Lannister in the hit HBO series . 'It’s a powerful stance that we’re all taking, and by uniting together we can help keep millions of girls safe from harm.' The Game of Thrones pair were joined in the campaign by singer Beverley Knight who said she was horrified to discover how widespread child marriage, FGM and domestic abuse still are. 'Plan UK is working hard to end these harmful practices worldwide but the stories of these girls just aren’t being heard,' she added. 'This campaign is vitally important.' Commenting on the campaign, Plan UK chief executive, Tanya Barron, said: 'These practices are a violation of girls’ rights and can cause severe physical and mental trauma. 'By putting the stories of real girls where they can’t be ignored, we hope to build momentum, unite opinion and end FGM and child marriage in a generation. Forced marriage: Dormer's character Margaery Tyrell was made to marry the evil Joffrey Baratheon . Hope: Headey said she hopes to see a world free of violence while Dormer said all of us should play a part . 'We’re absolutely delighted that Lena, Natalie and Beverley are facing up to girls’ rights and are on board to help us get this vital message across.' Plan UK is also launching a new online app so that supporters across the country can Face Up to violence against girls too, and join the Because I Am A Girl campaign. Launched on September 30, the Face Up app will enable supporters to have the words ‘I’m putting girls’ rights where they can’t be ignored’ digitally placed on a photo of their own faces for them to share on social media platforms using #FaceUp. The app will be available on the Plan UK website and Facebook.","The Game of Thrones stars have joined forces with charity, Plan UK .

"Reports have surfaced there is a third Australian man that has been killed in Syria in the past two weeks, among fears from leaders of the Muslims that more Australians will join the fighting. The man from Sydney's south west is understood to be from a well-known family and married with children, Fairfax Media reports. It follows more unconfirmed reports in recent weeks that Australia's most Islamic State militant, Mohammad Ali Baryalei was killed in the middle east. Fairfax has also reported another IS fighter Abu Noor al-Kurdi from Sydney is believed to have been killed with Baryalei. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in the Middle East, according to a friend . The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade say they are yet to confirm the reports. 'Australian Government agencies are attempting to verify these reports however it is very difficult to do so,' said a spokesperson. 'Due to the extremely dangerous security situation consular assistance is no longer available within Syria or Iraq. The Government’s capacity to follow up reports of this kind is therefore extremely limited.' 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria and Iraq.' Australian Federation of Islamic Councils president Hafez Kassem fears other Australians may follow in the footsteps of the Islamic extremists. 'I think they are going to defend their families there,' he told AAP. 'This is why it's very hard for communities to control something like this. We can't know where they are going or why they are going.' 'That is the message we have heard from people.' In light of reports about Baryalei's death, details have emerged about the former Kings Cross bouncer's past. One source told ABC about Baryalei's love for gambling, women, drugs and painted him as someone who mixed with questionable characters. 'He gambled a lot ... He once won $8,000 or $9,000 on the pokies, then played it back down ... and he loved cocaine.,' the source told the 7.30 program. The friend also said they thought Baryalei, originally from Sydney, may have gotten 'in too deep' in the scene, and it seemed as though he saw more than he could handle. Baryalei recruited as many as half of the Australian militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in the Middle East . The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end. The 33 year old from Quakers Hill, is understood to have travelled to the Middle East in April last year and has helped the movement of a number of Australians believed to fighting in Syria and Iraq. Fairfax News reported he allegedly recruited Khaled Sharrouf, the Australian radical who posted a picture of his seven year old son with a severed head and Mohammad Elomar, wanted Australian terrorism suspect, who has also appeared in many social media images holding severed heads. The Australian Federal Police had issued a warrant for Baryalei's arrest earlier this year. A neighbour of the man told The Sydney Morning Herald, he had many troubles growing up. He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17. Despite this Baryalei would still help out around the neighbourhood, doing 'odd jobs' for those who needed the help. A friend visits the home of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's mother, Homira, in western Sydney on Wednesday evening . 'He was a clean cut young man. Somebody must have gotten inside his head,' a source told the website. Last week Foreign minister Julie Bishop answered reports that Baryalei had been killed saying the federal government was 'currently seeking to confirm whether the 16th Australian foreign fighter had indeed been killed in this conflict'. 'It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger,' she said. The news came as Labor joined the coalition to pass foreign fighter laws. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the laws would make it easier to arrest and jail terrorists returning from overseas, monitor potential terrorists in Australia and stop 'preachers of hate'. As news filtered through of Baryalei's apparent demise, the neighbours of his parents in Sydney's northwest spoke about his mother's pain over her son's decision to join the radical group. The neighbour said Ms Baryalei had been devastated by her son's decision to take up arms with IS. 'She was crying. She couldn't believe it was her son,' she said. 'All she knew was he was overseas studying to be a cleric and would call her every so often. 'He was very protective of his mum.' Neighbours said Baryalei's mother believed him to be overseas studying to be a cleric . Despite this, authorities have told The Sydney Morning Herald Baryalei's death is unlikely to stop young Australians being recruited to fight for Islamic State. A senior security source told the publication that although he was a key recruiter , others were likely to step up into the position meaning Australians would continue to travel to the Middle East to fight. 'I think you'll always find there's be people who'll step into that void and they'll be people who are probably well known to us, to be honest,' he said. Baryalei was the ringleader of an alleged plot to behead a random member of the public in Sydney earlier this year. He was a senior recruiter for the Islamic State terror group. In a tribute Facebook post last night, a friend of Baryalei's, Abdul Salaam Mahmoud, said he had received news the notorious western Sydney militant had died. In his prior life, Baryalei (left and right) was an aspiring actor who played a bit part role in Underbelly (right) 'I've just received the news that our beloved brother Mohamed Ali who was recently strongly attacked by Australian media has been martyred,' he wrote. 'He was a brother a friend and our leader in street dawah Sydney.' 'Today we shall celebrate his martyrdom with tears of joy and sorrow.' 'Oh Allah accept him as another green bird.' According to an ABC report, Baryalei it is unclear whether a Coalition air strike was responsible for Baryalei's apparent death. Terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton, from the Global Terrorism Research Centre at Monash University, said Baryalei's killing would be a 'significant' blow to Islamic State's recruitment efforts in Australia. A friend of Mohammad Ali Baryalei paid tribute to his friend in a Facebook post . Abdullah Elmir, the 17-year-old who fled Sydney to fight for the Islamic State, is believed to have been recruited by Baryalei . Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged in the nation's largest ever terror raids last month. Prosecutors allege Baryalei conspired with him in a beheading plot . We are currently seeking to verify reports (of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's death)... I can't confirm at this stage. It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger. They have a great risk of being killed. They are committing offences against Australian law. They are adding to the suffering of the people of Iraq and Syria. And they are likely to be come experienced in the ways of terrorism. We urge young Australians in particular not to be radicalised, not to fall for these false and toxic ideologies of the terrorists, who have only been using them for their own purposes. 'It doesn't mean a lot for Islamic State as a whole but it does mean a lot for Australia,' Prof Barton told Daily Mail Australia. 'If it's confirmed that he is no longer, and with the Operation Appleby (terror raids)... We would have really put a dent in the recruiting network.' Security officials believe Baryalei recruited as many of half the Australians who have joined the fighting in the Middle East - including the so-called 'Ginger Jihadist', Abdullah Elmir, 17. Baryalei was also accused of orchestrating an alleged plot for Omarjan Azari, a 22-year-old western Sydney man, to commit a public beheading in the streets of the nation's largest city. Before Baryalei fled to the Middle East in April 2013, he worked as a bit-part actor in the popular crime drama Underbelly and as a bouncer in the Kings Cross nightclub district. The AFP told Daily Mail Australia in early September a warrant had been issued for Baryalei's arrest over alleged terrorism-related activity. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis were approached for comment.","Third Australian man killed in Syria in past two weeks .

"A California elementary school teacher has been arrested for allegedly sexually abusing 20 students and one adult. Robert Pimental, 57, is facing eight counts of continual sexual abuse and seven counts of lewd acts upon a child for abuse that took place at George De La Torre Jr. Elementary in Los Angeles. In addition to the 15 felonies, misdemeanor charges are expected, LA Police Department Officer Christopher No said. Accused: Robert Pimental, 57, is facing eight counts of continual sexual abuse and seven counts of lewd acts upon a child for abuse that took place at George De La Torre Jr. Elementary in Los Angeles, pictured . The former teacher is being held on $12 million bail, and an arraignment date hasn't been set. Pimental left his fourth-grade teaching position in March at the onset of the investigation. When officials learned of the allegations earlier this year they immediately removed him from campus and parents and state credentialing authorities were informed, school district spokesman Daryl Strickland said. Protest: Parents marched near Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles, in February 6, 2012, after a similar child sex abuse case . Parents and guardians will be told of the arrest by letter and phone, he said. Pimental has worked for the Los Angeles Unified School District since 1974. Abuse: Mark Berndt, 61, pictured, from Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles was arrested for child molestation last year . George De La Torre Jr. Elementary is . located at 500 North Island Ave. in Wilmington, a largely Latino Los . Angeles Harbor Area neighborhood with about 50,000 residents. The school opened in 2006 and has about 800 students. Pimental's case follows a number of high-profile incidences of Los Angeles teachers accused of sexually abusing students. More . than 225 parents and students are involved in various claims for . damages against the district after Miramonte Elementary School teacher . Mark Berndt was arrested a year ago and pleaded not guilty to 23 counts . of lewd conduct. Berndt is accused of feeding his students his semen on cookies and photographing them in classroom 'tasting games.' The children were aged 6 to 10. In December, a jury ordered the district to pay a boy molested by an elementary school teacher $6.9 million - among the largest awards in the history of the school system. The jury found the district liable for the repeated molestation of the 10-year-old student in 2008 and 2009 by teacher Forrest Stobbe at Queen Anne Elementary School in the city's mid-Wilshire district.","Robert Pimental, 57, is facing eight counts of continual sexual abuse and seven counts of lewd acts upon a child .

"If Republicans should flip six or more Senate seats on Tuesday, they'll control both houses of Congress for the first time in ten years, opening up a host of possibilities that the Democratic-run Senate has blocked under the currently Majority Leader, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. Obamacare as we know it? No longer a guaranteed keeper. Immigration reform? Maybe, but on Republicans' terms. The Keystone XL pipeline? Built. Regulations that bring out the Ayn Rand in every conservative? Dead, at least for a time. Some legislation will still be off the table since President Barack Obama has a veto pen at the ready – and because Republicans themselves aren't unified about how to respond to what Democrats have put in place in recent years. But the legislative game would be changed in some important and earth-shattering ways. Every Senate committee will have a Republican chairman or chairwoman in January if the GOP wins control on Tuesday. That will allow them to slow-walk legislation, or entirely refuse to entertain it, in the same way Reid has done since 2007. The powerful Judiciary Committee, especially, would become a game-changer, turning on its head the White House's calculations when it chooses to appoint judges – including the next nominees to serve on the Supreme Court. In smaller ways, cogs in Obama's governmental machine would find themselves, one at a time, without teeth. Scroll down for video . Mitch McConnell has been waiting ten years to become Senate Majority Leader; his testudinal grin says it all . Obama's veto pen will get a workout if the GOP takes control on Tuesday, but he might be forced to face the difficult choice of whether to save unpopular laws or toss out crowd-pleasers . REPUBLICANS' LEAST FAVORITE REGULATIONS COULD STAND STILL . The Congressional Review Act of 1996 effectively gives Congress the power to block executive branch regulations at will – the kind issued daily by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration, the Education Department, and countless other federal agencies and subagencies. All that's required is for both houses of Congress to pass joint resolutions noting their disapproval. Just like that, the government rule in question is stopped in its tracks and robbed of any effect. Such resolutions require just a simple majority to pass in the Senate, meaning that with just 51 seats the GOP could team up with an expanding House majority to crush, or at least delay, a wide range of Obama administration initiatives during the president's last term in office. Obama's signature is still required on a resolution overturning a regulation, just like anything else that emerges from Congress. But while the White House wrangles over its PR strategy, the regulatory proposal would sit and collect dust. Republicans would then announce their intention to override the veto, an unlikely proposition since they lack two-thirds majorities in either house. But that process could be dragged out, and the Congressional Review Act would halt the regulation in question until 30 days after they officially give up. Everything from the administration's EPA rules on coal-fired power plants and water pollution to minimum-wage hikes and unpopular moves that open the borders to Ebola patients could be open for debate, producing consistent howls from Democrats along the way. WE'LL FINALLY FIND OUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE . On a larger stage, changing or repealing the Obamacare law would be the ultimate prize for conservatives in the GOP. Democrats passed it during the president's first term in office, when they controlled both houses of Congress. Not a single Republican voted in favor of the final bill. Obama at first resisted the GOP's demands for changes to the law, but then put his own in place to delay its phased-in implementation until after the election. That has brought howls out of the right-wing's woodwork, and the threat of a lawsuit from House Republicans since precise, hard-and-fast dates were written into the law. Obama, they say, lacked the power to change how the law was implemented without permission from Congress. Conservatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz favor sending a complete repeal bill to the White House now that Obamacare – and Obama himself – are wildly unpopular. That itself would be tough since it's practically impossible that Republicans will hold 60 seats, the number required to force an end to a debate and call for a vote on legislation. But current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled that he's willing to use a special budget maneuver called 'reconciliation' to get around that, setting the bar at just 51 votes. Reid invoked something similar in 2013 for the first time in America's history – a play known as the 'nuclear option' – to confirm a group of controversial judicial nominees without Republican support. Now it could be McConnell's turn to move the levers. Should the president veto an Obamacare repeal bill or let it languish until it expires (a so-called 'pocket veto'), right-wingers would then urge their leadership to pass a rapid-fire series of laws repealing Obamacare one piece at a time, forcing Obama to issue veto after veto and rebranding Democrats as 'the party of ""No"".' Will he stick around? If longtime Majority Leader Harry Reid loses his top post, the Nevada Democrat might shirk the role of minority leader in favor of returning to the back bench . Voters in many states have been casting ballots for weeks, but D-Day officially comes Tuesday . CANADA'S KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE MIGHT BE COMPLETED . The White House will certainly hunker down in any event, portraying the Affordable Care Act as a blessing for the previously uninsured. Republicans will follow their lawsuit through the federal courts. Another game-changer could see an oil pipeline bringing unrefined petroleum from the expansive tar sands of Alberta, Canada to the Texas coastline on the Gulf of Mexico. The idea was described ten years ago as a job-creation miracle and a way to lower energy costs all across North America. But President Obama's State Department, prodded by environmental groups, has slow-walked the project, crashing into hurdle after hurdle seemingly on purpose. Canada desperately wants the project to move forward. The alternative is to pipe as many as 830,000 barrels of oil westward every day toward the Pacific Ocean, where it would be refined and shipped to Asia. If the Keystone XL pipeline were built as planned, much of the finished fuel would go to China and India no matter what, but green groups have struck a 'not in our backyard' pose and urged the White House to delay it as long as possible. But the State Department's own review board ruled in January, after years of study, that the project would have a negligible impact on the environment. Whither Obamacare? With Senate and House conservatives both holding Democracy's car keys, it's not clear how much of the president's hard-won medical insurance overhaul would survive by the end of his term . Armed with that document, a Republican-run Congress would likely pass a bill immediately funding the project and forcing Obama's hand. The White House's public position has long been that it's not stalling – merely enduring a lengthy deliberative process to make sure it's doing no harm. Republicans will force the issue if they win control of the Senate. And enough Democrats want the project built that Obama may have no choice but to go along. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COULD GO FROM PROTECTED CLASS TO ENDANGERED SPECIES . They will also push back hard against what they see as Obama's lawless moves to remake immigration policy in a way that gives unreasonable advantages to people who are in the U.S. illegally. At stake, they say, are the potential bankrupting of the American education system, the availability of jobs for U.S. citizens, the worsening of an already strained criminal justice system, and a host of other controversial shifts in what American life looks like. The White House has pined for a rewrite of U.S. immigration law since day one of Obama's first term, but used all its political capital to get Obamacare passed – and never thought it would lose control of the House of Representatives in 2010. As a result, the Obama administration had to rely on a bipartisan 'Gang of Eight' senators last year to craft an immigration proposal that might, just maybe, be palatable to House Republicans. The Senate bill passed, containing something for everyone: dramatically fewer deportations of illegal immigrants, increased border security and other political dog-whistles. But conservatives feared the White House couldn't be trusted to hold up its end of the bargain, and the proposal never got a vote in the House. More walls: Any immigration proposal a new GOP-led Congress might approve would be guaranteed to focus on border security instead of on mainstreaming illegal immigrants – as the Obama administration has sought . Obama responded by unilaterally putting part of the bill into place with an executive order, guaranteeing that tens of thousands of people brought illegally to the U.S. as children could stay – at least as long as he holds the White House. He has pledged to go further still after Tuesday's election. ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN? IT'S POSSIBLE . Republicans want to be in a position to stop him, but even in their rosiest scenario they won't take control until the new Congress takes office January 3. At that point they could use the power of the purse to deny Obama the money he needs to put his ideas into practice. But they have few weapons in the meantime, during the end-of-year 'lame duck' session that's likely to last a few weeks. One possibility is another threat of a government shutdown, since the last budget resolution Congress passed expires on December 11. House GOP leaders could hold that over the president's head and threaten a budget standstill before Christmas in order to force his hand. A new war of words would surely follow, with Republicans calling the White House lawless and Democrats comparing the GOP to ill-mannered Grinches, jeopardizing the postal service and Americans' benefit checks during the busy holiday season. We've seen this movie before. It usually ends with the GOP backing down since it has controlled only the House of Representatives and can't take action without House Democrats. This time could be different.","Armed with majorities in both houses, a Republican-led Congress could embarrass President Obama into accepting changes to his health care law .
The GOP could use a 1996 law to stop practically any regulation, at least until Obama vetoes a resolution and Republicans give up on an override – and then for 30 days more .
President's hoped-for immigration reform law would be dead in the water and Republicans could use their budget axe to gut his executive orders .
An immediate funding mechanism to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline could be on the table by mid-January .
Every Senate committee would be chaired by a Republican, changing the White House's calculation on everything from foreign policy to Supreme Court appointments ."
"The look on U.S. figure skater Ashley Wagner's said it all Saturday after judges in Sochi scored her a 63.10 in her Olympic debut. The look of disgust was in stark contrast to the radiant smile she displayed just moments earlier after completing her routine. Wagner, 22, clearly believed she'd pulled off a performance worthy of a high score as she waved, smiled and blew kisses to the audience. All smiles: Ashley Wagner of the United States celebrates in the 'kiss and cry' area during the Team Ladies Short Program at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics . Shock: Wagner reacts to her score after competing in the Figure Skating Team Ladies Short Program during day one of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics at Iceberg Skating Palace on February 8 . But her smile turned upside down when the score came in, which left her in fourth place. 'I know roughly when I skate a good program where the score should end up... So yeah to score that low was very disappointing for me,' she said afterwards. 'But honestly this performance was more for myself and mentally getting beyond this past couple of weeks. And I wanted to do everything I could to help out the team, and I really feel that I delivered on that part.' Wagner may feel that she's got something to prove after her selection over Mirai Nagasu sparked a backlash on social media. Nagasu finished third at the National Championships in Boston last month while Wagner finished in fourth place, yet it was she who was selected to the Winter Olympic team. Waiting game: Wagner blows a kiss to spectators as she waits for her results after competing in the women's team short program figure skating competition . Performane: Wagner does her routine at her Olympic debut in Sochi . Sparkly: Wagner donned a bejeweled outfit and performed to Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd . 'It was on my mind with the media . frenzy over the last couple of weeks that I needed to prove to myself . and everybody else that has even doubted my belonging here that I am . here to compete, to be competitive,' she told Yahoo. The numbers she scored, though, left her visibly disappointed. She . was left trailing Russia's Yulia Lipnitskaya in first place, Carolina . Kostner of Italy in second and Mao Asada of Japan, who came third . despite falling during her routine. Before the score: Wagner waves to the crowd after her performance . Hopeful: Surrounded by teammates and next to her coach, Wagner waits for the scores . Second prize: McKayla Maroney's face as she stood to receive her silver medal became infamous . More to come: Wagner says she's hoping to score better in her individual events . Her score, however, was enough to advance the U.S. team from seventh to third place, meaning they will be one of the top five teams to advance through to the finals on Sunday night. Her facial expression upon seeing her score is reminiscent of the distinctly unimpressed look gymnast McKayla Maroney wore on the second-place podium during the 2012 Olympics. Maroney's visage was captured the public imagination - in other words, it became a meme. Time will tell if one unguarded facial expression will come to define Wagner in history more than her figure skating ability.","After Ashley Wagner completed her routine for the women's short program in Sochi Saturday she appeared pleased .

"A fit and healthy runner collapsed and died half a mile from the finish of the London Marathon after taking a performance-enhancing stimulant, an inquest heard yesterday. Claire Squires was determined to complete the course in under four hours to beat her personal best and raise thousands of pounds for charity. But as she neared the finish of last year’s race, the young hairdresser suffered a cardiac arrest and never regained consciousness. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Marathon runner Claire Squires, pictured, collapsed and died less than a mile before the finish line of the London Marathon last year after taking a now banned energy supplement . Charitable: Claire Squires, pictured (right) raising funds for the Wings Appeal, had taken Jack3D which has now been banned in the UK . Her partner, Simon Van Herrewege, said . the ‘beautiful’ 30-year-old was passionately against drugs and had . ‘innocently’ dissolved the popular sports supplement, which is now . banned, in her water bottle to help her if she ‘hit a wall’. The inquest heard she had bought the . powder called Jack3d from the internet. Its main active ingredient was . an amphetamine-like substance DMAA (dimethylamylamine) which boosts . energy and metabolism, but had been banned in the US and Canada after . two soldiers died during strenuous training after taking it. Battle: Paramedics attempted to revive Miss Squires, pictured (right) fundraising with a friend, who collapsed at Birdcage Walk but they were unable to save her . Before its ban in this country last . August, several months after Miss Squires’s death, it was one of the . UK’s most popular legal stimulants. Recording a narrative verdict, . coroner Dr Philip Barlow said the combination of the DMAA with . ‘extensive physical exertion caused cardiac failure which resulted in . her death.’ Outside Southwark Coroners Court, Mr . Van Herrewege, flanked by Miss Squires’s family, called for tighter . regulation of the health food and sports supplement industries. Seasoned runner: Claire Squires (right) with her friend Nicky Wells (left) while on holiday. An inquest into Claire's death has heard that she had taken Jack3D an energy supplement which has since been banned in the UK . Support: Donations flooded into Claire's Justgiving page after her death . Fighting . back tears, the 31-year-old said: ‘Claire’s death has left a gaping . hole in our hearts and in our lives, but we’ll always remember her with a . big smile on her face, trying to make everyone she met feel good about . themselves. ‘Claire was passionately against the . use of drugs and would never, ever, have taken anything that would have . caused her harm or even worse risked her life. She innocently took a . supplement which at the time was entirely legal, and widely available on . the high street, and somewhat worryingly, apparently used by so many . others. Final preparations: Claire, pictured in her running gear the night before the London Marathon, right . ‘It’s clear that there needs to be far . better supervision of the so-called health foods and supplements . industry so that no more tragedies like this happen again.’ He added . that the almost £1.2million raised in Miss Squires’s name for the . Samaritans had given her family and friends much comfort. Miss Squires, from North Kilworth in . Leicestershire, was an experienced runner and committed fundraiser. She . ran in memory of her brother Gary who died aged 25 from a drugs overdose . in 2001. Dr Barlow added: ‘I hope that the . coverage of this case and events leading up to Claire’s death will help . publicise the potential harmful effects of DMAA during extreme physical . exertion.’ High spirits: Claire Squires, pictured (left) the day before she ran the London Marathon last year, and smiling for a family photo, right . Claire Squires wanted to raise £500 for the Samaritans by running the London Marathon, but when news of her death became public last April, donations to her JustGiving page rocketed. Within days, the total raised was more than £500,000. To date almost £1.2million has been pledged in her memory, and the Samaritans said several projects had been established in her name. To donate, go to www.samaritans.org/your-community/creation-Claire-Squires-Fund . Mr Van Herrewege told the inquest that Miss Squires had taken the supplement once before but ‘never really got on with it’. ‘She said she was going to take one . scoop of it in her water bottle and if she hit a wall she would take it . to give her a boost.’ An off-duty paramedic said she saw Miss Squires, who ‘appeared tired and was slowing down’ just before she collapsed. Dr Nicola Drake, an A&E consultant . at St Thomas’s Hospital who tried to save Miss Squires, said DMAA had . been linked to the deaths of two US soldiers. She added: ‘It would give . someone a racing heart, increasing heart rate and make the heart work . much harder than it naturally would.’ DMAA has also been linked with high blood pressure, headaches, vomiting and strokes. Professor Sanjay Sharma, medical . director of the London Marathon, said: ‘No-one, particularly athletes . doing strenuous exercise, should take this supplement or indeed any . performance-enhancing drugs. It should not be available to be bought . either from shops or over the internet. ‘This is a tragedy that inadvertently cost a young girl her life.’ Huge event: Claire was one of 37,000 people who lined up at the start line of the annual race . Video: London Marathon runner's death blamed on supplement . Banned: Jack3d contains a stimulant called DMAA . Jack3D contained a stimulant known as DMAA (dimethylamylamine) that has been linked to high blood pressure, headaches, vomiting, stroke and even death. The UK’s medicines watchdog MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) ruled last August that it is unlicensed and that all other DMAA containing products needed to be removed from the market to protect public safety. Although DMAA is not illegal to take or possess in the UK it is no longer licensed so cannot be sold. The decision followed similar warnings around the world, including in the US and Australia where a man died after buying DMAA online. Jack3d is said to boost energy, concentration and metabolism. But DMAA, most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement, can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate, said the MHRA. This has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide, ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks. An MHRA spokesperson said at the time: 'Jack3d is mainly bought over the internet although it is also available in sports stores specialising in work out products. 'If we find a shop selling it we will send them a written reminder asking them to remove it from their shelves. If they ignore this then our enforcement officers will move in and begin legal action. 'It is the most popular sports supplement in the UK because it is a stimulant that allows you to work out for longer. 'But it is for people who are really into their fitness. Your average person who goes to the gym once or twice a week is unlikely to have ever used it.' A spokesman for the MHRA told MailOnline today it had . tried to take it off the UK market prior to last August but it was . delayed by an appeal from one of the retailers of the product.","Claire Squires collapsed less than a mile from the marathon's finish line .

"Marijuana has been legalized in Washington D.C., Oregon and Alaska as a series of sidelined pro-cannabis referendums were ushered in during the midterm elections. The legalization has provided a new high for the marijuana lobby, two years after Colorado and Washington led the way in approving cannabis for recreational use. On marijuana, Washington, D.C. approved the measure by 65 percent in favor and 28 percent against, while Oregon passed by 54 percent to 46 percent. In Alaska, the vote was passed with a 52 percent majority. Scroll down for video . Free weed: A medical marijuana dispensary in Sacramento, California, River City Phoenix (above), was offering a free gram of weed to members of the public who vote on Tuesday . Mike Elliot, head of the Colorado-based Marijuana Industry Group, said: 'More and more people are realizing that it makes sense to choose licensed, regulated, and taxed marijuana businesses over the drug cartels.' On the streets of the US capital, pro-marijuana campaigners were in jubilant form. The result in Washington D.C. became not just a practical victory for its campaigners, but also a symbolic one. Malik Burnett, a leading pro-cannabis campaigner, said: 'This is a great day for ending the war on drugs in the District of Columbia.' He told the Washington Post: 'This is huge. We’re talking about ending the prohibition of marijuana as a manifestation of the war on drugs, in the birthplace of the war on drugs: Washington, D.C. 'The District of Columbia was the birth place of the war on drugs, and marijuana prohibition was the engine of the war on drugs. Today we are putting the engine out of commission.' However, Florida appeared to have failed to approve a measure allowing marijuana for medical purposes. Some 57 percent voted in favor, less than the 60 percent required for the proposal to pass, partial results showed. Following Colorado and Washington's lead two years ago, the shift in policy could inspire other states to take similar action during the next election, and eventually, lead to loosened marijuana laws across the country. And while marijuana is nowhere to be found on the ballot in California, a medical marijuana dispensary in Sacramento, River City Phoenix, was offering a free gram of weed to members of the public who vote on Tuesday. Trail-blazer: Portland attorney Bradley Steinman (above), who helped write the initiative that became Oregon Measure 91, wore a Marijuana hat to support his work on Tuesday . Too good to be true: The Facebook message announcing free weed at River City Phoenix (above) Speaking with KCRA, manager Shayna Schonauer said, 'If people go out and they vote and they bring in their ""I Voted"" sticker, we're going to give them a complimentary gram on the house.' At least a dozen people had taken the dispensary up on their offer by midday. Opponents worry that the government won't truly be able to regulate the marijuana industry to make sure sellers are distributing safe to use product. They're also concerned that it will lead to greater numbers of car accidents as high drivers take to the roads. The Portland Mercury, a local paper, has pointed to Washington and Colorado as evidence that the argument is bogus. Neither states have seen an increased in roadway accidents since legalizing pot two years ago, it said. The New York Times and the state's most influential newspaper, The Oregonian, have both come out in favor of marijuana legalization in the state. Alaska's vote will change the law to allow people over the age of 21 to maintain six pot plants and poses a single ounce of dope. According to language contained in the measure, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board would implement the bill, but the state legislature would be required to develop a Marijuana Control Board to take over regulation of pot sales permanently. Activist Anastasia Stepanova from the D.C. Cannabis Campaign holds a sign during the midterm elections in Washington, D.C. encouraging voters to legalize recreational weed and low-level pot production . Washington, D.C. residents are voting on whether or not to legalize recreational weed and low-level pot production . A key argument against decriminalization in Alaska is that it would reportedly cost the state government $7 million per year to regulate. Meanwhile, residents in Washington, D.C. will be allowed to possess six pot plants and two ounces of weed. The D.C. ballot initiative would not provide any other regulatory guideline for recreational pot use however, such as government oversight and taxes. However, Congress, which has superseding authority over the District of Columbia, may strike it down. Likewise, even though ballot measures in Oregon and Alaska have received voters' approval, federal law still categorizes the possession, sale and distribution of dope a crime. The Drug Policy Alliance, the main group pushing for the Oregon ballot initiative, is working world wide to get pot-friendly laws passed. Already, they are working to get pro-pot bills on the ballot in several states ahead of the 2016 elections, which reportedly include California, Arizona, Massachusetts and Nevada. 'If we lose in Oregon, it will shift the national frame a little bit,' Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the group, had previously told NBC. 'But it doesn’t change the strategy and it doesn’t change the tactics,' he said. 'A generation from now people will still step back and look at the prohibition of marijuana and say, what the heck was that about?' Oregon voters decided for the third time today whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and the businesses that support it . Likewise, Mason Tvert, communications director of the Washington, D.C. based Marijuana Policy Project, another leader in the legalization movement and a major funder of the Alaska initiative, said today's outcome would have little effect on the future of decriminalization. Tvert's group alone put $700,000 into the Alaska measure. It would like to see restrictions on weed that are similar to those on alcohol. State and local ballot initiatives, such as those which have introduced the pro-marijuana legislation, are often overlooked in the frenzy for the U.S. Senate. The Rocky Mountain state in 2012 became the first state, along with Washington, to give the thumbs up to recreational marijuana use after a pro-pot ballot initiative was approved by voters. This year Coloradoans are being asked to consider a measure that would give unborn babies the same legal rights as babies out of the womb. The initiative would amend the Colorado constitution to redefine person and child in the state's wrongful death act to 'include unborn human beings.' The suggested law change is in response to the death of an unborn baby named 'Brady' who was killed by a drunk driver in his mother's eight month of pregnancy. Current Colorado law does considers an unborn child part of its mother's body, and so the driver was not charged with homicide. Opponents of the law, which include Planned Parenthood, say the language change could lead to the criminalization of abortion. In the end, a resounding majority of the voters declined. Proponents of Amendment 67 on Tuesday. Marijuana was just one subject being voted on, along with everything from abortion to gay marriage and GMOs to bear-baiting, in state and local referendums held in the sidelines of the US midterm elections. Same-sex marriage, which is also in the process of being legalized by many US states, was put to a referendum in Arizona, which amended its constitution to outlaw it five years ago. Another hot button issue, abortion, was on the ballot in Colorado, North Dakota and Tennessee. In Colorado a proposal to define a fetus as a person was rejected by 64 percent to 36 percent of voters. In North Dakota pro-abortion voters also won by 64 percent to 36 percent. Firearms measures were voted on in Alabama, Missouri and Washington state, where there were two opposing ballots: one making it tougher to buy a gun by imposing background checks, and the other seeking to ban exactly that measure. Eight towns and cities voted on anti-fracking proposals. The extraction of oil and gas from shale via hydraulic fracturing has boosted US oil production, but critics fear its impact on the environment. Several towns and cities voted on measures against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Referendums in Oregon and Colorado sought to make it mandatory to label food containing GMOs. On a lighter note, in California a measure proposed in San Francisco and Berkeley would impose a tax of one cent per centiliter on sugary beverages, in a bid to combat obesity and other health problems. Voters in Alaska were consulted on a proposal to ban mining activity if it endangers wild salmon. Also aiming to protect animals, the East Coast state of Maine was asked to ban the use of food to bait bears, in particular using cold pizza and donuts as lures.","Washington D.C. legalizes recreational weed and low-level production .

"A woman who survived a near-fatal car accident only to suffer a devastating bacterial infection in her colon has been cured after undergoing an unusual treatment known as a 'fecal matter transplant.' Kaitlin Hunter's life threatening infection was cured after fecal matter from her mother, including healthy bacteria, was transplanted into her colon. Hunter, 20, of Marietta, Georgia, was involved in a car accident in June 2011 in which her lower spine was fractured, her liver and colon lacerated, and all 10 toes were broken. Scroll down for video . Road to recovery: Kaitlin Hunter's life threatening infection was cured after fecal matter from her mother was transplanted into her colon . After a month in hospital in Sacramento, California, Hunter was flown home to Georgia. When she arrived home, she complained of extremely bad stomach pains, which was diagnosed as C. diff, also known as bacteria clostridium difficile. The C. diff had infected Hunter's colon, causing severe stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. She was prescribed antibiotics to cure the infection. After nine rounds of antibiotics, Hunter's  weight plummeted to 85 pounds, she was still ill and had lost 40 pounds. It was then that doctors decided to take a different approach, known as a 'fecal matter transplants' which recolonizes the colon with new bacteria from a healthy donor. Hunter's mother 'donated' one of her stools for the procedure. Next, the hospital lab carefully diluted it, and the doctor pumped the foreign fecal matter into Hunter's colon. The procedure took place in July and Hunter is happy to report that she has been cured. 'I've been so happy,' said told CNN. C. diff infections kill about 14,000 people in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the number and severity of total cases have increased dramatically over the past decade.","Kaitlin Hunter survived a car accident, only then to battle a bacterial infection .

"Police in Germany have raided dozens of addresses to foil an Islamist terror plot intending to use remote controlled model aircraft filled with explosives to be flown into targets. Armed officers of the specialist G9G units raided homes in Stuttgart, Munich and Dachau after receiving information that at least one assassination attempt was being planned using the model planes as guided missiles. Technical materials and paperwork were seized at several addresses while prosecutors spoke of plans for a 'seditious outrage'. Arrests: Police leads away a handcuffed suspect in Fellbach, Germany, this morning after raiding a residential building in the village . Evidence: Investigators carry boxes out of a house in Fellbach, Germany, after raiding a residential building in connection with a suspected terrorist plot . German intelligence officers have been warning for some time of a home-grown attack inside the country's borders as more and more Islamists return from Jihadist training camps in Pakistan ready to commit terrorist acts. As well as the addresses in southern Germany, an Internet service provider in the state of Saxony was also raided. At least two men are in custody and authorities say the operations will continue as more intelligence is gathered. No information was given about likely targets or exactly which Jihadist organisation the suspects are affiliated with. In custody: At least two men are in custody following police raids in Germany to investigate a terrorist plot - with public radio reporting that alleged Islamist militants were planning to use remote-controlled model airplanes . Target: The property in Fellbach, Germany, is one of several targeted in a string of dawn raids this morning . French authorities have detained nine people suspected of plotting attacks in France or of belonging to jihadi networks in anti-terrorist raids this week, officials said. France has been on higher alert for potential attacks since French troops entered Mali earlier this year to push out al-Qaida-linked extremists who had seized much of the West African country. Police detained six people suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in the Paris region on Monday. The suspects, aged between 22 and 38 years old, were being questioned today by anti-terrorist investigators. In an unrelated investigation, three suspected extremists were detained this morning by agents from the DCRI intelligence agency. Some 48 people have been detained this year in 21 anti-terrorist operations. Most were let go, but some 17 remain in custody pending further investigation. One of the addresses raided was at the . Olympic Village in Munich, scene of the 1972 Olympic massacre when . fanatics of the Black September movement stormed the living quarters of . Israeli athletes. All eleven hostages later died in a shootout at Munich . Airport. Prosecutors said that the arrests were linked to a plot centred on Islamist 'Holy war' but gave no further details. German media reported that some model aircraft, which are powerful and big enough to carry explosives capable of destroying a commerical building, were seized in the raids early this morning. The paperwork taken from several of the suspect addresses also relates to money laundering necessary to fund the planned outrages, according to media reports. The suspects are of Tunisian descent. Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which deals with internal terror threats, said only recently in its annual report that the country remains a 'top target' for Islamist fanatics for its support for NATO operations in Afghanistan.

"A police officer who got into a row with a colleague over a French woman has been cleared of assaulting him and claiming he was acting in self-defence. PC Kevin Wasboonma, 30, was accused of punching PC Michael Scullion 33 times after spending hours drinking together at the Alwyne Castle in Highbury, north London, after work. A team of decorators, who were renovating the pub at the time, captured footage of the brawl - which showed Wasboonma hitting Mr Scullion - but he was found not guilty this afternoon. PC Kevin Wasboonma (left) has been cleared of punching colleague PC Michael Scullion (right) 33 times and kicking his head like a football in a row at the pub over a French woman . Southwark Crown Court heard that Wasboonma had drunk seven pints of cider and several Jagerbombs before the pair started fighting outside on the pavement. Wasboonma insisted he punched Mr Scullion in self defence after his colleague came ‘steaming’ towards him but denied kicking him and said the camera footage only showed part of the fight. The officers, who are friends and have known each other for six and a half years, had left work in Haringey at around 3pm on June 12, last year to catch up over a pint. But the evening descended into violence after the men  squabbled over a French woman and began trading insults. Wasboonma had drunk seven pints of cider and several Jagerbombs before the pair starting fighting outside the Alwyne Castle pub in Highbury, north London (pictured) A jury of six men and six women cleared Wasboonma of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after just one hour and 23 minutes. During the trial the judge Mr Recorder Gregory Mitchell QC had asked prosecutor Senghin Kong why only Wasboonma was charged. 'Just as a matter of law, two people fighting in the street, is that the offence of affray?,' he asked. 'Potentially your honour,' replied Mr Kong. 'Two police officers being drunk and fighting in the street - they could both be in trouble for that,' said the judge. 'Potentially, yes,' replied Mr Kong. Robert Morris, for Wasboonma, added: 'Self-defence is also a defence to affray but very much the Crown here have pinned their colours to the mast.' The pub was packed with French people meeting for a social event organised on Facebook, jurors heard. Wasboonma and Mr Scullion started talking to a group of girls before numbers dwindled at closing time. In interview Wasboonma said: 'As we went inside, the group sort of got smaller so there were two French girls that we met, everything was fine. 'I got up, went to the bathroom, everyone was leaving. As we have left the pub the two girls that we were talking to most of the night and this guy were walking off as if they were upset about something. Wasboonma (pictured) insisted he punched Mr Scullion in self defence after his colleague came ‘steaming’ towards him but denied kicking him . Southwark Crown Court heard decorators, who were renovating the pub at the time, caught the attack on camera - and it shows Wasboonma (pictured) hitting Mr Scullion. But Wasboonma said it only showed a part . The man turned to Mr Scullion and told him: 'Maybe you should just leave it', jurors heard. 'I said to the guy what had happened and he said they just want to go home now and the girls didn't even say goodbye. 'I didn't know what had happened so then I said to Michael ""you know what happened?"" at which point he started shouting ""It was me, it was me!"" but I didn't really understand why he was saying that,' Wasboonma said. 'Michael started going mad at me, calling me a f****** p**** - all of that, being really abusive towards me.' He said Mr Scullion then launched himself at him, pushing him in the neck and causing him to fall back onto a table. Wasboonma, of Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm . 'He starts to be abusive, he says stuff about my personal life - quite hurtful, insulting someone who is important to me at which point I have turned around and said to him ""I want nothing more to do with you don't ever contact me again"".' He said he turned to leave the pub but Mr Scullion punched him again and the pair grappled to the floor, the court heard. 'I then said to him ""stop, we are going to lose our jobs over this"" because I was worried because obviously if police came past and we are having a roll-around on the floor. 'He has refused to let go of me, he is still grappling with me, he has punched me in the ribs and he wouldn't let me get up so I have punched him,' he said. 'He is grabbing me and all the time he is saying I am going to glass you in the face and then I hit him repeatedly to get him off me,' he said. They were broken up by decorators who recorded part of the incident on a mobile phone. At around 1:45am Mr Scullion was picked up by two police officers who had been flagged down by a member of the public. Mr Scullion ‘seemed drunk’ and suffered ‘lumps and bumps to the head’ and a small cut to his nose and lip. He told the officers: ‘I had a fight with my best mate, he is a police officer too, we work together.’ Mr Scullion was taken to Whittington Hospital in north London and treated for bruising and a lesion. But Wasboonma said he was not angry or drunk and pressed he was acting in self-defence from his 'violent' pal. 'I felt tipsy and stuff but not to the point I was unaware of what was going on, I can't stand up straight or I needed help to get home,' he said. 'I wasn't angry, I wasn't angry I just wanted to go home and wanted to take myself out of that equation and leave.' Wasboonma, of Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was found not guilty. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said Wasboonma automatically faces misconduct proceedings and added: ‘No other police officer is subject to misconduct proceedings as a result of this case.’","PC Kevin Wasboonma filmed attacking PC Michael Scullion outside pub .

"James Marcus Howe, 42, died the morning before Thanksgiving after an intruder posing as a solicitor shot him . Reality TV director James Marcus Howe, 42, and a female identified as his wife, were shot last week on the morning before Thanksgiving in what seemed to be a 'random act of violence'. Howe died and his wife remains hospitalized. Police were called at 10:51 a.m. on Wednesday November 27. Police continued to search for the . shooter today. The unknown suspect barged into the home on the 4400 . block of West Avenue 42 in Los Angeles and opened fire, reported KTLA. According to a release . from the Los Angeles Police Department, Howe opened the door after . hearing a knock. As he approached the door, two intruders forced their . way into his home. Police reported that there was a struggle, and during the scuffle, one of the two intruders fired a gun. According to LAPD, the intruders were described as two black males, one between the ages of 16 and 22 and the other between the ages of 20 and 15. The older suspect is thought to be the shooter. There was allegedly one black female involved in the shooting as well. According to Police, the members of the trio were posing as solicitors. Police are searching for an early 2000 Ford Mustang, dark in color, that witnesses saw speed off after the shooting. LAPD Detective Harold Dicroce told CBS 2 that Howe and his wife recently moved to the neighborhood with their 6-year-old son. Neither of the victims had criminal records. The child was not home at the time of the shooting and is being cared for by his aunt. Howe was a reality TV show director and worked on shows such as 'America's Next Top Model' and 'Tila Tequila'.

"Olivia Stanca, pictured with her mother Maria, passed away last night, hours after she was taken off a life support machine . The heartbroken parents of a one-year-old girl who lost a long court battle to keep her on life support announced their 'angel' had passed away last night. Olivia Stanca, described as a 'little fighter', was born with liver cancer and defied all odds to celebrate her first birthday on Monday. Parents Maria and George were preparing to oppose Great Ormond Street hospital's decision to withdraw life support. But last night they bravely accepted her condition was deteriorating and dropped their legal challenge. The little girl died shortly after the machine was switched off as the family made their way to the hospital's rooftop garden to spend their last moments peacefully and privately, after pleading to take her outside. In a statement on Facebook, they said: 'With the greatest sadness and broken hearts we have to tell you that our baby girl became an angel this evening. 'Thank you so much for your support. Lots of love from Olivia and us.' Mrs Stanca today said: 'Following the decision not to give her blood pressure drugs, our beloved daughter Olivia had no more chances and yesterday at lunch we decided to keep the promises we made to her. 'We always promised her that we will let her go when she wants to go, we promised to hold her and love her and we promised to get her out of the intensive care unit.' Anne-Marie Irwin, an associate solicitor with law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represented the family, said: 'Following yesterday's court hearings, Olivia died in her parents arms shortly after the family made their way up to the rooftop garden at the hospital. 'This is obviously a very difficult time for them and they now need space to grieve the loss of their daughter who has been bravely fighting for her life for a year.' Olivia, whose first birthday was on Monday, beat her cancer after two rounds of chemotherapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital. 'With the greatest sadness and broken hearts': Parents Maria and George announced Olivia's death on Facebook after bravely accepting her condition was deteriorating and dropped their legal challenge . Family: Olivia Stanca's heartbroken parents Maria and George (above) asked to spend their precious last hours with her in the roof garden at Great Ormond Street Hospital, before she passed away last night . The roof garden at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where Olivia spent her final few hours with her family . But she suffered several blood infections and recurrent episodes of severe multiple organ failure. Mr and Mrs Stanca had pleaded with doctors to be allowed to take her to a park for what would have been the first time. Fiona Paterson, counsel for the Hospital Trust, told Court of Protection judge Mr Justice Moylan yesterday that it was her mother Maria's wish to take her daughter outside. Olivia passed away in her parents arms after she was taken off a life support machine at lunchtime . The hospital arranged  for the 33-year-old engineering student and her husband George to be alone with Olivia on the hospital's roof garden after medical experts predicted it would be the final hours of her life. Hospital staff opened the garden to the family so they could enjoy being together in a peaceful setting, but she passed away moments later. Aside from the two nurses on standby, it was believed to be one of the rare times that Mr and Mrs Stanca have spent time alone with their sick daughter. The arrangements  were made after they agreed to the withdrawal of her life support. A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital said: 'Our thoughts are with Olivia's family at this extremely difficult time. We appreciate how hugely distressing the past year has been for them and we are continuing to support them in every way we can. 'Olivia was an extremely ill child with a very complex and unusual combination of conditions. 'We tried everything we could to strengthen Olivia and give her the best possible chance of survival, having provided her with the maximum level of treatment and 24-hour nursing care on our Intensive Care Unit for the past 12 months. 'However she reached the point where she was no longer responding to treatment and had been in multiple organ failure for a number of months. 'Olivia was a true fighter, and this was matched by the strength and dedication of her parents. We are so glad they managed to have the private time they needed as a family before she died.' Olivia beat cancer after two rounds of chemotherapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital but has had several blood infections and recurrent episodes of severe multiple organ failure. She was born with a tumour on her adrenal gland which spread to her liver. The chemotherapy has left her underweight and vulnerable to infection. Distressing choice: Mr and Mrs Stanca were preparing to oppose the hospital's decision to withdraw life support from their 'little fighter'. But last night they dropped their challenge . Close bond: This image of Olivia with her father George was taken in November and was uploaded to Olivia's Voice - the Facebook page set up by her family to keep people up to date on her progress . The hospital trust was due to ask the High Court in London for permission to discontinue a range of treatments, including renal replacement therapy, because doctors did not think it in her best interests to continue treatment. Mr and Mrs Stanca, from Walthamstow, East London, were planning to oppose the application and ask for everything possible to be done to keep their child alive. But yesterday Mr Justice Moylan, sitting in the Court of Protection, heard that the couple had accepted Olivia's life was ending and agreed to life support being withdrawn following a rapid deterioration in her condition. Fiona Paterson, for the trust, speaking at the hearing yesterday said that Olivia's parents 'now accept an end-of-life plan is necessary'. She added: 'Maria's dearest wish is to take her daughter to a park and be alone with her and her husband. That's why the roof garden was proposed. She is deteriorating quite rapidly. 'Olivia's life support has been withdrawn save for a portable ventilator and an intravenous infusion of painkiller to keep her relaxed and sedated. 'She will be taken to a roof garden in the hospital with two of the nursing staff who have good relations with the family. The family will be allowed to spend time alone, save for the two nurses. 'It is very likely Olivia will die in the next few hours. If she survives beyond 8pm her family will be in a private room and the nursing staff will give them as much privacy as possible.' Tiny: Arrangements for the couple to share Olivia's precious hours in a roof garden at the hospital were made after they agreed to the withdrawal of her life support . Decision: Olivia beat cancer after two rounds of chemotherapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital (pictured) but had several blood infections and recurrent episodes of severe multiple organ failure . Earlier Mrs Stanca said: 'Olivia is a little fighter. She is a beautiful baby. She loves life, loves to learn, interacts and relishes attention, and while we appreciate she is not well, we just want to give her the best possible chance of survival …and believe that with more time she will recover. 'She is our daughter and we have only just celebrated her first birthday and it is heart-breaking to be in this situation.' The couple had started an online appeal to raise £550,000 for Olivia to go to a private clinic. By today the appeal had raised just over £52,000. Solicitor Anne-Marie Irwin, representing the family, said: 'This is clearly a distressing time for Olivia's parents. There are no winners in this situation. 'The courts are charged with making very tough decisions where there are disputes between parents and clinicians over serious life or death medical issues. This is a tragic and incredibly sensitive case.'","Olivia Stanca, of east London, described by her parents as 'little fighter'

"If you're looking for a lakeside retreat on a budget, it's likely you could easily pick up a villa near to Russia's beautiful Lake Karachay and still have change left for a new sofa. But it's probably worth bearing in mind that in 1990 just standing on the shore for an hour would give you a radiation of dose of 600 roentgen. In case you were wondering, that's more than enough to kill you. Scroll down for video . Lake Karachay, Chelyabinsk, Russia: These days the lake is mostly covered with concrete. In 1990 standing on its shore for more than an hour would be lethal . The lake, in Russia's south-west Chelyabinsk region, close to the modern border with Kazakhstan, is located within the Mayak Production Association, one of the country's largest — and leakiest — nuclear facilities. Built in the Forties as Soviets moved armament production east to avoid the Nazi invasion, Mayak was one of the Russia's most important nuclear weapons factories and was off limits to foreigners for 45 years. It was only after President Boris Yeltsin signed a 1992 decree opening up the area that Western scientists were able to gain access - and promptly declared it the planet's most polluted area. In their long decades of obscurity, the nuclear engineers at Mayak spent their time mainly having nuclear meltdowns and dumping radioactive waste into the river. The watered-down waste was a cocktail of radioactive elements, including long-lived fission products such as Strontium-90 and Cesium-137–each with a half-life of approximately thirty years. When their facility's existence was finally acknowledged, the Chelyabinsk region had seen a 21 per cent increase in cancer, a 25 per cent increase in birth defects, and a 41 per cent increase in leukaemia. Irradiated: The ruins left by an explosion of nuclear waste storage tanks at the Mayak nuclear facility in 1957 . The nearby Techa river, on which several villages relied for water, was so contaminated that up to 65 per cent of locals were stricken with radiation sickness. Prevented from mentioning radiation in their diagnoses, doctors treating those who had fallen ill termed the sickness 'special disease'. Even then, these notes were classified until 1990. The rural communities surrounding the . nuclear facility suffered greatly from their government's nuclear arms . race with the U.S. Eager to catch up with the technological development . of Western weapons, the Mayak engineers didn't worry too much about . safety and the facility suffered several major accidents in the Fifties . and Sixties. Radioactive wasteland: This map shows the location of Lake Karachay and the surrounding Chelyabinsk region, which is still badly contaminated by nuclear waste . By the mid-Fifties they decided, belatedly, to cease dumping nuclear waste into nearby lakes and rivers, instead pumping it into a row of vats. Then in September 1957 they exploded with a force equivalent to about 85 tons of TNT, spewing about 70 tons of radioactive waste a mile high. The dust cloud spread isotopes of cesium and strontium over 9,000 square miles, affecting some 270,000 Soviet citizens and their food supplies. With their waste storage system obliterated, authorities decided to direct Malak's constant flow of radioactive effluent into Lake Karachay, which lacked any surface outlets making engineers optimistic that anything dumped there would be entombed indefinitely. This worked okay for ten years, until a severe drought struck the whole of Chelyabinsk. Lake Karachay gradually began to dry up, exposing the radioactive sediment in its basin. The spread of toxic dust peppered about 900 square miles of land with Strontium-90, Caesium-137 and a host of other unpleasant elements. Today, huge tracts of Chelyabinsk remain uninhabitable as a result of the river contamination, the 1957 blast and the 1967 drought. Lake Karachay's surface is now more concrete than water, but its contamination is still not contained. Estimates suggest approximately a billion gallons of groundwater have been contaminated with 5 megacuries of radionuclides and even today, the local population still does not know the actual levels of radioisotopes in its home grown products.","Lake Karachay was a dumping ground for one of the Soviet Union's biggest nuclear weapons facilities .
A string of accidents and disasters has left the surrounding regime completely contaminated with radioactive waste ."
"Facebook heads are considering incorporating most of its 1 billion-plus members' profile photos into its growing facial recognition database, expanding the scope of the social network's controversial technology. The possible move, which Facebook revealed in an update to its data use policy on Thursday, is intended to improve the performance of its 'Tag Suggest' feature. The feature uses facial recognition technology to speed up the process of labeling or 'tagging' friends and acquaintances who appear in photos posted on the network. The technology currently automatically identifies faces in newly uploaded photos by comparing them only to previous snapshots in which users were tagged. Facebook users can choose to remove tags identifying them in photos posted by others on the site. Tagged: The database would enable Facebook to improve its Tag Suggest feature . The changes would come at a time when Facebook and other Internet companies' privacy practices are under scrutiny, following the revelations of a U.S. government electronic surveillance program.Facebook, Google and other companies have insisted that they have never participated in any program giving the government direct access to their computer servers and that they only provide information in response to specific requests, after careful review and as required by law. Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan said that adding members' public profile photos would give users better control over their personal information, by making it easier to identify posted photos in which they appear. 'Our goal is to facilitate tagging so that people know when there are photos of them on our service,' Egan said. Private lives: Erin Egan (pictured) says that the database will actually improve privacy because people will immediately know when photos of them have been put on Facebook . She stressed that Facebook users uncomfortable with facial recognition technology will still be able to 'opt out' of the Tag Suggest feature altogether, in which case the person's public profile photo would not be included in the facial recognition database.Facial recognition technology has been a sensitive issue for technology companies, raising concerns among some privacy advocates and government officials. Tag Suggest, which the company introduced in 2011, is not available in Europe due to concerns raised by regulators there. Google's social network, Google+, also employs similar technology, but requires user consent. And it has banned third-party software makers from using facial recognition technology in apps designed for its Glass wearable computer. Database decisions: Facebook won't guarantee that it won't use its photo database for other purposes than its Tag Suggest feature . Egan said Facebook was not currently using facial recognition technology for any other features, but that could change. 'Can I say that we will never use facial recognition technology for any other purposes? Absolutely not,' Egan said. But, she noted, 'if we decided to use it in different ways we will continue to provide people transparency about that and we will continue to provide control.' Facebook also amended its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities on Thursday, adding and tweaking the language so that members under 18 years of age are deemed to have affirmed that a parent or legal guardian has agreed to allow marketers to use some of their personal information in ads. The language was the result of a recent court-approved legal settlement regarding its 'sponsored stories' ads.","Facebook may add user profile pictures to a facial recognition database .

"Three friends with learning difficulties, including one with Down's syndrome, have been turned away from their local pub after being told they weren't good enough to perform karaoke. Singer James Smyth, 23, said he was barred with his friends, David Griffiths and Keiffer Courtney-Lee, because they were out of tune and 'bad for business'. The trio of Beatles fans wanted to sing versions of the Fab Four's Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine on Friday nights. Singer James Smyth (left), 23, said he was barred with his friends David Griffiths and Keiffer Courtney-Lee because they were out of tune and 'bad for business' But last week, staff at The Abington pub in Northampton refused to let them go up on stage. Alex Duggan, who cares for the men in Ryan QC Homes supported accommodation, told the Daily Mirror: 'The DJ handed out ­songbooks to all the tables in the pub, but not to our residents. 'He said he was not allowed to let the residents sing anymore.' But pub landlord Neil Bartholomey denied saying the singers were bad for business, insisting they were just terrible vocalists. James was not allowed to perform because 'he just shouts words - there is no tune', according to the chairman of Northampton Pubwatch . Mr Bartholomey, who is also chairman of crime/anti-social behaviour monitoring group Northampton Pubwatch, added: 'James was asked not to sing purely on his ability. He just shouts words. 'There is no tune. James is a pleasant, well presented lad, he just can't sing. 'The karaoke guy organises the entertainment and if it's not successful, he won't come any more. 'It has nothing to do with whether people have a disability, it's about whether people can entertain and sing. Staff at The Abington pub in Northampton refused to let the trio go up on stage . 'Everyone has a right to have a go but if their audition is not successful, they do not have the right to sing again.' Laurie Duggan, director . of Ryan QC Homes, said the pub's stance was nothing to do with singing . ability. She told the Northampton Chronicle that the decision was 'totally inaccurate and insulting'. Ms Duggan said there was a wider issue at stake than that of them not being able . to sing karaoke. She added: 'We are totally . distraught that here we are in 2011 with very clear discrimination . against three young men, purely based on the fact they have a learning . disability.

"An angry Gumtree user has got his revenge on an unscrupulous seller who conned him out of £80 by sending the man the entire works of William Shakespeare via 29,000 text messages. Edd Joseph, a 24-year-old from Bristol, was furious when the Sony PS3 console he bought on Gumtree failed to arrive, so decided to get back at the seller by bombarding him with messages. The graphic designer wanted to the send the conman as many texts as possible, so started by copying and pasting Macbeth into 600 messages, All's Well That Ends Well into 861, and Hamlet into an irritating 1,143. Revenge: Edd Joseph wanted to get back at the conman so started bombarding him with thousands of text messages containing the works of Shakespeare . Technique: To send the messages, Mr Joseph simply copies the entire wording of each play using a single click on an app on his iPhone, then pastes it into a text (pictured) Mr Joseph was able to send the messages at no expense as he is on a £37-a-month unlimited contract with 02. The contract allows him to make as many calls or texts as he wants without paying anything extra. And sending the messages was not nearly as time consuming as it sounds, as Mr Joseph simply copies the entire text of each play using a single click on an app on his iPhone. He then pastes the full wording into a single message, which his phone automatically breaks down into 160 word segments while sending. Great lengths: Edd Joseph says he is not a particularly avid fan of  William Shakespeare but claims to now have 'a new appreciation' for the Bard's works - especially the longer ones . The messaging campaign began last Thursday when the PS3 console Mr Joseph purchased from a user calling himself 'David Williams' failed to arrive, and a demand for a refund went unanswered. As he had already paid the . Derby-based seller the money through a direct bank transfer a week . earlier, Mr Joseph had broken Gumtree's terms of service, so the website . was unable to help. Mr Joseph claims that when he contacted the police, they told him that there was little hope of catching the conman. Feeling helpess, he decided to send all 30,000 words written by Shakespeare via text message. So far Mr Joseph has sent 22 plays including Hamlet, Macbeth and Othello which have been delivered in 17,424 texts. By the time he reaches the final play, Mr Joseph thinks he will have sent a total of 29,305 messages. The . remaining 15 works will take another few days to send, meaning the . conman's phone will have been receiving a new text message every few . seconds for almost a week by the time it has finished. Speaking of his act of revenge, Mr Joseph said: 'I was really annoyed and I was trying to think of ways of being more in the position of power because I felt so helpless about it.' 'My first thought was that I could try and pretend I had found out where he lived but it was all a bit of a cliche and it wasn’t going to worry him really. 'Then it just occurred to me you can copy and paste things from the internet and into a text message. 'It . got me thinking, ‘what can I sent to him’ which turned to ‘what is a . really long book’, which ended with me sending him Macbeth.' Since sending the messages, Mr Joseph has started receiving abusive responses from the seller. Con: Edd Joseph was furious when the Sony PS3 console (pictured) he bought on Gumtree failed to arrive, so decided to get back at the seller by bombarding him with messages . 'I got the first reply after an hour, and then a few more abusive messages after that,' he said. 'Recently he has taken to calling me and giving me abuse on the phone. I tried to ask him if he was enjoying the plays, but he was very confused.' 'I’m going to keep doing it. If nothing else I’m sharing a little bit of culture with someone who probably doesn’t have much experience of it.' Mr Joseph says he is not a particularly avid fan of Shakespeare but claims to now have 'a new appreciation' for the Bard's works - especially the longer ones.","Edd Joseph was furious when the PS3 console he purchased failed to arrive .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has asked NICE to work with cancer charities in the hope that more life-extending drugs will be approved for use . Jeremy Hunt will today order a review of the system for approving cancer drugs amid criticism that thousands of NHS patients are denied life-extending treatment. The Health Secretary will tell the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to work with cancer charities and researchers. He will also announce a 40 per cent rise in resources to pay for vital treatments blocked by NICE. He is to increase the Cancer Drugs Fund from £200million to £280million for the next two years to improve access to drugs currently deemed too expensive. NICE has been ordered to review its system for approving drugs following complaints that it bases its trials solely on patients with no other underlying health conditions. It is being asked to include evidence from patients with other conditions, a move that could see more drugs being approved. Health chiefs have been told to renegotiate with the drugs industry to drive down the price of cancer treatments. ‘It’s vitally important that as many people as possible have access to these pioneering, life-enhancing drugs,’ said Mr Hunt, adding that the fund ‘has an essential role in helping us realise our ambition to be the best place in Europe to survive cancer’. Two more drugs have been approved for immediate inclusion on the Cancer Drugs Fund list as a result of today’s decision. The first is Xtandi, a drug for treating advanced prostate cancer. The second is Revlimid, which will become available for patients with the rare blood condition myelodysplastic syndrome for the first time. Officials will also now review the list of drugs approved by the fund ‘to ensure patients are offered the most effective drugs for their condition and [so that] new drugs can be added to the list’. The Cancer Drugs Fund was established in April 2011 following a public outcry at decisions by NICE to block certain treatments on cost grounds. It is credited with helping more than 55,000 cancer patients by paying for costly drugs that would not otherwise have been provided on the NHS. But critics complain it is little more than a sticking plaster and are pressing for fundamental reform of NICE. The organisation, which is responsible for deciding which drugs are made available on the NHS, is blamed by some for unfairly blocking drugs it deems to be poor value for money. Xtandi, a drug designed to fight prostate cancer (pictured), has already been approved under the new rules. Mr Hunt will also increase the Cancer Drugs Fund from £200million to £280million for the next two years . NICE says it makes no sense to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient, when the money could be better spent on other treatments. But critics point out that it rejects almost two-thirds of the cancer treatments it assesses – meaning that patients in England are denied drugs that are available in other parts of the world. NICE came under fire earlier this month when it rejected the drug Kadcyla, which can extend life for women with an aggressive form of breast cancer for six months, but which costs £90,000 per patient. The Department of Health last night said the drug was available via the Cancer Drugs Fund, and that funding for the scheme has been guaranteed until at least 2016. Cancer charities welcomed the increased funding and said a thorough review was vital. Mark Flannagan, chief executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘The current system of pricing and approving drugs is broken and is letting down cancer patients. ‘NICE and the pharmaceutical industry must show greater flexibility and a genuine willingness to work together in the interests of all cancer patients.’ Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, described the funding increase and review as ‘an important start’ in ensuring the Cancer Drugs Fund is sustainable in the long-term. Chris Askew, chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, also welcomed the news, but warned that several ‘innovative, effective drugs’ are still ‘sitting on the shelf of no use to anybody’.","NICE only approves drugs tested on patients with no other conditions .

"She's known and loved in the fashion industry for her quirky, urban style and if there's one girl who pioneered the sportsluxe street trend, it's undoubtedly Cara Delevingne. So when the supermodel announced she was working on a range for DKNY fashion fans couldn't wait. And now the model-turned-actress' range has finally dropped her fans, who call themselves Delevingners, will be pleased to hear that it does indeed mirror her cool, London style. Here it is! Cara Delevingne has unveiled her debut fashion range for DKNY . Cara first started to work with DKNY almost two years ago as a model. Talking about the design collaboration she explains that the brand has have always encouraged her input, personal style and ideas from the very beginning of the working relationship. Speaking about the new drop, the 22-year-old said: 'It was an organic process and it made sense. DKNY is urban and edgy but most of all, it’s individual. They truly embrace the weirdness in all of us, so you can really be yourself. 'I can’t believe that some random, rough ideas have finally turned into my own collection! Designs with my own name on them and in collaboration with the iconic DKNY brand. 'It is so wild to realise that it has been an entire year since we began planning this project together and it goes to show that time does fly when you’re having fun.' Stars of the future: Cara launched a social media competition to find her campaign models . In the family: Cara has already worked with the brand for several seasons as a model . Behind the lens: The 22-yr-old says that DKNY gave her lots of creative control on the project .

"What does it feel like to have the universe at your fingertips? The blind and visually impaired will soon be able to find out through a project that has developed 3D printed tactile pictures of the cosmos. Astronomers from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland are using images taken by the Hubble telescope and translating them into something that can be felt on plastic. Scroll down for video... Researchers are experimenting with 3D printing o transform astronomy education by turning images from the Hubble Space Telescope into tactile 3D pictures for people who cannot explore celestial wonders by sight . The incredible iconic image of the star cluster NGC 609, for instance, shows several new stars circling around a striking bubble of gas and dust. Visually it’s stunning, and recreating that experience through touch is a major challenge as researchers can't really see space objects in three dimensions. ‘The work is scientific, but it's also guesswork and artistry to try to produce an object, which printed, will look like the image that Hubble has taken,’ said astronomer Antonella Nota. This incredible iconic image of the star cluster NGC 609 shows several new stars circling around a striking bubble of gas and dust. It is the first to be translated into plastic using 3D printing . So far, the scientists have developed 3D tactile prototype representations in plastic showing the stars, filaments, gas, and dust seen in the visual image using textures such as raised open circles, lines, and dots . Astronomers in Maryland have so far developed 3D representations of filaments, gas, and dust seen in the star cluster NGC 602. Using a 3D printer, they represented each feature using different textures on a plastic sheet including raised open circles, lines, and dots. These . features also have different heights to correspond with their . brightness. The tallest, and therefore brightest, features are a tight . group of open circles, which represent the stars in the core of the . cluster. The team is now designing a way of . rendering the nebula's structure onto a sphere that represents its true 3D shape. ‘We are basically designing the process from scratch.’ So far, the scientists have developed 3D tactile prototype representations of the stars, filaments, gas, and dust seen in NGC 602 using various textures such as raised open circles, lines, and dots. These features also have different heights to correspond with their brightness. The tallest, and therefore brightest, features are a tight group of open circles, which represent the stars in the core of the cluster. The 3D printouts of NGC 602 are a first steps towards the team’s goal of creating a 3D model of the cluster that people will be able to hold in their hands and study. ‘Imagine making a visualisation that you visually fly through, and as you fly through, first you encounter filaments, and then you see some dust and also some stars,’ said researcher Carol Christian. The team is designing a way of rendering the nebula's structure onto a sphere that represents its 3D shape . ‘As you fly to the back side of the cavity, you see other features. I want to represent that in 3D and have people feel it with their fingers because they can't see it. ‘They would be able to spatially understand where important features are relative to everything else and what the structure is.’ So far, the group has tested the prototype images with about 100 people with visual impairments. They discovered through testing that the textures that were distinctive on the swell-form paper were not always as clearly perceived on the 3D plastic prints. The features have different heights to correspond with their brightness. The tallest, and therefore brightest, features are a tight group of open circles, which represent the stars in the core of the cluster . ‘Sure, we cannot see the image, so we don't know exactly what it looks like,’ said Nijat Worley of Baltimore who has a visual impairment. ‘It can never replace pictures, but with this 3D image you can get an idea of what it's supposed to look like and then use your imagination for the rest,’ she added. The team is now designing a way of rendering the nebula's structure onto a sphere that represents its true three-dimensional shape.","Scientists have developed 3D representations of the star cluster NGC 602 .

"Netflix has announced that they will be postponing Bill Cosby's upcoming standup comedy special. A spokesperson for the company said that Bill Cosby, 77, will be pushed back from its scheduled November 28 air date, this after several woman have come forward to allege that they were 'drugged and raped' by the actor. The most recent woman to make this claim is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who says Cosby 'gave her a pill with wine' back during a dinner date in 1982, and that she 'remembers before [she] passed out that [she] had been sexually assaulted by [Cosby].'

Netflix says no: The online streaming giant had originally intended the air the special on November 28 . Appearances by Cosby on popular television programs including Late Night With David Letterman and The Queen Latifah Show have also been cancelled as these new allegations come to light. Cosby also cancelled a live appearance in Florence, Arizona, back on October 27 when Barbara Bowman revealed to MailOnline that she was 'drugged and raped' by Cosby as a teenager. Earlier this week, Joan Tarshis also alleged that she was twice drugged and raped by the actor when she was 19-years-old. Revealing her truth: 'He drugged and raped me,' said former actress Barbara Bowman of Cosby in an interview with MailOnline . Her story: Joan Tarshis (above) alleges she was twice drugged and raped by Cosby when she was a teenager . The actor did however sit down for an interview with NPR Weekend Edition on Saturday with his wife, but grew silent and would not speak when host Scott Simon asked him about these allegations. Cosby has in fact remained silent through this all, and his attorney, John P. Schmitt, issued a statement Sunday saying his client would not dignify 'decade-old, discredited' claims of sexual abuse with a response. The 77-year-old Cosby was never criminally charged in any case, though he did settle a civil suit brought forward by a woman back in 2006.","Netflix has postponed the November 28 air date of the Bill Cosby standup special Bill Cosby 77 .

"A 33-year-old woman who went missing nearly a month ago after returning from a two-year trip around the world has been found hanged in Texas woodland. Leanne Hecht Bearden was last seen January 17 when she told her in-laws in Garden Ridge near San Antonio that she was going for a walk. Her body was found in woodland close to where Mrs Bearden and her husband Joshua had been staying after returning from their travels. Loss: Leanne Hecht . Bearden, pictured with husband Joshua, went missing after their round-the-world trip . Tragic: Leanne Hecht Bearden's body has been found nearly a month after she went missing in Texas . Search: Police and private investigators had been scouring the area near where Leanne was last seen . City Police Chief Donna O'Conner said just after 1pm Thursday, they received a call from a Garden Ridge homeowner saying that he had found a body in a wooded area near his residence, CNN reported. Sources said Mrs Bearden was found hanging in a tree. Police identified her by her backpack and ring. An autopsy is scheduled to take place on Friday, and investigators have not said if they suspect foul play. In a statement posted Thursday evening on a Facebook page devoted to finding Mrs Bearden, her devastated family confirmed she had been found. ‘Leanne was a lovely and remarkable young woman, and we will all miss her greatly,’ the post read. Her family thanked the law enforcement officials and volunteers who helped search for Mrs Bearden, as well as the thousands of well-wishers who have been praying for her safe return. Bond: Leanne and Josh pictured on their wedding day four years ago . Adventure: The couple pose on a Goa beach during their two-year round the world trip . In an earlier post on the Facebook page, her relatives had suggested that she may have left on her on accord because she was struggling to adjust to life in the U.S. ‘The . pressure of transitioning from her two year trip back into what we . consider ""normal"" life seems to have left her very anxious and . stressed,’ the statement read. ‘As a result of this investigation there . is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area.’ A neighbor who lived close to where Mrs Bearden's body was discovered, said the community was heartbroken to learn that she had died. 'We've all been praying for her and the family for three weeks. We all figured she wanted to run away,' Carol Edwards told Kens5. 'I sympathize with them ... what they've had to go through, not knowing. That's the worst part,' she said. Heartbroken: Joshua Bearden made an emotional plea to try to find his wife. Her body was found Thursday . The . local police, sheriff's deputies, the Texas Rangers, a group of friends . and volunteers had spent the past month scouring Garden Ridge and its . vicinity in search of Mrs Bearden, but to no avail. The . theory that the globetrotter took off voluntarily has been supported by . evidence found on her computers by private investigator Charlie Parker. Garden Ridge police had . reached a similar conclusion, adding that they have found nothing to . suggest that Mrs Bearden was the victim of a foul play. Her husband said that while his wife was fit and athletic, she was small in stature. The family had initially feared that she had been bitten by a snake or got injured. ‘Her mental and physical status is uncertain. We fear for her greatly,’ her relatives said when she first disappeared ‘She is extremely vulnerable. She left with only a few assets and is traveling very light.’ Two weeks ago, Mr Bearden offered a message of hope for his missing wife. Travels: The couple had just returned to the U.S. after their journey around the world . ‘Baby, don’t be scared. We’re looking . for you. And we’re never ever going to stop looking for you,’ Mr Bearden had said in a televised interview. He was speaking out in hopes continued public interest in his wife’s disappearance would help his cause, after the official search was called off. ‘As far as any sort of search in the area, we’re on our own on that,’ he . said on Fox & Friends. ‘If . you see Leanne, let somebody know. Call the police. If you live in the . area… could you do me a favor and check out your property and see if . there is anything unusual out there?’ Mrs Bearden, a marketing graduate, left her in-laws house in Garden Ridge on January 17 wearing jeans and hiking boots and carrying about $60 in cash and some credit cards. She also had a red backpack with her that reportedly contained several energy bars. The couple had intended to stay briefly in Texas before flying to their home in Denver to begin searching for work. According to CNN, the couple has been married for four years. Grief: Leanne's family are devastated by their loss and thanked the many people involved in trying to find the 33-year-old . According to My San Antonio, Mrs Bearden was planning to return to the home within an hour in order to take a phone call about a job in Denver. She was reported missing by her husband after she had been gone about four hours. At about that time, his parents returned home from an out-of-town trip. 'We could draw up scenarios that . range from the sublime to the ridiculous,' Will Bearden told My San . Antonio. 'I just stick with what we know. What we know is she was seen . leaving our house Friday, and no one has seen her since.' Search: Facebook pages and leaflets were set up to try to find Leanne .

"What Christmas present do you buy for the relative who has everything? If they have a taste for fresh fish, olive oil and an Aegean Sea breeze you could get them their own Greek island. A 16-acre land mass off the coast of one of the most beautiful islands in the Mediterranean has been put on the international market for the first time. Little Lesbos is just minutes by boat from the  island of Lesbos and has an asking price of £633,680, less than the price of a two-bed flat in many parts of London. Up for grabs: Little Lesbos is a 16-acre island on sale for £633,680 through Vladi Private Islands . While currently uninhabited, the estate agents say a building permit can be applied for at the local government agencies. The island is located 200 metres opposite the sleepy village of Pamfila. Once there, it's a 10-minute drive to  Mytilini, Lesbos's capital and main port, founded in the eleventh century BC. Lesbos is accessible by international airport or ferry  and is a favourite of travellers, thanks to its beautiful setting, history, fiery ouzo  and beaches. Sea view: It's currently uninhabited but a building permit can be applied for at local government agencies . The estate agents selling the small island say Mediterranean private islands rarely come o the market - and when they do, they often have an astronomical price-tag. Little Lesbos has  clear water bays, smooth sandy beaches and an abundance of vegetation. Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, which is marketing the sale, said: 'This is a one of a kind. The waters surrounding the island are clear and tranquil. 'Fresh water can be gained by installing rain catching or desalination systems. Sewage can be brought over to the mainland or composted.' Lesbos: Mainland is only a  200m boat ride  from Little Lesbos and the capital is a 10-minute drive away . The island of Lesbos (left) was the birthplace of Sappho (right) a poet who wrote verses for other women . According to Vladi Private Islands, this is  the first time the current Greek owner had put the island up for sale internationally. Legend has it that 3,000 years ago the Greek god Zeus visited Lesbos to put a curse on the larger island for 40 years, after his advances were rejected by a lesbian woman living there. After the curse was lifted, visitors, so the story goes, were unable to find a single sexually mature man left on Lesbos. The island was populated by females sexually involved with other females instead. Another explantion for where the meaning of the word lesbian derives from is the ancient Greek female poet Sappho, who was born in Lesbos and who wrote emotional verses aimed at women. It's thanks to this association that Lesbos and especially the town of Eresos, the birthplace of Sappho, is a popular destination for lesbian tourists.","Little Lesbos has asking price of £633,680, less than some London flats .

"Prince George was today christened wearing a delicate lace gown that is an exact replica of one worn 172 years ago by Queen Victoria's first born. When he was welcomed into the faith by the Arch Bishop of Canterbury today, George wore an ivory gown made of delicate Honiton lace and white satin, worn before him by every baby born to the British Royal family since 1841. Royal . babies were traditionally, until 2004, christened wearing the intricate . lace and satin gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, . Victoria, Princess Royal in 1841 and used for generation after . generation of royal infants including the Queen’s father King George VI, . the Queen, Charles, William, Prince Harry, with Lady Louise . Mountbatten-Windsor the last royal baby to wear it in 2004. Heritage: Queen Victoria in 1894 at the christening of her great-grandson, . the future King Edward VIII (1894 - 1972), with the baby's mother Mary of Teck, above left, and the baby's grandmother Alexandra, daughter of Victoria - 53 years after the dress was first worn by Alexandra, right . Traditionally a family photograph with the baby in its robe is released to the media. Crafted from layers of delicate, hand-made Honiton lace and ivory satin, it was . used for all royal christenings until 2004 when . Queen Elizabeth decided the gown was past its prime and ordered an exact replica to be crafted by her personal . dressmaker. An entire team of . seamstresses set to work at Buckingham Palace to recreate the intricate bows . and high collar of the original gown, and it was first used for the . christening of James, Viscount Severn, son of Prince Edward and Sophie, Earl  and Countess of . Wessex, in 2008. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother pictured with Queen Elizabeth after her christening . One of the earliest portraits of Queen Elizabeth II taken in 1926 when she was only a few days old . A Royal christening is an important . occasion - both socially and spiritually. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have given their approval to the first ever royal christening coins created in the UK. The special coins, which have been produced by the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales, go on sale today to mark the christening of the couple's son, Prince George. The design features the Lily Font from the Tower of London and two harp-playing cherubs. At the foot of the coin is the royal motto ""Dieu et mon droit"" - God and my right. The £5 coin is available in silver - because the crossing of a baby's palm with silver is said to confer good health and prosperity to newborns - and gold - to commemorate the royal celebration. Not . only does it reinforce the family's faith, but in the case of Prince . George, who is in direct line to the throne, it has more significance. As a future king, George will become . Protector of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England and . therefore must be a full, confirmed member of the religion. Such was the significance of baby George’s christening that the duty fell to . the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - leader of the 77-million . strong Anglican Communion - to carry out the ceremony. The . event is also a key gathering for those in the royal inner circle. Mostly held in private, away from the public and the media, royal . christenings are usually attended only by family, godparents and close . friends - the people who will directly influence the Prince as he grows . up. George is the first . future monarch in modern times not to be baptised at Buckingham Palace, . with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge choosing the intimate Chapel . Royal at St James’s Palace instead. William and the Prince of Wales were both christened in Buckingham Palace’s Music Room. The Queen, who was not expected to be queen when born, was christened in the Palace’s private chapel in 1926. But Edward VIII, who later abdicated, was baptised at White Lodge in Richmond Park in 1894 and his brother George VI, who was not expected to be king, was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene close to the Sandringham estate in 1895. George is three months old - older than his father, grandfather and great-grandmother were when they were christened. William was baptised on August 4 1982 at the age of six weeks, while the Prince of Wales was one month and one day old at his own christening. The Queen was just over five weeks old when she was christened. Although there are usually official christening pictures released . to the public - in this case, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have . chosen renowned showbiz photographer Jason Bell to take the photos - the . ceremony itself is a private affair. A notable exception to the usual privacy surrounding royal christenings is that of Princess Eugenie in 1990. Nine-month-old Eugenie was baptised during morning service at the church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham just before Christmas in 1990. The christening was broadcast by loudspeaker across the royal estate at Sandringham, Norfolk. Queen Elizabeth II and baby Prince Charles, and . with Prince Philip, left, in 1948 after Charles' christening in . Buckingham Palace. Charles is wearing the traditional Honiton lace and . white satin gown . Prince Charles, current heir to the throne, after his christening in 1948, which, like most royal christenings, was a private affair . Microphones relayed the service to  a crowd of 2,000 outside the church. 'It . was a lovely family occasion, a truly happy day,' said the Bishop of . Norwich, the Rev Peter Nott, who conducted the 50-minute service. Queen . Elizabeth, meanwhile, was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, . Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace, on 29 May . 1926. Prince . William was christened in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace on 4 August 1982, while . Prince Harry was christened in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in 1984. Royal christenings have not always been plain sailing. At Queen Victoria’s in 1819, there was a dispute over what she should be called. Her mother the Duchess of Kent had wanted to call her Georgiana Charlotte Augusta Alexandrina Victoria, but was overruled by a cantankerous Prince Regent, the future George IV, who dictated during the ceremony that she be called Alexandrina Victoria instead in tribute to the Russian Tsar Alexander I. The Duchess was left distraught and broke down sobbing during the proceedings.

"Two Australian sky surveys named Wallaby and Dingo are expected to discover 700,000 galaxies over the course of the new year. The huge new radio telescope facility in Western Australia will scour vast regions of space to provide clues about galaxy evolution. The £65m Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (Askap) is located in a remote desert region of Western Australia, 196 miles from the port of Geraldton. Scroll down for video . The Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), with an array of 36 antennas each 12 meters (40 feet) across . It consists of 36 dishes, each 12 metres (39ft) wide, which work together as a single antenna. Askap will also help astronomers investigate one of the greatest mysteries of the universe: dark energy. This is the force which appears to be causing galaxies to fly apart at an accelerating rate. Although no one is sure what dark energy is, it is believed to account for 73 per cent of the universe. Scientists were able to predict Askap's capabilities by combining its specifications with computer simulations. Dr Alan Duffy, a member of the Askap team from the University of Western Australia, said: 'Askap is a highly capable telescope. Its surveys will find more galaxies, further away, and will be able to study them in more detail than any other radio telescope in the world. 'We predict that Wallaby will find an amazing 600,000 new galaxies and Dingo 100,000, spread over trillions of cubic light years of space.' On its first day in full operation, ASKAP will collect more data than is currently contained in all current radio astronomy archives or the U.S. Library of Congress . The telescope will examine galactic hydrogen gas – the fuel that forms stars – to see how galaxies have changed in the past 4bn years. Askap is a curtain raiser for an even more ambitious project, the Square Kilometre Array (Ska). With receiving stations stretching between South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Ska will be the world's largest radio telescope when it begins operating in 2019. Its combined antennae will provide radiation-collecting area of approximately 1 sq km. The ASKAP telescope is located in the Shire of Murchison, an area of 50,000 square kms (19,300 square miles), or the size of Costa Rica, with barely 120 people. The location is ideal because it is 'radio quiet', or lacks man-made radio signals that would interfere with the antennas picking up astronomical radio signals. Using new 'radio cameras' called phased array feeds, the telescope will be able scan the sky much more rapidly than existing radio telescopes and will give the telescope a field of view about 150 times the area of the full Moon. ASKAP is also the first building block in the world's largest telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) which will be based in both Australia and South Africa .

"Nine serving BBC employees, including some famous faces, are under investigation for ‘serious allegations’ of sexual abuse following the sickening revelations about the late Jimmy Savile. Some are being investigated by police while others have been reported to the corporation’s management. But the BBC last night refused to say if any of the employees have been suspended. Scroll down for video . Probe: Nine serving BBC employees are under investigation for 'serious allegations' of sexual abuse following the sickening revelations about the late Jimmy Savile (file photo) It has emerged that some of those being investigated are or have been in the public eye. A BBC source told the Daily Mirror: 'The allegations are right across the corporation and they involve some famous faces. These complaints relate to recent and historic incidents.' The revelation about the nine suspects emerged during yesterday’s questioning of BBC director-general George Entwistle by MPs over the Savile affair. To add to the Corporation’s embarrassment, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon – who controversially shelved a film detailing Savile’s abuse – faced fresh criticism after an email emerged claiming that he played down the story because ‘it was 40 years ago’ and the girls were not ‘too young’. And Culture Secretary Maria Miller made it clear she was unimpressed with Mr Entwistle’s often faltering performance in front of MPs – with aides saying it ‘resembled a car crash’. BBC Director-General George Entwistle (right) and Head of BBC Editorial Policy David Jordan . She wrote to BBC Trust chairman Lord  Patten saying ‘very real concerns are being raised about public trust and confidence in the BBC’. In a hostile session of cross-examination, Mr Entwistle failed to satisfy those still calling for an independent inquiry as he was repeatedly hauled over the coals and even ridiculed for not finding out more about the Savile film when informed about it last December. Sparked: Late TV presenter Jimmy Savile . He told the Culture Select Committee: ‘We are looking at between five and ten serious allegations relating to activities over the whole period in question, the Savile period. Some of these cases have been passed to the police where appropriate, and we are reviewing others within our normal HR processes and procedures.’ The BBC later said it was ‘aware of . nine allegations of sexual harassment, assault or inappropriate conduct . regarding current staff or contributors’. The . fact that nine employees are being investigated is a sign that the . ‘broader cultural problem’ of sexual harassment dating back to the . Savile years of abuse still needs to be tackled. Since . the scandal erupted at the start of October, BBC stars – including Liz . Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig – have alleged they were groped while live on . air. Asked by the MPs if there were active . allegations against existing employees, Mr Entwistle said: ‘Information . is being assembled on exactly that subject. ‘New allegations are being made and are coming in. What I am looking at is all the existing current allegations.’ The director-general did not dispute suggestions . that child abuse had been ‘endemic’ at the corporation in the past, but . insisted children were safe there now. ‘I believe we have good . policies, but I am currently checking them to make sure they are as good . as they need to be.’ David . Jordan, head of editorial policy, said that if any allegations emerged . which related to people still working for the BBC, the corporation would . ensure they went to the police and that those involved were denied . access to children. Worried: Culture Secretary Maria Miller, left, wrote to BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, right, saying ‘very real concerns are being raised about public trust and confidence in the BBC’. Mr Entwistle told MPs he was bringing . in Dinah Rose QC – who represented News International in phone hacking . cases – to look at how the BBC handles sexual harassment cases. ‘This is something the BBC simply has to get right and I’m not sure we have got it right in every respect at the moment.’ Newsnight . boss Mr Rippon ‘stepped aside’ from the role earlier this week after a . blog he wrote  was revealed to be inaccurate in  key respects. The . latest email, revealed yesterday, suggests that Mr Rippon was trying to . ‘kill’ the Savile story by making ‘impossible editorial demands’. Channel . 4 News said it had seen the email from Newsnight reporter Liz MacKean, . the reporter who worked on the investigation. In it she accuses Mr . Rippon of backtracking. It . reads: ‘Having commissioned the story, Peter Rippon keeps saying he’s . lukewarm about it and is trying to kill it by making impossible . editorial demands.’ Claims: Since the scandal erupted at the start of October, BBC stars – including Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig – have alleged they were groped while live on air . She adds: ‘When we rebut his points, he resorts to saying, “Well, it was 40 years ago ... the girls were teenagers, not too young ... they weren’t the worst kind of sexual offences etc”.’ Duties: Newsnight boss Mr Rippon 'stepped aside' from the role earlier this week after a blog he wrote  was revealed to be inaccurate in  key respects . If true, his comments will outrage child protection groups as they appear to play down Savile’s crimes. Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘Oh my God. He said that, and in the year 2011? Now we know why he has “stepped aside”. What an inane thing to say, and sadly reminiscent of the attitudes of too many people who don’t take these crimes seriously enough.’ The email follows another in which Mr Rippon, when referring to the evidence the programme, had used the phrase ‘just the women’. Broadcast on Panorama it read: ‘The key is whether we can establish the CPS did drop the case for the reasons the women say. That makes it a better story – our sources so far are just the women and a second-hand briefing’. Conservative MP Therese Coffey said the email was ‘chilling’ and questioned whether the culture had really changed at the BBC. Mr Entwistle told her: ‘That phrase, on the face of it, isn’t in the least defensible, of course. I do believe the culture has changed since the Seventies and Eighties but I’m not convinced it has changed as much as it should have.’ Emails that suggested senior BBC executives tried to cover up the scandal were pulled from the Panorama programme for ‘legal reasons’ amid concerns that others implicated in the shelving of the report could sue for damages. At least one of these emails suggests the Savile report was being discussed by a ‘long political chain’ of executives.","Nine serving BBC employees are under investigation for 'serious  allegations' of sexual abuse following the sickening revelations .

"A U.S. senator warned on Thursday that ISIS, the militant terror group sweeping across Iraq, aims to destroy an American population center and is working on a plan to do it. 'They're crazy out there and they're rapidly developing a method of blowing up a major U.S. city and people just can't believe that's happening,' Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe told the Fox-25 television in Oklahoma City. Inhofe, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned that leaders of ISIS 'are really bad terrorists. They're so bad even al-Qaeda is afraid of them.' Rep. Jim Bridenstine, a fellow Oklahoma Republican and a committee member, told the Tulsa World that ISIS Islamists are 'cutting children's bodies in half. They're shooting them. I've never seen anything like it.' Scroll down for video . The Oklahoma senator warned that the US faces a novel and potentially catastrophic threat from ISIS, and said President Barack Obama isn't up to the task of defeating the terror group . The warnings came after a stomach-churning video released Tuesday showed the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley at the hands of an ISIS militant, and on the heels of a press briefing where Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the U.S. military's job is to 'get ready' for whatever battle might lie ahead. ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel said, appearing alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey. 'They're beyond just a terrorist group,' Hagel said. 'They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.' 'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.' Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there. 'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said. Rep. Jim Bridenstine said if America is going to do battle with ISIS, 'we have to win' 'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.' Bridenstine said hours later that 'if we're going to do these kinds of operations, we have to win.' But a frustrated Inhofe said Thursday night that he fears President Obama isn't up to the task, despite the tough words he delivered Wednesday before hitting the golf course. 'Obama's lofty rhetoric is undermined by fainthearted follow-through and lack of meaningful action,' he told the World. 'The president's limited strikes in Iraq have not halted ISIS' momentum but only temporarily redirected it,' said Inhofe. 'Without sustained pressure, ISIS will regroup and continue its campaign of terror.' 'We're in the most dangerous position we've ever been in as a nation,' he told Fox-25. A top Marine general agreed on Wednesday, writing on the DefenseOne website that if the U.S. military doesn't 'eradicate' ISIS now more attacks on the West will come. General John Allen praised Obama for the ordering airstrikes on ISIS camps in northern Iraq, but he urged him to 'move quickly to pressure the organisations entire ""nervous system,"" break it up, and destroy its pieces.' 'The U.S. is now firmly in the game and remains the only nation on the planet capable of exerting the kind of strategic leadership, influence and strike capacity to deal with IS[IS],' he wrote. 'It is also the only power capable of organizing a coalition's reaction to this regional and international threat.' ‘This group,' he wrote, 'is not a flash in the pan that will go away of its own accord or if we don’t poke at it.' General Allen praised Obama for recent airstrikes, but urged him to 'move quickly to pressure the organisations entire ""nervous system""' Allen also denied that the U.S. military was war weary, saying it's fully capable of attacking and reducing ISIS. ‘We should do it now, but supported substantially by our traditional allies and partners, especially by those in the region who have the most to give – and the most to lose – if the Islamic State’s march continues.' ‘If we delay now, we will pay later.' The president told a global audience this week from his Martha's Vineyard vacation spot that the U.S. 'will continue to do what we must do to protect our people.' 'We will be vigilant and we will be relentless. When people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what's necessary to see that justice is done.' 'We act against ISIL, standing alongside others,' Obama added, hinting at his 'coalition' strategy rather than a plan to strike unilaterally with overwhelming American force. Inhofe, though, warned that without a concrete plan, Obama's words ring hollow. 'Relentless': Obama drew fire this week for golfing as an angry nation mourned the death of journalist James Foley at the hands of an ISIS militant . The video, uploaded to jihadi websites on Tuesday, shows the beginning of Foley's decapitation – and then his severed head resting on top of his prone body . 'You have to come up with something that we're going to do,' the senator said, 'because they're holding another hostage in place.' 'And the problem is, the president, quite frankly – he says all these things and he never does them.' With the right strategy, he added, the U.S. could defeat ISIS on its home turf before the threat arrives on America's doorstep. 'This idea that they're coming and infiltrating the United States – sure, some are coming in who have had an association with ISIS. But the majority of them are still over there,' he said. The senator also defended the United States government's sweeping intelligence programs that have drawn barbs from civil libertarians, suggesting that information dragnets would play a part in keeping ISIS at bay. 'You have to have an intelligence process going on to stop attacks on America,' he said.","Oklahoma senator said Obama needs a plan to crush the terror group .

"Executed: William Happ, seen in this undated photo, was executed on Tuesday using an untried drug . A Florida man convicted of raping and murdering a 21-year-old woman in 1986 blinked repeatedly and shook his head back and forth as he was executed by lethal injection of a controversial, never-before-used drug. William Happ, 51, was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride - despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict cruel and unusual punishment on a death row inmate. The execution began at 6.02pm at Florida State Prison in Starke. Happ's eyes opened and he blinked several times. He closed them and opened them again two minutes later. He then yawned and his jaw dropped open. At 6.08pm, the official overseeing the execution tugged at Happ's eyelids and grasped his shoulder to check for a response. There was none. A minute later, Happ's head began moving back and forth and shortly thereafter his breathing stopped. He was pronounced dead at 6.16pm. Happ appeared to remain conscious for a greater length of time and made more body movements after losing consciousness than people executed by the old formula which usually kills the prisoner within seven minutes. Midazolam, typically used by doctors for sedation, was the first of three drugs pumped into Happ as part of a lethal injection cocktail designed to induce unconsciousness, paralysis and death by cardiac arrest. The first of the drugs administered as part of the lethal injection 'protocol' in Florida has long been the barbiturate pentobarbital. But Florida and other death penalty states that use a trio of drugs as part of their injection procedures have been running out of pentobarbital since its manufacturer clamped a ban on its use in future executions. 'This is somewhat of an experiment on a living human being,' Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, said Monday. 'The three-drug process depends on the first drug rendering the inmate unconscious and, if he is only partially unconscious, the inmate could be experiencing extreme pain,' he added. 'Because the second drug paralyzes him, he would be unable to cry out or show that he's in pain.' The 51-year-old Happ, who had abandoned his appeals and said he was ready to die, was condemned for the 1986 abduction, rape and murder of Angie Crowley, whose body was found on a canal bank near Crystal River in central Florida. Happ was calm when he met with two spiritual advisers, including a Roman Catholic priest who administered last rites, according to Department of Corrections spokeswoman Jessica Cary. For his last meal, Happ had a 12-ounce box of assorted chocolates and 1 1/2 quarts of German chocolate ice-cream. 'To my agonizing shame, I must confess to the crime,' he said in a slow, deliberate voice before the injection was given. 'I wish to offer my most sincere, heartfelt apology. I have prayed for the good Lord to forgive me for my sins. But I understand why those here cannot.' Crowley's mother and two siblings died before they could see the sentence carried out, but Crowley's surviving sisters and brothers traveled to Starke to watch as Happ was executed. Lethal dose: Happ was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride, pictured, despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict undue pain . Just last week, Missouri postponed an execution set for October 23 due to uncertainty about using a different drug, propofol, as a substitute for pentobarbital. Misty Cash, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Corrections, declined to comment on how the state could rest assured that midazolam would avoid inflicting pain and suffering on Happ. But she said the prison system 'did research and determined that this is the most humane and dignified way to do the procedure.' She refused to identify a research laboratory or other source of the department's scientific data, citing an exemption in state public record laws that also meant that the supplier of midazolam hydrochloride for executions could remain anonymous. 'We're not talking about details,' she said. 'That could impact the safety and security of the process.' Happ's lawyer, Eric Pinkard of St Petersburg, said there were no late motions to stay the execution. Happ told a circuit judge in Inverness, Florida, last month that he did not want to continue the court appeals that have kept him on Florida's death row for nearly a quarter-century. Another condemned Florida prisoner, Etheria Jackson, has a hearing set for a November 6 in Jacksonville's federal court, challenging the use of midazolam. Jackson's appeal contends that there is 'substantial risk' of midazolam not working completely, violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of 'cruel and unusual punishment' by subjecting the condemned to a painful paralysis and fatal heart seizure over several minutes. Angie Crowley was making her first long trip through Florida on Memorial Day weekend in 1986 but she never arrived at her destination. Victim: Angie Crowley, pictured, was just 21 when she was kidnapped, raped and murdered by William Happ in 1986. Happ was executed on Tuesday . She prearranged with her friend to meet at a convenience store in Crystal River so she could be guided the last few miles of the trip. Crowley found the store, but before she could get to the pay phone, William Happ smashed her car window, kidnapped her. He beat her, raped her and strangled her with her pants before throwing her body into a canal. Crowley's brother Chris has pushed for years through an online petition and an email campaign to ensure Happ was executed for what he did to his sister. 'He killed my sister, he took her life. But when he took that life, he created so many other victims,' Crowley said. 'What he did affected everybody. It ate my mother up. I changed jobs and moved all within three months.' The murder shook Oregon, a small town about 40 miles southwest of Rockford, Illinois. Angie Crowley was a popular student at Oregon High School. After graduating, she attended Northern Illinois University before moving to Fort Lauderdale in December 1985. She worked as a travel agent to help pursue her dreams to travel the world. 'He took away the potential. There were seven kids in that family and she had the greatest potential of everybody. She had the personality, she had the looks, she had the smarts and she had the attitude. She really, really accomplished things and he took that,' Crowley said. 'We were never able to see it.' And the praise is not just because he's a loving brother. Angie Crowley's friends said she had a magnetic personality. She was a talented musician, honor student and a cheerleader with tons of friends. Always smiling, she never said anything bad about anybody. 'She was a sweetheart. Everybody just loved her, she had a great personality. She was prom queen, she was homecoming queen. She was just a gorgeous, gorgeous girl,' said Jim Kaufman, a classmate who visited Crowley in Florida just before her slaying. 'All of her classmates were devastated. Everybody in the whole town was. The whole town from young to older people knew her very well. She was very, very outgoing.' She was also a thoughtful friend who made great efforts to stay connected, said Sharon McBreen, who moved from Illinois to Florida in 10th grade. Not only did Crowley write long letters, but she mailed McBreen a senior yearbook signed by all her former classmates. Crowley's note in the book was two-pages long. Protesters: Florida Highway Patrol cars frame protesters to the execution of William Happ, who was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of  Angie Crowley in 1986, as they demonstrate across the highway from the Florida State Correctional facility near Starke on Tuesday . 'She was just one of those really good friends who never missed your birthday. The card was always on time. She would write me six-page letters,' McBreen said. 'She would just write, front and back. She filled these letters with everything that was going on in town, and what she was thinking and what she wanted to do.' She loved her new home in Florida. In Oregon, she often spent time on the Rock River waterskiing and boating and she was happy to be living near the ocean. And coming from a small town, she was excited about being in South Florida and was looking forward to more travel adventures — she booked a trip to Hawaii with her mother. That trip never happened because of the murder. McBreen traveled from Gainesville to Fort Lauderdale the weekend Crowley was murdered. At one point Crowley had talked about staying in town if McBreen was going to be there. But instead she kept her plans to meet a friend from college and spend some time on the Gulf coast. 'It's before cellphones and before Google Maps, she's trying to take a trip and she took all these precautions. She put a radio in the back seat to play loud so she wouldn't fall asleep, she told her roommates where she was going, she had this whole route all mapped out,' McBreen said. 'She was very careful anyway, so she took all these steps to make sure she was going to have a safe trip.' Her friend fell asleep waiting for the phone call to meet Crowley. When she woke the next morning, she alerted Crowley's family that she was missing and a search began. Later that day, a fisherman found her body. 'She just ran across this guy, and that was it. It was just completely random,' said McBreen. 'When you think about random crimes, how random could it have been that she was there at the same time he was?'","William Happ, who killed and raped Angie Crowley, 21, in 1986, was pronounced dead at 6.16pm on Tuesday at Florida State Prison in Starke .

"A rare thing happened at Old Trafford on Saturday: Radamel Falcao won the game for Manchester United. It was an isolated moment of class in a game of unremitting drudgery. In fact, it was just about the only moment of class. Ander Herrera played a ball into the box from the United right midway through the second half and Falcao took it down with the sweetest of touches. In the same movement, the Colombian spun away from Sunderland’s John O’Shea and was pulled back as he shaped to shoot. Radamel Falcao goes down under the challenge of John O'Shea and Wes Brown to win a penalty . Falcao's touch which led to the penalty was a reminder of his quality, and changed the course of the game . Brown was sent off for his part in bringing down the Colombian, but it should have been O'Shea . Wayne Rooney stepped up to convert the penalty, putting United into the lead at Old Trafford . Referee Roger East sent off Wes Brown by mistake, Wayne Rooney scored the resultant penalty and the game was effectively over. It was a tantalising glimpse of the player Falcao used to be, Atletico Madrid’s feared penalty-box predator who could terrorise the best defences. A few seconds later, he was substituted for Marouane Fellaini. A thunderclap of boos rolled around the stadium in protest. In many ways, it was hard to argue with manager Louis van Gaal’s decision. Falcao was lucky he had lasted that long. His £60 million team-mate, Angel di Maria, had been taken off at half-time after an anonymous first half. Before the crucial penalty Falcao had been ineffectual, failing to find the form that brought him to Old Trafford . Falcao has not done enough to convince Louis van Gaal he should be signed permanently this summer . Angel di Maria was also off the pace in United's 2-0 win over Sunderland and was replaced at half time . Van Gaal insisted that Di Maria still needs time to adapt, but he should apply the same principle to Falcao . There were no complaints about that and the truth is that Falcao, 29, had been very much Di Maria’s equal in mediocrity. Most of the time, his second touch was a tackle. It’s an old saying but it rang true for Falcao in the opening 45 minutes. The ball kept bouncing off him. ‘I was very pleased with his action for the penalty because he won it for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But I had to win the game and I saw at that moment that we needed to keep the ball more and with Fellaini it is more easy to keep the ball.’ Once again on Saturday, Falcao’s former knack of poaching goals from nowhere appeared, once again, to have deserted him. Sure, the service he received was hardly up to the standard that United forwards of the past have been used to. Falcao looks on disappointed as another United chance goes begging, while Rooney bends over . The Colombian striker has become more notable for missing chances than scoring them since joining United . Falcao's goals have been few and far between, but his match-winning touch showed he has still got it . But on the few occasions that Ashley Young, United’s liveliest forward, did force his way to the byline and cut back crosses, Falcao was out of the picture. In that first half, he was marked out of the game by former United defender Brown, who didn’t give him a kick. Brown is a good player but he’s not exactly Thiago Silva. In the circumstances, Falcao was lucky to make it back out for the second half. He has scored just four goals in 17 league appearances for Manchester United this season. His threat has been negligible. The consensus is that time is running out for him to persuade Van Gaal and the rest of the United hierarchy that it would be responsible for them to spend the £40m to make his loan deal from Monaco permanent at the end of the season. Falcao, once so dynamic a poacher in the penalty area, was rarely in the right place at the right time . The striker continued to work hard throughout, but until the penalty showed very little quality . The 29-year-old applauds the Manchester United fans, who have stuck by him through his form troubles . However wonderful a striker Falcao used to be, the hard truth is that on the basis of what United have seen so far, if they had to make their decision today, he is simply not worth it. And yet having invested so much in him emotionally, having hailed him as a goalscoring hero when he arrived in the summer, United’s supporters are reluctant to give up on him just yet. To their credit, they have been relentlessly supportive of Falcao. Their yearning for him to rediscover his quality has never curdled into disillusionment. And to Falcao’s credit, he has never stopped working. That is part of the reason United fans have stuck by him. If Di Maria has developed a tendency to drift aimlessly through games, Falcao has never stopped running himself into the ground. Falcao shakes hands with United staff members after being replaced on the hour-mark on Saturday . Marouane Fellaini was brought on by Van Gaal to help United retain possession better once in the lead . And while he is still capable of producing a moment of magic like Saturday's pivotal moment, there will still be those who will dream he can return to his former self. In those circumstances, might Van Gaal have kept Falcao on the pitch for a while to see if he could capitalise on the confidence that winning that penalty had brought him? If there is even a slim chance of bringing a player of his pedigree back to life, then surely it is worth taking. Van Gaal had said on Friday that the reason United are not challenging for the title is that they do not have a 20-goal-a-season striker. But Falcao was brought to the club to be that striker. Resurrect him and United’s chances of making the top four and securing a place in the Champions League next season will improve dramatically. Falcao celebrates with Rooney, and could yet prove to be important in Manchester United's push for Europe . If Van Gaal can help his forward to find confidence, he could have the striker he thought he had signed . Instead, the chance to breathe confidence back into him was missed and when the final whistle blew, Falcao walked alone along the touchline, applauded all the way by the home supporters. Many saw Van Gaal’s decision to substitute him as a sign that he has already made up his mind to let him go. But when the United boss spoke about Di Maria afterwards, he was at pains to point out that it takes time to settle in the Premier League. The same logic applies to Falcao, maybe even more so given that he is still recovering from a serious knee injury that ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup. While he can still turn a game with one moment of brilliance, it would seem like folly to abandon him now. The most important moments of United’s season lie ahead and if Falcao can replicate Saturday's touch of class more regularly, he may yet emerge as the hero Old Trafford’s fans so desperately want him to be.","Colombian striker Radamel Falcao has largely disappointed this season .
But his moment of brilliance on Saturday changed the game .
Manchester United fans have stuck by 29-year-old despite poor displays .
Like Angel di Maria, the striker needs time to adapt to Premier League .
Louis van Gaal should continue to give Falcao a chance to show brilliance ."
"Reform: Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor has called for the 'pope's own house to be put in order' in the wake of recent troubles . The scandal-hit Catholic Church needs to undergo renewal and reform, the former leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales said today as he called for the 'pope’s own house to be put in order' in the wake of recent troubles. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, retired Archbishop of Westminster, said the successor to Benedict XVI would need to be able to tackle reform of the Roman Curia, the Vatican departments which govern the 1.2 billion-strong global church. 'There is no doubt that today there needs to be renewal in the Church, reform in the Church and especially of government, how is this next pope going to govern the Church?' he told a news conference. 'Quite a lot of bishops and cardinals think that it has got to be done perhaps in a more collegial way, in other words, those who rule the Church. It is not just the pope who rules the Church, it is the pope with the bishops. 'The pope is essential as a centre of unity and truth but he also cannot rule the Church without real association with the bishops. 'As you know, there have been troubles in recent years, and scandals. Well, this has got to be addressed and especially the pope’s own house has to be put in order.' Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor was speaking after the Catholic Church in Britain was plunged into crisis yesterday following the resignation of Cardinal Keith O’Brien as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, amid allegations of 'inappropriate' behaviour towards fellow priests. Cardinal O’Brien has denied the allegations and is taking legal advice. Asked what his initial reaction had been to Cardinal O’Brien’s resignation, Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor said: 'Obviously, I was very surprised. I do not know anything about the details, I am sure that they will be addressed but certainly I was saddened. I know Cardinal O’Brien well, so I think it has been very sad. 'I think that what has happened will for him and for the Church in Scotland have been very damaging. 'But I think Cardinal O’Brien who is a very honest man... whoever goes in will look at the allegations that have been made and he himself has contested them. So I think we have to leave it like that.' Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor said part of the role of the apostolic administrator appointed to the diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh while the post remains vacant would be to examine the allegations made against Cardinal O’Brien. Cardinal O’Brien said he will not travel to Rome to take part in the conclave to elect a new pope in order to avoid becoming a focus of media attention. Calls: Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor, the retired Archbishop of Westminster, said the successor to Benedict XVI would need to be able to tackle reform of the Roman Curia . His decision has left Britain’s Roman Catholics with no vote in the conclave as Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor, at 80 years old, is ineligible to cast a vote. Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor, who flies to Rome tomorrow to take part in pre-meetings before the conclave starts, said he regretted the fact that Britain has no vote. He added that he was also 'sorry' that Archbishop Vincent Nichols, his successor as Archbishop of Westminster, had not yet been made a cardinal. Allegations: Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor was speaking after the Church in Britain was plunged into crisis following the resignation of Cardinal Keith O'Brien (pictured) as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh . Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor’s call for reform of the governance of the Roman Catholic Church comes after Italian Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, a papal contender, last week denounced the 'divisions, dissent, careerism, jealousies' that afflict the Vatican bureaucracy - divisions that were exposed by the leaks of documents taken from the pope’s study. Pope Benedict has also referred obliquely to the Vatican’s dysfunction, deploring how the church is often 'defiled' by attacks and divisions and urging its members to overcome 'pride and egoism'. In his final comments to the Curia at the weekend, he lamented the 'evil, suffering and corruption' that has defaced God’s creation. But he also thanked the Vatican bureaucrats for eight years of work, love and faith and promised them he would be spiritually close to them in retirement. Speaking at the news conference at the headquarters of the Catholic bishops of England and Wales in London, Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor described the qualities of popes John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I and John Paul II. He paid tribute to the 'lucidity' of the teaching of Pope Benedict, saying: 'I have never known a pope who has been able to teach and preach with such clarity and precision and love of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 'He is a teacher and I think we remember him, particularly in this country, for the way he came over to the people here not as an austere, severe man, but as a humble pastor and shepherd. It was very moving.' Pope Benedict, 85, announced earlier this month that he is to resign, the first pontiff in nearly 600 years to do so. He will formally quit on Thursday as leader of the global Catholic Church. The German-born pope, who was elected in 2005 after the death of Pope John Paul II, said he had decided to resign because of his age and infirmity.

"Mario Balotelli is set to become the catalyst in a complicated January transfer window jigsaw for Liverpool. Manager Brendan Rodgers has to sell the Italian striker or at least trade to buy, and this is how it could work... Balotelli could be offloaded back to Italy to Sampdoria, and that way Liverpool could then lure goalkeeper Sergio Romero to Anfield. Mario Balotelli is central to Liverpool's activity in the transfer market this month . Liverpool could splash £30million on Napoli's Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain . Then Liverpool may splash out £30million to sign striker Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli given that Rafael Benitez has just signed Sampdoria striker Manolo Gabbiadini. Liverpool might also offload Brazilian midfielder Lucas to Napoli, Inter or even Sampdoria. The Reds know they need a goalscorer, and they toyed with idea of taking Fernando Torres on loan from Chelsea, but the Spain striker preferred to goal back to his boyhood club Atletico Madrid. Liverpool also wanted Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri, but the Swiss star chose to join Inter on loan, as did Arsenal's Lukas Podolski. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder Lucas could be on his way to Italy this month with Inter leading the interest . Xherdan Shaqiri snubbed a move to the Premier League to join Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan . Before the window, Rodgers insisted that he would do no business - maybe he was just trying to keep the fees down. The fact is that Liverpool are desperate to bring two or three players in and reshape their squad. The activity around Anfield could be frenetic in the coming fortnight or so. Manchester City centre back Matija Nastasic is Schalke bound, but West Ham may yet move in for the Serbian defender if Winston Reid refuses new terms. Reid is out of contract in the summer and eyeing a move to Arsenal or Liverpool. Meanwhile, Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is set to quit White Hart Lane in the summer and move to Paris Saint-Germain in a £25million deal. Matija Nastasic looks set for a move to Schalke, but West Ham may yet make a late move for the defender . On the other side of north London, Arsenal hope to sign Sporting Lisbon defensive midfielder William Carvalho within the next fortnight. The fee for 22-year-old Carvalho would be in excess of£25million. As first revealed by Football Grapevine months ago, Manchester City's money men are doing the maths to see if they can afford to sign Lionel Messi from Barcelona in the summer. A massive part of the challenge is to make sure City comply with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, which would also prove a major impediment for Chelsea if they moved for Messi, as has been mooted. The £500million overall cost of Messi could potentially be sorted by City, not just because of their oil rich Arab backers, as part of an agreement with Nike and, down the line, MLS side New York City. Manchester City are working out a way to sign Lionel Messi from Barcelona . Dani Osvaldo is likely to be offered back to Southampton this week from his loan spell at Inter Milan, and in turn the Saints could offer the player to other clubs. Sunderland, among others, would be interested. Liverpool, meanwhile, may offload Rickie Lambert during this transfer window with West Brom, Crystal Palace and Hull all interested. Rickie Lambert could be heading for a Liverpool exit with West Brom, Crystal Palace and Hull interested . I am hearing... That some delegates at a conference of football administrators in Lisbon this Tuesday to discuss 'third-party ownership' of players will raise the situation of Frank Lampard's confused status with Manchester City. City have airbrushed previous claims that Lampard was on loan from New York City and now say he signed for them for the whole season. But those who take time to analyse the chronology of events have noted that according to MLS there is an issue about an initial contractual agreement between Lampard and City Football Group (CFG). Frank Lampard's contract with New York City has been the subject of much controversy . Lampard in action for Manchester City during their draw at Everton on Saturday . CFG it seems is a company owned by the same Arab owners who control both Manchester City and New York City. I am hearing there are some at next week's Lisbon summit that might raise the question of whether in actual fact Lampard's status with City is similar to that of Carlos Tevez at West Ham during the 2006-07 season. West Ham had to pay a fine then massive compensation after it was ruled they had wrongly registered Tevez on the basis that he was actually owned by a third-party company, which is outlawed by the Premier League and FA. Recent legislation has stated that FIFA no longer recognise third-party ownership of players. But there remains a big dispute about this issue since such a system is how many clubs in South America and poorer clubs in Europe are able to survive. Carlos Tevez joined West Ham in 2006, but the club were fined as he was owned by a third-party company . The conference will be heated, with legal and financial representatives arguing against so called global football law. The complex Lampard case could well be highlighted. If it is and further investigation of the deal is compelled then there could many outcomes. Should City, who strangely keep changing their story over the issue, be found to have breached any regulations then the club could possibly face sanctions. Those sanctions would potentially range from fines to point deductions, and the latter scenario could impact on the title race and Champions League places. I understand at least one Premier League club is set to ask the Premier League to further investigate. I am also hearing... A top level Crystal Palace official rang an estate agent in the Beckenham area (where the club's training base is) to find two short-term rental flats. Not for new boss Alan Pardew but two new loan signings. One of them is set to be Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo. Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo could be set for a loan move to Crystal Palace . Luis Figo insists Cristiano Ronaldo should lift the Ballon d 'Or at FIFA's Zurich headquarters on Monday. Ronaldo is favourite with the bookmakers with German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer behind him and Lionel Messi likely to come third. Former Barcelona and Real Madrid star Figo, 42, accepts that Ronaldo and Portugal disappointed at the World Cup finals in Brazil last summer. Cristiano Ronaldo is one of three finalists for FIFA's Ballon d'Or award on Monday in Zurich . But Figo, who now heads up a football networking website similar to Linkedin in called Network 90, feels the phenomenal year Ronaldo enjoyed, highlighted by leading Real Madrid to their 10th Champions League victory in May, means the award should be his. Figo, who twice won the award, said: 'I know Germany won the World Cup and there are those who think Neuer, who is such a great keeper and was a big part of their success, should be recognised while the World Cup wasn't so good for Cristiano. 'But for me it has to be Cristiano. He's had a fantastic year all the way through for Real.' That leads to the obvious question. Who does Figo think is the better player - Ronaldo or Messi? Luis Figo believes his Portuguese compatriot should win the award ahead of Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer . 'It's the impossible question,' he said. 'They are both so good. It's like comparing caviar and truffle. 'Back when I was playing there were usually 10 strong contenders every year. I think the overall level of top players was stronger. I recent years it has pretty much a question of Ronaldo or Messi.' LUIS FIGO'S TEAM OF 2014 . Such is the pressure in the hot seat, each week a Premier League manager's survival rate can be cut. As it stands Steve Bruce is now 7-2 to favourite to get the bullet. Paul Lambert is now just 4-1 and Gus Poyet 9-1. Interestingly, though, despite a good draw for Everton against Manchester City, Roberto Martinez is relatively short at 7-1. I-Say . I was having a coffee with a senior football administrator the other day and he argued the case for a winter break. His proposed break would have started last week after the FA Cup third round games and last for at least 12 days. To clear the decks in the fixture calendar, the plan would be to scrap FA Cup replays. Clubs would also have to be contractually obliged not to play any form of matches during the break period. I tend to agree and don't think the loss of replays would undermine the FA Cup. It could even see a few more shocks and recapture some romanticism. Certainly players would benefit from a break in the schedule mentally as much as physically. Raheem Sterling has been given some time off by Brendan Rodgers after a busy first half of the season . And that might have a positive effect in future for the national team when it comes to tournaments. Liverpool have taken the decision to allow Raheem Sterling a personal break in Jamaica right now. The 20 year old has had a hectic year or so and it would seem a wise move by the club. Liverpool will hope that when Sterling returns he will have shaken off signs of fatigue and also that his mind will be suitably cleared to sign a new contract. BTW . One thing is clear about the sordid saga of Ched Evans. He has been given some awful advice. If he has actually paid PR people to construct a 'campaign' to re-establish himself as a professional footballer then he has been ripped off. His legal counsel would seem questionable too. After coming out of prison on licence he should have stayed as best he could under the radar, displayed genuine remorse, and sought to rebuild his life and career from the bottom again or sought permission to find a club abroad. Ched Evans' search for a new club continues after his move to Oldham fell through . He should have gone out of his way to shun the spotlight and eased himself into the game in the manner some other players have managed to in similar circumstances. But with a website stridently still claiming his innocence and it would seem some 'supporters' with questionable attitudes towards the victim in this case, he has merely courted publicity to such a fever pitch that it's hard to see how he can actually find a professional club wiling to employ him, certainly until the outcome of his appeal against conviction.","Liverpool must offload Mario Balotelli before they buy .

"A grandmother has been banned from a village rugby club for her 'bad' behaviour. Lillian Mort, 74, has been accused of standing on the touchline and hurling abuse at referees and rival players during matches at Pyle RFC near Bridgend, in South Wales. The club was fined £50 by Welsh rugby chiefs after Mrs Mort shouted at a referee during a game. Red card: Lifelong Pyle RFC fan Lillian Mort has been banned from watching games at her village rugby club . Banned: Pyle RFC was fined £50 by Welsh rugby chiefs after Mrs Mort shouted at a referee . The final straw came when she was caught trying to spend beer tokens handed out to players after a match. She was banned for three months after supporting Pyle RFC for the last 50 years. The ban will stop her from watching matches and having a drink at the club in the village of Pyle. She said: 'I feel terrible. I've been going to watch games since I was in my 30s. 'I am a loyal fan, probably the oldest they've got and they've kicked me into touch. Dedicated: Mrs Mort has vowed to carry on watching the team through the steel railings at the side of the pitch . 'The committee think they have got the better of me but I am not going to leave it there.' Mrs Mort has vowed to carry on watching the team through the steel railings along the boundary of the pitch. She said: 'I still go down the club and watch games but I am not allowed on the field. 'I watch through the fencing - I feel like I'm in jail.' Club officials claim they wrote 'a dozen' letters to the grandmother asking her to improve her behaviour. But she was finally shown the red card after being accused of abusing  committee members when she was told she could not use beer tokens given to her by player grandson David Pound, 22. Mr Pound said: 'I went down to see the last game and my gran was watching through the fence. 'I couldn't believe it - most of the players are not happy about it.' Club rules state that only players can use beer tokens in the bar after matches. Chairman Clifford Ricketts said: 'We . wrote her a dozen letters asking her to behave but she took no heed of . them so we banned her. 'We do not want to ban anybody from the club but we did not want the hassle. She is lucky she did not have longer.'

"A antiques shop owner has banned tourists from his store after claiming they never buy anything and put off genuine local customers. Mark Galpin claims his profits have risen by 30 per cent since he put up a sign outside the shop door which reads 'No Tourists.' It also states that only people who live within a 30 mile radius of his shop are welcome to his Aladdin's Cave store in Christchurch, Dorset. Mark Galpin has put up a sign outside the front door of his furniture and antiques shop in Christchurch, Dorset, which reads in bold letters 'No Tourists' Mr Galpin claims tourists use his shop to kill time while they wait for their buses home and says they put off genuine customers . If Mr Galpin does not recognise a customer, he quizzes them on who they are and where they are from. He became fed-up with coach loads of 'time-wasting' tourists who browse around his furniture and antiques shop while they wait for their bus home. Footfall has dropped by 90 per cent since Mr Galpin brought in the policy a month ago but he claims he is making more money off genuine customers. He said he is willing to alter his stance if tourists pay a pound to enter, which they will get back if they buy something. But the shop owner has been labelled 'eccentric' by his local chamber of commerce who fear the move will put people off visiting the town. Mr Galpin, who is in his 60s, said: 'We have made a decision that this business should be a local business for local people. 'We have a coach drop-off and pick-up point immediately opposite us and we can have 500 to 600 coach passengers a day coming in and buying absolutely nothing. 'We have put up with it for three years and we believe that maybe one in every 2,500 tourists has spent a pound or two. The rest have spent nothing. The sign reads: 'Regretably [sic] we no longer allow tourists entry as furniture too large to take on coach' 'We have really tried to cater for tourists by selling small trinkets and ornaments for a few pounds but they are not interested in buying. 'We have also had at least 45 to 50 local residents tell us they avoid coming in to our shop when it's busy. 'It was having a huge detrimental impact on our business so we decided to make it a local business for local people. 'We are an independent retailer, we pay extremely high rents and rates for being in the high street. 'We think that giving tourists an option of coming in if they pay a pound to an extremely worthwhile charity is the right thing to do.' Customer Anthony Nichols, who was ejected from the shop after admitting he was not a local resident, said: 'He said that before I could come in I had to read this sign, which said that tourists were banned. Some officials fear that Mr Galpin's actions will put visitors off Christchurch (file photo) 'At first I thought he was joking. We were actually looking for a piece of furniture on behalf of a Christchurch-based relative but I didn't see why I should have to explain that to him. 'We had had a lovely time in Christchurch but that's not what I will be taking away from me. 'This has ruined that. I cannot understand how he is allowed to act like this.' Some residents fear Mr Galpin's actions will damage the reputation of Christchurch. Cllr Nicholas Geary said: 'We're working very hard to encourage people to come into our town and spend money and this attitude does us no good at all.' Peter Watson-Lee, chairman of the Christchurch Chamber of Trade, said: 'We are working hard to get people to come to the town and it's just so depressing that we have got one eccentric trader taking this stance. Peter Watson-Lee, chairman of the Christchurch Chamber of Trade, said Mr Galpin was 'in the wrong town' if he didn't want to welcome tourists (file photo) 'I've had a whole series of complaints from people but he won't listen. 'It's totally contrary to everything that the traders stand for. 'Tourists bring a lot of money into the town. He is in the wrong town if he doesn't want to welcome them.""

"This is the terrifying moment a wildlife cameraman comes face-to-face with a deadly 1,000lb polar bear looking for its next meal. The hungry eight-foot predator repeatedly attacks the safety perspex box - the on-ice equivalent of a shark cage - housing helpless Gordon Buchanan. Filmmaker Mr Buchanan shows nerves of steel as he endures the lethal polar bear’s 40-minute sustained assault as it desperately hunts for a weak spot in his protective pod. Scroll down to see the video . Terrifying: This is the moment that wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan came face to face with a hungry polar bear in Svalbard, in the northern-most region of Arctic Norway, for his three-part BBC series The Polar Bear Family and Me . 'Without a doubt, she wanted me for lunch': Gordon Buchanan's reinforced perspex pod protected him . Persistent: The 1,000kg female polar bear spent nearly 45 minutes trying to get to the cameraman . Heart-stopping moment: This shows the size of the adult polar bear compared to the cameraman . The female bear, with its powerful paws and giant teeth, was trying to get hold of the 40-year-old so she could feed herself and her two young cubs. Mr Buchanan, who has filmed the world’s deadliest creatures for 20-years, described the ordeal as his scariest ever experience. He said: 'A lot of people think that carnivores are intrinsically dangerous but most aren’t - there’s a minimal risk and attacks are the exception. 'But polar bears are different, without a doubt she wanted me for lunch. She was so persistent, looking for a weak spot for almost 45 minutes. 'I was terrified and you could hear my heartbeat on the mic. It really was a sensational moment and a worrying situation. 'It shows how enormous and powerful they are. Man vs nature: The polar bear battered Buchanan in his tiny cage . Ferocious attack: The cameraman had a good view of the bear's enormous teeth . Starving: The female bear was determined to find food for herself and her two young cubs . 'You could hear my heart beating on the mic': Buchanan was inches from the bear's jaws . 'It is the most difficult thing I have done and the scariest. I’ve not been terrified for 40 minutes before.' The Scottish wildlife expert filmed the fascinating creature in Svalbard, in the northern-most region of Arctic Norway, for his three-part BBC series The Polar Bear Family and Me. The series, to be aired over three consecutive nights on BBC2, starts on Monday, January 7 at 9.30pm. 'It's getting quite hairy in here': The footage shows the photographer becoming more and more frightened as the attack went on . 'I've never been terrified for 40 minutes before': The bear could smell Buchanan and was determined to get him . Buchanan described the pod as 'bombproof' but said there was a danger it could become brittle in the cold . Mr Buchanan followed mother Lyra and her cubs Miki and Luca for 12 months to get closer to a polar bear family than anyone has before. He risked long journeys over and through the ice, often into uncharted territory, battling freezing winds, violent storms and plummeting temperatures. On a number of occasions the crew had to flee on their snowmobiles as the giant predators edged closer and closer to them. The bear roared as she attacked the pod with the Scotsman inside . Weakest point: Buchanan said his scent was strongest at the pod's weakest point, the door . The bear rocked the pod back and forth with its paws in an attempt to break it and get to its human prey . The perspex 'ice cube' the photographer was housed in for much of the filming was 'pretty much bombproof'. But there was a risk it could get brittle when very cold - making the task of filming the polar bears even more perilous. He said: 'There’s no doubt polar bear cubs are the cutest animals in the world and even the adults have an aesthetic which isn’t threatening. The pod was built of perspex and metal and withstood the fierce onslaught from the eight-foot predator . Closer than ever before: The cameraman got closer to a polar bear family than anyone else has before . Desperate for food: Unlike many mammals, polar bears have to work hard to find food . 'But the polar bear is the animal I have the most respect for, it is the largest and strongest land carnivore. They are such inquisitive animals too. 'The landscape is pretty featureless and it is amazing how they appear from nowhere. 'With most carnivores you can see their food source but you have to work really hard to find the animals polar bears feed on.' The Polar Bear Family and Me begins on BBC2 on January 7 at 9.30pm.

It was more than two decades earlier when the current Real Madrid manager watched, in agony while Liverpool and the cup with the big ears taught him a major lesson. One which should serve him well this week when the Champions League holders visit Anfield. It was the 1984 European Cup Final. The Eternal City was the host venue and it was an infernal pity, for AS Roma, that Liverpool became the visitors. Ancelotti would have been there, in midfield, to greet and then repel them, had it not been for a game against Juventus the previous December. In what was a 1983 star-studded version of the hostility which is once again dividing Italian football this season, Roma travelled to Juventus. Ancelotti had, until then, played every single minute of Roma’s European Cup matches, driving them into the quarter-finals. Juve could boast Michel Platini, future Italy manager Cesare Prandelli and 1982 World Cup winner and top scorer Paolo Rossi, but there were also Marco Tardelli, Gaetano Scirea, Paulo Roberto Falcao, Zbigniew Boniek. The match’s names trip off the tongue. Roma were champions, Juve wanted the crown back. Then, bang on the half hour, bang went Ancelotti’s chance of his first ever European Cup Final (although so far there have been seven more as player and manager). In a collision with his international team-mate, Juve’s Antonio Cabrini, Ancelotti’s left knee collapsed and he was sidelined for months. And thus he could only watch Liverpool refuse to wilt the following May. Refuse to buckle while Roma’s own Olympic Stadium howled and ranted that this was ‘their’ night, their home ... ‘their very own’ European Cup. It is ironic that, as Ancelotti watched on helplessly, Bruce Grobbelaar’s wobbly legs and penalty high-jinks distracted Francesco Graziani from scoring and induced him to sky his kick over the top. Ironic because, 11 years later in Istanbul, Ancelotti was again helpless, the manager on the touchline as Milan wilted and Jerzy Dudek morphed into the modern version of ‘crazy Bruce’, such that Serginho, Andrea Pirlo and Andriy Shevchenko flopped on penalties they would normally score blindfolded and wearing hiking boots. How Liverpool haunted Ancelotti. ‘They are a team with special connotations for me — some bad memories, some good,’ he said. ‘Twice they beat me when the European Cup was there to be won, that time with Roma when I couldn’t play and then in 2005. But I won the Champions League Final against them in 2007 and my Chelsea side beat them 2-1 at Anfield. ‘Now my goal, Real Madrid’s goal, is to do what nobody else has done. To win back-to-back Champions Leagues. ‘As a player with Milan, I did it when the competition was the European Cup — we won two in a row. But now this motivates us to set a new mark in the Champions League. ‘Last year there was so much talk about the obsession with ‘La Décima’ (Madrid’ s 10th competition win) — that was our driving force and we achieved it. Roma's Francesco Graziani, psyched out by Bruce Grobbelaar, blasts his spot kick high over the bar in 1984 . Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates as Real Madrid clinched the Champions League against Atletico in Lisbon . ‘To win ‘The Eleventh’ is now on everyone’s lips and while it’s a long road, I’ m convinced we are in the mix for the trophy because of the talent in our squad.’ That talent was on show as Cristiano Ronaldo hit a double as Real put five past hosts Levante on Saturday. In the end, Liverpool is a game about the future for Madrid. The future of ‘La Undécima’ (The Eleventh). But with flavours of the past for Signor Ancelotti.","Liverpool host Real Madrid at Anfield in the Champions League this week .

"A Swedish mother has been left shame-faced after the secret sex chamber she set up at an abandoned military bunker was uncovered. Two fisherman were left baffled when stumbled on the old bunker near the town of Nordmaling on Sweden's east coast last Friday. They found what appeared to be either a garden of earthly delights . complete with a silk-sheet laden bed, ropes, dildos and leather items - or a crime scene. The sex bunker was found near the town of Nordmaling on Sweden's east coast by two fishermen . Assuming it was a crime scene, they reported their find to local authorities, and once word got out about the sex chamber, Swedish language newspaper Aftonbladet reported 'a hard-working single mum in her 40s' came clean about it. It seems the woman - who is calling herself 'Lena' - set it up for trysts with a man she dated a few times. With news of her hideout becoming public, she decided to get in touch with the Swedish paper in order to clear up any misunderstanding, The Huffington Post reported. 'I just wanted to test my limits,' she told authorities. Experienced bondage buffs said the incident proves that the 'D' in 'BDSM' stands for discretion as well as discipline. Items found in the bunker that a 'hard-working single mum in her 40s' came clean about . Dee Severe, a filmmaker whose company Severe Society Films specializes in fetish films, said people who are interested in exploring BDSM need to think about how they will react if their lifestyle becomes public knowledge. 'Think people are narrow-minded about gay rights? Their reaction to BDSM is three steps further,' Severe told The Huffington Post. 'People need to gauge how family and friends might react and then decide how secretive you need to be.' The Swedish mother told Aftonbladet she learned an important lesson from the incident . 'Sweden is not really such a free country when it comes to sexuality,' she told the paper, and promised to make sure to tidy up after herself next time.","Two fishermen stumbled on bunker last Friday .

"Nasa has released an incredible image that shows the dizzying array of colours that can be seen emanating from the sun in wavelengths that cannot be seen by the human eye. It was made possible by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, using the wide range of wavelengths that the telescope can view. SDO converts the wavelengths into an image humans can see, and the light is colourised into a rainbow of colors. A composite image shows the many different wavelengths given off by the sun, usually invisible to the human eye . Taking a photo of the sun with a standard camera will provide a familiar image: a yellowish, featureless disk, perhaps a bit more red when near the horizon since the light must travel through more of Earth's atmosphere and consequently loses blue wavelengths before getting to the camera's lens. The sun, in fact, emits light in all colours, but since yellow is the brightest wavelength from the sun, that is the colour we see with our naked eye - via the camera , since the sun should never be looked at directly. When all the visible colours come together, scientists call this 'white light'. 335 Angstroms: This wavelength also shows hotter, magnetically active regions in the corona . 211 Angstroms: This wavelength shows hotter, magnetically active regions in the sun's corona . We see the visible spectrum of light simply because the sun is made up of a hot gas – heat produces light just as it does in a light bulb. But when it comes to the shorter wavelengths, the sun sends out extreme ultraviolet light and x-rays because it is filled with many kinds of atoms, each of which give off light of a certain wavelength when they reach a certain temperature. Not only does the sun contain many different atoms – helium, hydrogen, iron, for example - but also different kinds of each atom with different electrical charges, known as ions. Each ion can emit light at specific wavelengths when it reaches a particular temperature. The left image highlights regions of the corona during a solar flare, while the one on the right shows light emitted from the chromosphere and transition region . 131 Angstroms: The hottest material in a flare . The wavelengths SDO observes, measured in Angstroms (a measurement used to express the sizes of atoms, molecules): . 4500: Showing the sun's surface or photosphere. 1700: Shows surface of the sun, as well as a layer of the sun's atmosphere called the chromosphere, which lies just above the photosphere and is where the temperature begins rising. 1600: Shows a mixture between the upper photosphere and what's called the transition region, a region between the chromosphere and the upper most layer of  the sun's atmosphere called the corona. The transition region is where the temperature rapidly rises. 304: This light is emitted from the chromosphere and transition region. 171: This wavelength shows the sun's atmosphere, or corona, when it's quiet. It also shows giant magnetic arcs known as coronal loops. 193: Shows a slightly hotter region of the corona, and also the much hotter material of a solar flare. 211: This wavelength shows hotter, magnetically active regions in the sun's corona. 335: This wavelength also shows hotter, magnetically active regions in the corona. 94: This highlights regions of the corona during a solar flare. 131: The hottest material in a flare. 1700 Angstroms: Shows surface of the sun, as well as a layer of the sun's atmosphere called the chromosphere, which lies just above the photosphere and is where the temperature begins rising . How we see it: The left image incorporates a broad range of visible light.  The one on the right shows a mixture between the upper photosphere and what's called the transition region, a region between the chromosphere and the upper most layer of the sun's atmosphere called the corona . Solar telescopes make use of this wavelength information in two ways. For one, certain instruments, known as spectrometers, observe many wavelengths of light simultaneously and can measure how much of each wavelength of light is present. Different wavelengths convey information about different components of the sun's surface and atmosphere, so scientists use them to paint a full picture of our constantly changing and varying star. By examining pictures of the sun in a variety of wavelengths – as is done not only by SDO, but also by Nasa's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, its Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and the European Space Agency/Nasa Solar and Heliospheric Observatory - scientists can track how particles and heat move through the sun's atmosphere.","Composite picture shows colours emitted by Solar Dynamics Observatory .

"Gangster Domenyk Noonan has been arrested on suspicion of raping a man just two weeks after his big wheel protest brought Manchester city centre to a standstill. Police said a 49-year-old man was arrested yesterday afternoon in the city centre and remains in custody for questioning. It is understood the suspect is notorious criminal Noonan. Detectives are investigating a complaint that a man in his 20s was raped at an address in Stretford, Greater Manchester on Monday. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police said a 49-year-old man was arrested yesterday afternoon in the city centre and remains in custody for questioning. It is understood the suspect is notorious criminal Domenyk Noonan (pictured) Gangster: On Saturday, Noonan (left) was charged with public nuisance following a stunt which took place on Manchester’s Big Wheel tourist attraction (right) two weeks ago . Greater Manchester Police said specially trained officers are supporting the alleged victim and inquiries are continuing. On Saturday, Noonan was charged with public nuisance following a stunt which took place on Manchester’s Big Wheel tourist attraction. He was released on bail pending a court appearance, but only on the condition he does not enter Piccadilly Gardens - the part of Manchester city centre where the Big Wheel is located. Noonan, . who has changed his name by deed poll to Domenyk Lattlay-Fottfoy, spent . more than six hours perched 100 feet above the ground on the structure . two weeks ago. He was apparently protesting against police plans to return him to prison after he was told he had breached his licence. Investigation: Detectives are investigating a complaint that a man in his 20s was raped at an address in Stretford, Greater Manchester on Monday. Domenyk Noonan has been arrested in relation to the incident . During the protest, a dozen people were trapped in the wheel’s pods for two hours, including an elderly couple and a boy of three. Officers said his 'outrageous' actions endangered the lives of tourists. On Saturday, Domenyk Noonan was charged with public nuisance following his Big Wheel stunt . Up to 1,000 people watched the drama unfold as a large area at the foot of the wheel was cordoned off, before firefighters using ropes and harnesses eventually freed the gangster. Noonan, who has been the subject of a TV reality crime documentary, was released from prison in April this year after spending 18 months behind bars. However, Noonan, originally from Moston, was recalled to prison for a nine-and-a-half year sentence imposed in 2005 for possessing a gun. Since being released again, he has vowed to stand as an MP at the 2015 General Election. Noonan is considered a central figure in the notorious Manchester crime family of the same name. The family rose to notoriety after the murder of 'White' Tony Johnson - the . leader of the so-called Cheetham Hill Gang - who was shot dead 1991. Noonan’s brother Desmond was charged but . later acquitted of the killing. Over the next years, Desmond Noonan . faced a number of convictions in connection to witness intimidation and . jury tampering resulting in key witnesses refusing to testify against . him and other members of the Noonan crime family. In 2006 Domenyk Noonan and his brother were the subject of the Donal MacIntyre documentary ‘A Very British Gangster’. Domenyk Noonan, who has a 20-year-old . son named Bugsy, openly admitted to being gay during an interview with . the Irish investigative journalist. Desmond Noonan was stabbed to death just days before the screening of 'A Very British Gangster', in which he boasted of boasted of being 'untouchable'. He also said he had been behind 27 gangland murders, and claimed to have a 'bigger army', and more guns than the police.

"Again and again, the baby elephant nudged its mother’s head hoping desperately for a sign of movement. It was to no avail. She had become another victim of a mysterious spate of deaths in the tropical rainforest. If wildlife officials had not led the three-month-old infant to safety, it would probably have remained beside its mother until it, too, died. 'Great loss': A three-month-old elephant calf attempts to wake its mother; one of ten pygmy elephants found dead in Malaysia's Sabah state . Its distress moved the rescuers to tears, and left them desperate to discover who or what caused the tragedy. In total, ten Borneo pygmy elephants have been found dead in three weeks at the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve. The bodies were all near to each other . and while poisoning appears to be the likely cause, it has yet to be . determined whether it was intentional. The animals still had their tusks, indicating that they had not been killed by poachers, and none had gunshot wounds. The reserve’s head vet Sen Nathan . said the elephants were all thought to be part of the same family group, . and were aged between four and 20. It has been said that Walt Disney . could not have created a cuter creature than Borneo elephants, which . have distinctive baby-faced features, oversized ears and long tails. They grow to 8ft tall, a foot or two shorter than mainland Asian elephants. Fewer than 1,500 are believed to be in existence. Attached: The baby elephant sticks close to the body of its mother, while a wildlife department official gives it a drink . Suspicious: Conservation officials believe the elephants, discovered in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve, had been poisoned . Will Travers, who founded the Born . Free Foundation with his actor parents Virginia McKenna and Bill . Travers, said: ‘I have seen on numerous occasions that where the mother . has died and the calf has nowhere else to go, it often stands by her . until it too dies. So I’m not surprised by the image but I’m deeply saddened by it.’ He added that elephant calves are not . fully weaned until they are three and a half or four. A male is likely . to stay with its mother until it is around ten, and a female possibly . for life. Many animal behaviour experts believe that elephants mourn their dead just like humans. Mr Travers said that a combination of . close social bonds, excellent memory and long lifespan leads to the . animals experiencing emotions similar to our own. ‘We call it grief, in elephant language it is something else, but it is the same emotion.’ 'Sad day': A total of seven female and three male pygmy elephants have been found in the forest over the past three weeks . Tragic: The carcasses of the endangered animals were found in the forest over a period of three weeks . Oxford University research found . elephants mourn their dead by ‘kissing’ their bodies with their trunks . and even rocking to and fro with grief. The creatures also show compassion towards the sick and dying, trying to nurse them back to health. A separate study found that elephants . seem to be compelled to visit carcasses over and over again – even when . the animal is long dead. And calves orphaned by poachers are known to suffer nightmares, before losing the will to live and dying of grief. Elephants are not alone in exhibiting . human-like emotions. For instance, magpies hold ‘funerals’ for fallen . friends, laying ‘wreaths’ of grass along roadside corpses. And dolphins will stay by the side of stillborn calves for days.","A total of ten of the creatures have been discovered in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve, Borneo, over the past three weeks .

"Tourists visiting a popular Thai resort island are being warned to take care while swimming after a five-year-old boy was killed by a box jellyfish over the weekend. The boy, from France, was holidaying with his family on the picturesque island of Koh Phangan when he was stung by one of the deadliest creatures in the world. After the boy died, local authorities and beachfront hotels were asked to post signs warning of venomous jellyfish and prepare emergency kits for additional stings. Scroll down for video . Tragic: A young boy died after he was stung by a box jellyfish on Khuad beach on the island of Koh Phangan . Yongyos Thammawut of the provincial public health office in Surat Thani told The Bangkok Post that the boy went into shock after he was stung by the poisonous tentacles of a box jellyfish on Khuad beach on Saturday. He said the boy died as his parents and a guide were rushing him to a hospital on the island, located in the Gulf of Thailand. The tentacles of fully grown box jellyfish can reach nearly 10 feet in length, and the creatures can be found in the waters off many Thai beaches that are popular destinations for swimming and snorkelling. Lt Saengroj Somrotrat of the Thai police told AFP that the season for box jellyfish runs until the end of October. He said: ‘We have asked [hotels and resorts] to help warn people and prepare emergency kits if people come into contact with the jellyfish.’ Deadly creatures: Box jellyfish, the world's most toxic jellyfish, can grow to nearly 10 feet in length . With about 5,000 stinging cells per tentacle, box jellyfish use their venom to stun or kill fish or other prey, but even a small amount can be lethal for humans. Their venom disrupts the heart and nervous systems and can cause heart failure within minutes. Medical professionals say all cases should be treated as urgent and potentially lethal.","Boy was holidaying with his family on picturesque island of Koh Phangan .

"In a throwback to the colour-changing mood rings and Hypercolour T-shirts of the 1990s, a UK bodyshop has taken it a step further by creating a colour-changing car. Using Reactive Paint, a video shows the Bradford-based experts from Auto Kandy pouring cold water over an orange Nissan Skyline R33. Wherever the water hits the car, the bodywork appears to change from orange to purple. Scroll down for video . A Nissan Skyline R33, pictured, was coated with heat-sensitive paint by UK bodyshop Auto Kandy. When cold water is poured onto it, the car changes colour. The paint is what's called thermochromatic. As the temperature goes up, the pigment in the paint becomes colourless, revealing the base coat underneath . Thermochromatic paint contains pigments that change from one colour to another as the temperature changes. There are two types of thermochromatic pigments: liquid crystals and leuco dyes. Liquid crystals are more accurate in detecting temperature changes, but have a limited colour range. Leuco dyes come in more colours, but can only show 'hot' or 'cold'. Pigments used in the Reactive Paint are made from leuco dyes. The dye isn't applied to the car directly; it is in sold in the form of microcapsules with the mixture sealed inside. Hypercolour tshirts, mood rings and Duracell battery state indicators all use thermochratic dyes. The paint is what's called thermochromatic, which means it changes from one colour to another when the temperature changes. As the temperature goes up, the pigment in the paint becomes colourless, revealing the base coat underneath. The reactive element is suspended in either water or solvent based-paint and must be applied in such a . way to make sure the particles spread across the entire surface. Auto Kandy applied the base coat under a layer of clear paint. Its Reactive Paint costs £199 per litre and the bodyshop used around 7.5 litres on its Nissan Skyline R33. The base colour of the car stays hidden by the effect paint when it is cold, but is revealed when the car heats up again. The paint comes in different colours and they can be combined with existing car colours, and top coats, to make the effect more personalised.

"In less than a month, Scotland will decide whether to become an independent country or remain part of the United Kingdom. Uncertainty regarding the future normally slows down property markets, but in Scotland the reverse has been true. Data from estate agent Strutt & Parker show that in the second quarter of this year, median house prices rose by eight per cent – almost double the figure for England and Wales. And the market in Scotland’s capital has been particularly buoyant – for example, in the three months to April, the number of homes sold in Edinburgh was 40 per cent up on the same period in 2013. Popular area: A four-bed house in Edinburgh's New Town recently sold for £1.17million . In Scotland, vendors of residential property are required to provide a Home Report, which includes a professional survey and a mortgage valuation, and buyers submit sealed bids for the property. ‘A year ago, fewer than one in four homes sold in Edinburgh achieved their valuation,’ says David Marshall, business development analyst at the Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centre. ‘Today, for the first time in four years, over half the homes sold in the capital achieve their valuation and one in 20 will exceed the valuation by ten per cent or more.’ While there is not a property bubble comparable to the one seen recently in London, Edinburgh did not suffer the negative equity experienced elsewhere when the market crashed during the banking crisis. ‘The market here merely plateaued,’ says Richard Loudon, senior partner in the property division of Simpson & Marwick Solicitors in Edinburgh. Selling well: A six-bed home on Walker Street in New Town, Edinburgh, similar to the one pictured above, is currently on sale at £1.55million . Uncertainty regarding the future normally slows down property markets, but in Scotland, and particularly in Edinburgh, the reverse has been true . This is hardly surprising. Edinburgh is one of those places with a market that runs its own course, to some extent independent of the winds of change. In part, this is due to the foresight of the city elders in the 1760s who organised an architectural competition to develop the north of the city, partly to relieve the overcrowded medieval Old Town and partly to attract the wealthy. The resultant New Town was built in stages up to the 1830s. It was the largest planned city of its time, with its grid of broad streets, elegant squares and neo-classical sandstone buildings. Now part of a World Heritage Site, the New Town, with adjacent Stockbridge, is the most sought-after sector for city living. On average, a three-bedroom flat here costs between £600,000 and £700,000. ‘There is always strong demand from well-to-do professional couples and families,’ Loudon says. ‘But the market for £1 million-plus properties is limited.’ Changing Edinburgh: Stephanie Lothian has been renovating properties for 15 years . One Edinburgh property for sale that has recently received a lot of interest is 13 Claremont Crescent, an elegant, listed terrace house on the eastern edge of the New Town with four bedrooms and two reception rooms. It was designed by architect William Burn  in 1823 and is currently on sale through Simpson & Marwick. The minimum price for offers has been set at £850,000, but the house is expected to fetch more than £1 million. Formerly architects’ offices, it was . bought last November for £710,000 by a foreign-based owner, who handed . over its renovation to Stephanie Lothian, 42, co-director of project . management business Sandstone Property. ‘There . was everything to do, from listed building consent for even the most . minor alteration to replumbing, rewiring and choosing all the designs . and finishes,’ says Stephanie, who met her Sandstone business partner, . Valerie Allingham, when they were members of the British Alpine Ski . Team. ‘There’s been a great . deal of interest, mainly from expat families returning to Edinburgh,’ says Stephanie, who has been renovating properties for 15 years. She . started the business  in her spare time while working for Lothian and . Borders Police, where she ended up as a detective inspector in . counter-terrorism. Inverleith, . on the other side of the Water of Leith, is also desirable, as is leafy . Grange, south of the centre, with large family houses. Richard Loudon . says he recently sold a villa there valued at £800,000 for £910,000. In . April next year, stamp duty in Scotland will be replaced by the Land . and Buildings Transaction Tax – which may well prove popular as it will . be on a sliding scale rather than kicking in at certain rates at certain . levels. But how will the market fare come the referendum? David Marshall expects the market to slow just beforehand. ‘In uncertain times, people delay major decisions,’ he says. ‘But . whichever way it goes, we’re not going to see a flood of properties on . the market.’ Loudon adds: . ‘Currently, the economic recovery has overridden concerns about the . referendum. But if the result is No, we could see the market climb away. If it’s a Yes, well, it’s anybody’s guess.’","Median house prices in Scotland rose by eight per cent last quarter .

"The Fast and the Furious may be a Hollywood fantasy, but a new documentary reveals that the world of underground racing is alive and well in Britain too. Young men from all around the country gather at giant race meetings to compare their cars, which tend to be affordable models which have been modified with extra lights and powerful sound systems. The police are keen to crack down on the racing scene, saying it endangers both the drivers themselves and their fellow road users. Boy racers: A new documentary reveals the world of secret race meetings where hundreds of people gather to admire super-fast cars . Meeting: Police are trying to crack down on the gatherings saying they promote dangerous behaviour . Danger: The cars often go well over the speed limit as they race each other on public roads . However, many of those who attend the . meetings come from depressed areas, and claim that the work they do on . their cars is the only thing that keeps them out of more serious . trouble. The hidden story of these passionate motorists is revealed in Boy Racer: Fast & Furious In The UK, a documentary made by Rhys James and Grant Armour for Vice. The . short film follows both sides of the boy racer divide - a pair of . policemen supervising a gathering in Essex, and a car fanatic from . Tyneside who loves customising his car and racing other drivers. At . the late-night meeting in Essex, young men show off their cheap cars, . which they paint in gaudy colours and deck out with flashy accessories. One . racer proudly displays his lit-up door handles and a strip of lights . along the underside of his car - which he boasts cost just £11.50 in . total. Star: Much of the film focusses on Ollie, from Whitley Bay in North Tyneside . Thrill: He says the high-speed manoeuvres he pulls off are exciting enough to outweigh the dangers . Out in the open: The racers manage to avoid police attention despite racing in public . Another tells the filmmakers that he has covered his Vauxhall Corsa in 2,500 stickers, and installed a sound system which is powerful enough to make people's hair stand on end. Much of the documentary focusses on Ollie, from Whitley Bay, who is proud to call himself a boy racer and frequently travels the length of the country to attend meetings . He admits that his hobby is extremely dangerous - but says that his hometown is so deprived that he has no other way of occupying himself. 'There's nothing much to do for young uns around here,' he says. 'I'd probably do what a lot of people are now- just go on the dole and go and get p***ed every day.' He has a Subaru Impreza, painted 'burnt tangerine candy orange', and spends his evenings trying to avoid the police as he takes to dual carriageways and pits his powers against his brother, another keen racer. Tricked out: Many of the cars involved are cheap motors with additions such as powerful sound systems . Skid: The film chronicles exciting but potentially deadly moments in races between competing drivers . The drivers are aware of the risks they face by racing on public roads, but they tend to blame motorists who are not as good at driving as they think they are. One of Ollie's friends, who works in a scrapyard, tells the film: 'People that think they can drive but obviously they can't, and then they end up in here.' The police in the documentary highlights the dangers by telling of the horrors they face when dealing with the aftermath of fatal accidents. 'You see the consequences and you see how much it rips apart families for what we'll call a moment of madness,' one says. 'It's horrendous having to go to someone's house and tell them that their son or daughter has been killed.'

'Since you came back into the headlines, our loyal fan base has been e-mailing us non-stop asking about you.' Kulich's email gives Knox the assurance that she would have final say 'over all terms of production' - Kulich says Knox will get to choose which sex acts she performs on film, and which 'talent' she wants to work with. 'This is a great opportunity for you to make some money to put towards . finishing your education and also future legal costs to help with this . unfortunate retrial,' Kulich continues. This is far from the first time Kulich's company has tried to cash in on attractive women who make headlines. In December of 2013, Kulich made a similar offer to shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco. PR Stunt: Monarchy Distribution offered shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco $10,000 to appear in a porn film . Sacco - a former public relations executive with IAC, an Internet company with brands like Ask.com and The Daily Beast - made headlines last year when she posted derogatory, racial remarks on Twitter before boarding a flight to Africa. 'Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!' Sacco tweeted on December 22. Before Sacco's flight touched down in South Africa, news of her offensive tweet had already made headlines across the globe - there were journalists and photographers waiting at the airport for her flight to land. She was promptly fired by IAC CEO Barry Diller. After the incident, Kulich offered Sacco $10,000 to appear in an adult film with the title 'Justine's African Vacation.' For another PR stunt, Kulich used political laughing stock Anthony Weiner's notoriety to push his brand. Weiner: Monarchy Distribution also used the further shaming of former Congressman Anthony Weiner to push his brand . Porn star: Anthony Weiner gal Sydney Leathers appeared in a porn film spoofing her relationship with Weiner . In July of 2013, after it was revealed that Weiner's X-rated social media habits continued well after he was forced to resign from Congress for a series of sexually charged conversations he had with women over social networking sites, Weiner was pressured by many to end his bid to become the Democratic nominee for New York City's mayor. After the scandal broke, Kulich announced that he was producing a movie titled 'Don't Pull Out,' and donating 15 percent of the profits to Weiner's failed mayoral campaign. After news of Weiner's texting made headlines, the woman at the center of the scandal - Sydney Leathers - appeared in a porn film spoofing the Weiner scandal. Leathers' film is titled 'Weiner and Me.' This isn't the first time Knox has been offered a job in the porn industry; in 2011, after winning the appeal of her initial guilty verdict in the Kercher murder case, Vivid Entertainment - which, like Monarch Distribution - has a long history of headline-inspired publicity stunts - offered Knox a job. 'We would like to offer her the opportunity to be our vivid.com spokesperson and represent the studio at trade and retail events.This would involve no nudity or sex. Of course we would welcome talking to her if she wants to pursue this direction, but the decision is totally hers to express,"" the company said in its publicized offer to Knox. Knox, however, did not respond to the gimmick.","Monarchy Distribution has a history of publicity stunts .
Last year the company offered shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco $10,00 to appear in a porn film .
The company claimed it was donating part of the proceeds from an adult film spoofing the Anthony Weiner downfall to the former candidate's campaign for mayor .
Knox was again found guilty of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher ."
"A stag’s antlers are his pride and joy, his protection and his way of attracting a mate, but from December he sheds them and those all-important horns are all but gone. For the stag that is. An army of people across Britain and Europe roam parks and woodlands every year, collecting hundreds of thousands of deer antlers to fashion them into walking sticks, furniture or ground them down for Chinese medicine but now the valuable antlers are being turned into dog chews. Tasty dog treats: George Turton, 19, cutting this week's 1000 antlers into dog chews at Pure Dog warehouse near Southampton . Deer turns dog: Glenn Campbell, left, has found a new, popular way of using stag antlers, naturally shed by deers every winter. He is turning them into tasty dog chews . Eight tons of antlers were prepared and dispatched from a warehouse in Southampton, Hampshire to pet shops across the country last month, keeping up with the growing demand for the dog chews, called Stagbars. Glenn Campbell, owner of Pure Dog, the company who makes them, said: ‘We recently had an order for thirty thousand bars from Pets at Home – they’re in all their stores now. ‘It all started nearly two years ago. We’re both passionate dog lovers – we’d looked for ideas and wanted to offer something completely different. First in the UK: Mr Campbell's company is the first in the UK to turn deer antlers into chews that plenty of British dogs are enjoying, including this one pictured . British are the favourites: A quarter of the antlers come from Scotland and Mr Campbell said 'The British ones are our favourites because they have the smallest carbon footprint' ‘We knew antler dog chews were popular in America so we decided to be the first to do them in the UK.’ What started as a part-time enterprise at home for Mr Campbell and wife Deborah has now got so busy they have left their jobs and moved the business into a 1,800 sq ft warehouse four months ago. Mr Campbell said: ‘I think they’re so popular because they last a long time, are natural and different and people love to spoil their dogs. ‘About 25 per cent of our antlers come . from Scotland and a small number come from Exmoor. The British ones are . our favourites because they have the smallest carbon footprint. Antler enterprise: The business has got so busy that the once part-time enterprise at home has moved into a 1,800 warehouse and last month they prepared eight tons of antlers for pet shops around the country . Popular for pets: Mr Campbell, right, said the chews, left, have proved popular because they last a long time and people love to spoil their pets . ‘The rest of our stock is mainly found in Spain and Germany and is imported from our European suppliers. ‘None of our antlers come from farms or culled animals. They can all be traced to where they were harvested. We work alongside DEFRA to meet their stringent regulations.’ They employ between five and ten people in their factory. None of the antlers Mr Campbell, pictured, uses come from farms or culled animals . On their website, Stagbars are described as: ‘They wear down slowly with the grinding action of the dog’s teeth and saliva, into tasty morsels. Eventually, the dry marrow is exposed as a lovely treat when the outside has been worn away. They are suitable for puppies who are teething. ‘They clean the dog’s teeth, rather than bung them up and they’re great for dogs with sensitive tummies. Even dogs who are losing weight can enjoy Stagbars because they only contain a tiny amount of fat.’ The antlers are cut into different sized Stagbars suitable for different sized dogs. Ready for mating season: Stag's antlers grow to attract a mate and fight off other males and after they shed them during the rutting season, a new, larger rack will grow in time for the next mating season . Stag’s antlers are grown purely to attract females and to fight off other males. Every year they grow a new larger, rack with more points ready for the mating season. A stag’s age can be determined by the number of points on his antlers. Deer antlers are among the fastest growing tissues known to man, growing as much as an inch per day during peak development in the summer.","Glen and Deborah Campbell run Pure Dog, a company that turns deer antlers into dog chews .

"But tourists have already flocked to . archaeological sites in Mexico and Central America where 'Apocalypse parties' are being held . With ten days to go before the Mayan apocalypse supposedly casts Earth into oblivion, time is running out for believers to find alien salvation. But for those who have failed to book . their spot in the shadow of France's Pic de Bugarach - apparently home to an extra-terrestrial mothership that will pluck believers to safety - there is another peak with similar powers. Nestled deep within Serbia's Carpathian mountain range, Mount Rtanj is thought to house a 'pyramidal' structure left behind by alien visitors thousands of years ago that will emit a powerful force field at the moment of Armageddon, protecting those in its vicinity. 'The navel of the world'? Mount Rtanj, in Serbia, is thought to house a 'pyramidal' structure left behind by alien visitors thousands of years ago. New Agers believe it will emit a powerful force field that will protect them from Apocalypse . Now, hotels in the area are overflowing with doomsday cultists hoping to live past Christmas. 'In one day we had 500 people trying to . book rooms. People want to bring their whole families,' Obrad Blecic, a . local hotel manager, told The Telegraph. Popular British science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke reportedly believed the peak contained a 'special energy' and labelled it 'the navel of the world'. Doom: An ancient Mayan calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns . Panic: The prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and has spread panic across the world . Mount Rtanj has long been believed to have mystical powers. According to legend, a wizard lived in a great castle at its summit, guarding a hoard of buried treasure. The castle is now gone, replaced by a small chapel to Patron Saint of England Saint George. The chapel, however, was destroyed by treasure hunters in the trying to unearth the hidden gold. The mountain is also famed for its 'Rtanj tea', made from the savory herb and lauded as a powerful aphrodisiac and cure for chronic flatulence. Ancient Mayans believed that a . 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count would come to a close  on December 21 2012. Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, started counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21. They . say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle . would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does . not mark an end. Conspiracy . theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending . astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from . explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power . grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's . magnetic field. The end-of-days prophesy is based on . an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an . intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and will impact on . December 21 2012. As 'zero hour' approaches, various theories have been posed as to how Planet Earth will meet its doom. One claims that . Nibiru, a rogue planet discovered by the ancient Sumerians, will crash into . Earth on December 21, killing everyone. The origins of those rumors have been . linked to the works of the late Azerbaijani-born author Zecharia . Sitchin, who wrote in 1976 that he had found and translated Sumerian . documents identifying the rogue planet. Sitchin died in 2010 at the age . of 90. Scientists, however, say there is no such planet. Another theory claims that the earth's magnetic field will reverse producing dire consequences such as violent hurricanes and the loss of all electronic communication systems. Some believe the earth is unwittingly hurtling headlong towards a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way that will suck humanity into oblivion. As a result, panic-buying of candles and other essentials has been reported in China and Russia, while in the United States the sale of survival shelters is booming. News of Mount Rtanj's mystic powers follows claims that aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep . within Pic de Bugarach mountain, in France's Pyrenees, and pluck anyone in . the vicinity to safety. Armageddon tourists and UFO spotters hoping for salvation have swarmed to the two-street hamlet where 'authentic Bugarach stones' are on sale for €1.50 (£1.20) a gram, a bottle of water from the local spring costs €15 (£12). One landowner is even offering up his four-bedroom home with close up views of the mysterious peak for £1,200 a night, while tourists can also pop to the local Italian . restaurant for an 'Apocalypse pizza', washed down with a local vintner's . 'End Of The World' vintage. But not everyone is taking the forecast so seriously. Tourists have already flocked to archaeological sites in Mexico and Central America where 'Apocalypse parties' are being held to mark a new Mayan era on December 21. Mexico is one of five countries preparing to observe the date, which marks the end of a more than 5,000-year era, according to the Mayan 'Long Count' calendar, which began in 3114 BC. End of Days party: Tourists have already flocked to archaeological sites such as the Pyramid of Kukulkan at Chich (pictured) in Itz, where 'Apocalypse parties' are being held to mark a new Mayan era on December 21 . The start of the new Mayan calendar also is big business in this region, with tourism offices in no fewer than five countries aggressively promoting the date. Millions of tourists are expected to flood into the region for celebrations that will include fireworks, concerts and other spectacles held at more than three dozen archaeological sites. In addition to Mexico, celebrations will be held in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras, and at least two heads of state - President Otto Perez of Guatemala and President Porfirio Lobo of Honduras - have confirmed that they will take part in festivities in their respective countries.","Mount Rtanj is thought to house a 'pyramidal' structure left behind by alien visitors thousands of years ago .

"It looks like it might soon be moving day for reality star Todd Chrisley and his brood of eight—downsizing from his lavish 30,000 square foot Rosewell, Georgia home to a two-bedroom condo in Atlanta. According to court documents obtained by MailOnline,  Chrisley, 45, the sharp-tongued family patriarch of  Chrisley Knows Best, could soon lose the family’s mansion  to the bank if it’s not sold first. A new court order entitles the bank holding the million dollar mortgage on the two-acre estate to foreclose on the property. Until now, Chrisley had been shielded from foreclosure after he filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012. Scroll down for video . Curbed: According to court documents obtained by MailOnline,  family patriarch Todd Chrisley of  Chrisley Knows Best, could soon lose the family mansion in Rosewell, Georgia to the bank . Now the court has given U.S.Bank the green light to repossess the home that serves as the backdrop for the popular reality series that has been signed for a second season. But a buyer may save the day. According to Suzanne Close, a broker with Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International Realty, the home, which went on the market in March for $2.4 million, is now under contract for an undisclosed sum. But where does that leave Chrisley, who owes close to a million dollars on the house? His only property that is not on the line is a two-bedroom condo in Atlanta! The fifth floor unit, located at 620 Peachtree in Atlanta, is completely paid off.  It is a 1,750 square foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom, condominium unit worth $300,000. From this....a 30,000 square foot mansion with it's own theatre, grotto, elevator and nine fireplaces... To this...a 1,750 square foot two-bedroom condominium unit on the fifth floor in Atlanta . The family is also in danger of losing two more of their four properties. In addition to the family home, Todd is also facing foreclosure on the house occupied by his mother, Grandma Faye. He defaulted on a $33,000 loan and she and Todd’s oldest son Kyle, who had been staying with his grandmother, are about to be forced out. Grandma Faye’s $500,000 house, located in Alpharetta, Georgia, has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and is 3,000 square feet. The third possible casualty of Todd’s bankruptcy is his four bedroom, four bathroom, 4,324 square foot lakefront vacation retreat located in Seneca, South Carolina, 37 miles from Greenville. The house was purchased for $1.425 million, however with back payments and penalties the amount has swollen to over $1.688 million. Court order: The mansion, previously protected under the bankruptcy law, is now subject to foreclosure, unless someone buys the property first . When Todd filed for bankruptcy he listed more than $4.2 million in assets but claimed his debts were amazingly, over $49 million! According to LALATE.com Todd’s financial empire literally collapsed overnight after Todd and Julie lost a lucrative contract with Fannie Mae, where most of their fortune had been built refurbishing foreclosure properties and selling them for a fat commission. Todd allegedly owned a company called Executive Asset Management, LLC and made $8 million in 2004, which he sold that same year. In 2008 he launched Chrisley Assessment Management, where the bankruptcy trustee claims Todd was withdrawing over $500,000 per month in income from the business.  The trustee went on to exclaim Todd and Julie own — or owned — homes in resorts in Florida and South Caroline as well as the large estate in Atlanta. In addition, the trustee explained Todd also owned a condominium in Los Angeles and leases a substantial residence in Gwinnett County, Georgia. However, according to a recent search of real estate documents Todd, only owns the four properties now and his wife, Julie, a former beauty queen who has her own fortune, is not listed as a co-owner on any of them. In the closet: Todd's notoriously huge walk-in closet is probably bigger than one of the bedrooms in the condo . Todd also reportedly owes the IRS more than $500,000 and he even borrowed $4.4 million from his wife to invest in the business. Todd and his wife, Julie, who have five children and two grandchildren, proudly boasted on the March 11, 2014 premiere of the show on USA Network that they live in a gated community with many celebrities, including the “The Voice” judge, Usher. He went on to brag that his family spends at least $300,000 a year on shopping sprees. The sprawling 30,000-square-foot mansion includes a gourmet indoor kitchen as well as an outdoor one, a living room that is so large it’s takes up an entire floor, a huge spa bathroom next to the master suite, nine fireplaces, a theater, grotto, wine cellar, elevator, saltwater pool and, of course, his infamous walk-in closet full of his designer clothes that he has separated by the different seasons. Todd may not be able to save all or any of the three properties but he has already started to bounce back with his reality show and as a result of record ratings the USA Network has already renewed the show for a second season. 'Perfection should be something you should strive to be.' Todd explained on the show, 'I expect a certain standard, I want us to live a certain way.'","Court documents obtained by MailOnline reveal the bank has been granted permission to repossess the house where the Chrisley Knows Best star lives with wife, five children and two grandkids .

"A sea exploration company said today . it has discovered yet another British wartime ship filled with silver, . which is lying 8,000ft beneath the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean. Odyssey . Marine Exploration Inc hit the headlines earlier this month by . discovering the Second World War-era SS Gairsoppa and its £155million . haul of silver on the ocean floor. Today . the company proudly announced that it found the remains of the British . SS Mantola, a First World War-era ship that sank on February 9, 1917. Spooky sight: The Odyssey Marine Exploration's ROV inspection of the SS Mantola site, showing the promenade railings . Excellent condition: Despite being sent to the bottom in 1917, and suffering the ravages of salt water and pressure, the Mantola is literally in ship shape at the bottom of the Atlantic . Open the hatches: Odyssey Marine Exploration intends to return in the spring to mine both the Mantola and the Gairsoppa around 100 miles away . Like the Gairsoppa but decades before, the Mantola fell victim to a German submarine,  U-81. An Odyssey spokesman said the Mantola was insured to carry silver worth £110,000 when it sailed in 1917. That value would mean the ship could hold as much as 600,000 ounces of silver, based on silver prices in 1917. At current market prices, that much silver would be worth more than £12million. Odyssey will retain 80 per cent of the value of the silver that's recovered. Precious cargo: The SS Mantola, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 in the North Atlantic, carrying silver . The . company is planning a recovery expedition next spring. It said its . share of the proceeds will contribute significantly to funding its . future operations. The . shipwreck is about 100 miles away from the SS Gairsoppa which sank in 1941 carrying a reported cargo of up . to 7 million ounces of silver. Treasure hunter: Odyssey Marine Exploration's Odyssey Explorer, which is bristling with hi-tech gadgets, has hit pay dirt twice - first with the SS Gairsoppa and now with the SS Mantola . The Gairsoppa was steaming home from . India while in the service of the Ministry of War Transport when . she was torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat. She sank in icy seas more than three miles deep about 300 miles south west of Ireland. Only one of her 84 crew survived. Eerie: A ladder leads down to the cargo hold on the SS Gairsoppa as it lies on the sea bed 300 miles south of Galway . Well preserved: A brass part of the Gairsoppa is in good condition, suggesting that the cargo is also undamaged by its time beneath the waves . Sea bed: A sonar image of the SS Gairsoppa, sunk by German U-Boat in 1941 . In what is believed to be the deepest . and largest ever retrieval of a precious cargo, the firm will next . spring dive to recover a haul estimated to be worth £155million. The 412-ft steamship is sitting upright on the seabed, with . its holds open. Odyssey said a robot submersible . captured video footage showing tea chests, a sign that the heavier . consignment of silver was underneath. Hoard: The ship, which was torpedoed after breaking away from a convoy, was carrying silver . Uncovered: An intact toilet sits on the bridge deck of the SS Gairsoppa . Sunk: The SS Gairsoppa was a steel-hulled British cargo steamship that began her career in 1919 under the service of the British India Steam Navigation Company of London . Pick-up: Odyssey crew will use remotely operated vehicles to get to the wreck and unload its precious cargo . 'This should enable us to unload the . cargo through the hatches,’ chief executive Greg Stemm added. The . Gairsoppa is so deep the usual steel cable used in the grab mechanisms . will have to be replaced by synthetic fibres. The ship, recognisable by the . red-and-black paintwork of the British-India Steam Navigation Company . and the torpedo hole in its side, was sailing in a convoy from Calcutta . in 1941. Buffeted by high winds and running . low on coal, the captain decided he would not make it to Liverpool and . broke from the convoy to head for Galway. A single torpedo from U-101 sank her . in 20 minutes, on February 17, 1941. Three lifeboats were launched, but . only Second Officer Richard Ayres made it to land, reaching the Cornish . coast after 13 days. Odyssey said yesterday the UK . government was ‘desperately looking for new sources of income’ and was . urging it to find more British wrecks. It is also investigating HMS .

In 2008 a U.S. judge ordered the firm . to hand back gold and silver coins worth £300million to Spain, which . said the treasure was taken from a frigate that sank in 1804.

"A high school in Missouri is under fire after photos have emerged showing a dozen seniors, all of them white, taking part in a powder-puff football while in full-on blackface. The racially insensitive photos were taken November 5 at Sullivan High School during an annual game where girls from each grade faced off against one another on the football field, with some of the male players acting as their coaches. A dozen teenage girls from the senior class took to the field with their faces entirely painted black, as parents and school officials looked on from the bleachers. Racially insensitive: This photo of Sullivan High School students in full-on blackface was taken November 5 after a powder-puff football game . Courting controversy: The images of the white girls with their faces painted black were posted on social media sparking outrage . 'I thought, ""Oh my gosh,""' Sullivan Principal Jennifer Schmidt told St Louis Post-Dispatch. 'I knew they didn’t mean anything by it, but, in hindsight, I should have made them wash it off and move on.' The seniors in blackface ended up defeating their opponents and later posed with the medals awarded for their victory. In one of the two pictures shared on Facebook two weeks ago, the all-female team is flanked by three young men, presumably Sullivan football players, who had no paint on their faces. Principal Schmidt said the girl who posted the incendiary photos was 'mortified' that it had sparked outrage in some circles and attracted media attention. The November 5 game was organized by the junior class to raise money for the prom. In years past, girls taking part in the powder-puff game have painted their faces black and gold, which are the school colors, or worn eye black inspired by male football players. True colors: The principal of the school said the girls only had black paint to work with that day. In the past, students have painted their faces black and gold, which are the colors of the school . Ban: Going forward, student likely will be prohibited from using any face paint during powder-puff games . Opportunity: The school plans to use the incident as a teachable moment . According to Schmidt, on the day of the game the seniors brought with them only black face paint, so they decided to work with what they had. The girls in question have not been reprimanded because, as Schmidt explained, they had no intention to offend anyone, or make a statement about race relations. 'They just weren't thinking,' said the principal of her students. Schmidt added that the school will use the incident as a teachable moment and explain to students why it is offensive to wear blackface. As a result of the controversy, students likely will be prohibited from wearing any face paint going forward.","Photos of a dozen girls from Sullivan High School with their faces painted black were taken November 5 .

"These vibrant comic book covers appear to be the epitome of science fiction, but within their eye-catching illustrations are scarily accurate predictions of life in the 21st century. The retro covers imagine a world where plastic surgery is common place, man walks on the moon and patients are fitted with artificial hearts. And although these subjects may not seem that groundbreaking today, all of the covers were published more than 80 years ago between 1929 and 1939. The retro covers imagine a world where plastic surgery is common place, man walks on the moon and patients are fitted with artificial hearts. On the left is a 1939 cover depicting a  fountain of youth which rejuvenates the human body in a beauty parlour of the future. The left image of World without Women depicts a robot saving humanity from extinction. It was published in 1939 . For instance, the now infamous moon landing of 1969 was predicted 40 years earlier in the Moon Strollers comic of 1929. That same year, illustrators predicted that in the future scientists would develop machines that read the subconscious mind and project its thoughts as images, titled Into the Subconscious. A number of breakthroughs in this field were made just last week. A student from the University of Washington, fitted with an EEG cap, successfully controlled the hand of a friend sitting half a mile away. The two students played a game in which cannons had to be fired on-screen. The ‘sender’ thought about firing the cannon, which then moved the hand of the ‘receiver’. Yesterday, Google-owned Boston Dynamics unveiled its latest version of the Atlas robots, and the tech giant is developing software that acts like a human.These areas of research will pave the way for the Robot A.1, featured on a comic book cover in 1939, which shows a giant robot controlled by a human brain (left). Pictured on the right is an 1932 illustration of what a city on Mars might look like . This retro cover of Kidnapped into the Future shows a man from the year 4230 travelling by time machine back to mid-20th century . Meanwhile, the '#scanners' project allows users to manipulate a digital art installation using a headset that creates a visual record of a person's subconscious mind. An animator in Manchester said it will give people a glimpse into a dream world, and it uses a £100 ($150) headset developed by technology company NeuroSky. The collection - from titles including Marvel, Amazing Stories and Wonder Stories - also includes a host of recognisable scenes including one cover, created in 1939, called World Without Death. On the left is Secret of the Buried City, a 1939 comic about how the Earth is destroyed to make way for a better civilisation. The right image of 4-sided triangle, also from 1939, shows a scientist cloning the body of a young woman in his laboratory . These vibrant comic book covers appear to be the epitome of science fiction, but within their eye-catching illustrations are scarily accurate predictions of life in the 21st century. For instance, the now infamous moon landing of 1969 was predicted 40 years earlier in the Moon Strollers comic of 1929 (pictured) Deja vu, unexplained shivers down the spine, hairs on the back of your neck...people have always believed the body has many ways of telling you something that is about to happen. But a recent scientific research paper claims to have discovered that your body can predict the future. Scientists said that during tests they found proof people can anticipate events, or realise something is about to happen, without cues. The paper, in the Frontiers of Perception Science journal, claimed that after studying people's reactions in different tests, they found that subjects could 'predict' that something out of the ordinary was about to happen. But some scientists said the findings showed scientists were looking for evidence of 'presentiment' and didn't actually prove that it existed. In the image, a doctor is seen fitting a patient with an artificial heart - reminiscent of Matthew Green, who become the first Britain discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart in 2011. Yesterday, Google-owned Boston Dynamics unveiled its latest version of the Atlas robots, and the tech giant is developing software that acts like a human. These areas of research will pave the way for the Robot A.1, featured on a comic book cover in 1939, which shows a giant robot controlled by a human brain. During this year’s World Cup, for example, a paraplegic used a mind-controlled exoskeleton to walk on the pitch and kick the first ball of the tournament. And last month, scientists revealed two patients fitted with radical new mind-controlled artificial limbs that link directly with their skeleton and nervous system. While many of the covers appear to be a fairly accurate prediction of the future, others are thankfully yet to come to fruition. One comic, dubbed Cities in the Air, sees New York become an airborne city, elevated above the Earth’s surface to avoid pollutants and Secret of the Buried City, in which Earth is destroyed to make way for a better civilisation. Another retro cover of Kidnapped into the Future shows a man from the year 4230 travelling by time machine back to mid-20th century America. Scientists may not have achieved time travel yet, but that hasn't stopped it being source of fascination for science fiction writers and illustrations, today, as it was back in the 1930s.

"Piers Morgan's interview with the man leading the charge to have him deported turned explosive as the CNN anchor tried to discuss gun control in America. Morgan brought radio talk show host Alex Jones onto his prime time show on Monday to explain why he thinks the British journalist and broadcaster should be banned from the U.S. for his views on gun control. The topic has been the focus of Piers Morgan's shows since the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones, however, spent nearly all of the time screaming at Morgan at the top of his lungs, calling him a 'redcoat foreigner' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to 'take our guns.' Scroll down for video and transcript of the rant . Explosive: Alex Jones, right, spent nearly all of his 15 minutes on CNN shouting at Piers Morgan, left, at the top of his lungs . Volatile: Jones ranted for three minutes straight at the start of the interview, without Morgan getting a single word in edgewise . 'Let me say, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. No matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to be taken. We will not relinquish them,' Jones said. Jones, a well-known conspiracy theorist whose radio show and website, InfoWars.com, reaches millions of Americans, at one point challenged Morgan to a boxing match. He also claimed 'mass murder suicide pills' like the anti-depressant Prozac were the real cause of massacres like the ones at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the late screening of the 'Dark Knight Rises' in Aurora, Colorado. Throughout the exchange, Morgan attempted to foster a debate about gun control, beginning with the fact that the United States counted more than 11,000 gun murders last year while Britain had only 35. Finger pointing: Jones said Morgan is a foreigner who is working to disarm the American people for dastardly purposes . Fiery: Morgan tried several times to calm Jones down and had little success . Angry: Jones clearly had a point to make and was intent on shouting to ensure he was heard . He tried many times to calm Jones down and get him to answer his questions. Most of the time, it was a failed effort and Jones was insistent on getting his own points across. Morgan, a Mail On Sunday columnist and former editor of The Daily Mirror and News Of The World, began one exchange by saying: 'Let's try again. You accuse me of attacking the second amendment... ' Jones responded: 'I wanna get people off pills that the insert says will make you commit suicide and kill people. I wanna blame the real culprit - suicide pills. Mass murder pills.' When asked again about the difference in the murder rates between the U.S. and Britain, Jones responded: 'You're a hatchet man of the New World Order' - referring to the belief among conspiracy theorists that an international cabal is working to break down national boundaries and control the entire world. Argument: Alex Jones refuses to remove his shoes while going through airport security as a police officer allegedly threatens to arrest him . Iconic: These image of police officers and teachers leading children to safety immediately after the Sandy Hook massacre was seen around the world . Morgan was persistent: 'Let's try again. How many gun murders were there in Britain last year?' Jones responded: 'I don't know, how many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin?' James Holmes, who faces multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder for the Colorado theater Dark Knight Rises shooting . Jones is leading a drive to petition the . White House, under its We the People program, to deport Morgan back to . Britain because he 'is engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment.' The petition has more than 105,000 votes - more than four times the number required to receive an official White House response. Jones explained the reason for the petition, saying: 'It's to point out that you're a foreigner, a redcoat, here telling us what to do.' 'Redcoat' refers to the red uniforms British soldiers wore as they fought the colonists during the Revolutionary War. Before he had even managed to arrive . for his appearance on Piers Morgan's show, Jones had already been filmed . in argumentative scenes. A known critic of Homeland Security, Jones felt he was being singled out when Austin-Bergstrom airport security made him remove his shoes. In the ensuing argument, Jones claims, he was threatened with arrest by police until he agreed to their request. After Morgan's interview with Jones first aired, the White House press office responded to questions about the petition with a statement saying: 'The White House responds to all petitions that cross the threshold and we will respond to this one. 'In the meantime, it is worth remembering that the freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy.' Alex Jones starts by explaining his reason for supporting the Second Amendment . ALEX JONES: We did it as a way to bring attention to the fact that we have all of these foreigners, and the Russian government, the official Chinese government -- Mao said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun, he killed about 80 million people because he's the only guy who had the guns -- so we did it to point out that this is globalism, and the mega banks that control the planet and brag they have taken over -- in Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, you name it -- brag that they're going to get our guns as well. They've taken everybody's guns, but the Swiss and the American people and when they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny while the government buys 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, predator drones, armed now in U.S. skies, being used to arrest people in North Dakota. The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting. It's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs. Take the woman in India, your piece earlier on CNN earlier, I was watching during Anderson Cooper's show, didn't tell you the women of India have signed giant petitions to get firearms because the police can't and won't protect them. The answer is -- wait a minute, I have FBI crime statistics that come out of a year late, 2011, 20-plus percent crime drop in the last nine years, real violent crime because more guns means less crime. Britain took the guns 15, 16 years ago. Tripling of your overall violent crime. True, we have a higher gun violence level, but overall, muggings, stabbing, deaths -- those men [allegedly] raped that woman in India to death with an iron rod 4 feet long. You can't ban the iron rods. The guns, the iron rods, Piers, didn't do it, the tyrants did it. Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms! It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there in the street begging for them to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them. Do you understand? He goes on talk about the lower number of gun deaths in the UK . ALEX JONES: I already said earlier that England had lower gun crime rate because you took all the guns. But you have hoards of people burning down cities and beating old women's brains out out everyday. They arrest people in England if they defend themselves, that's on record. My God, you have a total police state. Everybody is fleeing the country because -- you've had to flee, bud. Yeah, you fled here. Why don't you go back and face the charges for the hacking scandal?PIERS MORGAN: Answer this question. How many -- . JONES: Why did you get fired from the Daily Mirror for putting out fake stories? You're a hatchet man of the New World Order. You're a hatchet man! And I'm going to say this here, you think you're a tough guy? Have me back with a boxing ring and I'll wear red, white, and blue, and you'll wear your Jolly Roger.

"It was a dramatic night of football at the Emirates as Arsene Wenger's side contrived to give away a three goal lead and draw with Belgian side Anderlecht. Arsenal were cruising after 58 minutes thanks to Mikel Arteta, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but in the final 30 minutes crumbled and conceded three goals. Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper gives his verdict on how the players performed on Tuesday. Arsenal (4-2-3-1) Wojciech Szczesny - 6 . Sharp enough early on to save Arsenal from falling behind. Calum Chambers - 5 . Beaten by Kawaya for the first Anderlecht goal. Looked a weak link. Per Mertesacker - 5.5 . Steady early on - but terribly weak to allow Mitrovic the equalising header. Per Mertesacker (right) tackles . Nacho Monreal - 5.5 . Never 100 per cent certain and exposed when he gave penalty away. Kieran Gibbs - 6.6 . A quieter game, but dependable. Consistently the best in the back four. Mikel Arteta - 6 . Great penalty - but early on there were large gaps in front of the back four. Mikel Arteta opened scoring for Arsenal with a chipped penalty . Aaron Ramsey - 5.5 . Endeavour is there but still yet to reach the heights of last season. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7 . Excellent form. Great finish for his goal and always injecting pace and momentum. Alexis Sanchez - 8.5 . Superb. Involved in all three goals, never stops battling and a phenomenal finished. Alexis Sanchez shoots and scores Arsenal's second goal with a volley from 20 yards . Santi Cazorla - 6.5 . Busy and unerringly accurate. Rarely has a poor game. Danny Welbeck - 6 . Started brightly. Offers an outlet and troubles opponents, as he proved when he won his marginal penalty. Faded a little. Subs .

"Liverpool have stepped up their efforts to sign Adam Lallana by tabling an improved £25million offer for the Southampton midfielder. Brendan Rodgers is keen to bring the England international to Anfield and Liverpool showed their ambition shortly after the end of the Barclays Premier League season with a £20million opening bid. Lallana, who is wanted by a number of other Premier League clubs, has his heart set on a move to Liverpool but negotiations have proven difficult as Southampton owe 25 per cent of any fee they receive for the 26-year-old to Bournemouth.

The £25million Liverpool have tabled is a 'take it or leave it' and the decision now lies with Southampton over whether they accept and grant Lallana his wish or they bring an end to negotiations. Should the move collapse Liverpool, who remain on the trail of Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno, would turn their attentions to Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri, who they have lined-up as an alternative to Lallana.","Liverpool's first offer of £20m was rejected by St Mary's management .

"A Park Avenue-raised heroin addict who was last week charged with keeping high-powered explosives in her Greenwich Village apartment was already a suspect in a robbery. Morgan Gliedman, 27, was also already on probation for drug possession after a Washington Heights drug bust in February, when she was taken into police custody on Saturday where she gave birth to a daughter named Melody. On February 17, Gliedman met a man at Johnny's Bar in the Village and went to his Midtown apartment where she allegedly took off with a backpack containing his laptop, cellphone, wallet and credit cards, which she used to make purchases. Scroll down for video showing an HMTD explosion . Posh: Gliedman attended one of New York's premier prep schools and was raised on the exclusive Park Avenue . Gliedman hasn't yet been charged in the theft, according to The New York Post. Five days after the robbery, on February 22, she and her Harvard-graduate boyfriend, and father of her child, Aaron Greene were arrested for possession drugs and found with a .223-caliber rifle, The Post reported. The couple were spotted with another woman in a car that was parked at West 176th Street and Haven Avenue. Greene, 31, was seen injecting heroin while one of the women snorted the drug, a criminal complaint said. Police officers found empty heroin bags on the floor, marijuana and a digital scale with heroin residue in one of the women's handbags, according to The Post, and Greene admitted to having a gun. 'I have a... rifle in the trunk,' he told officers, according to the complaint. 'Junkies': Morgan Gliedman, 27, and Aaron Greene, 31, are both admitted heroin addicts - even though Gliedman was heavily pregnant when the explosives were found at their apartment, police say . Dangerous: The NYPD bomb squad was called in to remove the explosive that was discovered in the couple Greenwich Village apartment . He was sentenced to five months in . jail. Gliedman was due to complete pre-trial probation for drug . possession next week, but that case now could be reopened because of the . weekend's explosive find. Despite explosives and a cache of weapons being found at their apartment, police said Gliedman, the daughter of a top New . York doctor, and Greene are not home-grown terrorists. Greene's . father is the head of a top art restoration firm. He was also arrested . in the apartment on Saturday and is being held without bail on Rikers . Island. eighbors say the couple lived in squalor in their home in the pricy Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village. 'It looks like they’re junkies, well-to-do junkies, not terrorists,' a police source told the Daily Beast. Prominent parents: Gleidman's father is Dr Paul . Gleidman, the director of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Hospital's . Brooklyn division. Her mother is Susyn Schops Gliedman, a top New York . real estate agent . Inside the apartment, officers found . seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the . substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings. The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive. Police . also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting . shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a . replica of an M203 grenade launcher. Several disturbing items were seized, . including: 'The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and . Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself . Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby . traps and explosives. The New York Post reported . that Greene was a member of Occupy Wall Street, though an NYPD . spokesman told MailOnline that his connection to the group was still . being investigated. Evacuation: All of the residents of the couple's building had to be removed from the area before a police bomb disposal unit could clear out the explosive . Two spokesmen for the Occupy movement said they had never heard of Greene. Officers . were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and . Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to . their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported. The apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street, is near the apartment where two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970. Greene and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' according to the Daily Beast. Neighbors said Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a top New York real estate agent, visited her often at the Greenwich apartment. Big boom: YouTube video reveals that five grams of the explosive HMTD, less than was found in the New York apartment, can blow apart two bricks .

"A stone bridge reputed to be 3,000 years old was swept away as flooding continued to bring chaos to parts of Britain yesterday. Downpours over the Christmas break and through New Year’s Eve are likely to ensure 2012 was one of the wettest years on record. As celebrations began, more than an inch and a quarter of rain was dumped on to already saturated ground and more than 200 flood alerts and 90 flood warnings were in place. Scroll down for video . Now: The iconic clapper bridge is the latest UK landmark to be hit by of weeks of relentless rain. Martin Hesp and his lurcher, Monty, (pictured here) on what remains of Tarr Steps . The bridge as it looked before the floodwater caused it to collapse . The River Barle in Somerset swelled . so much that it destroyed the ‘Tarr Steps’ –  a Grade I listed ancient . monument formed of massive stones weighing up to two tons apiece. The . slabs, some measuring 8ft long, were swept away as downed trees crashed . into them. Local resident Martin Hesp said: ‘I have lived in the area for over 50 years and I have never seen anything like this before. ‘It must have been some mighty trees which were carried downstream and smashed through them.’ The bridge links the Somerset villages of Withypool and Dulverton. It was last damaged in floods in 1952 . when the stone slabs were washed up to 50ft downstream and had to be . recovered. Since then the slabs have been numbered to aid . reassembly. Gone: Two men look at the remains of the Tarr Steps clapper bridge which was washed away . Although the first recorded mention of the Tarr Steps was in the 14th century, some believe it could be far older . Millions are facing a difficult . return to work tomorrow after the Christmas break, with numerous roads . left potholed and damaged by the weather. The only good news is that . forecasters believe the first month of the new year will be considerably . drier – if colder – than November and December. The South West had been braced for . the worst of the flooding, but there were similar fears elsewhere too. Mobile flood barriers were set up in cities and towns including Oxford, . Worcester, Shrewsbury and Bewdley. Larger rivers such as the Thames, Severn and Wye are likely remain high for several days. Along Dorset’s Jurassic Coast, . sections of cliff threatened to slide towards the sea at the weekend, . threatening beach chalets and creating a risk for beach-goers and fossil . hunters. Weymouth coastguard Philip Chappell . said: ‘The amount of rain we’ve had recently is turning parts of the . cliff into a potentially dangerous porridge.’ There were fears that a woman whose . body was pulled from the sea at a ferry terminal in Southampton . yesterday had been a victim of the weather. Environment Agency flood risk manager . Katharine Evans said: ‘It is as important as ever to be prepared for . flooding, keep up to date with the latest warnings and, if you are at . risk, to move valuable items to safety.’ England has already suffered its wettest year since records began in 1910, with 43.1in falling between January 1 and Boxing Day. The Met Office said 1.8 inches of . rain on the last day of the year would set a new UK record – although . final confirmation is not expected until next week. After all the rain, however, the . start to the new year is expected to be relatively calm, with only light . winds and localised showers in the South. Met Office forecaster Dan Williams . said: ‘As of tomorrow, the weather will get nicer. There will be showers . around here and there, but because of high pressure building from the . South we can expect calmer, drier conditions from tomorrow across the . UK. 'It is sure to provide welcome respite from the unsettled weather we saw throughout December, and indeed the whole of 2012. ‘In January, the temperature will . initially be above average, before getting a little colder and moving . closer the average towards the middle of the month.’ Legend has it that the devil built the bridge at Tarr Steps and had rights over sunbathing on the stones. Anyone who tried to cross the bridge, it was said, did so at the risk that they would be killed by the devil, who swore an oath to crush anyone who passed from one side to the other. It is claimed that locals once sent a cat across the bridge to test the myth – and the animal was vaporised. Only after confrontation with the local parson is the devil supposed to have withdrawn the threat. The first recorded mention of the Tarr Steps was in the 14th century – but some experts believe the bridge could date back to 1000 BC. It is constructed of stone slabs supported on stone piers, which stick three feet out of the water when the river is at its normal level. The name ‘Tarr’ is thought to have derived from the Celtic word ‘tochar’ for causeway.

Together: The couple, pictured in New York in April 2011, have long been open with their friends . The news of Champion's coming out was first revealed in the pages of the New York Times, in an article on the wedding of gay MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts. Mr Champion and Mr Robierb were present at the event and were seen taking to the dancefloor together. 'We're getting married New Year's Eve in Miami,' Mr Champion told the Times.

"Most bank account holders have heard of card skimmers, the insidious devices that steal your details from inside a cash machine. Now, however, there is another danger to watch out for at the hole-in-the-wall - the 'cash trap'. The simple, claw-like implement sits inside the slot that dispenses notes and grabs hold of customers' money until the thief returns to collect the loot. Invisible crime: Claw-like cash trap devices, which are inserted into ATMs to grab cash before it can be dispensed to the customer . Rife: The simple contraptions inserted into cash-dispensing slots have been spotted in Lincolnshire and across Europe . The devices have been used at cash points across Britain, with 2,479 reported cases in the first half of 2012. Fraud losses through cash trapping and other ATM scams across the UK came to £29.3million last year, according to Financial Fraud Action UK, although this is said to be dropping since chip and pin was introduced in 2004. Such scams are already rife across Europe. Thieves stole more than a million euros from French cash machines this year using devices that prop open note-dispensing slots, according to security experts. Police have warned account holders to be vigilant, but many devices are impossible to spot. Some are designed to look like part of the . machine and attached to the front, and others - such as the claw - . are completely hidden inside the ATM. This can mean that customers remain . unaware of the problem and simply assume there is a fault with the ATM, . failing to report the crime. Jaws:  cash trapping device is shown removed from the machine. Police have warned customers to look out for anything unusual at ATMs . The European ATM Security Team advises customers to immediately report all incidents to the bank. In August, Lincolnshire Police issued a warning to cash machine users after fraudsters tampered with three machines in Spilsby and Louth, pocketing hundreds of pounds from one transaction. Officers . warned anyone who spots anything unusual on an ATM, finds a device or . notices part of the machine falling off to contact the police as soon . as possible. The tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated, varied and widely used. Here is how they have developed: . Spring traps: Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it. Cash traps: Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'. Jammers: An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction. Skimmers: Thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash. Transaction reversal fraud: Involves 'tricking' ATM into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the ATM to pay more than the balance available. Can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them. A spokesperson for the force said: . 'Unfortunately, there was insufficient forensic and CCTV evidence [in . Louth] to progress the investigation and no arrests were made. 'The Spilsby incidents related to ATMs possibly being tampered with and no actual thefts occurred. 'The banks don’t always notify police . in these cases if no crime has taken place and their own fraud . departments investigate the matter. 'ATM tampering is obviously a . nationwide issue and we work with the banks to raise awareness and . educate the public about how to protect themselves from fraud and what . things to be on the lookout for.' Most of the crimes apparently take place outside of normal banking hours. A spokesperson for EAST said: 'The criminals operate by cash being collected by a customer. As . far as a customer is concerned everything can be going fine with their . transaction and the receipt - if they get one - can say ""£20 taken out"", . but they've got no money. 'The . cash trap is normally placed across the front of the cash dispensing . slot, either with adhesive or a spring. The claw is one variant, which . is placed inside machine and is a little more sophisticated. 'The criminals make one transaction and insert the device while the slot is open. 'We . saw a significant increase in these attacks in 2011, with 15 European . countries reporting such crimes, and a surge in the second half of the . year. 'The success of . chip and pin seems to be driving criminals from high-tech card skimming . to low-tech techniques such as cash trapping. 'This can be combined with other ways of manipulating the ATM.' It is estimated that in the first six months of 2004, more than £40.5million was fraudulently taken from customers' accounts using card skimming in London and the South-East alone. In March 2005, Dover-based Kenneth Mennie had £1,500 stolen from his Lloyds TSB current account after his debit card was copied and used in Thailand. Four months later, five Romanians stole . up to £1.2m by sticking false fronts to ATMs across London to skim . unwitting customers' cards and film their PIN numbers being entered. A laptop found at the gang's safe house contained details of 1,236 bank cards. It is believed most of the cash was channelled to Romania in a 'fruitful and sophisticated fraud'. Helping themselves: Thieves stole more than a million Euros from French cash machines this year using a similar technique, pictured, in which cash-dispensing slots are propped open after normal transactions . Since the advent of chip and pin, . however, cash traps may be the most worrying trend, because they are . simple, cheap and spreading fast. Earlier . this year, industry experts reported on the danger of 'robbing by . radiowave' - in which thieves access 'contactless' cardholders' details . simply by walking past them in the street and activating a handheld machine. A spokesperson for Vocalink told . MailOnline they had seen a move back to more traditional methods of . fraud such as shoulder surfing since chip and pin came in. Cardholders who are given a . contactless card when their old one expires can unknowingly surrender . their details to a thief by simply walking past them in the street. The technology in the card, known as radio frequency identification (RFID), transmits bank details via its own radio signal, and is accepted in many High Street chains, including Co-op, Boots and Pret-a-Manger. Lucrative scam: A simple fork, pictured, can be placed inside the machine to hold it open after customers have left . It does away with the need for a . customer inputting their PIN when buying goods, and was designed to . reduce queues at the checkout. However, . a fraudster with a contactless cardreader can easily collect the . 16-digit credit card number, expiry date and  name – known as RFID . skimming – from anyone who walks past carrying one of the new cards. They . then have enough information to rack up huge bills at any internet . shopping site that does not demand the three-digit security code on the . back of the card. David . Maxwell, a former policeman and director of RFIDprotect, a firm which . specialises in protection against card fraud, said: ‘It has been a big . problem in America for a while and is getting to be a big problem over . here.’ Cards can be protected from RFID skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil or being kept in special foil-lined wallets.","Gadgets snatch money from inside dispenser before it is released .

"'The most perfect woman': Paul Daniels with his wife of 25 years, Debbie McGee . Magician Paul Daniels says men dominate his profession because they are ‘more creative’ than women. The 75-year-old, who started teaching himself tricks at the age of 11, blamed a female  obsession with fashion, saying this led to girls giving up toys at a younger age than boys, focusing instead on clothes. And he went further by saying that although there were some women in the industry, their  tricks were less inventive than their male counterparts. Daniels said: ‘There is a reason there are fewer female magicians – girls give up toys sooner than boys. Around the age of eight they want fashion items. ‘There are women who are starting to see it as a business, but they do tricks straight out of the box. Men are more creative.’ Daniels, who rose to fame with his long-running BBC programme, The Paul Daniels Magic Show, also  said there were fewer roles for older magicians. He said donning a wig for his programme of 15 years was ‘one of the smartest decisions I ever made’. Daniels added: ‘I was 32 and the industry was suddenly getting very young. I thought, “How am I going to survive this?” ’ Daniels, who now performs at a range of venues including casinos, theatres and village halls, described feeling an ‘enormous relief’ when his TV show ended in 1994. Successful: Paul Daniels, with Debbie McGee, rose to fame on The Paul Daniels Magic Show on the BBC . He joked about being ‘an international sex symbol’ because his work takes him around the world, and revealed: ‘Magic pays me very well. ‘People must think of me as quite famous because I get sent a lot of packages. ‘They are mostly from families of magicians who have died – they send boxes of tricks they don’t know what to do with. ‘I keep some in my shed and sell the rest on eBay.’ He added: ‘Comparing Dynamo or Derren Brown to me is like comparing Robbie Williams to Pavarotti. They’re both very nice guys, but my focus is comedy. I want to entertain, to make people laugh.’ Yet he admitted he was ‘not a social animal’, a trait he considers to be a hang-up from ‘being the small kid with a largish head and sticky-out ears’. And while he says his profession is a younger man’s game, the  magician said his personal life had bettered with age. He lives with his second wife, Debbie McGee, 54, to whom he has been married for 25 years. Long-lasting: Paul Daniels says that if something goes wrong in his 25-year marriage to Debbie, they both just shrug it off . Daniels, who famously claimed in 2000 to have bedded more than 300 women, told the Observer: ‘Sex can be great in your seventies – no Viagra needed – and it certainly beats fish and chips. But I don’t think that’s the love bit.’ He added: ‘The best thing I ever did in my life was marry Debbie McGee. ‘She really is the most perfect woman and we laugh a lot. When something goes wrong we just look at each other and shrug.’","Daniels says young girls' fashion obsession makes them less creative .

"Police yesterday abandoned their search of scrubland in the Portuguese holiday resort where Madeleine McCann disappeared seven years ago. The British team of specialists did not find any clues to her disappearance during the eight-day operation. But they said the multi-million-pound inquiry will soon move into a new phase after negotiations with the Portuguese authorities. Scroll down for video . Still no answers: Detectives investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance have finished an eight-day search near the Portuguese holiday camp where she vanished seven years ago - and found no evidence . 'English police are stupid!' Graffiti scrawled on a wall near the search overnight as locals turned on the Met . Search: British and Portuguese officers were seen carrying pickaxes and spades to three separate sites . Police used bolt cutters to access this home. They are investigating whether Madeleine was killed and buried . Senior officers said the searches were the ‘first phase’ of the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine, who was three when she went missing in Praia da Luz in May 2007, and more activity will ‘commence shortly’. This could include the arrest of a handful of suspects who detectives suspect may be able to cast fresh light on the notorious case. The announcement came just hours after graffiti was daubed in large orange letters on a brick wall opposite one of the search areas. Written in Portuguese, the misspelled message translated as: ‘Maddie’s parents killed her. English police are stupid!’ The attack was the latest sign of anger among locals at the high-profile police inquiry, which is taking place as the annual tourist season takes off. Business owners have been joking that the police operation is a new tourist attraction, with many visitors asking for directions to the latest search site. Heat: A member of Scotland Yard jumps over a wall during the search for missing Madeleine McCann . Operation: Portuguese judiciary police chief of investigation Luis Mota Carmo uses his mobile phone at the site . Painstaking: Police established a forensic tent and examined several dozen items of interest to them . DCI Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard (third left) led the search flanked by colleagues from Britain and Portugal . Operation: Scotland Yard's top officer DCI Andy Redwood. He has led the joint Portuguese-British operation, which started on June 2 . Over the past eight days, officers have undertaken the biggest search undertaken overseas by a team of British police. They have searched to the ‘highest possible standards’ an area of scrubland equal in size to around nine football pitches. This included checking water pipes, drainage channels and derelict buildings around the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz on the Algarve. Police also searched a horseshoe-shaped piece of waste ground that was specifically identified as an area of interest by the latest inquiry. A Met spokesman said 41 ‘ground anomalies’ – areas where the earth had been disturbed – were discovered by aerial surveys and ground-penetrating radar equipment. This morning Portuguese officers stood around the edge of the search area while British sniffer dogs went in . Site map: The first search area was a quarter of an hour's walk away from the holiday apartments at Praia da Luz. A Met Police spokesman refused to confirm the locations of the second and third searches today . Family's tense wait: Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, are being kept informed of developments . These sites, which included three outside the original area, were then painstakingly checked by search teams. The spokesman added: ‘At this time no evidence relating to Madeleine McCann has been identified. ‘However it has given us an essential understanding of the activity on – and people that have used – this piece of land. ‘This was the first phase of this major investigation, which has been agreed with the Portuguese following the four International Letters of Request submitted to date. More activity has been agreed and we expect that to commence shortly. ‘In addition, further requests are being compiled and will be submitted in due course.’ The Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance in 2011, codenamed Operation Grange. Senior officers stress that the operation in Portugal mirrors what would take place in Britain for a murder or high-risk missing person inquiry. They say there is still a ‘substantial amount of work’ to be done in the coming weeks and months. Hunt for Madeleine: British and Portuguese police searched a property near Praia da Luz in the Algarve today . Detectives from Britain and Portugal searched three areas on the edge of the Praia da Luz resort yesterday . Algarve search: British officers were seen digging into hard ground and using bolt cutters to get into a building . Police said the searches  covered ‘just the one hypothesis’ that Madeleine was killed and buried locally. There are many others. The dawn-to-dusk searches have involved teams of officers armed with pickaxes, spades and specialist search dogs. Accompanied by Portuguese officers, they examined three sites and removed several items for further analysis. One shopkeeper was sceptical over whether the searches would bring police any close to finding Madeleine. ‘People keep coming in asking what’s going on and where,’ he said. ‘It seems to be the new tourist attraction. ‘It is a beautiful resort and shouldn’t be spoiled by searches for a girl who disappeared a long time ago and will probably never be found.’ British police officers were pictured scouring the scrubland using poles in the second week of the new search, which was abandoned yesterday . The small area being searched has been taped off with police tape and is guarded by local armed officers . British and Portuguese detectives worked on the scrub site in tandem under this morning's blazing sun .

It is thought the monkey is a Japanese macaque, which are well suited to the cold, as the thickness of their coats increases as temperatures decrease. But the sight of monkeys in clothes is not a hit with everyone. Animal right campaigner group Peta said keeping a monkey as a pet was like 'like lighting a fuse and pretending that it won't go off.' A spokesman added: 'You'd think after a Connecticut woman made international news when her face was ripped off by her friend's ""pet"" chimpanzee that people would wake up to the fact that wild animals have no place in people's homes. 'In addition to being a danger to people, captive wild animals are denied everything that is natural and important to them – companionship for one, not to mention the opportunity to run, climb, hunt and establish their territory.'

"It's not often that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is seen laughing and joking but the Paris Saint-Germain striker looked absolutely delighted with his own waxwork at its unveiling at the Grevin Museum on Monday. In fact, as the real Zlatan posed and smiled merrily in his PSG kit, onlookers could be forgiven for thinking the waxwork was more lifelike than the man himself with its arms raised in celebration and a glaring stare. Ibrahimovic was so impressed with the model he uploaded a picture to Instagram alongside it with the caption 'I took the opportunity to take a selfie with myself at the Grevin Museum in Paris.

"In spite of the fact the birthrate has climbed, nappy sales have fallen - particularly expensive branded diapers . Sales of nappies have plummeted as cash-strapped new parents have slashed their spending on the newest member of the family, according to a new report yesterday. Despite the birthrate in Britain hitting a record level, the latest research shows that the demand for nappies has failed to enjoy an upsurge. But the greatest impact has been felt by the big brands which have seen hefty reductions in sales as families switch to cheaper own-label nappies from discount store chains and supermarkets. Trade magazine The Grocer reported . yesterday that the bottom has well and truly fallen out of Britain's . nappy market which is worth £473.8 million a year. In the past 12 months, value has slumped 3 per cent with volumes down 3.9per cent. Grocer . said: 'What baby boom? We may have seen a 23 per cent hike in births . over the past decade and the national birthrate may be at its highest . point since 1971, but that has not stopped the nappy market from having a . stinker.' The report says that Pampers, the UK's biggest nappy brand, has continued to lose value and volume sales despite its biggest rival, Huggies, making a shock exit from the UK market in October 2012. Savvy parents are rejecting big-name brands in favour of cheaper supermarket own-label nappies . Pampers has sold a staggering 76.3 million (4.1 per cent) fewer nappies year on year. A spokesman for brand owner Procter & Gamble told the magazine: 'As we said this time last year, we knew own-label would present strong competition and this has been the case.' But popular discount store chains have cashed in on the demand for cheaper products and the report shows that own-label figures are up an impressive 37.3 per cent on volumes up 44.5 per cent. Aldi says it had doubled sales of its own-label baby and toddler range this year, claiming a 15 per cent own-label share for nappies, which it claims puts it behind only Tesco and Asda. Popular discount store chains have cashed in on the demand for cheaper products and the report shows that own-label figures are up an impressive 37.3 per cent . Aldi also reports newborn nappy sales have risen 190 per cent in the past year helped by on-pack promotions, discount coupons in key parent and baby magazines and low prices. We're starting to see a switch in mindset with mums and how they make their purchasing decisions,' said an Aldi spokesman. 'The tough economic climate has forced many to look at alternatives. Once brands were best but they now realise there is no need to pay a premium price for a good quality product.' Fellow discounter Lidl has also been one of the most active store chains in new product development. 'We are experiencing a baby boom in the UK at the moment so this is the optimum time to be developing and expanding our range,' a spokesman said. Other industry observers say that savvy parents are increasingly switching to online retailers such as Amazon for their nappies.","Birthrate has hit record high but demand for nappies has decreased .

"The world's oldest known Holocaust survivor has died aged 110. Alice Herz-Sommer, who lived in London and was originally from Prague, survived two years in the Nazi camp in Terezin, or Theresienstadt, in Germany during the Second World War. Ms Herz-Sommer was a talented musician and an adept pianist and a film about her life is nominated for an Academy Award. Scroll down for video . Alice Herz-Sommer, the world's oldest known Holocaust survivor has died aged 110, her family have said . Ms Herz-Sommer,pictured with Caroline Stoessinger who compiled Herz-Sommers' memories in a book, A Century of Wisdom. Born in 1903 Prague to a family of Jewish intellectuals and musicians, Alice Herz-Sommer socialised with the likes of Kafka and Brod . She is said to have counted esteemed existentialist writer Franz Kafka among her family friends and, more recently, was the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary about her life. The Lady In Number 6: Music Saved My Life, a 38-minute film, is up for best short documentary at the Academy Awards to be handed out next weekend. Her grandson, Ariel Sommer, said tonight: 'Alice Sommer passed away peacefully this morning with her family by her bedside. 'Much has been written about her, but to those of us who knew her best, she was our dear 'Gigi'. 'She loved us, laughed with us, and cherished music with us. 'She was an inspiration and our world will be significantly poorer without her by our side. We mourn her loss and ask for privacy in this very difficult moment.' Ms Herz-Sommer's devotion to the piano and to her son sustained her through two years in the Nazi prison camp, and a film about her has been nominated for best short documentary at next week's Academy Awards. She died in a hospital Sunday morning after being admitted on Friday, daughter-in-law Genevieve Sommer said. Ms Herz-Sommer, who lived in London and was originally from Prague, had been confined in the camp in Terezin, or Theresienstadt, in Germany during the Second World War . The Lady In Number 6: Music Saved My Life, a 38-minute film, is up for best short documentary at the Academy Awards to be handed out next weekend . Ms Herz-Sommer's devotion to the piano and to her son sustained her through two years in the Nazi prison camp . 'We all came to believe that she would just never die,' said Frederic Bohbot, producer of the documentary 'The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life.' 'There was no question in my mind, ""would she ever see the Oscars.""' An accomplished pianist, Ms Herz-Sommer, her husband and her son were sent from Prague in 1943 to a concentration camp in the Czech city of Terezin — Theresienstadt in German — where inmates were allowed to stage concerts in which she frequently starred. An estimated 140,000 Jews were sent to Terezin and 33,430 died there. About 88,000 were moved on to Auschwitz and other death camps, where most of them were killed. Ms Herz-Sommer and her son, Stephan, were among fewer than 20,000 who were freed when the notorious camp was liberated by the Soviet army in May 1945. Yet she remembered herself as 'always laughing' during her time in Terezin, where the joy of making music kept them going. 'These concerts, the people are sitting there, old people, desolated and ill, and they came to the concerts and this music was for them our food. Music was our food. Through making music we were kept alive,' she once recalled. 'When we can play it cannot be so terrible.' Ms Herz-Sommer was born on November 26, 1903, in Prague, and started learning the piano from her sister at age 5 . Though she never learned where her mother died after being rounded up, and her husband died of typhus at Dachau, in her old age she expressed little bitterness. 'We are all the same,' she said. 'Good, and bad.' Ms Herz-Sommer was born on November 26, 1903, in Prague, and started learning the piano from her sister at age 5. As a girl, she met the author Franz Kafka, a friend of her brother-in-law, and delighted in the stories that he told. She also remembered Kafka saying, 'In this world to bring up children: in this world?' Alice married Leopold Sommer in 1931. Their son was born in 1937, two years before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia. 'This was especially for Jews a very, very hard time. I didn't mind, because I enjoyed to be a mother and I was full of enthusiasm about being a mother, so I didn't mind so much,' she said. Jews were allowed to shop for only half an hour in the afternoon, by which time the shops were empty. Most Jewish families were forced to leave their family apartments and were crammed into one apartment with other families, but her family was allowed to keep its home. An accomplished pianist, Ms Herz-Sommer, her husband and her son were sent from Prague in 1943 to a concentration camp in the Czech city of Terezin - Theresienstadt in German - where inmates were allowed to stage concerts in which she frequently starred . 'We were poor, and we knew that they will send us away, and we knew already in this time that it was our end,' she said. In 1942, her 73-year-old mother was transported to Terezin, then a few months later to Treblinka, an extermination camp. 'And I went with her of course till the last moment. This was the lowest point in my life. She was sent away. Till now I don't know where she was, till now I don't know when she died, nothing. 'When I went home from bringing her to this place I remember I had to stop in the middle of the street and I listened to a voice, an inner voice: ""Now, nobody can help you, not your husband, not your little child, not the doctor.""' From then on, she took refuge in the 24 Etudes of Frederic Chopin, a dauntingly difficult monument of the repertoire. She labored at them for up to eight hours a day. She recalled an awkward conversation on the night before her departure to the concentration camp with a Nazi who lived upstairs and called to say that he would miss her playing. She remembered him saying: 'I hope you will come back. What I want to tell you is that I admire you, your playing, hours and hours, the patience and the beauty of the music.' Other neighbours, she said, stopped by only to take whatever the family wasn't able to bring to the camp. 'So the Nazi was a human, the only human. The Nazi, he thanked me,' she said. The camp's artistic side was a blessing; young Stephan, then 6, was recruited to play a sparrow in an opera. Alice married Leopold Sommer in 1931. Their son was born in 1937, two years before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia . 'My boy was full of enthusiasm,' she recalled. 'I was so happy because I knew my little boy was happy there.' The opera was 'Brundibar,' a 40-minute piece for children composed by Hans Krasa, a Czech who was also imprisoned in the camp. It was first performed in Prague but got only one other performance before he was interned. 'Brundibar' became a showpiece for the camp, performed at least 55 times including once when Terezin, which had been extensively spruced up for the occasion, was inspected by a Red Cross delegation in June 1944. The opera featured in a 1944 propaganda film which shows more than 40 young performers filling the small stage during the finale. Herz-Sommer's life inspired two books: 'A Garden of Eden in Hell' (2006) by Melissa Mueller and Reinhard Piechocki, and 'A Century of Wisdom: Lessons from the Life of Alice Herz-Sommer, the World's Oldest Living Holocaust Survivor' (2012) by Caroline Stoessinger. In 1949, she left Czechoslovakia to join her twin sister Mizzi in Jerusalem. She taught at the Jerusalem Conservatory until 1986, when she moved to London. Her son, who changed his first name to Raphael after the war, made a career as a concert cellist. He died in 2001. Funeral arrangements weren't immediately available.

"Three days before the 1994 State of the Union Address, President Bill Clinton's advisers fretted about including a line promising that participants in the still-viable Hillarycare insurance overhaul would be allowed to keep their favored doctors and health care plans, a concern that would come back years later when President Barack Obama promised the same thing. The line, which made it into the final speech in a slightly different form – Clinton told Americans they would have 'the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor' – was the subject of controversy because his aides knew it was untrue. 'We have a line on p. 10 that says ""You'll pick the health plan and the doctor of your choice,""' an internal memo read. 'I know that it's just what people want to hear. But can we get away with it?' he asked. 'I am very worried about getting skewered for over-promising here on something we know full well we won't deliver.' The Clintons' first term in the White House was marred by the failure of 'Hillarycare,' an earlier proposed version of what would later become law as the Affordable Care Act . 'Over-promising': A 1994 memo released Friday shows a Clinton aide encouraging the president to drop from his State of the Union address a line promising Americans they could keep their health care plans and their doctors . In his 1994 State of the Union address, Bill Clinton promised Americans 'the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor' -- 13 years before Barack Obama made nearly identical pledges . The memo was part of more than 4,000 pages of documents released by the Bill Clinton Presdiential Library, and offers new insights into the development – and 'sale' to Congress – of the ill-fated Hillarycare program that represented a major public embarrassment for then-first lady Hillary Clinton. 'Isn’t the whole thrust of our health plan to steer people toward cheaper, HMO-style providers?' wrote the memo's author, identified only as Todd. 'It’s one thing to say we’ll preserve your option to pick the doctor of your choice (recognizing that this will cost more), it’s quite another to appear to promise the nation that everyone will get to pick the doctor of his or her choice,' he added. 'And that’s exactly what this line does.' Obama drew fire in 2013 for repeatedly promising that under the Affordable Care Act, now law, 'if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,' and 'if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.' But horror stories have emerged, marginalized by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats as 'false' and 'phony,' demonstrating that significant numbers of Americans have lost the breadth of medical choices they once had. PolitiFact, a project of the Tampa Bay Times, designated Obama's version of the Clinton-era promise as its 'Lie of the Year' in December. In 1994, however, President Clinton made the same pledge. 'This IS a tax, a hefty tax': Clinton adviser Ira Magaziner warned the boss that he could go down in history as the author of '$40 billion in new taxes' if Hillarycare wasn't spun deftly enough . Tip of the iceberg: Archivists at the Cliinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas has at least 78 million pages of paper files and 23 million emails from the 1993-2001 administration, and released fewer than 5,000 pages on Friday . No 'decrease in their premiums': Hillarycare crafters knew ahead of time that it would be impossible to give policyholders a price break even though government would be collecting an extra $40 billion from insurance companies . His wife had already reassured Republican members of Congress, in an effort to bring them on board with her signature law, that the White House's plan would not increase the cost of health care. 'One of the objectives that the President directed us to pursue from the very beginning was, how did we make this a financial benefit for the majority of Americans who are already insured?' she told GOP leaders on Capitol Hill in September 1993, just eight months after becoming first lady. 'There is no way we could good in conscience go to the American public and present a plan that would either [sic] alter their expectations about what the system looks like, while at the same time increasing their costs and perhaps not providing the kind of security that they need and they should be able to rely on.' Yet while the first lady was arm-twisting on Capitol Hill with promises that costs would come to heel, White House senior staffers were hoisting red flags. 'It is important to note that people and businesses will not see a decrease in their premiums, despite the compression of system costs,' two aides wrote to Clinton adviser Ira Magaziner, then the White House's health care policy quarterback. Many of the same issues that have made Obamacare a practical minefield, it turns out, came up 20 years ago. Good old days: Hillarycare was a serious but failed effort to redesign the U.S. health care system, years before the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal sucked all the oxygen out of Clinton's presidency . Leveraging heroes: Chris Jennings, a Hillary Clinton aide who now works in the Obama White House, acknowledged that it was important to get veterans on board in order to scare Republicans from voting 'no' on Hillarycare . The principal difference between Hillarycare and Obamacare was that the former relied on squeezing funds out of insurance companies, while the latter requires individuals and employers to buy their products. Magaziner candidly admitted in one strategy memo that 'this is a tax, a hefty tax, which will, it seems to us, provide at least 2/3 of the revenue for your access fund.' The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare's financial penalties on Americans who don't buy insurance were, too, 'taxes.' Another revelation came in an early memo from Clinton – and now Obama – adviser Chris Jennings. He wrote to the first lady just two months into her tenure that she would have to court the support of veterans for whatever health reform proposal she chose to undertake. 'One extraordinarily important political goal of any health reform proposal,' he advised in March 1993, 'is to design it in such a way that a vote against the Clinton health reform initiative is a vote against veterans.' Another adviser set out advice that Obama might have found helpful: 'It is important for us to avoid the perception tha twe will be placing all the burdens on businesses; along these lines, please try to avoid the word MANDATE.' The Clinton Library in Arkansas released more than 4,000 pages of documents from the 1993-2001 Bill Clinton White House, including a series of bombshell revelations. Hillarycare: . Technology: . Middle East: . Hillary's Image: . Doodles: . Doubleplusgood: Don't use the word 'mandate,' advisers counseled, so Americans would believe everyone was an equal stakeholder in the health care reform process .

"The latest in a string of delays and alterations to the Affordable Care Act – nearly 30 in all –has the federal government deciding to delay penalizing about 500,000 Americans who have what President Obama recently called 'substandard' and 'junk' health insurance plans. Penalties scheduled to hit as many as 1.5 million such Americans who have not yet seen cancellation notices from their insurers were set to kick in just before the November 2014 congressional election. But now that deadline has been pushed back until five weeks before the 2016 presidential contest, creating a potential headache for Hillary Rodham Clinton – Obama's former secretary of state and his party's presumptive nominee to succeed him. Republicans immediately mocked the move as cynically political and designed to protect vulnerable liberals in Congress, noting Obama's quest to avoid a Republican-majority U.S. Senate when the dust settles eight months from now. If you like your plan, you can keep it -- until I'm nearly retired -- Obama seems to be saying, in a mvoe that Republicans are blasting as nakedly political . Ballgame: All eyes are on the U.S. Senate elections in November, after which Mitch McConnell (C) could become the new majority leader -- and the unpopular Obamacare law could propel Republicans to victory . Democrats fear that Americans frustrated with an Obamacare system that defied the president's many campaign promises, particularly his oft-stated pledge to protect those who wanted to keep their medical insurance plans and their doctors, will take it out on liberal legislators who voted for the law nearly more than four years ago. But the most the White House can do is delay the onset of chronic health insurance pain, not prevent it: Clinton or another Democrat will have to carry the Affordable Care Act's baggage into the 2016 election. Republican leaders met the announcement of the latest gear-shifting in Obamacare's implementation on Wednesday with rhetorical catcalls and we-told-you-sos. 'This move is a cynical ploy that delays thousands of insurance policy cancellations until after the elections,' said Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, 'in the hopes that Americans won’t notice the spiking premiums and shrinking options they face under the president’s health care law.' 'Nothing, however,' Issa warned, 'can distract from the fact that the president blatantly broke his promise that ""if you like your plan you can keep your plan.""' House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia said in a statement that Democrats' worst fear is 'full implementation' of the Affordable Care Act. 'Time and again, the Obama Administration has shown its true colors by putting politics first and unilaterally delaying parts of the law to avoid political repercussions,' he sniped. 'Doesn't it say something that the authors of this legislation are worried that it's implemented before they face voters again?' Will she? Won't she? (Will she still want to?) Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, will have to carry Obamacare's baggage into a presidential contest if she runs . Health insurance policies that White House Press Secretary Jay Carney derided just months ago as 'substandard' will be acceptable until just before the 2016 presidential election . The net effect of Wednesday's announcement is that many Americans will be permitted to keep health insurance policies which, for a variety of reasons, don't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards. A senior White House staffer told CNBC that the number could reach 1.5 million . President Obama railed against those options throughout 2013, and administration figures have called them 'substandard' and 'junk insurance.' Explainer: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the latest sudden Obamacare policy shift represented a way for the government to ease the pain of transition . Those policyholders will be permitted to renew their plans through October 1, 2016, pushing their coverage well into 2017. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement that her agency's shifting policy would 'implement the health care law in a common-sense way by continuing to smooth the transition for consumers and stakeholders and fixing problems wherever the law provides flexibility.' 'This comprehensive guidance will help ensure that consumers, employers and insurers have the information they need to plan for next year,' she added, 'and make it easier for families to make decisions to access quality, affordable coverage.' The nuts and bolts of the regulatory walk-back are complicated. President Obama declared late in 2013 that Americans who wanted to keep their plans could do so, and Wednesday's move is an extension of that one. But by the time the president changed course last year, at least 5 million taxpayers had already received cancellation letters from insurance companies whose offerings didn't meet with Obamacare's strict minimum requirements. Not everyone can benefit from the White House's suddenly relaxed posture toward what will qualify as a 'compliant' insurance policy. State insurance commissioners, not the president, decide whether to allow insurers to continue offering plans from one year to the next. And the insurance companies are under no obligation to sell those plans in 2014. But to conservatives who smell the latest drops of blood in the water, the White House appears mired in a posture dedicated more to winning elections than to seeing Obamacare through. The move 'reeks of politics,' a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said. Gloves come off: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said the Obama administration's move on Wednesday 'reeks of politics' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declared it a 'desperate move to protect vulnerable Democrats in national elections later this year.' McConnell will likely become the Senate majority leader if Republicans gain six seats in November – and he survives his own tough election challenge from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. On the other side of the U.S. Capitol, House Republicans, still angry that the Obamacare law's 'individual mandate' tax remains in effect for the 2014 tax year, staged a protest vote on Wednesday. Twenty-seven Democrats joined them, passing a bill by a 250-160 margin that would delay those penalties for individual taxpayers. The measure faces certain death in the Democrat-controlled Senate.","Next deadline for 'substandard' health care plans to disappear has moved from just before the 2014 election to just before the 2016 election .
Republicans mocked the move as cynically political, noting President Obama's desire to maintain Democrats' control of the U.S. Senate in the fall .
Democrats fear an angry public facing new health insurance costs and burdens will turn out in force to send them packing on Election Day .

"For those trying to enroll through online health exchanges, help has long been advertised as just a phone call away. Yet the challenge in some states has been trying to get a call through at all, never mind the multiple transfers once contact has been made. Long wait times of an hour or more have been commonplace in some states, primarily those running their own health care exchanges. California, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada and Washington are among the states in which consumers and insurance agents have complained. Jacki Manley - pictured with husband David and two-year-old son Tyndale - has been trying to enroll in a Maryland health plan since December . One consequence is that people just give up because they are unable to wait indefinitely. 'If I had to use one word, I'd use ''frustrating'',' said Jacki Manley, a stay-at-home mom in the western Maryland town of Keedysville, who has been trying since mid-December to enroll in a health plan through that state's health exchange. With a child who is almost 3 and another who is 5 months, the 20 minutes she can spare on hold often have not been enough. She estimates she has reached someone at the Maryland call center three out of about a dozen times she has called, but then she gets passed between different people and cannot get definitive answers to her questions. 'It just seems like all the right connections aren't being made,' Manley said, adding that she believes she has successfully enrolled her children but is unsure whether she and her husband have been enrolled after more than two months of trying. Manley said she has given up calling. Now, she uses Facebook to try to get the help she needs. The telephone frustration is just one more obstacle consumers are facing as the March 31 deadline for open enrollment approaches. Technical glitches and software meltdowns on the federal and some state-run exchanges deterred many people from signing up after enrollments under the federal Affordable Care Act began in October. With many of those technical problems solved, enrollments across the country have been brisk since the start of the year. Yet even with 4 million signed up for policies through the exchanges, the Obama administration will be challenged to meet its own projection of 7 million enrollees by the deadline. Specialists help callers and potential customers find health insurance at a customer contact and call center for HealthSource RI. There have been delays and technical difficulties at centers around the country . Long wait times for consumer won't help. In California, an operational review of the state-run exchange's first three months showed consumers waiting 45 minutes to an hour for an employee to answer, and insurance agents have said they have waited hours to make human contact. The exchange's goal was to answer 80 percent of the calls within 30 seconds. 'We did not meet our standards,' said Yolanda Richardson, Covered California's chief deputy executive director. The most recent statistics, from the first week of February, show the average wait time for those dialing in to a California call center at about 47 minutes. Sherrie Larsen, a 49-year-old truck driver in Tacoma, Wash., said the first time she called the exchange, she was told after waiting an hour and 27 minutes that the computer system was down, and she would have to call back. She called the state insurance commissioner's office to complain, and said she didn't get a lot of help or understanding there. The next day, Larsen called the exchange again, and was told the wait time would be about 29 minutes. After more than an hour on the phone, she finally got the help she was seeking, but no apology or explanation. 'It's very, very, very frustrating,' Larsen said. In Nevada, Claudia Lamb complained publicly about spending more than 100 hours on the phone to a call center, then waiting by her phone for hours more for return calls that never came. Lamb and her husband first tried to apply in early October when the system went live, but she only received confirmation they had been insured on Feb. 12. That was 129 days after she first applied. Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee greets more than 250 new employees at a call center in Fresno, Calif., on Monday, Feb. 10, 2014. The new employees began training to help uninsured Californians navigate the health care exchange . 'I once waited three hours and 40 minutes to get through to a manager who cycled the problem back through to his subordinate,' Lamb testified about her experience with Nevada Health Link, the state's exchange. 'The subordinate's solution was to do another application.' Wait times for call centers on the federal marketplace that is running in 36 states have been much shorter to reach a customer service representative. The average wait time in October was just more than one minute, dropping to 38 seconds in November. It rose to about eight-and-a-half minutes in December, when more people were trying to get coverage for Jan. 1. The federal call centers have about 14,000 employees. Maryland's problems have been particularly embarrassing because officials there were quick to support President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Gov. Martin O'Malley, a term-limited Democrat who is weighing a White House bid, and Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who is running to succeed him, had hoped to make Maryland a national model for health care implementation. Instead, the state has had one of the rockiest rollouts of the 14 states operating their own exchanges, with the call center problems coming on top of constant problems with the online enrollment portal. For example, some Maryland residents early on were prompted erroneously on the exchange website to seek help by calling a telephone number that led callers to the owner of a pottery shop in Seattle. The disastrous rollout forced the previous director of the Maryland exchange to resign. Officials in some states, including Maryland, Nevada and California, have taken steps to address the long wait times. Nevada has boosted its call center staff from 50 to nearly 250, and wait times reportedly have been reduced significantly. California is adding 350 to 400 more call center employees by the end of March, while Maryland has tripled the number of call center employees from 120 to about 360 at the state's call center in Baltimore, said Carolyn Quattrocki, the interim director of Maryland's health exchange. Quattrocki said she is optimistic the boost in staff at Maryland's call center, expected to cost about $6 million, will be enough to handle the expected increase in activity as the enrollment deadline nears. She said wait times and abandonment rates have gone down since the middle of January. Covered California also created a dedicated phone line for insurance agents and counselors, increased the number of bilingual staffers and added an online chat feature to help take pressure off the phone lines. Exchange officials there said they were somewhat surprised by consumer behavior that exacerbated the long wait times. They designed the exchange so people could shop, compare, select a plan and be done with the process in one stop. Instead, they found that people often had questions after visiting the website and wanted to speak to someone by phone. They often called back two or three times before selecting an insurance plan, adding to the volume of calls coming into the service centers. Still, Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee said the exchange is not making excuses and is working hard to reduce wait times. 'We've heard their concerns,' Lee said. 'We've stepped up to say we're going to make it right.'","Complaints of hour-long waits in California, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada and Washington .

"Eoin Morgan took a big step towards accepting his days as a Test cricketer are over by paving the way for his return to the Indian Premier League. The England one-day captain’s decision to put his name forward for the IPL auction on February 17 in Bangalore is a realisation that he remains further away than ever from adding to his 16 Test appearances. This time last year Paul Downton, then the new managing director, persuaded Morgan to miss out on the Twenty20 riches in a clear indication that England wanted to give him another chance to prove he can thrive in the ultimate game. England captain Eoin Morgan has put his name forward for the IPL auction in February . Yet he failed to score enough first-class runs with Middlesex to stake a claim to face Sri Lanka and India last summer and seemingly realises that he is better off concentrating on the limited-overs formats that made his name. ‘My ambition is still to play Test cricket, absolutely, but given where I’m at at the moment I think the IPL is the best thing for me,’ said Morgan ahead of Friday’s winner takes all Tri-series match against India. Morgan, who will not miss any England one-day cricket while he is in India, has always said that he wants to revive a Test career that was derailed against Pakistan three years ago but has now had to scale down his ambitions. Morgan is England's ODI captain and says he still wants to play Test cricket but his chances have been 'scaled down' after not making the team in the summer . ‘The opportunity I gave myself in missing the IPL was the potential carrot at the end of the road,’ said the former Bangalore and Kolkata player. ‘I think there were three positions available in the Test team at the start of last summer but I didn’t manage to get any of them. So since then it’s been scaled down a bit.’ The immediate conclusion is that Morgan and Ravi Bopara, who will also join the auction, believe they have no chance of being picked for the three-Test tour of West Indies that follows swiftly on from the World Cup. That tour clashes with the IPL in its entirety meaning that no Test players will be able to even have a short stay in India, as has been possible previously. Morgan is preparing to lead England in their latest Tri-series game with India on Friday . It also raises major questions over the strength of the West Indies side that England will face in April as many of the Caribbean’s best players, at loggerheads with their own board, may decide to put Twenty20 money ahead of Test cricket. The ECB will have no qualms about Morgan throwing in his lot with the IPL this time because there is a growing acceptance that it is in England’s best interests for as many of their players as possible to experience the IPL and the Big Bash, which has been incredibly successful here this year. There is also so much cricket now, particularly this year, that the ECB realise it will become harder for players to feature in all formats and accept England will increasingly move towards different teams for different cricket. Jos Butler and Steven Finn were in the nets at the WACA ahead of the match with India . Morgan, as a new international captain, believes he will benefit from returning to a competition that includes many of the world’s best players but few from England because of fixture clashes and workloads. ‘It’s nice to have one ear to the ground both by playing in the Big Bash and potentially the IPL again,’ he said. ‘It’s very useful because cricket is changing so much that it’s good to have new, fresh ideas. ‘I think any England player who has the chance to play in these competitions should grab it with both hands. It’s a great experience and a huge opportunity to put yourself under pressure and bridge that gap between our domestic game at home and the international game.’ England bowler James Anderson  gets past Buttler during a game of touch rugby during training . James Taylor beats Anderson during a game of touch rugby  at the WACA . Rohit Sharma, who hit 264 on his own for India in a one-day game last year against Sri Lanka, had a fitness test at the WACA today on the hamstring injury that has kept him out of the Tri-series so far. And if he comes through it and plays in Friday’s game it will be a major boost to an India side who have looked weary and, frankly, uninterested in this tournament so far having already been in Australia for nearly four months. But England remain strong favourites to repeat their comprehensive defeat of India at the Gabba, particularly with the WACA pitch expected to provide its usual bounce. The winners play Australia in Sunday’s final.","England's ODI captian Eoin Morgan puts himself forward for the IPL .

"China has banned all imports of British cheese after its inspectors condemned hygiene standards at just one UK dairy. The ban, imposed three days ago, has sparked outrage and one MP has demanded ‘tit for tat’ retaliation against Chinese food imports. The cheese factory has not been identified but The Mail on Sunday has learned it does not even export cheese to China. Ban: China has banned all imports of British cheese after its inspectors condemned hygiene standards at just one UK dairy . There is no evidence the factory broke any British regulations and last night George Eustice, Farming Minister, said China’s ban was ‘disappointing’. He said: 'British cheese is the best in the world and produced to the highest safety and quality standards so it is disappointing that China have put a temporary block on cheese imports. 'Food inspectors will now visit all factories exporting cheese to China to demonstrate their high standards so these restrictions can be lifted as soon as possible.' Andrew Percy, Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole, who is secretary of the All Party Parliamentary Cheese Group, said: ‘We have some of the highest food production standards in the world as well as the world’s finest cheeses. ‘It seems to me this is a complete over-reaction and a disproportionate response especially as the plant involved does not even export cheese to China. ‘This matter needs to be resolved quickly and if it is not we should look at the possibility of some retaliatory action.’ Probe: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has asked officials to discover what went wrong . He added: ‘Attacking the British cheese industry is like us attacking the Chinese noodle industry and on the basis of just one visit to a  British dairy producer I think  it’s offensive.’ Chinese inspectors were in Britain in March and asked to visit a cheese factory. This was arranged by officials at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and industry body Dairy UK, which assumed it was a general visit. But on arrival at the plant, the Chinese conducted a full-blown audit and then suspended all UK cheese imports from May 1. The Chinese inspection report has not been published, but DairyCo, which works on behalf of Britain’s dairy farmers, has said the Chinese were concerned about maintenance of equipment, air sanitation, temperatures of raw milk during transportation and chemical storage. Government and industry sources insist the issues were minor and posed no threat to public health. But the ban will remain until the eight UK plants that export cheese to China have been checked for compliance. Environmental health officers are now inspecting these dairies on behalf of the Food Standards Agency in the hope of persuading China to lift the ban. The watchdog has also asked officers to visit the plant that sparked the cheese ban to ensure any shortcomings are addressed. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who has visited China twice in the past 18 months  to drum up new exports for food and drink companies, has  asked officials to discover what went wrong. A Whitehall source said: ‘Everything is being gone through with a fine-tooth comb to ensure it doesn’t happen again.’ Disappointed: There is no evidence the factory broke any British regulations and last night George Eustice, Farming Minister, said China's ban was 'disappointing' What is particularly galling for Britain is that Irish factories inspected by the Chinese in April have been approved to export cheese. Farming and industry figures fear the Irish are now better placed to win new Chinese orders. While the Chinese market is tiny, the ban has coincided with a sharp increase in demand this year. Export figures for January and February alone are already valued at £93,003. The Chinese government bodies responsible for the ban – the State Administration of Quality Supervision and the National Certification and Accreditation Administration Committee – did not respond to requests for comment from The Mail on Sunday yesterday.","Farming Minister George Eustice said China’s ban was 'disappointing'

A stock image of a giant panda is pictured . Giant panda, Ai Hin, showed signs of being pregnant last month, according to reports by state news agency Xinhua. But experts at the centre in the south western province of Sichuan, think she experienced a phantom pregnancy. Ai Hin’s ‘behaviours and physiological indexes returned to normal’ ahead of her TV debut, they said. It is standard practice at the breeding centre to take extra care of expectant giant pandas, as every cub is so important to preserving the highly threatened species. It is standard practice at the breeding centre to take extra care of expectant giant pandas, as every cub is so important to preserving the endangered species. Here, tiny cubs are shown off at the centre's 'crib' Ahead of the first  TV broadcast of giant panda birth,experts at the centre (marked on the map with A) in the south western province of Sichuan, think Ai Hin experienced a phantom pregnancy . Mothers-to-be are housed in air-conditioned single rooms and receive 24-hour care. It is thought that the intelligent animals know their care improves when they are expecting. Wu Kongju, an expert at the centre told Xinhua: ‘They also receive more buns, fruits and bamboo, so some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life.’ Some of the bears continue to display pregnant behaviour after noticing their change of treatment and experts say that it is common for endangered animals to have phantom pregnancies. Experts were led to believe that Ai Hin was pregnant as she became less mobile and had less of an appetite. They also noticed a surge in hormones at first – before realising the pregnancy wasn’t real, Gulf News reported. Breeding centres such as Chengdu are needed to stop giant pandas teetering on the edge of extinction. The animals’ natural habitat in the mountains has become more built-up and the bears have a low reproductive rate, making their survival perilous. Female giant pandas reach maturity at between four and eight years old and only ovulate once a year in the spring. A short period of two to three days is the only time they can conceive and while a panda often gives birth to twins, only one usually survives. Over a lifetime of around 35 years, female pandas typically only successfully raise five to eight cubs, so their slow breeding rate prevents the population from recovering quickly. There are just 1,600 pandas living in the wild in China, as well as some 300 kept in captivity. Breeding centres such as Chengdu are needed to stop giant pandas teetering on the edge of extinction.

"Ministers should not overrule the Bible by allowing same-sex marriage, the Archbishop of York has said. David Cameron would be acting like a ‘dictator’ and overruling the Bible if he legalises gay marriage, Dr John Sentamu has warned. He told the prime minister that he will face a rebellion if he pushes ahead with plans to allow fully-fledged gay marriages. Archbishop of York John Sentamu says David Cameron would be like a 'dictator' if he legalises gay marriage . Marriage is set in history and the government cannot change it overnight, the second most senior cleric in the Church of England added. The Archbishop believes marriage must remain a union between a man and a woman. Dr Sentamu said: ‘I don’t think it is the role of the state to define what marriage is. It is set in tradition and history and you can’t just (change it) overnight, no matter how powerful you are. ‘We’ve seen dictators do it in different contexts and I don’t want to redefine very clear social structures that have been in existence for a long time and then overnight the state believes it could go in a particular way. ‘It’s almost like somebody telling you overnight that the Church, whose job is to worship God, (will become) an arm of the Armed Forces. They must take arms and fight. You’re completely changing tradition.' Dr Sentamu, who is in Jamaica to mark . its 50 years of independence, also said that the Church’s leadership . needs to do more to avoid its leadership being solely white and middle . class (see below). Dr John Sentamu pictured in Jamaica earlier this week. The archbishop believes marriage is set in history and cannot be quickly changed by the government . The Government will open a consultation on its marriage reform bill in March, but the Church of England has already warned that same-sex couples will be able to have church weddings if David Cameron goes ahead with the plans. The Church’s lawyers last month said that weddings will have to be offered to same-sex couples under any scheme to open the full privileges and title of marriage to gays and lesbians. Dr Sentamu said the bishops in the House of Lords did not try to stop Labour introducing civil partnerships in 2004. He added the Church was also content with last year’s move to allow civil partnership ceremonies in places of worship, as long as it is voluntary. But Dr Sentamu said the Government would face a rebellion on any changes in legislation on gay civil marriage. ‘The rebellion is going to come not only from the bishops. You’re going to get it from across the benches and in the Commons,’ he said. ‘If you genuinely would like the registration of civil partnerships to happen in a more general way, most people will say they can see the drift. But if you begin to call those marriage, you’re trying to change the English language. The church did not object to the introduction of civil partnerships in 2004 which gave same-sex couples improved legal rights. The state can not redefine what marriage is, Dr Sentamu says . ‘That does not mean you diminish, condemn, criticise, patronise any same-sex relationships because that is not what the debate is about. ‘The Church has always stood out - Jesus actually was the odd man out. I’d rather stick with Jesus than be popular because it looks odd.’ Mr Cameron indicated his support for gay marriage in October, saying: . ‘Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don’t support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I’m a Conservative.’ The church needs better representation of black people, the archbishop argues . Liberal Democrat Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone has indicated that nothing would force churches that disapprove of gay relationships to host same-sex ceremonies – but the CofE’s analysis suggests any attempt to bar legalised gay marriage from churches would fall at the first court challenge. Dr Sentamu has previously expressed concern over the ‘gay marriage’ of homosexual clergy after two reverends exchanged rings and vows at a service held in St Bartholomew the Great Church in the City of London in 2008 . In a joint statement with the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, he said: ‘Those clergy who disagree with the Church’s teaching are at liberty to seek to persuade others within the Church of the reasons why they believe, in the light of Scripture, tradition and reason that it should be changed. ‘But they are not at liberty simply to disregard it.’ Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, co-ordinator of the Equal Love campaign, said: ‘Archbishop Sentamu is a religious authoritarian who wants to impose his personal opposition to same-sex marriage on the rest of society. ‘It is not a Christian value to demand legal discrimination against gay couples and to treat them as inferior, second-class citizens - with fewer rights than everyone else. ‘The Government is proposing to legalise same-sex civil marriages in register offices. This will not affect churches. ‘The Archbishop has no valid grounds for objecting to civil legislation that will ensure marriage equality for all couples.’ The Church must do more to avoid its leadership being solely white and middle class, the Archbishop of York has said. Dr John Sentamu said white working class parishioners and black church-goers are poorly represented in the Anglican church. He said: ‘I used to chair the committee for minority ethnic Anglican concerns, and we seemed to be making some progress but that now seems to be going backwards. 'Where we have lost out is black people who had been realised Anglicans, who are now joining Pentecostal churches. That's a huge drain.’ He said white working-class parishioners were often relegated to making tea after services, and added: ‘The Church should be a sign of the kingdom of heaven and should be telling us what it will look like. ‘Heaven is not going to be full of just black people, just working-class people, just middle-class people, it's going to be, in the words of Desmond Tutu, a rainbow people of God in all its diversity.’ Addressing the accusation of ‘institutional racism’ in the Metropolitan Police that came out of the inquiry following the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, Dr Sentamu said he believes many organisations have made progress over the past decade. However, he said other institutions have avoided addressing the issue. ‘Those that did it, there is some kind of change. Football never did it, so I'm not surprised (by allegations of racism on the pitch). ‘I didn't hear that the media ever said let's put a mirror to ourselves and see whether there isn't this tendency of stereotyping, or being prejudiced, of advantaging people because they went to the same school.’ The Archbishop said he never encountered racism from fellow clergy in his rise through the ranks of the Church of England but said he did have to deal with racist parishioners. ‘When I was a vicar there was a lady who didn't want me to take her husband's funeral because I was black. 'I took one funeral and at the end a man said to me, 'Why did my father deserve to be buried by a black monkey?' We received letters with excrement in.’","Marriage is set in history and cannot be changed overnight. It should be between a man and a woman, Dr Sentamu says .

"NHS Health Trusts have spent more than £6million in taxpayers' money on equipment for obese patients since 2012, it has been claimed. The money spent by NHS Trusts went on items such as reinforced operation tables, super-sized beds and extra-large bedpans for patients weighing up to 70 stone. The £6million figure does not include any money spent on medication or care, and the total figure could be much higher as not all 245 NHS Trusts in Britain revealed their figures. Expensive: East Midlands Ambulance Service are believed to have spent nearly £200,000 for three new extra large vehicles with specialist lifting equipment and ramps (pictured) Sherwood Forest Hospital Trust in Nottinghamshire spent a total of £728,000 in 2012-13, according to the Sun. Breaking that figure down, the Trust spent a reported £52,000 on two operating tables for patients weighing up to 70 stone - making it the biggest spender on specialist equipment for obese patients. Last year the the people of the East Midlands were revealed to be the fattest in Britain with more hospital admissions for obesity-related illnesses than anywhere else in the country. The Nottinghamshire district of Bassetlaw had the most obesity-linked hospital admissions - an incredible 2,878 per 100,000 people, which works out at almost six times the national average. Cost: The money spent by NHS Trusts went on items such as reinforced operation tables, super-sized beds and extra-large bedpans for patients weighing up to 70 stone . The purchase of two reinforced tables suggests the number of obese patients in the area is so large that there is a risk of two extremely overweight patients coming in for an operation at the same time. The Trust also spent £76,000 on 29 extra large trolleys to transport obese patients. Other big spenders were Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospital Trust, who reportedly paid £1,000 for a fat suit so that members of staff could experience obesity, and Salisbury Trust who are said to have spent £5,000 on extra large gowns to cover overweight patients. Meanwhile East Midlands Ambulance Service are believed to have spent nearly £200,000 for three vehicles with specialist lifiting equipment and ramps, and Tameside Trust who paid £2,000 to widen the doors in their mortuary so obese patients could be accommodated.","Spending on equipment for obese patients increased in 2012 and 2013 .

"An incredulous North Carolina mother was banned from Facebook for 24-hours after the social media giant labeled a picture she uploaded of her two-year-old daughter, 'pornographic'. Photographer, Jill White said that she fell foul of Facebook's notoriously strict guidelines on posting nude children after they received a complaint about her innocent recreation of the famous 'Copperton girl' pose from the 1950s ad campaign. Mrs White's profile was suspended from the site for a day after she ignored a request to remove an unedited version of the photo that shows daughter Willa's bathing suit being pulled down on July 3. She replaced that picture with a version that has a smiley face 'emoji' over her backside instead, but that too was reported, but Facebook has said that this picture meets their terms and conditions. Offending picture: This is the photographer that Jill White is facing a lifetime ban from Facebook for. Her daughter Jill, (right) has her bathing suit bottoms in the image which received complaints on the social media giant . The original Coppertone advertisement showed a little girl's swimming costume being pulled down by a small dog, to expose her backside and Mrs White said she was at the beach recently near her Hickory home when she decided to recreate it. 'I posted the photo on Coppertone's Facebook,' White told WBTV. 'We thought it would be cute because of the old Coppertone ad and her tan line looked like that.' However, someone reported the picture to Facebook because they found the image of the little girl's bare backside offensive. Responding, Facebook sent her a notice asking her to either delete the picture, change her privacy settings so that the picture was not public or to ignore. Daughter and mother: Little Willa, (left) is inadvertently at the center of a storm created by Facebook and their terms of use after they effectively accused her mother, Jill, (right) of posting child pornography . Family: Jill with her husband and son and daughter Willa. The North Carolina photographer is facing a lifetime ban from Facebook after being accused of posting child pornography . Innocent: Willa standing on the beach with her friend in another picture taken by Jill White that day . 'Well I ignored it,' Mrs White said. 'No way did I think it would fit the criteria of nudity or pornography and if you read the terms of use in settings no where does it state that this would be considered either.' Facebook disagreed with this and banned White from the site for 24 hours. This is because according to their terms and conditions which all members sign up to, the social media giant can 'remove content that violates our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. 'If we determine you've posted something that violates our terms, you may receive a warning or become disabled, depending on how severe the violation is.' White told WBTV that she could not post the picture to her personal profile nor the fan page she had created for her photography firm. 'It is hard. With over 1 billion people using Facebook we have to put in place a set of universal guidelines that respect the views of a wide range of people. These policies are designed to ensure Facebook remains a  safe, secure and trusted environment for everyone on Facebook,' said a Facebook spokesman to MailOnline. Report: This is the message that Jill received from Facebook on July 3 that show that the picture was reported for pornography . Recreation: Jill White said that she was trying to pay homage to this famous advertisement for the Coppertone girl . Indeed, when her ban was lifted she altered the picture slightly to reflect sensitivities and reposted this new image. 'I got back on with another photo, this time a big Emoji face on the area of the butt crack,' she said. 'Now it is being reviewed again for nudity and pornography.' Facebook have said that they have examined this photograph and find it meets their terms and conditions. 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved,' the Terms of Service state. 'We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance.' Mrs White says neither of the photos she posted should be considered pornographic. 'I despise pornography and anything to do with it,” she said. “I would never ever post a pornographic photo. I am anti-porn.' White also told WBTV that the mother of the other little girl agreed for her to post the photo. 'Actually, she is the one that insisted,' Mrs White said. 'I am outraged about this.'","Professional photographer Jill White banned by Facebook for picture of her 2-year-old daughter, Willa .

"YouTube has dropped the strongest hint yet that it is planning to introduce subscriptions for video content. The plan was revealed in fragments of code in the latest update of the YouTube app - and comes after claims the Google-owned site could introduce the new paid-for model as early as this spring. The move is being viewed as an aggressive move by the world's most popular streaming video site to compete directly with traditional television services for viewers and advertisers. Get your credit cards ready... Fragments of code . in the latest YouTube's mobile app update offer the strongest hint yet . that the online streaming video service is set to introduce subscriptions for paid-for content . The code, unearthed by Android operating system fan blog Android Police, seems to describe a function in the app which tells users they can only subscribe to or unsubscribe from paid channels from their desktop or laptop computers. It reads: '<string name=""paid_channel_subscribe_message"">You can only subscribe to this paid channel on your computer.</string>' And: '<string name=""paid_channel_unsubscribe_message"">You can only unsubscribe from this paid channel on your computer.</string>' The discoveries have not yet been confirmed, but the messages apparently hidden within the code appear to back up reports last month that claimed YouTube would soon begin asking users to pay to access some content. The company has held talks with several video producers, asking them to submit applications to create for-pay specialist channels, according to AdAge. The first such channels could be available at Easter and YouTube is expected to charge between 60p ($1) and £3 ($5) a month. In addition to episodic content, . YouTube is also considering charging for content libraries and access to . live events, a la pay-per-view, as well as self-help or financial . advice shows. Benefit to content creators: YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar has talked about the . website's potential to provide second- or third-tier cable networks with . a more direct channel to their passionate viewers . YouTube, has been moving to add . professional-grade video programmes to the vast archive of . amateur-produced, home-shot videos that have made the site so popular. Twitter executives have vowed the introduction of a new advertising model will not lead to users seeing more adverts on the website - yet. Twitter users already sometimes see paid-for tweets among the posts from people, organisations and companies they have chosen to follow. But the microblogging site's new Ads API (application programming interface) will let advertisers better tailor their campaigns to relevant members of Twitter's 200million active users. Facebook launched similar technology in 2010, helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $3billion the following year. As speculation grows that Twitter will follow Facebook with a stock market float, it seems the company's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential. Twitter product manager April Underwood told the Financial Times there would be 'no direct impact on the user experience', merely that the service's users should see 'more relevant and better ads'. She did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown, but insisted the company took users' experience 'really seriously'. Currently all content is available to consumers for free and is supported by advertising that appears alongside the videos. YouTube has hinted in the past that it was considering offering subscription-based paid content. At a media conference last year, CEO Salar Kamangar talked about the potential to poach second- or third-tier networks having trouble building big enough audiences on cable to command subscription fees from distributors. Internet distribution, the thinking goes, would give some of these networks a more direct line to their passionate base with lower costs. 'If we have a subscription model, then absolutely that's something that becomes possible,' said Mr Kamangar. 'We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models,' a Google spokesman said, in a statement. 'The important thing is that, regardless of the model, our creators succeed on the platform. 'There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we're looking at that.' YouTube is treating paid subscriptions as an experiment, much like video rentals when it began in 2010. The initial group of channels will be small, estimated at about 25 at the outset.","Find backs up speculation that YouTube plans paid-for channels by spring .

"Teenage sweethearts have finally been reunited with their daughter 46 years after they were forced to give her up for adoption. Inge Dart was just 17 when she fell pregnant by her boyfriend Jeremy Owen, who is the nephew of celebrated First World War poet Wilfred Owen. It was 1968 and they were living in British colonial settlements in Africa at the time. When Inge's mother discovered what had happened, she hit the roof. Back together: Chantal and her birth mother, Inge, have been reunited decades after she was forced to have her adopted as a baby . 'She . called me a whore and a prostitute and all sorts of names like that,' Inge recalls on tonight's episode of Long Lost Family. 'Her edict was that I was to go to England and ""serve out my term"" and then . the baby was to be adopted.' Inge, now 66 and living in Dorset, said her mother was a domineering force in her life and she never dared to disobey her. 'It was her terms or nothing, as a child or teenager, I would not question any decision she made,' she said. As a result, Inge was sent to live with a couple in Surrey while she was pregnant, where Jeremy, who was now training to be a dentist in London, visited her once a week. Long overdue hug: Jeremy was devastated that he was never allowed to hold his daughter after she was born . Inge believes they would have made wonderful parents to their baby - if only they had been given the chance. But as soon as their daughter - who they named Sandra - was born, Inge's mother took control. Inge spent just 10 days in the company of her baby, on one of which, Jeremy was allowed to visit. 'He took one look at her and cried. He . looked at me and it was perfect,' she remembers. 'Then my mother arrived and said ""are you . ready to go?"" she drove us to a foster home.' Jeremy, now living in Australia, recalls he wasn't even able to give his daughter a hug. 'The staff told me I wasn't to even . consider holding the child as it might affect the bonding of the child to . her new parents,' he said. The teenagers' relationship failed to withstand the ordeal and not long after they had to give their baby away, they split up. Tear-jerking scenes: Presenters Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell help reunite the family . 'We realised mother's dominance had won. I did what I was told and not what I wanted to do,' Inge said. Since then, she's had to live with the heartache of losing her baby and always wondered what happened to her and if she was happy. Inge went on to marry and have two more children but she said she never forgot her first born. 'I have spent 46 years without . peace, if I could find my daughter, just to know she's had the life I . would have wished for, then I'll find that peace,' she said. Her wish was finally granted by ITV show Long Lost Family, who tracked their daughter down. Chantal was amazed to discover she is related to war poet Wilfred Owen through her birth father . She had been renamed Chantal by her adoptive parents and had moved to France, where she currently lives with two children and works as an air stewardess. Chantal said she was overcome with emotions when she heard her birth mother was trying to find her. 'It's a panic and a mixture of excitement, impatience and questions,' she said of how she was feeling. She revealed how she had a happy upbringing with her adoptive parents and wonderful siblings. On wanting to meet her birth parents, she said: 'It's not replacing, it's riching and adding.' She said she was glad to hear that Inge and Jeremy had once been in love and that she wasn't an unwanted product of a fling. Inge wrote Chantal a letter saying she couldn't wait to be reunited with her. 'You have always been in my heart . since the day you were born... I pray to god I am given the chance to . tell you how sorry I am and how much I have loved you all these years,' she wrote. Meanwhile, the ITV show's researchers also tracked down Jeremy, who has four other grown up children, and he was over joyed that he would finally get to meet his long lost daughter. He said: 'When I heard she wanted to see me, I realised I can finally give her . that hug, even though it's 46 years late.' He added: 'I always hoped this moment may come but I thought it never would. It's like a fairytale but a real one.'

"Two airplanes narrowly averted a midair crash near the Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston this week in what was the second such incident in as many months. A Singapore Airlines jumbo 777 flew within 200 feet vertically and about a half-mile horizontally - about eight football fields - of a Delta Air Lines A320 just before 7pm on Thursday. Air traffic controllers caught the error and corrected the airplanes courses before they got any closer. A Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft takes off from Changi airport in Singapore in 2011. A similar passenger plane nearly collided with another aircraft on Thursday in the skies over Houston . A Delta Air Lines Airbus A320, as seen here at Denver International Airport in 2010, was the plane that nearly collided with the Singapore Air 777. The incident was the second in as many months near the airport . The incident took place about 10 miles northeast of the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration, which requires aircraft to remain separated at least a half-mile vertically and three miles horizontally, is investigating the incident, the Houston Chronicle reported. 'An air traffic controller noticed the deviation and issued traffic . alerts and instructions to the pilots of both aircraft,' Lynn Lunsford of the FAA said on Saturday. 'The FAA is still . determining the closest proximity between the two flights, . A view of Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport at sunset. The near-miss occurred about 10 miles northeast of here . 'As a result of a preliminary analysis of the . event, the FAA has taken steps to ensure that all flight crews are aware . of the top altitudes for standard departure routes,' he added. The FAA in late May began investigating a similar incident that occurred in the skies above Houston in which two passenger jets came within a mile of each other earlier that month. An air traffic controller's mistake put one aircraft in the other's path. That near-miss, in which the planes were 0.87 miles apart horizontally and 400 feet vertically, occurred about two miles southeast of the airport and involved  United Airlines Flights 601 and 437 just after takeoff. The controller then issued instructions to separate the planes, officials said. Audio from the control tower confirms that controllers asked Flight 437 to turn right immediately, while they told Flight 601 to 'stop your turn, stop your climb, stop your turn', according to CNN.","A Singapore Airlines 777 flew within a half-mile horizontally from a Delta Air Lines A320, a sixth of the distance required by the FAA, before traffic controllers corrected their courses .
