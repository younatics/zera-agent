"(CNN) -- The shooting of 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai in Pakistan's Swat Valley has awakened the world to the dangers a resurgent Taliban poses to the rights and safety of girls and women, particularly those who are human rights activists like Malala. Here is a question for Tuesday's presidential debate: Will Malala's shooting prompt concrete steps to prevent more of such attacks, which potentially affect tens of thousands of girls and women --and could seal the fate of an entire region? Late last week, as the teenager lay hooked to a ventilator, her recovery uncertain, the Taliban pledged to come after her and her family again to punish her efforts to keep girls schools open. This is the mark of a committed foe of women's rights, impervious to how its brutality has outraged the people of Pakistan and the globe. The Taliban appears determined to extinguish women's freedom at any cost. Profile: Malala -- Global symbol, but still just a kid . The stakes are undeniable, yet the fate of women has been glaringly absent from nearly all high-profile discussions on the future of Afghanistan and the wider region. When NATO heads of state met last May in Chicago, it was not until protests were held by Amnesty International and other groups that women were even included as full members of the Afghan delegation. Once invited into the room, Afghan women reported that they were denied a significant role in summit deliberations or decisions. At last week's vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, there was extensive discussion of Afghanistan, but no mention of women. The issue has scarcely figured in President Obama's many statements and speeches about the region. As we approach the final debates of this campaign season, it is vital that the candidates answer the ""Malala question."" This is not an easy problem to solve. As the United States and its allies draw down, security responsibility is being transferred to Afghan government forces without sufficient steps or resources to protect civilians. Funding for development is tenuous, at best. Institutions are weak, and outside influence by key governments and other actors is limited. In Swat Valley, violence and harm to civilians is coming from a range of sources, including U.S. drones in parts of Pakistan. While their challenges differ, the rule of law in both Afghanistan and Swat Valley ranges from fragile to nonexistent. But women's rights in Afghanistan and Taliban-influenced areas of Pakistan must not be written off as a lost cause. Nor is it good enough to simply proclaim that something must be done. The Taliban's siege on women puts the impressive rhetorical and legal commitments to women's rights over the past few decades to perhaps its most visible and high-stakes test. It is not just about women. Communities, local economies, indeed the entire region suffers if women are kept from contributing. Before 9/11, the Taliban in Afghanistan was notorious worldwide for its iron, repressive rule toward the country's more than 17 million women. Women were barred from education, professions and even from leaving their homes without being accompanied by a man. Maternal mortality levels were among the world's highest. In the decade since the Taliban's overthrow in Afghanistan, modest but key strides have been made. Today, 3 million girls go to school, compared to virtually none under the Taliban. Women make up 20% of university graduates, and their numbers are growing. Maternal mortality and infant mortality have declined, and 10% of all prosecutors and judges are women, while there were none under the Taliban. Securing and advancing these gains if the Taliban grows in influence will be difficult. Members of the Afghan Women's Network, a women's rights consortium, express grave concern about the future, but also fierce determination not to see the clock rolled back. They have also joined Amnesty International in outlining a specific action plan of steps that must be taken in Afghanistan that may have relevance to Swat Valley, as well. World: Attack on Pakistani schoolgirl galvanizes anti-Taliban feeling . One of the most important of these is a guarantee of significant, secure financial support controlled by women's institutions and organizations in the region. Development funds and economic activities are being funneled through Afghan government ministries in an effort to build up those institutions. But unless local women's organizations, including those serving rural areas, have unimpeded access to steady funds, the work and influence of dozens of organizations working to promote women's education, health care, freedom from violence, economic opportunities and rights are in jeopardy. These groups and their leaders are the best bulwark against regression and deserve assured support. As internal deliberations and political maneuvering over the region's future unfold, local actors, the United Nations, outside partners, funders and the media must keep up the pressure to ensure that women are heard around the negotiating table and within government organs in the region. Women's rights must be codified in all negotiated instruments, and existing legal and constitutional guarantees strengthened and enforced. A wide range of governments and institutions globally will continue to hold sway over subjects like the handling of terrorist militants in the region. They need to use that influence to weigh in consistently on behalf of the region's girls and women. Critically, the number of women at all levels in national security and police forces must be increased through incentives, recruitment efforts and training to ensure that those serving in military and law enforcement roles do not suffer discrimination and can do their jobs. The U.S. presidential candidates should endorse and Congress should enact legislation focused on addressing the threat posed by the Taliban in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. This legislation should be tied to larger U.S. policies and appropriations in relation to Afghanistan and Swat Valley. A new law is the best way to ensure that sufficient funds are set aside and that women's rights and their status are rigorously tracked and reviewed. Having cited the betterment of women as one justification for its invasion of Afghanistan 11 years ago, the United States needs to show that it is not turning its back on the region's women. When Malala is well enough she should be the one to decide whether she wants such an effort dubbed ""Malala's law."" It would be an apt naming. Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . It took a point-blank assassination attempt of a 14-year old girl to get the world to pay attention to the threat to women from a resurgent Taliban. Unless the shooting of Malala is news heard round the world, prompting sustained action in government offices, legislatures, newsrooms, U.N. halls and public squares, her fate may foretell the lot of millions of other women and girls, and the destiny of an entire region. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Suzanne Nossel.","Suzanne Nossel: Shooting of 14-year-old girl shows resurgent, repressive Taliban .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal have signed Moroccan international striker Marouane Chamakh from Bordeaux on a free transfer. Chamakh, 26, joins the London club on a ""long-term contract,"" the English Premier League team said in a statement on its Web site. His contract with the French club had run out, allowing him to move without a transfer fee. Chamakh scored 14 goals as Bordeaux ended Lyon's seven-year reign as French champions in 2009 and helped the southwest France club reach the quarterfinals of Europe's Champions League this season. ""Chamakh is a striker of real quality and has all the attributes suited to come to England and do very well,"" said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. ""He is also a fighter, not only a good football player, but a fighter as well. He is very good in the air and also a good team player. He is a great addition to our squad."" Chamakh has scored 27 times in 53 appearances for Morroco and was part of the side which reached the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations final. ""My goal was to join Arsenal out of the all the English clubs because it is a club that makes me dream and I have been a fan since I was a child,"" said Chamakh. ""We have many great players at Arsenal and I will be giving everything to help the team win trophies next season."" Arsenal finished third in the Premier League last season, and have not won a trophy since the F.A. Cup in 2005. Club captain Cesc Fabregas has been strongly linked with a move to Spanish champions Barcelona.","Arsenal sign Marouane Chamakh from Bordeaux for an undisclosed fee .

"(CNN) -- French authorities said Wednesday that they will not authorize weekend demonstrations in Paris as protests over an anti-Muslim video started to fade worldwide. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told radio station RTL that French police forces have been reinforced should protesters organize. ""There is no reason to bring conflicts in our country that do not concern France,"" he said. Adding to the debate, the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Mohammed in an issue that hit newsstands Wednesday. Any depiction of Islam's prophet is considered blasphemy by many Muslims. Magazine director Stephane Charbonnier told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that his staff is trying ""to comment (on) the news in a satirical way."" French authorities stationed extra police protection outside the magazine's offices in advance of publication. The offices were attacked in November when the magazine was due to publish an issue with a cover appearing to make fun of Islamic law. ""In France, we always have the right to write and draw. And if some people are not happy with this, they can sue us, and we can defend ourselves. That's democracy,"" Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger said. ""You don't throw bombs, you discuss, you debate. But you don't act violently. We have to stand and resist pressure from extremism."" A demonstration took place Wednesday in Tyre, Lebanon, organized by Hezbollah, which the United States labels as a terrorist group. At a similar protest Monday in Beirut, thousands took part, waving Hezbollah flags and yelling, ""America is an enemy of God."" ""You most dignified of messengers, we are here to honor you, our prophet Mohammed,"" they chanted. The reaction to the video in neighboring Iraq ""has been quite muted"" compared with elsewhere in the region, the nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to Iraq said Wednesday. ""There have been demonstrations throughout the country, but they have been low-level, and there has been nothing that is specifically threatening,"" Robert Stephen Beecroft said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington. ""There have been statements highly critical of the film that is at issue and statements by some political leaders that they should examine their relationship with the United States because of this film. But on the whole, we get good cooperation,"" he said. Due to recent events, officials have taken an even closer look at security and are working with Iraqi officials to ensure that U.S. personnel are ""safe as can be on our terms,"" he said. ""Innocence of Muslims"" was an obscure Internet video until September 11, when rioters, seizing on it, breached the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Protesters also attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. ""The Innocence of Muslims"" mocks the Muslim Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. Washington has made it clear that it did not sanction the film, although it was produced in the United States. A week of protests have rippled from Morocco to Malaysia, spurring U.S. officials to increase security at diplomatic missions and demand other governments to take action. Libya has taken steps to arrest those responsible for last week's deadly consulate attack, bringing in dozens for questioning over the weekend, Libyan officials said. The exact number of arrests was unclear. One Libyan official said those arrested included suspects from Mali and Algeria as well as al Qaeda sympathizers. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that FBI agents had arrived in Tripoli. They had delayed entering the country a few days while the situation remained especially volatile. The United States is looking at security at all diplomatic posts and will augment it at specific locations if necessary, Clinton said. CNN's Susannah Palk, Salma Abdelaziz, Karen Smith, Virginia Nicolaidis, Josh Levs and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: At Hezbollah demonstration, people chant, ""America is an enemy of God""

"Boston (CNN) -- You might not consider baseball or basketball players to be your typical business travelers. But the realities of life for professional athletes, whose job requires them to spend months on the road each year, means they become every bit as travel hardened as the most experienced sales executive. Golf legend Gary Player claims to have racked up about 15 million miles during his career, while Major League Baseball teams play 162-games a season, traveling across the United States in the process. Bill Acree, director of team travel for baseball outfit the Atlanta Braves, says his team spends nearly a third of the year on the road, so they look for comfort. The team stays in luxury hotels, with good 24-hour room service, and privacy and security are major concerns. Sporting events are big business for the travel industry, with the U.S. Travel Association estimating they account for more than a quarter of the entire travel market -- worth about $182 billion a year in the United States alone. For the hotels that do play host to traveling sports clubs, although those teams might only comprise a relatively small percentage of a hotel's trade, their reliability makes them an important part of their business. Increasingly, hotels are pulling out all the stops to cater to the particular needs of their high-profile guests. See also: Gary Player, road warrior . That means many hotels boasting state-of-the-art gym equipment, to allow athletes to work out on the road. But it also means putting special procedures in place to give sports stars the most comfortable guest experience. Boston is a sports-mad city. Its teams -- including baseball's Red Sox, football's Patriots, basketball's Celtics and hockey's Bruins -- have won championships in every major American sport. Local hotels The Liberty and The Westin are no strangers to visiting sports stars. Mike Jorgensen, general manager of the Westin Copley Place, said about half of the baseball teams that come to town to play the Red Sox stay at his hotel. ""When you get into the summer months, we might be checking one baseball team out and checking another one right back in,"" he said. Acree said that typically, when the Braves check in, the hotel staff have each player's key packet laid out on a desk ready to go, so the entire team can be checked in a matter of minutes. Jorgensen explained: ""The key is to get them in and up as quickly as possible, so that the big stars ... aren't bothered by the autograph seekers and that sort of thing."" At The Liberty, general manager Rachel Moniz says her staff whisks athletes in via a secret entrance unknown to the general public. ""We have a private back entrance and no other hotel guests know about this,"" she said. ""We always have two elevator attendants, so both elevators are used exclusively for the professional sports teams that's coming in."" Moniz said that by bypassing the regular check-in in the lobby, her team can have the arriving athletes in their rooms in ""four minutes door to door."" Athletes have certain requirements that the average guest doesn't. Some need extra-long beds and, because they spend so much time on the road, some have complicated family arrangements, requiring tact in deciding which rooms to place them in. ""I would say that things can get a little complicated when families start to arrive, especially if somebody has multiple ex-wives, kids,"" said Moniz. ""You really get to understand a little bit better somebody's family dynamic, and how to handle that and where the connecting rooms should be and which floors they should be on."" Jorgensen said football teams in particular had special demands around food and drink. ""Football teams want to make sure we have on every floor Gatorade, Powerade, fruit,"" he said. ""You know football players eat a lot so we need to keep them with enough food all the time to keep them busy."" As for the best behaved athletes? Moniz and Jorgensen agree that hockey players are the most hassle-free guests.","Professional athletes are valued regular guests at luxury hotels .

"(CNN) -- They didn't really look like a bird, a plane or Superman, but two high-flying acrobats did look strikingly similar to presidential candidates Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama when they jumped from a plane to promote an upcoming parachute competition. The coordinated 12,000-foot parachute jump, complete with masks resembling the presidential candidates, was performed by Travis Fienhage and Andy Malchiodi, world and U.S. freefly champions from a California parachuting team. The duo's election season leap celebrates the coming 2012 U.S. Parachute Association's National Skydiving Championships, the world's largest skydiving competition, according to the USPA. Five hundred of the nation's top skydiving daredevils will compete in Eloy, Arizona, from October 25 through November 3. On tap for this year's competition: formation skydiving (four-, 10- and 16-person parachute jumping teams), artistic events (which include freeflying and freestyle competitions), freefall style and accuracy landing, canopy formation and vertical formation skydiving. For the U.S. parachute team, this will be its final chance to perfect its aerial acrobatic skills before heading to Dubai in November for the World Parachuting Championships.","Two high-flying acrobats jump in Romney and Obama masks .

"(CNN) -- Debutants Cape Verde will open the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations when they take on hosts South Africa in Johannesburg on 19 January. The island nation of just half a million inhabitants, who stunned Cameroon in the final round of qualifying, will also face Morocco and Angola in Group A at next year's tournament. The draw for Africa's premier sporting event took place on Wednesday in Durban, a city which will host a handful of Group A games. ""All the draws were tough and I think this is a fairly good draw for us,"" South Africa coach Gordon Igesund told the website of African football's ruling body CAF. Group D would appear to be the most evenly contested group at the finals, with Didier Drogba's Ivory Coast -- who have lost two of the last finals on a penalty shoot-out alone -- taking on Algeria, Tunisia and a Togo side that boasts Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. Read: African football seeks new era to end old problems . ""It's undeniably the most difficult group,"" said Ivory Coast's French coach Sabri Lamouchi, who rallied his side's chances nonetheless. ""Ivory Coast is the favorite. We were favorites before the draw, and still are after it. We will have to prove it on the field."" The Ivorians are the top ranked team on the continent in the eyes of world governing body Fifa while Algeria, who missed out on the 2012 finals despite appearing at the 2010 World Cup, lie just behind them. Meanwhile, Tunisia won the competition on home soil in 2004 while the Togolese are set to play at their first Nations Cup since withdrawing from the 2010 edition in Angola after two members of their delegation were killed in a terror attack in the state of Cabinda. Reigning African champions Zambia, who will be based in Nelspruit, must emerge from a Group C containing two-time winners Nigeria, Burkina Faso and an Ethiopian side making its first appearance in over three decades if they are to defend their trophy. The team nicknamed the Chipolopolo won this year's tournament, which was co-hosted by Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, and coach Herve Renard believes they can silence the doubters once again. ""We are confident. We are here to make history,"" he told cafonline.com. ""We did it in 2012. No one was able to say Zambia will win in 2012. We stayed a small team but managed to go very far."" Finally, Group B pits Ghana against Niger, Mali and a resurgent Democratic Republic of Congo, who are back at their first finals since 2006. Following their 2010 World Cup exploits, Ghana's Black Stars are widely seen as one of Africa's leading sides but they were beaten for third place at the 2012 finals by Mali, who stand above them in FIFA's world rankings.

"(CNN) -- A goal from Liverpool's forgotten man Stewart Downing helped Brendan Rodgers' side beat Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala in the Europa League and go top of Group A. The winger, who signed for a reputed $32 million back in 2011, grabbed only his fourth goal for the club to see off Anzhi, led by veteran Dutch coach Guus Hiddink. It could have been a more comfortable margin for Liverpool but Daniel Agger had a goal ruled out when he headed the ball out of Anzhi keeper Vladimir Gabulov's hands and fired home. The defender was yellow carded for his efforts. The Russian side, who boasted four time African Player of the Year Samuel Eto'o among their ranks, failed to threaten regularly. Victory represented perfect preparation for Liverpool as they head into one of their biggest games of the season, against Merseyside neighbors Everton on Sunday. ""Great credit to the players after that,"" Rodgers told match broadcaster ITV. ""I haven't even thought about the derby, with our squad it's one game at a time. ""We had good control of the game and when we had to dig deep they put their bodies on the line for us. ""Stewart Downing scored a brilliant goal. He is a wonderful technician off either foot. He has had a rough ride here, it's been a tough time but he is a good guy and an important member of our team and he got a good reception from the Kop."" The other game in Liverpool's group saw Young Boys beat Italian side Udinese 3-1 thanks to a hat-trick from Argentinean striker Raul Marcelo Bobadilla. Liverpool's fellow Premier League side Newcastle also won 1-0 as French winger Gabriel Obertan scored the only goal of the game against Belgian outfit Club Brugge in Group D. The other match saw French club Bordeaux draw 1-1 with Maritimo in Portugal. Slovenian minnows NK Maribor grabbed an impressive point against the third Premier League side in the competition -- Tottenham -- in Group J, Gylfi Sigurdsson saving Spurs' blushes by canceling out Robert Beric's opener. Italian club Lazio are top of the group from Maribor despite an injury time goal from Jose Toche rescuing a 1-1 draw for Greek outfit Panathinaikos.

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Police Department released surveillance video Thursday from a traffic incident a day earlier that led to Lindsay Lohan being charged with leaving the scene of an accident. But specifics about what exactly happened remained as unclear as the video itself. The black-and-white video, which covers less than 30 seconds, was shot by a private surveillance camera and obtained by police the night of the incident, according to NYPD Detective Marc Nell. Lohan was driving a Porsche Cayenne into the parking lot of the Dream Hotel off West 16th Street when she allegedly hit a pedestrian who is an employee of the restaurant next door, said Sgt. John Buthorn, a New York Police Department spokesman. LiLo: Why hasn't a certain Nickelodeon star gone to jail? The video shows a dark car with its headlights on passing through a group of pedestrians as it turns from the street into an entrance. As the car disappears into the entrance and out of the frame, a blurred figure is seen appearing to run after the car. Included with the surveillance video was a police description of the incident that does not directly state the pedestrian was ever struck by Lohan's vehicle. The description also clearly states the pedestrian remained standing and walking during the entire incident. Nell of the NYPD confirmed a Wednesday report that the alleged victim was treated at a hospital for a knee injury after the incident. The actress continued driving before parking her car and apparently leaving the scene shortly after midnight, Buthorn said. Police arrested her about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, and she was given a desk-appearance ticket, meaning she was not jailed nor did she have to post bail.. Earlier this year, Lohan's five-year supervised felony probation in California from two drunken driving incidents in 2007 was lifted. She remains on unsupervised probation for a misdemeanor shoplifting convictions last year. Lohan has been in court at least 19 times since May 2007. Buthorn said police do not suspect drugs or alcohol played a role in the latest incident. Although the surveillance description never cites Lohan ever striking the pedestrian, ""everything stands as is"" and the actress will still be required to appear in court, according to the police department. A representative for Lohan told CNN, ""As the facts of this situation come to light, it is going to be apparent there was no accident."" Lohan is scheduled to appear in court on October 23, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office. Officials: Lindsay Lohan a suspect in burglary, but no charges planned .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A former senior police official, whose attempt in February to seek asylum in a U.S. Consulate triggered the most serious political crisis in China in decades, has been charged with defection and bribe-taking, the authorities announced Wednesday. Prosecutors in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu also accused Wang Lijun of abusing his power and covering up a high-profile murder case, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Chengdu Intermediate People's Court has accepted the case and a trial date will be set later, Xinhua added. Of his four alleged offenses, bribe-taking -- based on the amount involved and the seriousness of the case -- could potentially lead to the death penalty. The Xinhua report did not specify how much money Wang was accused of taking as bribes but described it as a ""huge sum."" The conviction rate for criminal trials in China stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report quoted the Chinese Supreme People's Court as saying. Wang, 52, was a right-hand man of disgraced politician Bo Xilai, once considered among Communist royalty and a fast-rising star within the party destined for the highest office of the country. Wang headed the police department of Chongqing, a sprawling southwestern metropolis with more than 30 million residents, during most of the period when Bo was the local party chief from late 2007 to early this year. Wang's indictment quoted by Xinhua did not mention Bo but prosecutors alleged that the former police official ""illegally used technical surveillance measures."" Analysts say the accusation may reflect rumors that Wang had bugged other senior officials to benefit Bo politically. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . After being suddenly dismissed as police chief in early February, Wang spectacularly sought refuge for one day inside the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information against his boss. Media reports and online posts claimed Wang clashed with Bo after suggesting Bo's wife poisoned and killed Neil Heywood, a British businessman and Bo family friend, last November amid a financial dispute. Gu Kailai, Bo's wife, was convicted of murder last month and received a suspended death sentence. Four high-ranking police officers who once worked under Wang also were convicted of covering up the Heywood murder -- a crime Wang was also accused of in the indictment cited by Xinhua -- and received prison sentences ranging from five to 11 years. Another former top deputy of Wang was recently arrested and accused of taking bribes. As for Bo, the government announced in April that he was stripped of his leadership positions for ""serious breach of party discipline."" He has not been seen publicly since. Gu Kailai: China's 'Jackie Kennedy' Bo, 63, a charismatic albeit controversial politician, launched a ""smashing black, singing red"" campaign in Chongqing that promoted Communist ideology as zealously as it cracked down on organized crime. His economic programs, which included millions spent on social welfare, made him a popular leader in Chongqing. But analysts say his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform-oriented faction that dominated the current party leadership. Bo and Wang were known to have worked closely on Bo's signature crime-fighting program in 2009. In just 10 months, Chongqing police arrested almost 5,000 people and executed more than a dozen. At the height of campaign, Beijing-based lawyer Li Zhuang defended an alleged gang member and discovered police torture during interrogation. ""For eight days and eight nights, my client was repeatedly hung from the ceiling,"" Li recalled in an interview with CNN in late March. ""He eventually soiled himself. His interrogators ordered him to remove the feces on the floor with his bare hands and use his shorts to wipe it clean. Then they hung him up naked."" As he tried to expose the interrogators' crimes, Li said, he was detained, tortured and promptly sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison under the direct order of Wang for ""fabricating evidence and inciting witnesses."" ""Their barbaric kind of law enforcement or, rather, their trampling of the law was against everything a modern civilization stands for,"" he said. Since the fall of Wang and Bo, Li has devoted himself to exposing alleged police abuse of power during Bo's reign in Chongqing. He quickly shared the news of Wang's indictment with his 285,000 followers on his microblog when the story first broke. More: What will happen to Bo? Political observers have also said Wang, not Bo, ""is probably the most hated"" figure in the eyes of the Beijing leadership for going to the Americans. Wang was taken into custody once he left the consulate for entering the diplomatic post without authorization. Analysts say his gambit forced China to deal with the scandal with an unprecedented level of transparency, prodded along by social media. ""That's keeping them honest in a lot of places where they could be dishonest in the past,"" said Douglas Paal, a top China analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. Meanwhile, the Communist Party has painted Bo as an outlier who violated discipline. It has been ""very careful"" not to use his case to purge the party of most of his supporters. It is now rumored that the 18th Communist Party Congress, a meeting where a new generation of leaders is expected to be unveiled, will be held in the middle of next month. The current leadership under President Hu Jintao is trying to resolve the Bo affair before its once-in-a-decade power transition, according to Joseph Fewsmith, an international relations professor at Boston University and a longtime China watcher. ""There was a desire on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to get this case settled,"" he said. ""It's not yet, but it is out of the party and into the hands of criminal courts -- well before the 18th Party Congress.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Several Chinese cities have shown improvements with air quality information -- a politically-sensitive issue in China -- but improvements are still needed, according to a Beijing-based non-profit environmental group. The report by the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs assessed air quality monitoring in 113 cities across China. The cities with the most transparency in air quality data included Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing, with the most improved cities being Guangzhou, Nanjing and Nanning. Compared with the organization's last report based on 2010 data, Chinese cities have made significant progress, said Ma Jun, the founding director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. ""Some Chinese cities have moved forward,"" he said. ""Among all 113 cities, there is still a large number of them which are not making proper disclosure."" In January, Beijing started releasing information about air pollutants in finer detail by looking at the presence of smaller pollutants, PM2.5, which are particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers. The previous standard was PM10. Smaller particles are believed to pose major health risks including risks of premature death, heart and lung diseases, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Analysts blame the thick haze that regularly shrouds the country's cities on rapid urbanization and industrialization. Beijing, for instance, burned some 27 million tons of coal in 2010, according to state-run media. Despite efforts to limit the number cars with an auto-plate lottery, it's estimated that Beijing now has over 5 million cars, up from about 3.5 million in 2008. Pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city's population (17 million) and the rapid speed of its economic growth, experts say. Some cities need time to get new air quality monitoring machines and to train new staff to operate them, Ma said. The worst level of disclosure of city air quality data was in western China, he added. Western China is less industrialized than its eastern counterpart. But economic differences may not fully explain why some cities lag in releasing air quality data. ""We do notice that there are some other cities which are highly polluted, for example steel cities in the Shandong province. Their pollution level is very high, but they are not making much disclosure,"" he said. Chinese authorities have been accused of not properly assessing the extent of the problem, prompting U.S. diplomatic missions across China to provide air pollution information to the American community so that ""it can use to make better daily decisions regarding the safety of outdoor activities,"" according to U.S. Officials in June. The U.S. readings are widely viewed as a reliable alternative to the official index maintained by China's Environmental Protection Bureau. Derived from a monitoring station in each of the embassy grounds, they typically paint a starker portrait of air quality than official reports, often falling within ""unhealthy"" bands, as defined by a rating system developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But this independent monitoring has provoked an angry response in China. In June, a senior Chinese official demanded that foreign embassies stop issuing air pollution readings saying that embassies lacked legal authority to monitor the environment. Beijing has now added 35 new monitoring locations and ranks as the top city in monitoring for smaller pollutants, according to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs' report. By August 2012, over 55 cities and 192 places published PM 2.5 data, the report added. ""There have been progress significantly in a very short period of time -- thanks to the push made by extensive public participation,"" Ma said. Despite some progress, other Chinese cities have lagged behind. Twenty-nine cities, including Chongqing â€” China's biggest metropolis -- Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Shenyang, Jinan, Hefei, Changsha and Urumqi, did not publish any information.

According to the amusement park's website, the ride has 32 two-person gondolas attached to metal arms, which spread out once the riders gets to 301 feet. Passengers, who can dangle their legs, travel eight times in a circle for one minute. ""Due to the long airtime, riders will experience a spectacular sense of weightlessness,"" the website claims. KABC reported that when the ride broke nearly two weeks ago park crews manually lowered the gondolas over the course of a couple hours.

"London (CNN) -- Another day, another story about Prince Harry. The party-loving grandson of Queen Elizabeth II has been exposed again, this time naked, playing strip billiards flanked by an equally naked girl. But what makes this story interesting -- and not just gratuitous tittle-tattle -- is the initial reluctance of the British press to even report the story in print or on their online digital media. It seems patently absurd to me that millions around the world can view the photographs online, yet no British newspaper would touch them. The big question is why? When grainy photographs were first published on the net by TMZ and seen by millions, the palace were forced to confirm it was him in the photos after speculation about the identity. In doing so his PR team reminded media outlets in the UK that the pictures were taken in a hotel suite where the prince would have had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Naked Harry scandal a watershed moment for UK press . This was a sharp move, given that every editor in this land would know that Clause 3 of the Press Complaints Commission Editor's Code of Practice states: ""It is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent."" To publish in a UK tabloid then would be a clear breach. But the newspapers have been left impotent by this move. They have again been scooped by the digital media. This is a dangerous precedent and in my view tantamount to returning to the good old, bad old days of royal reporting when in 1936 American and European newspapers freely reported on the affair of King Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson while an establishment deal meant nothing was reported in the British newspapers. Censorship of that royal story helped create the hysteria around the abdication crisis, polarizing opinion and may even have led to an atmosphere where the king felt he was forced to choose between love and duty. More importantly, surely -- like then -- the British paying public has a right to know what their royal family is up to. But post-Leveson -- the inquiry established in the aftermath of the News International phone-hacking scandal first revealed after both Princes William and Harry's phones were targeted -- no editor seemed, initially at least, is prepared to risk the backlash. Amid all the media navel-gazing there seems to be a genuine fear that the press feels it is no longer drinking in ""The Last Chance Saloon"" but time has already been called. Embarrassing pics could harm a soldier's career several ways . But this latest naked Harry scandal is a watershed moment -- a moment when it is fair to ask: ""Who is wagging the dog?"" When I was a reporter on the tabloid Sun newspaper in 1991 old photos were circulated of Prince Andrew naked. Like Harry he was a playboy prince, dubbed ""Randy Andy"" by the tabloids. The then-Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie bought the pictures and simply ran them across a double page inside spread (with a crown jewel sticker to spare the prince's blushes) and waited for the reaction. The reaction was MPs huffed and puffed their outrage in parliament and sales of the newspaper went up. I understand as we go to publication that Fleet Street (as the national UK national newspapers are still collectively referred to) has woken up to the story. Picture desks were today busy negotiating for the pictures and new snaps in circulation. Even if they do publish it is clear that the online media is calling the shots -- forcing the papers to react when in the past it was always the newspapers that led. A tale of two brothers . In these times with newspaper sales figure nose-diving it is critical for them to decide are they leaders or followers. Restricted by their own rules it leaves them exposed, giving the impression that they are slow to react. The problem newspapers face is that a new generation want news now, unrestricted and immediate. If they do not want to lose touch with that generation of readers altogether they have to at least compete with social and new media. As for Prince Harry, I do have sympathy for him. He has been betrayed by somebody and caught with his guard down. He could argue that he could expect privacy in his own hotel room, but the truth is he should have known that Las Vegas is not a place where you can expect anything other than trouble -- especially if you are one of the world's most famous people. He has been let down before -- who can forget the Harry the Nazi photos, again taken on a phone by somebody in a private venue. He could blame his protection team, I really do not understand why the S014 officers did not ask the girls for their mobile phones on security grounds. But in truth the only one who has let any one down is Harry. How 'soldier prince' Harry tore up royal rule book . I know he is young, free and single -- but he is a prince with responsibilities. He is bright enough and should have learned from his mistakes. The shame is that he had turned the corner. He represented his grandmother admirably at the Olympics Closing Ceremony and on a recent tour this year to Jamaica. If the royal family is to be streamlined -- with Harry as one of the central public players -- he really has got to be more cautious about the company he keeps.","Prince Harry pictured naked, playing strip billiards flanked by an equally naked girl .

"H. W. Brands is the author of ""TR: The Last Romantic"" and the just-released ""Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt."" He teaches history at the University of Texas at Austin. Historian H.W. Brands says power as well as race was behind controversy over Booker T. Washington. AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- In his concession speech on Tuesday night, John McCain illustrated the historic significance of Barack Obama's election by noting that a little over a century ago the inclusion of another black man, Booker T. Washington, at a White House dinner provoked outrage in large parts of the country. McCain wasn't giving a history lecture, and he quickly moved on, but the tale is worth exploring, as it is both more complex and more instructive than McCain's brief remarks suggested. Washington was the one who initiated the acquaintance that led to his 1901 dinner with Theodore Roosevelt. Washington had built the Tuskegee Institute of Alabama into a political base that made him the most powerful black leader in the country. Invited to address the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1895, Washington offered white America a racial bargain: Blacks would cease agitating for immediate political and civil rights if whites would fund black educational and economic advancement. This ""Atlanta Compromise"" outraged black intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois, but it appealed to white leaders in the South and white philanthropists in the North -- and it marked Washington, the broker of Northern largesse and Southern cooperation, as one of the shrewdest politicians in the South. Washington spotted Roosevelt on the rise, and after Roosevelt became vice president, Washington invited him to Tuskegee, where he knew Roosevelt, the apostle of the strenuous life, would be entranced by the rigorous physical regimen the students pursued. Roosevelt was preparing to visit Tuskegee when the assassination of William McKinley elevated him to the presidency and threw his plans into turmoil. Roosevelt instead invited Washington to call at the White House whenever he was in town. Washington didn't have to be asked twice. Within weeks, he was in the capital and was invited to join the president for dinner on October 16. Roosevelt's ascension to the presidency made him that much more interesting to Washington. Yet no more interesting than Washington was to Roosevelt. The peculiar politics of the Republican Party gave Washington an importance among Republicans that belied the abnegations of the Atlanta Compromise. Discriminatory Jim Crow laws kept most blacks from voting in the South, but they didn't prevent the Southern states from sending delegations to the Republican national conventions every four years. These delegations could tip the balance in a tight contest, and Roosevelt -- who though president was profoundly unpopular among the Republican bosses -- expected the 1904 convention to be a tight contest. Roosevelt's invitation to Washington to dine at the White House had little to do with Washington's race per se, but everything to do with Washington's role as a political boss of Southern Republicans who happened to be black. Likewise, the outrage expressed by Southern editors and spokesmen over Roosevelt's alleged affront to the South, while couched in the language of race, was really about political power. ""White men of the South, how do you like it?"" fulminated the New Orleans Times-Democrat. ""White women of the South, how do you like it?"" The Richmond Times frothed over the implications of the honor Roosevelt had bestowed on Washington: ""It means that the president is willing that Negroes shall mingle freely with whites in the social circle -- that white women may receive attentions from negro men; it means that there is no racial reason in his opinion why whites and blacks may not marry and intermarry, why the Anglo-Saxon may not mix negro blood with his blood."" The vehemence of the Southern response gave the game away. Booker Washington had explicitly forsworn any claim to social equality, let alone the right for blacks to marry whites. What the Southern foamers, political conservatives to a man, feared was that Washington might help the dangerously progressive Roosevelt get elected in his own right. When he did precisely that -- Roosevelt fended off the conservatives at the 1904 convention and was returned to office overwhelmingly -- they foamed the more. The race question in America has often been about race, but it has equally often been about power. Not for 40 years, since the dismantling of the Jim Crow system, has the race of guests at the White House prompted anything other than idle curiosity. But until last Tuesday those African-Americans among the guests were precisely that: guests -- visitors who lacked the power that occupancy of the White House entails. Symbolism isn't unimportant, and the symbolism of a black man taking the oath of the president's office in January will certainly bring an outpouring of sentiment like that which greeted Obama's election. But behind the symbolism of race is the reality of power. Obama will wield power of an order Booker Washington appreciated in Roosevelt but never possessed for himself. A week or a month after the symbolism fades, the reality will remain. At that point, Obama's race won't matter nearly as much as his facility with power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.W. Brands.","H.W. Brands: Roosevelt-Washington White House dinner was controversial .
He says the the opposition was about power as well as about race .

"Al Bab, Syria (CNN) -- The small room in the back of the Monsours house is set up for two people -- two desks, two night stands, and two beds. Both beds have matching sheets and pillowcases adorned with Superman caricatures. Jihad Monsour, 13, slouches on the edge of one of them. He lightly wipes his eyes from under his thin frames and stares through the empty doorway. It is only him that sleeps in this room now. He used to share it with his older brother Ali -- a victim of Syria's violence. ""Everything reminds me of him,"" Jihad says. President Bashir Al-Assad's forces killed 17-year old Ali while he was driving his motorbike during the first day of the battle for Al Bab last month. About 120 people from Al Bab -- a city in the north of Syria not far from Aleppo -- have been killed since the beginning of the conflict. Some of them soldiers with the Free Syrian Army, others civilians. See a gallery from the fighting in Aleppo . In recent weeks, an increased number of citizens in Al Bab have died at the hands of government air strikes. Now the airstrikes are not only killing people originally from Al Bab, but also those displaced by violence in Homs and Hama who are seeking refuge in the city. Jihad is wearing a yellow collared shirt that his brother is seen sporting in a photo framed on a table across the room. Hanging from the bedroom walls are decorations from the boys' childhood -- Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh plastic cut-outs. The dresser on the other side of the room still holds all of Ali's old school books. He had been studying to become an engineer. Jihad strokes the sheets with his left hand and then grabs hold of Superman's foot to compose himself. ""I think of him when I play football, when I ride the motorbike around the city, or just when I am reading,"" he says. As the Mansours got together for the last day of Ramadan their thoughts were dominated by one day -- July 19, which this year was the start of the Muslim fasting period and the day Ali was killed. Ali was on his way to school for a tutoring session with a friend when the bullets hit him, one in the arm and one in the stomach. Propping Ali's body up on the back of the bike, the friend rushed him to the local hospital for treatment. But Ali's injuries were too severe. He was evacuated to a hospital in Kilis, Turkey; his father, Hassan Ali Monsour followed. ""I hoped that he would recover and I would take him home from the hospital walking and that he would be fine,"" Hassan says. ""I never thought that he would die."" Hassan sits against the bedroom wall on the ground, legs crossed under his white gallabaya. He peers up at the picture of his son that sits on the table beside him. ""He was a good boy,"" he says. The Free Syrian Army has carved out an enclave in Al Bab, but despite the withdrawal of government troops, citizens say they still fear for their lives. The fluidity of the fighting around Aleppo province makes the situation on the ground, and in the air, completely unpredictable. ""The government is killing innocent civilians randomly,"" Hassan says. Eight bombs dropped on Al Bab within 48 hours this week, killing at least four people, including one six-year-old girl, according to witnesses. Like many towns that surround violent hotspots such as Aleppo and Damascus, citizens have come together to honor the dead, sometimes showing up in thousands to remember a victim. Dozens of YouTube videos show citizens of Al Bab gathering in the thousands, organizing themselves in mass prayers for those who have died. Everyone in the neighborhood knew Ali, his brother says. His death was one of the first in the city and his funeral was attended by hundreds of people. Neighbors and family friends offered the Monsour family money and gifts after Ali's death, but they turned them all away. ""There are people now that need that money more than we do,"" Hassan says. According to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights over 17,000 people have been killed since the conflict began last year. As many as 11,800 civilians have died, Ali included. The youngest daughter of the Monsour family runs into the bedroom and stands next to her brother. She is three years old. Jihad pulls his sister close to him. She hides behind his leg, every so often peeking around to catch a glimpse of her father. ""She is waiting for him,"" Hassan says with a nod. ""She always asks when he will come home. I tell her: 'You will see him in paradise.'""","A family mourns for their son -- gunned down on the day Ramadan started .

"(CNN) -- It happened at Royal Ascot. Now it has happened again at York. Any doubts over whether Frankel, rated the best racehorse in the world, would prove himself the master of the 10 furlong distance, as he has over eight furlongs, were dispelled Wednesday. Frankel made one of the toughest fields he has ever faced look pedestrian, defeating Fahrr and St Nicholas Abbey by a widening seven lengths to win the Juddmonte International at the racecourse in the north of England and extend his unbeaten record to 13. Frankel certainly cannot be said to suffer from triskaidekaphobia, a fear of the number 13. The first of his victories came on Friday 13th in August 2010. That half-length victory over Nathaniel is the closest anyone has come to the great colt since. His biggest winning margin has been -- you guessed it -- 13 lengths. The annual York meeting had long been turned into a one-horse race ever since Frankel's trainer, Henry Cecil, targeted the Juddmonte for Frankel's debut over the one mile and a quarter (2,000m) trip. On Wednesday, fans lined every inch of rail from the parade ring to the starting gates to get a glimpse of the horse that may possibly represent the culmination of 300 years of selective breeding to create the ultimate equine athlete. Superstar swagger . With the swagger of a superstar, Frankel emerged from the saddling area to a sea of pink and green (his owner, Khalid Abdullah's racing colors). Accompanied into the parade ring by a phalanx of policemen, the great colt looked far more relaxed than either his trainer or his jockey, Tom Queally. The most interesting and compelling race of Frankel's career to date was given more piquancy by the presence of Cecil, who was returning to the racetrack for the first time in months following ongoing treatment for cancer. The Juddmonte International is something of a graveyard of champions; 11 out of 17 horses that have started as odds-on favorites here have been turned over. Most famous of these was Brigadier Gerard. In the summer of 1972, Brigadier Gerard swept aside all comers in the same insouciant manner that Frankel does today. But it was in this race 40 years ago that he suffered the only defeat of his career. In a massive upset, the 1972 Epsom Derby winner Roberto ran the race of his life to beat Brigadier Gerard by three lengths, smashing the course record in the process. Frankel, starting the race at 10-1 on, suffered no such upset. Despite losing a couple of lengths at the start, there were never any signs of panic from his jockey, a virtually motionless Queally. Tactical ploy . Rival trainer Aiden O'Brien was determined, as ever, to halt Frankel's seemingly inexorable progress toward perfection, making the task something of a tactical puzzle by his use of pacemakers to assist St Nicholas Abbey. But an unruffled Frankel was content to settle towards the back of the field for the early part of the race, and all that remained was for Queally to pull the pin in his customary fashion with two furlongs to go. Frankel duly galloped into uncharted territory and into the history books. Frankel has now surpassed the mark set by Rock of Gibraltar for consecutive Group One wins with eight. The view of Frankel receding into the distance is one that the likes of top jockeys Frankie Dettori and Joseph O'Brien are already familiar with. It is a sight that racing fans will have to accustom themselves to now that Frankel's career looks to be following its inevitable trajectory toward the breeding shed. With just one race left on his card -- the Qipco Champions Day at Royal Ascot in October -- the finest athlete to grace this sport is in the home stretch of his long gallop into immortality.","Frankel extends his winning run to 13 with victory at York .

"(CNN) -- Up to 30,000 people are expected to gather in Cheongpyeong, South Korea, on Saturday for the funeral of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the controversial founder of the Unification Church who died this month. The ceremony, at the church-built Cheongshim Peace World Center, will take place after nearly two weeks of mourning. During this period, an estimated 180,000 people visited the mortuary where his body has been put on display to pay their respects, church official Ryu In-yong told CNN. Prayers, singing, floral tributes and eulogies are expected as the remains of Moon arrive at the arena. After a two-hour ceremony, he will be laid to rest on Mount Cheonseong in the northern South Korean province of Gyeonggi -- known as the ""holy land"" of the church. The 92-year-old died on September 3 after complications related to pneumonia. He had been in intensive care in a Seoul hospital since August after he fell ill, church spokesman Ahn Ho-yeol told CNN at the time. Moon had been a high-profile international evangelist for decades, having said that Jesus Christ came to him in the 1930s and ""told him to finish (Jesus') mission,"" according to James Beverley, a professor at the Tyndale University College and Seminary in Toronto. See more religion news on CNN's Belief Blog . The Unification Church believes that Jesus was divine but that he is not God, a stance that puts it outside the bounds of traditional Christianity. Followers regard Moon as the messiah. His church officially started in the 1950s, with missionaries being dispatched around the world by the end of that decade. His was one of several religious movements that emerged after World War II and the Korean War in South Korea and Japan, drawing from ""a tremendous pool of people ... looking for answers as to why the world had turned (against them),"" said Virginia Commonwealth University professor David Bromley. Moon was imprisoned in North Korea during the Korean War before being freed by the allies, an experience that turned him ""virulently anti-communist,"" according to Eileen Barker, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Globally, the church's reach may have peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s, as hundreds of thousands joined the singular religious movement, Beverley said. Critics have said the controversial Moon led a cult, whose followers were colloquially known as Moonies. TIME: The life and times of Reverend Moon . In his role as church leader, Moon became famous for conducting mass weddings, including one in 1982 at New York City's Madison Square Garden and one in 1995 in South Korea uniting 360,000 couples. He also gained influence in other ways as well -- growing a massive, diverse business empire that included holdings in industries such as chemicals, arms manufacturing, mining and pharmaceuticals. Moon helped create news publications, universities, religious institutions and other groups. Some such organizations that Moon founded stress interfaith dialogue and peace, like the Universal Peace Federation, which advocates ""building a world of peace in which everyone can live in freedom, harmony, cooperation and prosperity."" But Moon also fell afoul of the law, serving a federal prison term in the United States for tax evasion. From 2003 to 2005, Britain's government also prohibited him from traveling to that country, according to a U.S. State Department report.","Ceremony in Cheongpyeong, South Korea, will take place Saturday .

"(CNN) -- There were many areas of agreement on past policies Monday night in the presidential debate. The problem for Mitt Romney was with the one major disagreement on future foreign policy. I've always taught my debate students that in any argument, whether at home, at the office, or in public debates, it's important to find areas of agreement. There are two reasons for this. The first is so that you build up your credibility for when you need it on more important issues. In a debate, if you've already agreed with your opponent on some topics, the audience is more likely to believe you when you finally disagree. And the second reason for agreement is that it lets you pick your battles. Explicitly agreeing with your opponent is a terrific and underused debating strategy that lets you succeed when arguing for bigger, more significant issues. Opinion: Obama in command; Romney plays it safe . It was 40 minutes into the foreign policy debate before I heard an area of disagreement on future foreign policy direction. The problem was that Romney had not actually built up his credibility by agreeing with President Obama on any specific future policies. It was painfully obvious. In failing to openly agree when possible, Romney lacked the credibility needed when that first big disagreement came. And when he finally did disagree? Best said by the Holy Grail Knight in the Indiana Jones movie: ""He chose -- poorly."" The question was posed to Romney on how he would pay for his proposed $2 trillion increase in military spending, and he flat out didn't answer it. He was busy finishing his previous answer. So by the time it was the president's turn, Obama actually said, ""You should have answered the question."" Obama then asserted that the United States spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined. That's a great attention grabber. By the time Romney finally answered, he simply said we needed a stronger military, and the Navy needs more ships because it has fewer ships than it did in 1916. But Obama countered with the most memorable line of the night. ""We also have fewer horses and bayonets."" Obama's debating point was that the nature of our military has changed. He continued by saying that the U.S. has things like submarines and aircraft carriers that should suffice, and reminded viewers that the nation needed to study what its threats are and put money into things like cybersecurity and space. Obama said that the military neither wants nor has asked for this extra $2 trillion. Opinion: Romney endorses Obama's national security policies . This was terrible for Romney for three reasons. First, it was the original area of real disagreement, and Romney couldn't afford to be bested. Second, no matter what he may actually know, Romney looked like a neophyte when it comes to military spending, as though he were repeating old Republican talking points. Viewers could be left unsure whether he knew what century this is. And finally, it's two freaking trillion dollars! They both talked about the budget deficit and the need to balance the budget, and over three debates, this -- $2 trillion on military spending -- was the biggest difference on offer. Axing Big Bird would net a President Romney next to nothing in savings, but adding $2 trillion to defense sounded excessive, especially if it's true that the U.S. already spends more than the next 10 countries combined. Point Obama. I pored over my notes. The candidates had some other differences on future policies, such as who could be a better BFF to Israel (arguably, with his relationships in Israel, Romney might be, but he showed no actual specifics on how his policies would differ from Obama's) and what represents the greatest threat to America (Obama said terrorism, with some China economic arguments, while Romney said a nuclear Iran; but each man failed in Monday night's debate to show why this difference was important). But the topic I couldn't forget was defense spending. Obama also had a theme in the debate, and he played it more often than the melody in Ravel's ""Bolero."" The president continually said that Romney sends mixed messages and that he's all over the map. Obama smartly tied this to specific comments from Romney's past (examples were Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Libya) and used Romney's own words against him. Opinion: Was Obama too relentless with Romney? Obama repeatedly chided him, saying that Romney needs to be clear in what he says and what he means, while reminding us that in a president, we need steady and thoughtful leadership. This was the president's best debate when referring to Romney's ever-changing positions, since he actually tied it to important foreign policy issues and the real challenge of being a commander in chief. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Candidates had many areas of agreement in third presidential debate .

"(CNN) -- A drought in Louisiana has lowered the Mississippi River, leaving its southern tip awash in saline from the Gulf of Mexico and prompting health officials in Plaquemines Parish to issue a drinking water advisory. ""The water's perfectly safe to drink,"" said Guy Laigast, director of the parish's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, in a telephone interview Wednesday. ""It's just got the elevated salt."" With the mighty Mississippi near its all-time low, the salty water has crept in as a wedge, he said. Because salty water is denser than fresh, it tends to collect at lower depths, he said. Watch dryness overtake U.S. But pipes that pull drinking water from the river tend to draw from those same depths, Laigast said. The logical fix would be simply to raise the pipes, but that would be tough to do. ""You're talking about large pipes that have been down there for years and years and years,"" he said. The wedge has been moving up the Mississippi since early this month, reaching mile marker 89 -- signifying that many miles from the river mouth -- by Wednesday, Laigast said. ""You can taste a little salt water content,"" he said. ""But it's nothing that's harmful."" Anyone on dialysis and/or low-sodium diets was urged to check with a health care provider about drinking parish water. Salt, of course, is sodium chloride. Neither sodium nor chloride is considered a known health threat, the parish said, citing EPA data. Chloride, considered a secondary contaminant, could affect drinking water's taste, smell and color. EPA's secondary maximum contaminant level for chloride is 250 mg/L. The maximum chloride detected in drinking water in the Port Sulphur area was 362 mg/L, it said. Sodium is classified neither as a primary nor secondary contaminant, but it can adversely affect people on low-sodium diets for health reasons, such as high-blood pressure or kidney disease, the EPA said. Sodium levels in the parish's drinking water ranged from 60 mg/L to 200 mg/L -- far exceeding the EPA recommendation of no more than 20 mg/L for people on very low sodium diets. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers started work Wednesday on an $8 million underwater levee -- positioned at mile marker 64, just below Belle Chasse -- to stop the wedge's progress, as it did with success during a similar drought 24 years ago. ""It's a sill,"" Laigast said. ""It (the salt water) runs into that levee just as if it was a dry wall."" Interactive map: Drought conditions . He predicted the effects of the sill will become apparent on the salinity of the water within the week. In addition to creating the sill, officials are planning to take 2.5 million gallons of fresh water from farther north in the river -- past mile marker 100 -- then carry it by barge southward ""and suck it into our water treatment facilities,"" Laigast said. The salt water in the river has had a benefit for some anglers: ""The redfish follow it up, so we're able to fish right in the Mississippi now instead of having to go to the gulf,"" he said. The drought's impact has had effects that extend beyond the river. It led the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday to designate four Louisiana parishes and seven contiguous parishes as natural disaster areas. Morehouse, Richland, Union and West Carroll parishes were declared primary natural disaster areas. The seven parishes named as contiguous disaster areas were: Caldwell, Claiborne, East Carroll, Franklin, Lincoln, Madison and Ouachita, according to the Louisiana Department of Agriculture & Forestry. According to the department, 63% of the nation's hay acreage and about 73% of cattle acreage are in drought areas, as are about 87% of U.S. corn and 85% of soybeans.

"New York (CNN) -- Rudy Giuliani committed a classic Washington gaffe on CNN's ""State of the Union"" this past Sunday -- he told the truth. When asked about his criticism of Mitt Romney back in 2008, Rudy explained that it was a campaign contrast influenced by ego, but admitted that at the time he was comparing ""my far superior record to his otherwise-decent record."" Surrogates aren't supposed to toot their own horn. They're supposed to loudly recite the party line. But Rudy is an independent-minded kind of guy and when asked a direct question, he answered. The reason that Rudy had a better record in office than Mitt is actually pretty simple -- he worked at it in New York City nonstop for eight years. In contrast, Mitt was MIA from Massachusetts much of the time when he was governor. Under Rudy's leadership in New York City, crime and welfare rolls were cut in half, ahead of national trends. As the quality of life improved, so did the local economy -- with businesses and families reversing a decades-long exodus. On the fiscal conservative front, Rudy excelled as well, cutting or eliminating 23 different taxes while reducing the rate of spending below the rate of inflation plus population. I'm biased here to the extent that I served as Rudy's chief speechwriter in City Hall and deputy policy director in his 2008 campaign. But as another esteemed New York political leader, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once said, ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts."" Rudy remains controversial, but his record by the numbers is not a matter of opinion -- it is a matter of fact. Mitt's record in Massachusetts is more limited because he was only in office for one term and halfway through that period he started laying the groundwork to run for president. Mitt is running on executive experience, but it is as a businessman and turnaround artist -- not as chief executive of Massachusetts, the only government leadership position he has ever held. There's no question Mitt accumulated an impressive record as the innovative founding executive at Bain Capital, and he deserves a lot of credit for turning around the Salt Lake City Olympics. But his record of accomplishment in government is much more limited and far less innovative. His CEO approach to dealing with the Democrat-dominated legislature fell flat. And after assuming the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association for the 2006 mid-term elections, he spent two-thirds of his time out of state. So it's not a surprise that he declined to run for re-election as governor; instead, he announced he would run for president in 2008. This is a straightforward recital of the facts -- a more detailed portrait of his time in Massachusetts can be found in the essential book ""The Real Romney,"" written by two Boston Globe reporters, Michael Kranish and Scott Helman. But suffice it to say that Mitt is a very goal-oriented guy, and after achieving the governorship, he set his sights quickly on the next challenge -- the one that had eluded his beloved father -- the presidency. The central achievement of Mitt's government career in Massachusetts was the mandate-driven health care reform he now tries to ignore but which he once touted by saying that ""an achievement like this comes once in a generation."" He even chose the bill to appear in his official state portrait. The plan wasn't just a signature achievement, it was considered a political asset in running to succeed President George W. Bush. The country was tired of polarization, and Mitt could provide a problem-solving antidote, a demonstrated ability to bring a Republican solution -- the individual mandate -- to a problem that Democrats traditionally cared most about. It was an approach entirely consistent with the way he campaigned for office in 2002 and also consistent with the Romney family political philosophy established by his father, George, when he was an effective and popular governor of Michigan in the 1960s. Risking re-election was also deemed to be a political loser. If he ran and lost, his presidential ambitions would be toast. That's why Mitt was the last in 16 years of Republican governors for stereotypically liberal Massachusetts. The trend was set by centrist William Weld after he succeeded Michael Dukakis in 1990 and extended by Paul Cellucci. But Mitt pretty much buried that trend and didn't even try to extend it back in 2006. He wasn't a trailblazer as much as a trail-ender in this regard. But the biggest tell was the now infamous 180 on social issues he had pledged to defend while trying to get elected in the first place. In July of 2005, he penned an op-ed in the Boston Globe saying that his ""convictions have evolved and deepened during my time as governor"" -- the once staunch defender of a woman's right to choose began describing himself as ""firmly pro-life"" just in time to hit the national conservative circuit. Likewise, his commitment to advance ""full equality"" for gays and lesbians quickly fell by the wayside. Ditto past statements on guns, greenhouse gases, abstinence education and immigration. These are politically pragmatic decisions when someone is planning to run for the Republican nomination, but they are not the actions of a conviction politician. In contrast, John McCain and Rudy -- two of Romney's rivals in 2008 -- are quintessential conviction politicians. They put real stock in concepts of honor when it comes to the political arena, and it often gets them in trouble. It would have been far easier for Rudy to reframe his position on abortion or adjust his rhetoric to the right on guns, gays or immigration. But Rudy's not that kind of guy. Mitt is. Mitt's missing record in Massachusetts reflects the fact that he treated that executive office as a launching pad for his presidential ambitions. And it is an irony of presidential politics that the signature health care bill he intended to used as evidence of his political vision became a liability from which he had to distance himself four years later. The quintessential turnaround artist when it comes to business, he never really attempted a turnaround of Massachusetts. Instead, his inattention helped end 16 years of Republican gubernatorial rule. That is, unfortunately for Mitt, also a matter of record. As the technocrat candidate is fond of saying, ""facts are stubborn things."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","Rudy Giuliani drew contrasts between his record and that of Mitt Romney .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago alderman says Chick-fil-A's president is publicly contradicting what company executives personally assured him for months -- that the fast-food chain is changing its stance on gay marriage -- and he asked the company Sunday to clarify. Alderman Joe Moreno made news last week when he announced Chick-fil-A has ceased making donations to anti-gay groups and has enacted workplace protections for its employees against discrimination. Moreno said the two concessions were the result of 10 months of negotiations he had with Chick-fil-A executives as he weighed whether to support a new Chick-fil-A restaurant in his Chicago ward. He said the executives gave him documents backing up the new positions. How the Chick-fil-A controversy evolved . Chick-fil-A, in a statement Thursday, affirmed the workplace protections. Friday, however, company President Dan Cathy denied the company has ceased making donations to groups that oppose gay marriage and said Chick-fil-A ""made no such concessions."" ""There continues to be erroneous implications in the media that Chick-fil-A changed our practices and priorities in order to obtain permission for a new restaurant in Chicago,"" Cathy said in a statement to Mike Huckabee, the former Republican presidential candidate who now runs a conservative website. ""That is incorrect."" Moreno said Sunday that Cathy's statement ""at the least, muddied the progress we had made with Chick-fil-A and, at the worst, contradicted the documents and promises Chick-fil-A made to me and the community earlier this month."" Moreno said Chick-fil-A executives gave him a letter earlier this year saying the company's non-profit arm, the WinShape Foundation, will not support organizations with political agendas. ""We were told that these organizations included groups that politically work against the rights of gay and lesbian people,"" Moreno said. He said the executives confirmed to him that both the foundation and the company in 2012 has not given money and will not give money to those groups. Cathy's conflicting statement, Moreno said Sunday, is ""disturbing."" ""I am simply asking Mr. Cathy to confirm statements and documents that HIS company executives provided to me,"" Moreno said in a written statement, capitalizing ""his"" for emphasis. Chicken, with a side of politics . ""It's pretty simple, Mr. Cathy. Do you acknowledge and support the policies that your executives outlined to me in writing or do you not? Yes or no?"" the statement added. Chick-fil-A, whose restaurants are closed on Sundays, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the company has never hidden its conservative principles, Cathy caused an uproar in July when, in an interview with the Baptist Press, he said the company supports ""the biblical definition of the family unit."" The interview brought attention to donations the company made to organizations some activists said were anti-gay. Gay rights activists and others denounced the company and promised a boycott, while others vowed to support the company. Huckabee suggested a ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day"" and thousands turned out to show their support. Moreno said Sunday he has yet to introduce legislation for the new Chick-fil-A restaurant in his ward and will wait for Cathy's response before moving forward. iReport: 'I'm gay and I support Chick-fil-A' Opinion: Chick-fil-A and free speech .

"(CNN) -- A man and woman pleaded guilty to participating in a Romania-based Internet car sales scam that cost U.S. victims more than $4 million, federal prosecutors said Friday. The scheme allegedly advertised nonexistent vehicles for sale on websites that included eBay Motors, AutoTrader, Yahoo Auto, edmunds.com and Cragslist. Corneliu Weikum, 38, a Romanian national who lives in Germany, and Yulia Mishina-Heffron, 24, of Russia, entered the pleas Thursday in Las Vegas, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, which helped prosecute the case. The defendants forfeited more than $1.2 million in cash and agreed to pay restitution to the victims, prosecutors said. If a federal judge accepts the plea agreements, they will be sentenced December 21. ""After negotiating with members of the conspiracy in Romania, victims of the scam were instructed to deposit the money for the cars into bank accounts established at the direction of Weikum and Mishina-Heffron,"" according to the statement. ""Associates withdrew the money and gave it to Weikum and Mishina-Heffron, who would then smuggle the money out of the United States in the form of cash and wire transfers."" The pair pleaded guilty to two counts, one involving smuggling bulk cash out of the United States, the other involving a plot to commit bank and wire fraud. The agreements call for Weikum to receive a 97-month prison sentence, and Mishina-Heffron 70 months. The maximum statutory sentence is 35 years' imprisonment. According to prosecutors, more than $1 million was seized in October 2009 from Weikum's luggage at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. In March 2010, officers found $20,000 stuffed into stereo speakers Mishina-Heffron attempted to ship to Germany, the statement said.","Scheme operated out of Romania, federal prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in northern Mexico detained a prison director and two other officials after 129 inmates escaped from the facility through a tunnel, officials said. The three prison leaders will be detained for 30 days during an investigation, Coahuila State Attorney General Homero Ramos told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Local and federal authorities were searching for the inmates and U.S. officers were on alert after the prison break, which occurred Monday in Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, and about 150 miles from San Antonio. The inmates escaped one by one from the minimum-security facility, slipping out through a 23-foot-long tunnel, cutting through a chain-link fence and running through an empty lot, according to a statement from the Coahuila state attorney general. The tunnel, which was about 4 feet wide and nearly 10 feet deep, began in a wood shop inside in the prison, authorities said. Officials originally said that 132 inmates had escaped but adjusted the figure to 129 after finding three inmates hiding in another part of the prison, state security spokesman Sergio Sisbeles said. Of the escapees, 86 were federal prisoners and 43 were incarcerated on local charges. The massive escape cast a fresh spotlight on an issue that has dogged Mexico's government in recent years: how to handle a growing prison population amid the country's crackdown on organized crime. Security analyst Javier Oliva said the prison break was the latest sign of a crisis that is intensifying. ""What guarantee do we have as a society that those who commit crimes in activities as serious as drug trafficking receive a corresponding punishment? This, beyond the accounts that there could be about this escape, is a very severe blow to the nation's mood,"" he said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the prison break in a series of Twitter posts Tuesday, calling it ""deplorable."" ""In the past six years more than 1,000 inmates have escaped from state prisons. From the federal prisons, not one,"" he wrote. The largest escape during Calderon's six-year term occurred in December 2010, when 151 inmates escaped from a local prison in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo. In February, 30 inmates fled after a riot in a prison in Monterrey, Mexico. On Tuesday, Mexican authorities were offering a reward of nearly $16,000 for information leading to the capture of each escaped inmate. Local and federal authorities were searching for the inmates, and police have set up blockades on roads leading to the Mexico-U.S. border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection placed its officers and agents in the area on alert, a homeland security official said. ""At this point, CBP has no reports of escapees attempting to cross the border. We will continue coordinating with our Mexican counterparts as we monitor this situation,"" the source said. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Mario Gonzalez and Rey Rodriguez and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","NEW: The prison break is a ""severe blow,"" a security analyst says .

"(CNN) -- A dark day in Jamaica turned into a dark night as most of the island was without power and one person was killed as Hurricane Sandy passed through. CNN affiliate TV J reported a man was killed when he was hit by a boulder sent tumbling downhill by the storm's rain. TV J said 70% of the island was without power. More than 1,000 people went to shelters, the Office of Disaster Preparedness said. A curfew was in effect until Thursday morning, according to the Jamaican Office of Information. Hurricane Sandy rolled over Jamaica on Wednesday, bringing 80-mph wind and torrents of rain to the island, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm made landfall near Kingston about 3 p.m. ET, the center said. The storm was expected to bring rainfall amounts between 6 and 12 inches. As of 8 p.m., the eye of the storm was between Jamaica and Cuba. Sandy was headed north at 14 mph (22 kph) and its strongest sustained winds had increased in speed to 85 mph (135 kph). The forecast map shows Sandy reaching eastern Cuba by early Thursday before heading to the Bahamas. Tropical storm and hurricane warnings are up across the region. That includes Florida's east coast, where a tropical storm warning is in effect from Ocean Reef to Sebastian Inlet. The warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the area in the next 24 to 36 hours, the hurricane center said. In Massachusetts, the state's emergency management agency began issuing situational awareness news releases as some computer models show that Sandy could ""potentially transition over the weekend into a powerful nor'easter.""

"Dearborn, Michigan (CNN) -- Muntaha Fleful slowly lifts her arm sleeves, and then her left pant leg. She turns her head toward the white wall and takes a deep breath. She can't look at her skin, scarred and chapped from the acid thrown on her during an attack by Islamist militia members in Baghdad. Even worse are the mental scars she lives with daily, as one of perhaps thousands of Iraqi refugees living in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD. Despite the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq, refugees continue to flow into America. Many of them, officials say, have suffered primary and secondary trauma. Only a fraction of them seek treatment. Fleful, a Christian, was leaving her family's Baghdad jewelry store with her nephew in 2004 when four masked men drove down the same road. They struck her with the car, and then proceeded to beat her. ""I was trying to unmask them,"" she says. ""They dropped acid on my body. They tried to burn my face. My flesh was like meat."" An onlooker shot his Kalashnikov into the air to try and scare off the men. Before fleeing, they slashed Fleful's stomach open and left her in the street to die. Felful received treatment in Iraq and moved to Jordan for several years. The doctors needed to remove her uterus because of complications from her stomach injury. She also had reconstruction on her leg and needed treatment for the acid burns. She was eventually resettled as a U.S. refugee in 2008. But the memory of that day, she says while wrinkling a tissue in her hand, will stick with her forever. Her wounds are triggers bringing her back to that day in Baghdad. She relives every moment -- she sees the masks, and feels her skin burning. It is like living the attack all over again -- a classic symptom of PTSD. ""I felt like I was going crazy,"" Fleful says, shaking her head. ""I used to close all the windows and have them locked all the time. I thought the workers from the restaurant upstairs were going to come down and rape me."" Fleful, now 46, was diagnosed with PTSD last year when she was enrolled in a psychosocial rehabilitation program for victims of torture in Macomb, Michigan. The program is run by ACCESS, a community organization dedicated to empowering and enabling individuals and families in the Detroit area. Fleful's story is similar to others who lived in Iraq throughout the war. For Christians, religious persecutions by Islamist militias were especially common, and the victims were forced to leave their homes. The transition into their new countries, including the United States, only exacerbated the PTSD symptoms. Fleful is one of an influx of Iraqi refugees and asylum seekers who have come to America. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, America has resettled more than 2,500 Iraqis since March 31 this year alone. Dearborn is home to the largest Arab-American population in the country, many of them from Iraq. The exact number of Iraqis living in the United States is not clear. The statistic is fogged by the different classifications of foreigners -- asylum seekers, people who have been permanently resettled as refugees and those who are living illegally in the country. Wars prompt disturbing rise in refugees . Haitham Safo, a lead therapist at ACCESS, says his group serves just over 300 clients, most of whom are Iraqi Chaldean Christians. Sixty clients suffered direct physical torture, he says, and are now dealing with severe PTSD. Their symptoms include nightmares, insomnia, intense anger, and poor concentration. Fleful says her most pressing symptom is insomnia. She started receiving medication to help her fall asleep, but she became too dependent on it. ""It became a problem,"" she says. ""I am now trying to slowly go off of the medication. But it's a process."" The 300 clients served by ACCESS are thought to be only a sliver of those suffering from PTSD in the Detroit area. In 2011, Detroit and Wayne County experienced an influx of 3,500 new asylum seekers. The majority of those are Iraqi Chaldeans who are likely suffering mental and emotional effects of trauma. Many of them, however, do not seek services. ""There is a stigma of mental health in the Arab world,"" Safo says. ""There are no such services in Iraq, because people there act like there is no mental health (issues) in Iraq. At ACCESS we try to help them find meaning for new life, new goals."" Husam Abdulkhaleq, program manager at the ACCESS rehabilitation center, says PTSD is more widespread than many realize -- that thousands are suffering and will continue to suffer as they are resettled in upcoming years. The next immediate concern for ACCESS, he says, will be the additional influx of refugees affected by the Syrian conflict. Ronald Munia, director of the division of refugee services at the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, says his organization has consistently funded ACCESS over the past five years because it understands the need to address the demand for mental health services among the refugee population in Michigan. ""These people are facing challenges that normal Americans do not. They have been uprooted, and they didn't have a choice,"" he says. Soccer helping young refugees find footing in U.S. ACCESS is now in its second year of funding of a three-year grant from ORR. They receive $175,000 for what ORR has dubbed an ""ethnic"" grant. According to the ORR website, the grant ACCESS receives is designed to provide ""refugee populations with critical services to assist them in becoming integrated members of American society."" But in addition, ACCESS receives an additional $250,000 dedicated solely to helping survivors of torture like Fleful. For Fleful, daily life in Michigan is far removed from Iraq. She spends most of her days in the house, watching TV and preparing meals for herself. She does not work because she cannot speak English and finds it difficult to interact with the community around her. She spends days, sometimes even weeks, alone. Her brother lives just a few miles down the road, she says, but she never sees him because he too is suffering from PTSD. ""I don't want to hear about any more trauma or anyone else dying,"" she says. ""It hurts too much. But I can't forget what happened to me.""","Muntaha Fleful was injured in a 2004 attack in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- A lie-detecting virtual border official nicknamed ""Elvis"" is the latest high-tech approach to securing borders in the United States. Developed by University of Arizona researchers in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the computer is known as the Automated Virtual Agent for Truth Assessments in Real-Time -- or AVATAR -- kiosk. It uses sensors to screen passengers for unusual physiological responses to questioning -- which can indicate a subject is lying. ""What we're looking for is changes in human physiology,"" said Doug Derrick, a member of the University of Arizona team behind the project. ""We've had great success in reliably detecting these anomalies -- things that people can't really detect."" The kiosk is being trialled at Dennis DeConcini Port in Nogales, Arizona -- a checkpoint on the U.S.-Mexico border -- as a way of processing passengers looking to sign up to CBP's ""Trusted Traveler"" program. The program allows travelers pre-approved as ""low-risk"" to be fast-tracked through security processes. Applicants for the program must undergo an interview and biometric fingerprinting to be eligible for the program -- both of which can be performed by the AVATAR kiosk. Derrick said the kiosk could process travelers in five minutes. Travelers simply stand in front of the unit -- which ""looks like an ATM on steroids,"" according to Derrick -- and respond to yes/no questions asked in Spanish or English. ""You speak to it like you speak to a person,"" he said. Their answers are monitored, with any unusual physiological responses passed on to ""a human field agent"" who then subjects them to ""a more careful interview process,"" said CBP spokesman Bill Brooks. Unusual responses were not a sure sign of a lie, said Derrick. ""There might be valid reasons for it beyond deception."" Read more: 'Safe-list' travelers get fast-track through airport security . The computer uses three sensors to assess physiological responses: a microphone, which monitors vocal quality, pitch and frequency; an infrared camera, which looks at pupil dilation and where the eyes focus; and a high-definition camera recording facial expressions. Some of the involuntary cues that betray whether a speaker is lying could be controlled, but not all of them at once. Lab testing had indicated the machine was much more successful than humans at detecting these cues, according to Derrick. ""People have a hard time detecting small changes in the frequency of the human voice, that a computer is much better at,"" he said. ""People are accurate about 54% of the time at detecting deception ... We have got our machine as high as 90% in the lab."" Brooks said the project was still in the early phase of field testing, and participating in the AVATAR interview process was entirely voluntary at this stage. But if successful, the initiative could be rolled out in other parts of CBP's operations. Derrick said it was hoped that, as well as providing better detection of suspicious behavior, the AVATAR kiosk would prove to be ""a really important time and money saving tool."" Initially, the kiosk did not have the avatar feature, but it was added after its developers found that without it, people would tend to speak to the machine in a robotic, unnatural manner. It even got a name among the team developing the project. ""We call him Elvis, or Pat,"" said Derrick. ""But when he's in the field he's just the AVATAR agent.""","The AVATAR kiosk scans interview subjects for signs of lying .

"(CNN) -- Three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond has told International Cycling Union (UCI) president Pat McQuaid to resign, accusing the Irishman of ""abusing his power."" The UCI has come under fire amid the doping scandal that implicated Lance Armstrong in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour titles and dropped by high-profile sponsors Nike and Oakley in the wake of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report, and has yet to comment on it. LeMond called on McQuaid and his predecessor -- honorary UCI president Hein Verbruggen -- to quit, insisting that progress in the sport can only be made if they step aside. In an open letter on his Facebook page, LeMond -- who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990 -- reiterated his support for former Sunday Times journalist Paul Kimmage, who is being sued for defamation by the pair. ""I want to tell the world of cycling to please join me in telling Pat McQuaid to resign,"" he wrote. ""I have never seen such an abuse of power in cycling's history -- resign Pat if you love cycling. Resign even if you hate the sport. ""I do not want to include everyone at the UCI because I believe that there are many, maybe most that work at the UCI, that are dedicated to cycling, they do it out of the love of the sport, but you and your buddy Hein have destroyed the sport. ""The sport does not need Pat McQuaid or Hein Verbruggen -- if this sport is going to change it is now. Not next year, not down the road, now! Now or never!"" The UCI refused to comment on LeMond's statement when contacted by CNN. The Union is preparing for a meeting on Friday during which it will discuss possible reforms in the wake of the Armstrong scandal. LeMond's comments are sure to intensify the pressure on McQuaid and the UCI after it was revealed they failed to pick up signs of doping in Armstrong despite testing him over 200 times. McQuaid has insisted a $100,000 donation from Armstrong to the UCI in 2002, revealed in USADA's report, was not part of a cover-up. ""UCI has nothing to hide in responding to the USADA report,"" McQuaid told reporters at a press conference last week. ""Don't try to make the connection between the suspicious test and the donation. There were no positive tests from him."" But LeMond insists McQuaid is a barrier to change within the sport, and he called on people to donate to a fund to help Kimmage fight his legal battle with the UCI, who he accused of corruption. ""I have a file with what I believe is well-documented proof that will exonerate Paul,"" LeMond added. ""I would encourage anyone that loves cycling to donate and support Paul in his fight against the Pat and Hein and the UCI. ""People that really care about cycling have the power to change cycling -- change it now by voicing your thought and donating money towards Paul Kimmage's defense. ""If people really want to clean the sport of cycling up all you have to do is put your money where your mouth is."" As McQuaid and the UCI prepare for Friday's meeting in Switzerland, the president acknowledged events of the past fortnight had sparked a period of introspection within the governing body. ""It's up to the UCI to look at the sport, look at team structures, look at race structures and try to create an environment for this to not happen again,"" McQuaid said in quotes reported by the AFP news agency. ""We want to take what we can learn from it and put in place measures to make sure it doesn't happen again."" McQuaid hinted the UCI might ask teams that participate in cycling's main competitions to donate more money to the anti-doping fight. He also suggested the UCI will acquiesce to the Tour de France's wish not to reassign Armstrong's seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 after it was described as a ""lost decade"" by race organizer Christian Prudhomme. ""It's up to us to come out of this affair and show everyone that we do see this as a crisis but also as an opportunity, because there is a danger that it could have a fatal effect on the sport, and I don't want that to happen,"" McQuaid added. Elsewhere on Thursday, Team Sky -- who led Bradley Wiggins to victory in the 2012 Tour de France -- confirmed coach Bobby Julich had left his position. Sky have asked their staff to sign a statement declaring they have had no previous involvement in doping but Julich, who was a teammate of Armstrong in 1995 and 1996, has admitted to using the blood-boosting agent EPO as a rider. ""Bobby has shown courage in admitting to the errors he made long before his time with Team Sky,"" Team Principal Dave Brailsford said on the team's official website.

"Baltimore, Maryland (CNN) -- From her Baltimore kitchen, Rebecca Murphy is lobbying legislators, crafting signs and making phone calls as she wages a battle to allow gays and lesbians to marry in her state. The married mother of two doesn't have a personal stake in the fight. Rather, Murphy represents the growing number of people nationwide who support gay rights regardless of their own sexual orientation. ""I have gay and lesbian friends and family who are raising children and creating lives, and they deserve to be treated fairly,"" she says. As national polls show a shift in attitudes about same-sex marriage, Murphy's state of Maryland is one of three poised to put the issue to an up-or-down popular vote for the first time next month. While support has grown, there are still many who oppose allowing gays to marry and are doing their part to strike the measure down. The Rev. Frank Reid and his wife, Marlaa, of Bethel AME Church in Baltimore run workshops for single African-Americans in an effort to encourage strong marriages and discourage sexual behaviors that can lead to HIV/AIDS. ""I do understand and accept that there are other patterns for families,"" Marlaa Reid says. ""However, the basic prescription for marriage, I embrace it as a biblical prescription. A man and a woman."" Her husband is quick to point out that though the Reids support the traditional view of marriage, it ""does not mean that we don't love our gay, lesbian and transgender brothers and sisters."" ""It means that we don't take our direction from the president, whoever he or she may be. It is a reminder to us that God loves the sinner, but hates the sin,"" Frank Reid says. What a difference . Voters have mostly agreed with the Reids' views. Thirty-eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same sex, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. In the six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia where gays and lesbians have won marriage rights, it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. But what a difference an election cycle makes. Four years ago, three states -- Arizona, Florida and California -- joined the list of those with constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, while Arkansas banned same-sex couples from adopting. This year, Maryland, Maine and Washington could go the other way. Maine could represent the biggest turnaround. The state rejected their governor's decision to allow same-sex marriage in 2009, but recent polling suggests a shift. The Pan Atlantic SMS Group of Portland released a poll October 10 saying ""55% of Mainers plan to vote in support of same-sex marriage"" and another 1.3% are leaning that way, the Press Herald reported. Washington and Maryland, meanwhile, are voting on whether to affirm decisions made by their legislatures and supported by their governors. ""The biggest difference going into this election as opposed to the last election is that a majority of Americans now support the freedom to marry, we have a president of the United States that supports the freedom to marry, we have six states and the District of Columbia where gay people can share in the freedom to marry,"" says Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry, a group supporting the right of gays to marry. A CNN/ORC poll in June found that a majority of Americans support marriage rights for gays and lesbians, reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion over the past two decades. The number of Americans who say they have a close friend or family member who is gay or lesbian, meanwhile, has jumped from 49% in 2010 to 60% today, the first time in CNN polling that a majority of Americans have said that. In the 1990s, most Americans said they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. Drew Tagliabue, the executive director of the New York City chapter of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, says ties with gay people have prompted non-gays to support gay rights causes in increasing numbers. ""When you come at something and you know someone who is gay, it takes the fear out of the issue and makes it clear that it's just a simple matter of equality,"" he says. The November votes come as courts are moving to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, one of the biggest obstacles to gay rights supporters. The divisive act, passed in 1996, bars federal recognition of marriages between people of the same sex and says states cannot be forced to recognize them. Timeline: Same-sex marriage . On Thursday, a federal appeals court in New York became the nation's second to strike down the law, saying that it violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. Read the ruling (PDF). A federal appeals court in Boston made a similar ruling in May. The appellate court decisions mean the next step is likely to be a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Related: Federal court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act . Courting minority voters . In Maryland, gay rights advocates hope minorities will turn out to support the ballot measure -- known as Question 6. Nearly 30% of voters in Maryland are black and 8.4% are Latino. Both communities have shown a surge of support since May, when President Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage. Washington Post-ABC polls taken before and after Obama's announcement showed an 18-point jump in the number of African-Americans who support same-sex marriage. Also, 52% in a recent Pew Research Center national poll of Latinos said they support same-sex marriage, a significant increase from 2006 when 52% said they opposed it. Partnerships with racial and ethnic minorities became more important to the gay and lesbian community after 2008, when California voters approved a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriages. Voter exit polls showed strong support for the measure by blacks and Latinos. Wolfson, of Freedom to Marry, says that gay rights groups reacted by reaching out more aggressively to minority communities and encouraging gays and lesbians who are minorities to talk to their own friends and families about gay rights. ""I think it will be huge if the African-Americans of this state do what I think they're going to do, which is to recognize that everybody is entitled to equal protection under the law,"" says Murphy, who is black. Also supporting allowing gays and lesbians to marry in Maryland is the NAACP, which has put the civil rights group at loggerheads with clergy such as Reid. Reid accuses gay groups of forging convenient ties with black and Latino communities, while doing little to champion other minority causes. ""Where is this money for education to pour out to Latino and African-American communities,"" Reid asks. Kevin Nix, a spokesman for Marylanders for Marriage Equality, says the group is focused only on Question 6 right now and not other minority ballot issues like a local version of the Dream Act, which aims to protect undocumented young immigrants from deportation. Derek McCoy, a married father of three from Prince Georges County, has turned his opposition to Question 6 into a full-time job. He sees the ballot measure as a threat to his own personal freedoms. ""We are making a fundamental shift in what society sees as marriage,"" he says. ""When we look at it, people are asking to change our religious and civil liberties."" Big money . Question 6 has attracted big money from supporters and opponents around the country. A recent Washington Post poll showed the gay community winning the issue by a 9-point margin just days after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $250,000 to Marylanders for Marriage Equality. Hedge fund manager Paul Singer donated the same amount. Former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue lives in the District of Columbia, but he and his family have donated $100,000 to Marylanders for Marriage Equality. In past campaigns to expand marriage rights, little connection was made between dollars spent and outcome, and gay rights organizations were not always leading the way on collecting money from out of state. This time, if gay rights groups aren't outpacing opponents in raising out-of-state funds, they're close. Tagliabue, Bloomberg and Singer's combined donation of $600,000 is nearly as much as the entire budget of their opponents. The National Organization for Marriage, which opposes allowing same-sex marriage, has a $2 million matching grant challenge on its website targeting the November initiatives. The Knights of Columbus, a Roman Catholic organization that opposes same-sex marriage, acknowledged last week that it has spent at least $6 million since 2005 on a variety of initiatives opposing the expansion of marriage rights. In the Maryland race, gay rights groups appear to be leading in fund raising, with $3.2 million to $835,000 for their opponents. According to the Washington Public Disclosure Commission, gay civil rights activists in that state are ahead $10.5 million to $1.8 million. Maine gay rights supporters have $3.35 million to their opponents' $430,000, according to the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Practices. ""The top goal for the second half of 2012 is to win one of these ballot measures,"" Wolfson says. ""We've shown that we can win the freedom to marry in public opinion. We've shown that we can win the freedom to marry in courts. We've shown that we can win the freedom to marry in legislatures. ... We've shown we can win the freedom to marry with the support of both Republican and Democratic legislatures. The last barrier we have to overcome is to show we can win the freedom to marry in an up-or-down vote on the ballot."" Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

"London (CNN) -- The parents of Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousafzai arrived Thursday in Britain to reunite with their daughter, who has become an international symbol of courage after being shot by the Taliban for demanding education for girls. The 15-year-old, who at times has been unconscious, is being treated in a Birmingham hospital for a gunshot wound to the head. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, has been a central influence for Malala. He ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. Her parents' arrival on Thursday came 10 days after Malala was flown to Britain. Arrests made in shooting of Pakistani schoolgirl . Malala has been unable to speak because a tube has been inserted into her trachea to protect her airway, which was swollen after her injury. ""I am leaving this country with a heavy heart and in extraordinary circumstances because the whole country knows that it is essential that I be with my daughter during her recovery,"" her father told Pakistani network PTV before leaving Islamabad, in his first public remarks since the October 9 shooting. ""With the nation's prayers she survived the attack and she will surely recover and her health will progress. And, God willing, as soon as she is recovered, I will be back in Pakistan."" Khushal Khan, Malala's younger brother, called for the nation to rally behind his sister. ""I want to tell all my friends to pray for Malala,"" he said. Opinion: Why Malala should not be turned into modern Joan of Arc . Malala has been thinking about school even while she lies in her hospital bed, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family -- she asked her father to take her school books with him. ""The mission she has taken forward and the education awareness that has spread across Pakistan is all Malala's doing,"" he said, according to PTV. ""So I think that our entire nation should be proud of her love for the soil of her country."" After Malala recovers and returns to Pakistan, he said, ""we will provide her with complete security, despite anyone's refusal, to ensure that something like this never happens again. The attack on Malala was a mindset of people who don't want to see this country progress."" Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has spoken with the girl's father, asking him to stay in Britain as long as necessary while his daughter recovers, Rehman Malik said. Malala has been communicating with medical staff by writing notes, the hospital has said. What's your message for Malala? As of Thursday, Malala ""continued to respond well to treatment,"" the hospital's website said. She is expected to need ""a significant period of rest and recuperation"" before undergoing reconstructive surgery, Dr. Dave Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham, said last week. That surgery could involve reinserting a piece of her own skull or fitting her with a titanium plate. Malala was fighting an infection, but was able to move her extremities and has stood with help from nurses, the hospital said. Although the bullet grazed her brain as it passed from above her eye into her shoulder, she understands where she is and seems to be functioning well intellectually, it added. Malala sent a message of thanks to the thousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere who have attended rallies and vigils honoring her courage and praying for her recovery. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the shooting, but don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke. Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan. Girl shot alongside Malala haunted by attack . On her blog, Malala wrote about her life in the region, a center of militant activity where girls schools were shuttered and strict Islamist rules imposed. In her writings, which earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, she encouraged young people to oppose the Taliban. Pakistani police said Wednesday that six men have been arrested in Swat in connection with Malala's shooting, but the primary suspect remained at large. Police have identified Atta Ullah Khan, a 23-year-old man from the district where she was attacked, as the primary suspect. Police said they were searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry. CNN's Jonathan Wald and Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Plane carrying Malala's parents lands in Birmingham, England .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer overcame a scare against Swiss friend Stanislas Wawrinka before finally securing a victory which ensures he will spend a record-breaking 300th week as world number one. The 31-year-old recaptured top spot after a 17th grand slam success at Wimbledon in July and by reaching the last eight of the Shanghai Masters, he has reached another landmark in his illustrious career. Should he win in China, Federer will claim a record 22nd Masters 1000 crown and equal John McEnroe's haul of 77 tour-level titles. But the Swiss was pushed all the way by his David Cup teammate as the world no. 17 took the opening set 6-4 -- only the fourth set Wawrinka has won against Federer in 13 meetings. In a tight second, Wawrinka saved a set point at 5-6 before pushing it into a tie-break. The score was locked at 3-3 but Federer found another gear to take him level. He dropped just five points in the third set, taking it 6-0 to ensure this coming Monday will be the 300th time he has perched atop the world rankings. ""I consider myself a little lucky. I never stopped believing, pushed till the end, then got off to a good start in the third set. Basically that was it,"" Federer said in quotes carried by AFP. ""It was a tough match. He was the better player for basically two sets. It's great finding a way out that way, that's for sure."" ""So here I am at 300 weeks. It's pretty incredible. Probably one of my biggest accomplishments. I'm very proud of that record, no doubt about it. It's a great reward for me."" He will now play Marin Cilic in the last eight after the Croatian beat Spain's Fernando Verdasco 4-6 6-1 6-4. Federer's charge to wrestle the Shanghai crown from Andy Murray looks set to be a lot tougher, as the U.S. open champion dismissed the challenge of Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-2 6-2. Murray, who also won the event in 2010, told reporters: ""I think I did a decent job. ""It's very, very different conditions to last week. I think you can see by some of the results here, the guys that have come from Beijing have adapted to the conditions much, much quicker."" Murray will play Radek Stepanek after the Czech beat American John Isner 6-4 6-7 6-3 in a showdown of the big servers. World No. 2 Novak Djokovic is gunning for Federer's mantle as the top ranked player and he says improvements to his serve have helped his game. The Serbian defeated Spain's Fernando Lopez 6-3 6-3 and will now face Germany's Tommy Haas in the quarters after he beat Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic 6-2 6-1. ""I'm trying to enjoy the efficiency of my serve,"" Djokovic told the ATP tour website. ""I'm not very well known around the tour for big serving. ""But so far in this tournament, and also in Beijing, it has been working very well for me. It has been giving me a lot of free points, a lot of confidence into the matches."" France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga will meet Tomas Berdych, from the Czech Republic, in the last eight after he beat Marcos Baghdatis 6-2 7-6.

"(CNN) -- Food prices in Indonesia rise during the holy month of Ramadan, but that hasn't stopped Ghazmawati Akmalzen from stocking her shelves to celebrate next week's end of daylight fasting. ""It's not possible to cut down on food and ingredients because we're going to have friends and family over,"" she said. The spending power of Akmalzen and 242 million other Indonesians shows why this secular Muslim nation is a bright spot in a darkening global economy. Thanks to strong economic demand, this emerging market was able to shake off sagging exports due to eurozone troubles and slowing demand from China. The latest figures Monday from Southeast Asia's largest economy showed Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.4% year-on-year last quarter. ""The second quarter numbers beat market expectations and showed the resilience of the Indonesian economy - that was very much because of the strength of investment which grew 12% year-on-year and also the strength of consumer demand,"" said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight. ""Domestic demand was the key factor here."" More foreign companies are looking to profit from growth in the world's most populous Muslim nation. When Nissan Motor Company resurrected the Datsun brand, CEO Carlos Ghosn made the March announcement in Indonesia, where the Japanese automaker plans to build and sell the new car in 2014, to take advantage of the nation's both rising manufacturing prowess and growing middle class. Late last year, Boeing made its largest single aviation sale - 230 planes totaling $21.7 billion - to Lion Air, a domestic airline virtually unknown outside of this archipelago nation of 6,000 inhabited islands. Tony Fernandes, CEO of regional low-cost carrier Air Asia and chairman of the Queens Park Rangers football club, caused headlines recently by announcing his move from his native Malaysia to Indonesia. ""Jakarta has the potential to be the biggest market for Air Asia,"" Fernandes told CNN Tuesday at the launch of Air Asia ASEAN in Jakarta. ""It's also home for ASEAN. So it's a statement we want to accelerate change in ASEAN and we've made the bold move of physically relocating ourselves here. ""We believe there is a massive market potential that's untouched here -- that's what we're after,"" he said. Global Insight, an economics consulting firm, predicts the Indonesian economy will grow five-fold by 2030 to become a $4.5 trillion economy - roughly the size of Germany's economy today. ""That's very important -- not only does it mean Indonesia's GDP and per capita income are going to rise very substantially ... but also it's very important for the rest of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), because Indonesia is going to act as a growth driver for other ASEAN economies and for Asia regionally,"" Biswas said. Experts also talk about spurring more equitable growth that reaches Indonesia's poorest. In June, food staples tofu and soybean curd all but disappeared from markets for three days. The prolonged U.S. drought jacked up soybean prices to record highs, prompting local producers to go on strike. ""People look for tofu and soybean curd because that's what they eat. So for the poor, it's very difficult. If the prices are too high, who suffers? It's the poor,"" tofu vendor Haji Siti told CNN. Consumer prices were up 4.5% percent last quarter from a year earlier. Despite the country's growing investment, its infrastructure lags behind other developing economies such as China. ""I'm very bullish but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't introduce policies that would both accelerate growth further and improve the quality of growth,"" said Milan Zavadjil, senior representative for the International Monetary Fund in Indonesia. ""Particularly more investment in infrastructure is absolutely essential to get rid of some of the current (traffic) bottlenecks, more investment in education to improve human skills and allow industry and other sectors to move up the value chain,"" Zavadjil said.

"(CNN) -- In Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale, ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" two swindlers promise an emperor new, beautiful clothes that are invisible to anyone who is unfit for their position, unjust or stupid. The clothes don't actually exist, but the emperor pretends to see them anyway so it is not thought that he is stupid or unfit to be emperor. His followers and ministers do the same. It takes an innocent little child to say what no one else is willing to say: The emperor doesn't have any clothes on. In the first presidential debate last week, the president had his emperor's clothes moment in front of more than 60 million people. Complete coverage: CNN's election center . All the bright, beautiful robes of his presidency were reduced to nothing. He was unprepared, listless, and as James Carville said, he didn't look like he even wanted to be there. Clint Eastwood's empty chair, which earned the ire of liberal pundits, now seems ever so prophetic. But Andersen's tale doesn't end there. When the little boy exposes him, the emperor turns a blind eye and says, ""This procession has got to go on."" Andersen concludes the story, ""So he walked more proudly than ever, as his noblemen held high the train that wasn't there at all."" The procession went on this past weekend with the president's noblemen, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod and Paul Krugman, all taking to the Sunday shows to insist that the real grievance was not President Obama's debate performance, not that he had no clothes, but that no one is calling Mitt Romney on his lies. Ah, the modern day twist -- the child is a liar! The problems in labeling Romney a liar are several. First, he did not lie. His tax plan would not raise taxes on middle-class families. In fact, Princeton economist Harvey Rosen says the Obama administration is misrepresenting his study on Romney's tax plan. Second, calling Romney a liar blatantly ignores the reality of the debate: the president's missing clothes and his terrible performance. While more than 60 million people witnessed the debate, the only people ignoring the president's performance are his advisers and his closest ideologues. For four years Obama has been cosseted and insulated by the friendly mainstream media. His lack of interest in taking hard questions from the media and the media's lack of interest in asking hard question showed during the debate. He was unprepared for Romney's aggressiveness and forcefulness. One can now only wonder how prepared he has been for the presidency these past four years? Third, if Romney was such a blatant liar, why didn't Obama say anything about it on stage during the debate? Obama couldn't put together a cogent defense of his own policies, let alone go on the offensive against Romney, which leaves little substance or truth to the case that Romney is a liar. Or as Andrew Sullivan wrote, ""How do you erase that imprinted first image from public consciousness: a president incapable of making a single argument or even a halfway decent closing statement?"" Opinion: Five ways Obama can bounce back . Fourth, the allegations of lies won't stick. As several commentators have said, Romney's brilliant debate performance obliterated $100 million in negative ads against him. The Obama administration's caricature of Romney, as well as much of the mainstream media's, as a vulture capitalist monster who only cares about the rich, was shattered. The problem with caricaturing someone is that the caricature better fit. On debate night it didn't, and it won't fit going forward. Just how good was Romney's debate performance? In a CNN/ORC International Poll conducted right after the debate, 67% of debate watchers said Romney won. In the most recent Pew Research poll taken after the debate, Romney now leads Obama 49% to 45% among likely voters. Just last month, Romney trailed by 8 points among this group. That's an incredible 12-point swing less than one month away from the election. Romney's supporters are more engaged by 15 points, and his favorable rating now surpasses Obama's for the first time, 50-49. On the question of which candidate would best ""improve the job situation,"" Romney now leads Obama by 8 points. In September, Obama was winning likely female voters by 18 points. Now, Obama and Romney are tied among women at 47, a remarkable comeback for Romney. Obama is reeling. His campaign is against the ropes. But if they think calling Romney a serial liar will make up the ground lost in the first debate, Obama may be even more unprepared for this presidential campaign than anyone thought. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Obama had his emperor's clothes moment at first debate .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Six gay men were shot dead by members of their tribe in two separate incidents in the past 10 days, an official with Iraq's Interior ministry said. In the most recent attack, two men were killed Thursday in Sadr City area of Baghdad after they were disowned by relatives, the official said. The shootings came after a tribal meeting was held and the members decided to go after the victims. On March 26, four additional men were fatally shot in the same city, the official said, adding that the victims had also been disowned by their relatives. The official declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Witnesses told CNN that a Sadr City cafe, which was a popular gathering spot for gays, was also set on fire.","In the most recent attack, two men were killed Thursday in Sadr City area of Baghdad .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- At least 11 climbers were killed in an avalanche Sunday morning on Manaslu, the world's eighth-highest peak, a pilot who took part in the rescue effort said. Steve Bruce Bokan of Fishtail Air said that those coordinating the rescue report as many as 38 people missing. A French mountaineering official put the number lower at 15, but said it had been difficult to get exact figures from authorities in Nepal. Four French citizens are among the dead, with another three missing, said Christian Trommsdorff, vice president of the National Syndicate of High Mountain Guides in Chamonix, France. He said that rescuers in helicopters focused on evacuating the injured. They also found the bodies of the four Frenchmen. One of the survivors -- according to the editor-in-chief for EpicTV.com, a film company that make features on skiing, climbing and other adventure sports -- is Glen Plake, who with two other ski mountaineers had planned to descend from the summit on skis without the aid of oxygen. Trey Cook said he spoke to Plake by satellite phone and the skier said: ""It was a major, major accident. There are up to 14 people missing. There were 25 tents at Camp 3 and all of them were destroyed; 12 tents at Camp 2 were banged up and moved around."" Plake lost a few front teeth and had an eye injury after being swept 300 meters (985 feet) down the mountain, Cook told CNN. Plake was still in his sleeping bag, in his tent and still had on his headlamp he was using to read his Bible verses, Cook said. After the avalanche, Plake went looking for the rest of the people in camp, all of whom were supposed to be wearing avalanche transceivers -- electronic devices that can signal other similar receivers -- as he was. Two of his colleagues were missing, including the man with whom he shared a tent, Plake told Cook. The avalanche, which took place Sunday at about 5 a.m. local time, was likely caused by a huge piece of ice that fell from a glacier above the camp, Trommsdorff said. Cook said he thought it was a piece of ice the size of six or seven football fields. Most of the mountaineers had set up tents at 6,600 meters (21,650 feet), said Yograj Kadel of Simrik Air, which was also involved in the rescue. The other mountaineers were apparently 500 meters (1,640 feet) below the camp that was destroyed, according to the EpicTV.com report. The mountain is 8,163 meters (26,780 feet) high. Kenton Cool, a mountain climber from England who reached the summit of Manaslu in 2010, told CNN the weather during the post-monsoon season can be quite unsettled. His friends on the mountain told him that in the past 10 days or so there had been ""quite high levels of snow on the mountain,"" he said. Teams normally wait for new snow to settle before leaving camp. Officials said bad weather led them to postpone further search efforts until Monday. Cool, who said Manaslu had a ""fearsome reputation,"" predicted that searchers will have a hard time locating some of the people still on the mountain. The area where the avalanche happened is the site of some large crevasses. ""It will be hard to know exactly where everyone was,"" he said. ""It will be hard to find the bodies, let alone retrieve them."" According to Nepal tourism officials, 231 foreign mountaineers from 25 teams were attempting to climb the mountain in the current autumn season that ends in November. They said that a Spaniard, a German and a Nepalese sherpa had been killed.","Survivor tells filmmaker he slid nearly a quarter-mile in his tent .

"(CNN) -- Two staff sergeants will be court-martialed for their involvement in an incident that included U.S. Marines urinating on dead Taliban fighters and posing for photographs with the corpses, the Marine Corps announced Monday. Staff Sgt. Joseph W. Chamblin and Staff Sgt. Edward W. Deptola were charged for the incident, which occurred in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in late July 2011, a news release from the Marine Corp stated. The incident did not come to light publicly until this past January when a 39-second video showing the incident was posted on several websites, including YouTube. The two Marines, who are based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, were also charged with dereliction of duty, failure to supervise junior Marines and failure to report the misconduct of those Marines. The statement didn't say when the trial is scheduled to take place. Three other Marines have been disciplined for their role in the incident. The three non-commissioned officers pleaded guilty in August to a variety of violations of Marine Corps regulations, a statement said at the time.","Incident took place in Afghanistan in July 2011 .

"(CNN) -- The Mars Curiosity rover used its laser to ""interrogate"" a Martian rock Sunday in what NASA said was ""target practice"" for future experiments. It was the first time such a powerful laser has been used on another planet and comes two weeks after the mobile science lab touched down on Mars. A fist-sized rock dubbed ""Coronation"" -- or Martian rock N165 for scientists keeping count -- was zapped 30 times over 10 seconds with 14 millijoules of energy in each pulse, NASA said. ""Each pulse delivers more than a million watts of power for about five one-billionths of a second,"" a NASA statement said. India plans to launch Mars orbiter . Curiosity's ChemCam, short for Chemistry and Camera, recorded the resulting glowing, ionized gas in an effort to identify chemical elements in the rock, which was about 10 feet away. Sylvestre Maurice, the ChemCam deputy project scientist watching at the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planetologie in Toulouse, France, called the quality of the information gathered ""surprising."" ""It's so rich, we can expect great science from investigating what might be thousands of targets with ChemCam in the next two years,"" Maurice said. ChemCam ""got a great spectrum"" to analyze, said Roger Wiens of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. ""Our team is both thrilled and working hard, looking at the results. After eight years building the instrument, it's payoff time!"" Curiosity began a two-year mission on Mars on August 6 and has been beaming back images of the surface of Gale Crater ever since. It is loaded with 10 instruments ""to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life,"" NASA said. More space coverage on CNN Light Years . NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Friday that Curiosity's first driving destination will be Glenelg, about 1,300 feet from the rover's landing site. ""We had a bunch of strong contenders. It is the kind of dilemma planetary scientists dream of, but you can only go one place for the first drilling for a rock sample on Mars,"" said project scientist John Grotzinger. ""That first drilling will be a huge moment in the history of Mars exploration."" The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a peak about 8 kilometers (5 miles) away. But moving about a football field a day, with lengthy stops, it could take nearly a year to reach the slopes at the base of the mountain.

"(CNN) -- Stretch out your core, cue the music and get ready to follow the beats. Zumba and other dance workouts are debuting on the list of the top 20 predicted fitness trends for 2012. Lack a little rhythm? Well, there's a trend on the list for just about every person, preference and body part. The trends were selected through an annual survey conducted by the American College of Sports Medicine. The survey was completed by 2,620 fitness professionals worldwide who ranked their selections into a list of 20 trends they believed would be big in 2012. ""The survey attempts to show a distinction between fads and trends and is a good representation of what's occurring in the health and fitness industry worldwide,"" said Walter Thompson, Ph.D., the lead author of the survey and a fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine. The list serves to educate consumers and have them question the health clubs they attend. Gym-goers need to determine if their club offers the services that have been deemed trendy across the fitness industry in the year ahead, Thompson says. For instance, Zumba, a dance workout, offers classes in more than 110,000 gyms in more than 250 countries. So it probably won't be hard to find a gym that offers these classes. ""I think people are waiting to see if we're a fad, but class numbers keep getting bigger and Zumba is becoming more popular, so now, people realize we're here to stay,"" said Alberto Perlman, CEO and co-founder of Zumba fitness. Zumba's popularity has skyrocketed over the years, and the dance workout was one of the biggest surprises on the list for 2012. ""Zumba is liberating and magical, and one of the key ways it has expanded is through word of mouth,"" Perlman said. Zumba ranked ninth on this year's list. Thompson is curious to see if it will follow Pilates' short run in the top 20 fitness trends. Pilates was ranked in the top 10 for three consecutive years, beginning in 2008, but dropped off in 2011. Of course, there are always trends that are expected to make an appearance on the list each year, such as educated, certified and experienced fitness professionals; strength training; and fitness programs for older adults. Fitness professionals claimed the No. 1 spot on the 2012 list -- and have done so for the past five years. The demand for fitness trainers is expected to boom over the next half-decade. The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics determined that the ""... jobs for fitness workers are expected to increase much faster than the average for all occupations [through 2018]."" ""It starts with knowledge, and from that stems all the different ways to get in shape. If you have a certified and educated fitness professional, they can guide you through the other 19 fitness trends,"" said Brian Attebery, a trainer certified by the National Fitness Professionals Association and the owner of RESULTS Fitness and Nutrition Center in Edmond, Oklahoma. Also returning among the veteran trends is No. 3 on the list: fitness programs for older adults. As baby boomers are aging, more are attempting to keep their youthful physique and energy with frequent gym visits. ""The baby boom generation is retiring, and retiring more healthy. They're a lot more active, and many enjoy working out,"" Thompson said. ""And with the economy the way it is, group training was another trend that didn't come as a surprise. These group training sessions are directly related to the economy, and trainers often offer discounts to groups of people."" Once the new year rolls in and resolutions to hit the gym go into full effect, this predicted list of fitness trends will certainly come in handy.","Survey predicts the top 20 fitness trends for 2012 .

"New York (CNN) -- As a powerful mix of weather converged on the U.S. East Coast, residents across the region seemed to take the warnings with varying degrees of seriousness. ""It started yesterday afternoon when we started to see a rush from consumers for supplies like flashlights, hand-held radios and batteries,"" said Tom Collins Jr., a hardware store owner in Atlantic County, New Jersey. ""And starting this morning, we've started selling plywood to contractors to help board up homes."" In Manhattan, where forecasts of a direct hit from Hurricane Irene last year left the city largely unaffected, many residents seemed relatively confident about Hurricane Sandy and its aftereffects. ""Most seem to take the attitude of 'whatever happens, happens,'"" said Jason Covell, who works at Nuthouse Hardware on Manhattan's East Side. ""I don't think anybody's going crazy and buying sandbags."" Still, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday declared a state of emergency in every county in expectation of the storm, while placing the National Guard on standby. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city's Metropolitan Transportation Authority would begin suspending service ""before the arrival of sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or higher."" ""A major concern given this type of storm is the possibility of prolonged power outages, as you know,"" he said. As Sandy churned northward, forecasters warned of high winds, strong tides and heavy rain, as well as potential snow, saying the storm would be strengthened by its collision with a wintry storm moving from the west. Early forecasting models show the tropical weather could make landfall in the Washington region as early as Monday, though it will more likely push farther north and slam the New York metropolitan area by Tuesday. Eastern portions of Ohio and Pennsylvania could get snow, while heavy rains are expected to blast the Eastern Seaboard. In Maryland, Gov. Martin O'Malley declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm. ""I urge all Marylanders to review their family emergency plans, make sure their emergency supplies like batteries and water are fully stocked and to stay informed,"" he said. Meanwhile in Connecticut, Avon Town Manager Brandon Robertson recalled the perils of last year's storm, which knocked out 90% of the town's power grid around Halloween. ""The town was in pretty tough shape,"" he said. ""I don't think anyone expected the level of devastation."" Robertson said he had his first emergency preparedness meeting Friday and that power companies, which were criticized for a slow response last year, have already started to prepare. ""We are stronger and better prepared to respond now,"" said Connecticut Light & Power spokeswoman Theresa Gilbert. Federal authorities warned those in the densely populated area that is the storm's predicted path to fill up on prescriptions, nonperishable foods, cash, bottled water, flashlights, extra batteries and first-aid kits. Farther south, Virginia's National Guard was authorized Friday to bring up to 300 personnel for possible recovery operations. Last year, Hurricane Irene inflicted major damage from North Carolina to New England, though largely spared New York, where Manhattan restaurants and bars hosted hurricane specials and parties. But in neighboring states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the storm had harsher effects, knocking out power for thousands and causing flooding. ""While Sandy's exact track is still uncertain, New Jersey has the potential to experience a major impact from high winds, heavy rain, flooding and power outages,"" said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""I encourage all of our families to stay informed, get ready and reach out to those you know who may be isolated or in need of extra assistance during adverse conditions."" Floods are considered the most frequent natural hazards in New Jersey and residents across Atlantic County could be seen Friday filling up sandbags in preparation. Meanwhile, utility companies across the region were also in preparation mode in the hopes of reducing the numbers of power outages brought on by a rush of inclement weather. ""We're bringing in all of our field people,"" said Rena Esposito, a spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas Company, New Jersey's largest utility firm. ""We're also making arrangements with other utility companies to be able to get support from other states if needed."" Last October, a powerful snowstorm left more than a million residents without power across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.

"New York (CNN) -- Timothy Haydock, an emergency room physician and Kennedy family friend, is expected to take the stand Thursday in the trial of the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Douglas Kennedy is accused of twisting one nurse's arm and kicking another in January as he tried to leave the maternity ward of a suburban New York hospital with his newborn son. Haydock, who was with Kennedy at the time of the incident, previously asserted that the ""nurses were the only aggressors"" and is considered a key witness for the defense. Nurses describe alleged assault by Kennedy son . His testimony is expected to fit the defense's narrative that Kennedy's actions, which were in part captured on hospital surveillance video, were the result of an overly aggressive hospital staff and the product of a father's instincts to protect his child. Judge John Donahue -- not a jury -- is hearing the case involving misdemeanor charges of harassment and child endangerment. Kicking off the trial, the two sides outlined significantly divergent scenarios of what happened at Northern Westchester Hospital. One of the nurses, Anna Lane, testified Monday that she'd initially reached in to hold open an elevator door to prevent Kennedy from leaving that way. When he headed toward a stairway door, she ran to it and put her hand on the doorknob. ""I had my hand behind my back and he grabbed my left hand -- which was on the doorknob -- and twisted my arm,"" said Lane. Kennedy raised his foot and kicked another nurse, Cari Luciano, who'd come to help before entering the stairway, Lane added. But he only got down as far as the next landing, where he was met by security. The defense team was tough on the nurse. Suggesting she had an ulterior motive given Kennedy's high profile, lawyer Robert Gottlieb questioned a tearful Lane why, if recounting her story was so emotionally difficult, she had recounted her version of what happened so soon after the incident on NBC's ""Today Show."" After Kennedy was arraigned in February, his attorney released a statement stating that nurses initially agreed to let him take the baby outside and demanding ""appropriate disciplinary action"" be taken against Lane and Luciano. Kennedy lawyer says nurses should be disciplined .","Douglas Kennedy is accused of twisting one nurse's arm and kicking another in January .

"(Oprah.com) -- Lives Other Than My Own . By Emmanuel Carrère . You'd have to call 2005 a very tough year for Emmanuel Carrère and his family: After barely escaping a tsunami while vacationing in Sri Lanka, they returned home to Paris to witness the death of Carrère's partner's sister. While Lives Other Than My Own (Metropolitan) might have been just another ""why me?"" memoir, it is, in the French novelist and biographer's hands, a wise study of the roots and rewards of altruism. With clear-eyed reporting, never-treacly compassion, and, yes, a healthy dose of French philosophizing, Carrère shows us how even the most self-obsessed can find grace and joy in the simplest acts of kindness. Oprah.com: The latest award winners: How many have you read? Birds of Paradise . By Diana Abu-Jaber . The Southern Florida of Birds of Paradise (Norton) is a ""temporary enchantment...people behave here in ways they never would back in Naperville and Houston and Scranton."" Maybe, but the problems that beset Miami's Muir family in Diana Abu-Jaber's affecting novel are all too common: Teenage daughter Felice has run away from home; 20-something son Stanley has just shown up with a pregnant girlfriend, demanding money; parents Avis, a pastry chef, and Brian, a real estate attorney, are facing their own marital and financial problems. While the beautiful, haunted Felice is the heart of this novel -- and her scenes in tattoo parlors, bars, and beaches the most compelling -- Abu-Jaber makes us wonder about more than what will happen to one girl with a guilty secret. What, after all, does it mean to be a family? Is love really ""exchangeable, malleable""? We can't help turning pages full of stunning prose to find out. Oprah.com: 5 books everyone should read at least once . Mr. Fox . By Helen Oyeyemi . In a make-believe world of talking animals and courtly love, you might expect a dastardly plot or two. But as Helen Oyeyemi's vibrant novel Mr. Fox (Riverhead) makes clear, even pretend danger can be dangerous. ""You're a villain,"" Mary, the literary muse of our antihero, the novelist St. John Fox, tells him. ""You kill women. You're a serial killer."" Mr. Fox doesn't share Mary's outrage, however. ""It's ridiculous to be so sensitive about the content of fiction,"" he protests. But Mary knows better, and she constructs an elaborate series of adventures to teach Mr. Fox some lessons about his attitudes toward life and love. Based in part on a classic French folk tale, these labyrinthine tales-within-a-tale show him -- and us -- a powerful truth: that even ideas born of our imagination matter in the real world. Oprah.com: Poetry that till get you through a hard time . The Arrogant Years . By Lucette Lagnado . With precision and searing honesty, Lucette Lagnado writes in The Arrogant Years (Ecco) about her torn allegiances as both an Egyptian Jew growing up in America in the 1960s and '70s and the youngest daughter of unhappily married parents. Her haunting 2007 memoir, The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit, explored the exile of her dashing father, Leon, who fled Cairo as Nasser came to power. Here, Lagnado focuses on her mother, Edith, whose story is at least as tragic, whose relationship with the daughter she called Loulou is even more complex. Having abandoned a prestigious career (as the private librarian to a wealthy Egyptian family) to marry Leon, Edith becomes a passive, resentfully submissive wife. But after the couple and their four children are forced to resettle in America, Edith shows a strong will, finding a job at a Brooklyn library and micromanaging Loulou's education. Yet Edith has no desire to assimilate. She desperately tries to hold her family together ""in this post-Cairo exile of ours where there were few standards and we all felt unmoored."" Loulou basks in the cosseting of her parents' immigrant community as a child, then pulls away in adolescence. But once successfully integrated into the secular society her parents resisted, Lagnado, a writer at the Wall Street Journal, finds herself nostalgic for her insular childhood -- ""forever yearning for that sense of absolute protection, that feeling of being watched over and loved."" Oprah.com: Books that made a difference to Kevin Spacey . The Forgotten Waltz . By Anne Enright . In America we like our adultery straight up: a bubble of illicit passion that ends in regret. That's not what Irish novelist Anne Enright is serving in The Forgotten Waltz (Norton), which forgoes the simple morality tale for something more complex and satisfying. The novel begins as the otherwise involved Gina first sees the love of her life, the also-spoken-for Seán. Detailing the standard stuff of clandestine affairs -- tawdry hotels, wife-stalking -- Enright does not hide the ugliness of betrayal. But her real story is about the once illicit lovers' fraught attempt to live as a family -- one that includes Seán's alarmingly strange preadolescent daughter, Evie. Casting aside cultural bromides about the immorality of affairs, Enright puts us squarely in the center of a terrible truth: Love can be miraculous -- and still destroy everything in its path.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Many Yemenis, like Egyptians, Libyans and others, have been provoked by media reports about a film called ""Innocence of Muslims"" that maligns the Prophet Mohammed. Last week, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Sanaa, and broke in. Clashes between security forces and demonstrators left at least four protesters dead and more than 30 people injured, according to Yemeni officials. Yemenis have many problems and difficulties in their daily lives. Nearly half of them live below the poverty line, almost seven million of them have no secure access to food, and they struggle to send their children to schools. Such desperate situations are worsened by the ghost of separation in the south, the Houthis militants in the north and threats from al Qaeda, which at times launch suicide attacks. In spite of these conditions, Yemenis feel hurt by the film mocking the prophet. It is difficult for many outside the country to understand why the film is inflammatory to Muslims: This, however, cannot be explained unless considered within its context. The Prophet Mohammed is regarded as the highest authority in Islam. Through him the teachings of Islam and principles are revealed and conveyed: therefore to depict him as ""womanizer"" or ""pedophile"" is to claim wickedness at the foundation of the faith. Besides, the content of the film is hostile, grossly inaccurate and prejudiced. It revealed the producer's attitude toward the prophet rather than the prophet's character. As such, Muslims felt insulted by such depiction of their prophet. But there is disagreement among Yemenis as to how they should react to the film. By talking to ordinary people, listening to preachers in the mosques and following posts and comments on Facebook, it seems that the mood of Yemenis can be divided into three. One group believes that the film is insulting and that it is their religious duty to protest against it. They encouraged people to protest: It was members of this group who gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy. The second group, despite being angry, reject violence as a means of protest. They view the embassy incident in Sanaa as an immoral act and believe there are ways to express anger without destroying property and plundering equipment. Such acts, they say, contradict the teachings and principles of Islam -- the religion of peace and tolerance. Members of this group are, in fact, plenty in number. The third group believe it was a kind of stupidity to show any reaction to the film and that it gives its producers the publicity they are looking for. They likened its production to terrorist attacks, through which publicity is intended more than destruction and casualties. Thus, the best way to ensure the film will fail is to completely ignore it. Yet still the film has triggered plenty of political disputes and arguments in Yemen, as well as the other countries of the Arab Spring. The remnants of deposed regimes have used it as a political tool to accuse revolutionary forces of being more concerned to preserve their alliance with the U.S. than to defend the prophet, and also allege that the Arab revolutions were planned and plotted by the U.S. through its allies in the area. As such, they say, the region's new governments, including that of Yemen, are no more than puppets of the U.S. administration. On the other hand, most of the revolutionaries believe the U.S. is not to blame for the film. During Friday prayers, one preacher in the mosque stated the film was intended to irritate Muslims and drive their anger against U.S. interests in the area. He encouraged Muslims to be rational than emotional. It is an exploitation of resources, he said, for a nation to confront an individual who wants to make a hero of himself on account of Muslims' resentment and anger. Yemenis generally do not consider such an attack on the prophet as demonstrating freedom of speech, the essence of democracy. Democracy, for them, does not justify the vilification of other beliefs, but to show respect for them. The Arab Spring showed that when Yemenis protest, they want justice and dignity, which are the core of democratic principles. The Arab Spring improved this situation because the U.S. demonstrated its support for the revolutionary movement in Yemen and other Arab countries. But Yemenis reject ""democracy"" such as this video, which allows the maligning of other faiths and beliefs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Murad Alazzany.","Yemen has witnessed protests amid anger at the video ""Innocence of the Muslims""

"(CNN) -- England international defender Ashley Cole turned goal scorer as his late winner at Stamford Bridge Saturday gave Chelsea a 1-0 win over Stoke City to stay top of the English Premier League. Cole was finding the net for the first time in over two years and he left it until the 85th minute, set up by a brilliant pass by Spain's Juan Mata. His team had been made to struggle by the battling visitors and looked set for a fourth game without a win in all competitions before the full back's late intervention. ""I had a few shots in the first half and took too much time on the ball with them, but this time, the first thing that came into my brain was to dink it and I just did it,"" Cole said. ""It is mentally good to get a lead in the league table."" Fernando Torres scuffed Chelsea's best chance but Stoke might have gone ahead in the first half when a Jonathan Walters' header hit the crossbar. The striker was also subjected to a strong challenge late in the game from Chelsea defender David Luiz, which left the Brazilian lucky to escape a straight red card. Luiz, who signed from Benfica last year, sealed a new five-year contract with the Blues later Saturday, extending his deal to 2017. ""It is a great club and I look forward to winning more trophies here. I want to play for a long time at the top level -- which is what playing for Chelsea means,"" he told the club's official website. Four wins from five league games have left Roberto Di Matteo's men three points clear of Everton, who secured an excellent 3-0 win at 10-man Swansea in the early kick off. Victor Anichebe and Kevin Mirallas put Everton 2-0 up by halftime and home hopes disappeared when substitute Nathan Dyer was sent off after the break. Belgian star Marouane Fellaini was rewarded for his fine efforts with a late third goal. He had set up Anichebe for the opener with a pass which TV replays indicated had been via his arm, but he was a constant thorn in the side of the home defense. West Bromwich Albion continued their fine start to the season with a 1-0 home win over promoted Reading, leaving them third in the early EPL standings. Southampton earned their first points of the season with a 4-1 thrashing of Aston Villa at St Mary's. Darren Bent put the visitors ahead in the first half but two goals from Rickie Lambert helped the Saints storm back after the break. A Nathan Clyne effort and an own goal from Ciaran Clark added to Villa's misery. In other matches, Hugo Rodallega scored against his old club as Fulham won 2-1 at Wigan, while Sunderland drew 1-1 at West Ham.

"(CNN) -- A huge British military base in one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan got a surprise arrival this week as a soldier gave birth to a baby boy. Britain's Ministry of Defence does not allow troops to deploy on operations if they are pregnant, but the ministry didn't know the woman was expecting. It refused to confirm reports in the British media that the soldier didn't know she was pregnant. The mother and baby at Camp Bastion are both in stable condition in a field hospital, the ministry said. That's the same camp where Britain's Prince Harry is stationed as an Apache helicopter pilot in the Taliban heartland of Helmand province. The ministry said the baby was born Tuesday -- four days after a dramatic raid on the base by well-trained Afghan insurgents dressed in U.S. military uniforms. The insurgents, working in three teams of five, infiltrated the base, killed two U.S. Marines, destroyed six jets and damaged others before most of them were killed. One attacker was wounded and captured, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. A medical team from John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, is preparing to go to Afghanistan to care for the mother, the hospital said Thursday. The mother and baby will be brought back to the United Kingdom for treatment and care, the ministry said. It could not confirm reports that the baby born at Camp Bastion was named Sebastian. It did not name the mother, whom British newspapers are saying is a gunner. The ministry could not immediately say whether babies had ever been born to British military personnel before in Afghanistan.

"New York (CNN) -- The 25-year-old man who jumped from a monorail car into the Bronx Zoo's tiger den was not drunk or insane, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. ""Apparently he has some fascination with tigers,"" Kelly told CNN affiliate WABC. ""He visited the zoo in the last month, month and a half, and focused on that area."" Kelly added there was no evidence Villalobos is mentally ill or was intoxicated. ""I don't think it was malicious,"" Kelly added. ""There was no indication he was drinking, but that he just ... momentarily lost any semblance of common sense."" David Villalobos, who is hospitalized in stable condition, told police ""his leap was definitely not a suicide attempt, but a desire to be one with the tiger,"" according to Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the NYPD. Villalobos was riding on the zoo's Wild Asia monorail around 3 p.m. Friday when he jumped out of the rail car, ""clearing the exhibit's perimeter fence"" and landing in the den, according to Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny. Villalobos suffered a broken right shoulder, broken rib, collapsed lung, broken ankle, broken pelvis and puncture wounds, according to police spokesman Brian Sessa. Villalobos later claimed to have pet one of the tigers before it backed off, Sessa added. The commissioner said most of Villalobos's injuries appear to be the result of the 17-foot fall from the monorail. Man in critical condition after jumping into Bronx Zoo's tiger pit . Police said Villalobos was charged with misdemeanor trespassing and will be arraigned after he leaves the hospital. He will not have a court appearance until January, according to the office of the Bronx district attorney. Zoo officials said rescuers used a fire extinguisher to separate the man and the animal. Heeding instructions, Villalobos rolled ""under a hot wire to safety,"" and the tiger backed off, Breheny said. The zoo uses so-called hot wires -- or electrically charged cables -- as training tools to keep animals away from such areas as plant beds. If the animal comes into contact with the wire, it feels a small electric shock. Villalobos' decision to follow instructions and roll under the wire ""probably saved his life,"" Breheny told reporters Friday. He was ""conscious and talking"" as he was taken by ambulance to Jacobi Medical Center in Bronx, New York. ""I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual he certainly had the time to do it,"" Breheny said. ""This is just an extraordinary occurrence that happened because ... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves."" The exhibit is called Tiger Mountain and houses Siberian tigers as well as Malayan tigers, according to the Bronx Zoo's website. The Bronx Zoo is the city's flagship park run by the Wildlife Conservation Society. Tigers' den jumper wanted 'to be one' with beast, police say .

"Changzhou, China (CNN) -- This is a bustling, modern Chinese city. Shoppers decked out in the last fashions prowl shining new shopping malls. It's about two hours drive from the glamorous metropolis of Shanghai, yet it's fair to say very few people outside of China have heard of it. But now, Changzhou has landed right in the middle of a U.S political firestorm. It's all about jobs: American jobs shipped to China. And it goes all the way to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. In a thriving industrial area on the outskirts of Changzhou is a factory run by Sensata Technologies. It makes sensors for cars. Sensata is controlled by the private equity firm Bain Capital, and that is where Romney comes in. Romney is one of the founders of Bain Capital. And although he left the company years before it bought Sensata, he can't escape the political fallout. Outside the Sensata factory gates, we managed to catch a group of workers on their lunch hour. We talked with them quickly to avoid drawing the attention of company security guards. I asked one worker whether he knows who Mitt Romney is. ""No,"" he said. ""You don't know who he is? He's running for president of the United States,"" I explained. ""Really? I don't know,"" he said. They may not be up to speed on U.S. politics here, but they know a lot about the economy, about how incomes are rising even if it is at the expense of American workers. ""It's determined by the market: Jobs go wherever labor is cheaper. It makes sense,"" one worker said. ""Do you like America?"" I asked another. ""So-so,"" he said. The American flag flew proudly at the gates of the Sensata plant, but the facility is also a symbol of Chinese economic power. Workers in Freeport, Illinois, say this is where their jobs are going, to factories just like this one in Changzhou. Angry American workers are camping in tents outside the Sensata plant in Freeport, protesting the planned closure of a place where they have worked for decades. The closure in December is set to wipe out 170 jobs. The workers say they suffer while the company profits from cheap Chinese labor. ""November 5 is scheduled to be my last day after 33 years,"" said one despondent employee. On Wednesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was one of 16 people arrested and charged with criminal trespass after they marched onto the Sensata property in Freeport. Jackson and the 15 other protesters were quickly released after being served with citations for trespassing. Workers at the Freeport facility have erected posters and placards putting the blame for the shutdown directly on Romney. The Republican candidate has pledged to play hard ball with China during his campaign. Time and again, he's criticized the ruling Communist Party, saying it deliberately keeps China's currency low to gain an advantage in exports. If elected, he says he will declare China a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency, raising the prospect of a trade war. But with an eye on events at Sensata, President Barack Obama has scoffed at Romney's claims of getting tough on China. Back in Changzhou, workers say America's loss is their gain. They say they enjoy good conditions and regular eight-hour shifts. But they won't reveal how much they are paid. ""That's a secret,"" one of them said as others laughed loudly. Among the Chinese workers, we see two Americans. They tell us they are in China on rotation. They say they are fully aware of the controversy over jobs at the company and concede that it is a complicated issue. Right now, they're just happy to be working themselves. ""I enjoy my job,"" one of them said.","Sensata, a subsidiary of Mitt Romney's former company Bain Capital, has a factory in China .

"(CNN)  -- Rescuers on Friday suspended the search for the 11 people missing from the oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard announced. ""After three days of constant searching, covering more than 5,200 square miles, we've reached the point where reasonable expectation of survivors has passed,"" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters Friday evening. The Coast Guard began notifying family of the missing that they were preparing to end the search early Friday afternoon, Landry said. The Coast Guard and the Minerals Management Service -- the agency that regulates the oil industry in federal waters -- are conducting an active search for casualties, she said. Earlier Friday, Landry said conversations with survivors of the blast that set the oil rig Deepwater Horizon ablaze Tuesday night indicate that the missing workers ""might have been in the vicinity of this explosion."" Landry said neither the Coast Guard nor BP PLC -- which leased the rig from Transocean Ltd. -- would release the names of the dead out of respect for the families. She said the workers were from Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. One person injured in the explosion remained hospitalized on Friday, Landry said. She said the person is ""doing well"" but is expected to stay in the hospital for seven to 10 days. Landry said crews were continuing efforts to clean up a 1- by 12-mile-long oil slick spreading through Gulf waters 40 miles offshore. She said crude oil did not appear to be leaking out of the wellhead, located 5,000 feet below the water's surface. But remote vehicles will continue surveying the scene, she said. ""We are at the ready to respond should something happen,"" she said. ""We're going to be very forward-leaning. We can't back off from this at all."" The Coast Guard is still attempting to locate the rig, and two nearby underwater pipelines -- one owned by the Shell oil company -- have been shut down in case there is a collision, Landry said. The closest other rig is more than eight miles away, she said. BP officials said Thursday they did not know whether oil or fuel was leaking from the sunken rig. But BP Vice President David Rainey said, ""It certainly has the potential to be a major spill."" Crews had recovered 181 barrels of an oil-and-water mixture by midday Friday, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashley Butler said. Some of the oil had evaporated from the water's surface, she said, but about 200 barrels remained. The Coast Guard said it was also keeping a close eye on activity underwater. It would take about nine days for the oil to reach the shore, but the Coast Guard plans to clean up any spills before that happens, Butler said. The rig -- a mobile unit that moves to different locations in the Gulf of Mexico -- was about 52 miles southeast of Venice, Louisiana, when the explosion occurred Tuesday night. There were no indications it was a terrorist incident, the Coast Guard said. Officials said 126 people were on board at the time of the explosion. Of the 115 accounted-for workers, 17 injured were evacuated by helicopter from the rig. An additional 94 people were taken to shore with no major injuries, and four more were transferred to another vessel, according to the Coast Guard. The rig had been drilling for oil in its current location since January, said Eileen Angelico, a spokeswoman for Minerals Management Service. Angelico said the agency has begun interviewing people involved in the incident as it seeks to determine what caused Tuesday night's blast.","NEW: ""Reasonable expectation of survivors has passed"" Coast Guard rear admiral says .

"(CNN) -- England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere looks set to finally end his nightmare year after making a return to first-team training. The 20-year-old missed the entire of last season after suffering an ankle injury during a pre-season friendly in August 2011. He then suffered a setback earlier this year and was forced to undergo surgery on his knee in May. Wilshere's agent, Si Bayliff, tweeted: ""Delighted to say that Jack Wilshere was back in full 1st team training today. ""Understandably he is a very excited young man."" However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unlikely to rush Wilshere back into action immediately with his side enjoying an impressive start to the season. Spain winger Cazorla joins Arsenal from Malaga . The Gunners sit third in the Premier League after four games and defeated French champions Montpellier in their opening Champions League fixture on Tuesday. Wilshere is instead expected to play for the club's Under-21 side against West Bromwich Albion on October 1 or against Reading a week later. ""It's been 14 months and that's a long time for someone at his age,"" Wenger told the club's official website. ""It's an eternity, but it's great news. We have to give him a few training sessions to see how he copes and responds to it. ""That's the delicate, sensitive stage -- to choose when to bring him in and out. We'll have to handle that day by day."" Arsenal has also been encouraged by the news that Emmanuel Frimpong has returned to training after recovering from an anterior cruciate knee ligament injury he picked up during last season's loan spell at Wolves. Wenger said: ""We also have Emmanuel Frimpong who has returned to full training this week, which is great news as well. ""Emmanuel has also been out a long time, but is progressing well.""","Jack Wilshere has not played for 14 months .

"(CNN) -- The last space shuttle to grace the skies, Endeavour, ended two decades of glorious flights Friday, wowing onlookers as it descended onto a runway at Los Angeles International Airport atop a modified Boeing 747 jet at 12:51 p.m. PT. A crowd 5,000-strong, according to the Los Angeles County office of emergency management, gathered on a bluff overlooking the airport to watch Endeavour's low-altitude flyover and final touchdown. Daniela Derderian brought her son Michael, 7, and her daughter, Angela, 5, to the landing. ""It's a piece of history. It's the closing of an era,"" she said. ""I remember when the Columbia exploded. This is like the end of an era of man traveling in space, especially with Neil Armstrong just dying."" Endeavour, ferried by jet, lifted off for the last time at 8:17 a.m. PT on Friday, leaving Edwards Air Force Base, California,for a farewell tour through the Golden State's skies over Sacramento, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. NASA had delayed Friday's takeoff by an hour hoping to reach San Francisco under clearer skies, according to the space agency's website. It was the final leg of a three-day, three-stage cross-country trip that NASA designed to show off Endeavour in the sky to the American public. The space agency encouraged onlookers to share their sightings of the airborne spectacle on social media via the hashtags #spottheshuttle and #OV105, the later being Endeavour's ""vehicle designation."" Endeavour will need to be removed from its perch atop the Boeing 747 that carried it cross-country from Florida's Kennedy Space Center. Its final destination is the California Science Center in Los Angeles, where it will go on display for posterity. Endeavour, along with Discovery, Enterprise and Atlantis, became a museum piece after NASA ended its 30-year shuttle program in July 2011. All four shuttles have been permanently retired from service. NASA said Endeavour will be moved via roads on October 12-13 to its final spot at the science museum. On Thursday, it flew low over Tucson, Arizona, where Mark Kelly, who was the commander on the last Endeavour mission, watched with his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, before touching down at Edwards Air Force Base in California. ""The space shuttle is really a testament to American engineering and ingenuity,"" he told CNN affiliate KOLD. ""It is the most amazing spacecraft ever built, by far."" His wife had watched the launch of his mission but missed the landing, so it was great for her to see the shuttle in the air, he added. Two other shuttles -- Challenger and Columbia -- were destroyed in accidents that killed all aboard. Challenger exploded shortly after launch in 1986, and Columbia broke apart upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 2003. Watch: Trees removed to make way for Endeavour . Endeavour's three-day piggyback flight was divided into three legs that could be described as scenic routes to showcase the shuttle to the public from coast to coast. Wednesday's leg took Endeavour to Houston, with flyovers along Florida's Space Coast, Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. As Endeavour bid farewell to Kennedy Space Center, it elicited strong emotions from people -- such as CNN iReporter Randy Lathrop of Cocoa, Florida -- who have lived with the shuttle program nearby for decades. ""It's the last time that she'll ever be at her home base again. It strikes a chord of nostalgia in you because she's done so many flights from the space center. This is her home,"" Lathrop said. A short history of Endeavour . Named for the first ship commanded by British explorer James Cook, Endeavour rolled out of an assembly plant in Palmdale, California, in 1991 at a cost of $1.7 billion. It was the baby of the shuttle fleet, built as a replacement for Challenger. Over the next 20 years, Endeavour flew some of the most high-profile shuttle missions, covering 25 flights and nearly 123 million miles. It flew a Spacelab mission and numerous International Space Station assembly missions and rendezvoused with Russia's Mir Space Station. Read more space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese authorities trying to stave off meltdowns at an earthquake-damaged nuclear power plant reported more grim news Tuesday as radiation levels soared following another explosion at an overheating reactor. The risk of further releases of radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains ""very high,"" Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday. In addition to an explosion at the No. 2 reactor, the building housing the No. 4 unit -- which had been shut down before Friday's earthquake -- was burning Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced. The plant's owners, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, evacuated all but about 50 of their workers from the plant following Tuesday's explosion at the No. 2 reactor. Radiation levels at the plant have increased to ""levels that can impact human health,"" Edano said -- between 100 and 400 millisieverts, or as much as 160 times higher than the average dose of radiation a typical person receives from natural sources in a year. Evacuations have already been ordered for anyone living within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of the plant, and Edano said anyone between 20 and 30 kilometers (between 12.5-18.6 miles) should remain indoors. At least 500 residents were believed to have remained within the 20-kilometer radius Monday evening, Edano said. Edano spoke more than four hours after an explosion at the No. 2 reactor, the third blast in four days. The cooling system at that unit was damaged by a hydrogen explosion at the No. 3 unit on Monday, and workers had been attempting to keep temperatures at unit 2 in check by pumping seawater into the reactor ever since. The ""explosive impact"" took place shortly after 6 a.m. Tuesday (5 p.m. Monday ET), TEPCO said. Pressure readings indicated some damage to the No. 2 reactor's suppression pool, a donut-shaped reservoir at the base of the reactor containment vessel. ""We are continuing the water injection into the pressure vessels, but the operators who are not directly engaged in this operation are being evacuated to safer locations,"" a TEPCO executive told reporters at a news conference Tuesday morning. Monday's hydrogen explosion at reactor No. 3 injured 11 people, Japanese authorities said. A similar hydrogen explosion on Saturday blew the roof off the containment structure around the No. 1 reactor and hurt four people. Edano said earlier that he could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at all three troubled reactors at the plant. The buildup of hydrogen in the reactor vessels is ""the first sign that things are going haywire,"" said Kenneth Bergeron, a physicist who used to work at the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. The release of radioactive material such as cesium, a reactor byproduct that has been detected outside the Fukushima Daiichi plant, is another, he said. ""What is fairly clear, from the release of hydrogen and the fission products, is that all of these reactors have probably had fuel rods exposed for significant periods of time over a portion of their length,"" Bergeron told CNN. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Tuesday that up to 2.7 meters (8.8 feet) of the No. 2 reactor's control rods -- about half -- have been uncovered. Authorities began pumping a mix of sea water and boron into the No. 2 reactor after Monday's explosion, as they have been doing with units 1 and 3. But the pump ran low on fuel when workers left it unattended, and the water soon burned off and exposed the reactor's fuel rods, allowing them to emit levels of heat and steam that can melt the reactor's core. When that problem was resolved, Edano said, a new problem sent the water levels plummeting again. A valve that was supposed to be open to allow the heat and steam to escape was closed, causing pressure to build up inside the reactor building, according to TEPCO. But pumping had resumed by early Tuesday, Edano said. If the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario that experts who have spoken to CNN say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant, and possibly release radiation into the atmosphere or water. That could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems, experts say. But Bergeron said that while it is likely the reactor cores have been damaged, ""it will have to get a lot hotter"" for the dense uranium in the reactor's fuel rods to melt down. That would give authorities and the surrounding population time to prepare. ""I believe they would be able to tell from various signals having to do with release of radioactivity and other things that things were a lost cause, you might say, and they might start initiating additional evacuations,"" Bergeron said. ""There would be warning, but we're talking massive, massive responses required,"" he added. About 200,000 people have evacuated the area following a government order over the weekend. And low levels of radiation were detected at least as far as 100 miles (about 160 kilometers) northeast of the plant, according to the U.S. Navy, which repositioned ships and planes after detecting low-level ""airborne radioactivity."" Tests also detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, but no further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. The Navy said the maximum potential radiation dose received by any ship personnel when it passed through the area was ""less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun."" The United States has sent a team of 10 experts from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including two cooling experts, to assist the Japanese, the NRC announced Monday night. Two were sent Saturday, and the rest left Monday, the agency reported. NRC Chairman Greg Jaczko said Japan has asked for additional types of equipment that will help provide water and keep the reactors cool. But based on the reactor design and nature of the accident, there is very low probability of any harmful radiation levels reaching the United Sates, including Hawaii and U.S. Pacific territories, Jaczko said. CNN's Stan Grant, Steven Jiang, and Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","NEW: Dangerous levels of radiation reported at Fukushima Daiichi .

"(CNN) -- Football's global governing body FIFA has licensed two manufacturers to install goal-line technology in stadiums across the world. FIFA announced in October it had approved the use of technology which would help officials decide whether or not a goal had been scored, with providers GoalRef and Hawk-Eye now licensed to produce their respective systems. Both companies were tested between October 2011 and June 2012 and have been inspected in simulated and real-life match situations. The technology will be used for the first time at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup in December. British company Hawk-Eye is already well established within sport. The technology is already used in both tennis and cricket. GoalRef has been developed by German research institute Fraunhofer and involves using magnetic strips inside the ball to detect whether or not it has crossed the goal line. However, both GoalRef and Hawk-Eye's technology must now pass a stadium test before either system can be used in a match. ""Once a system has been installed in a stadium, the system undergoes a final inspection to check its functionality,"" read a statement on FIFA's website. ""This is carried out by an independent test institute, and the results of this so-called 'final installation test' must be successful. Only a positive final installation test qualifies a system to be used in official matches."" While other sports embraced goal-line technology, football dithered over its introduction. FIFA chief Sepp Blatter was only finally convinced of the need to provide technological help for referees after England were not awarded a goal despite Frank Lampard's shot clearly bouncing inside the goal during a 4-1 defeat by Germany in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. However, Michel Platini, head of European football's lawmakers UEFA, remains a staunch opponent of the use of technology in football. UEFA has confirmed goal-line technology will not be used in European competitions such as the Europa League and the Champions League. Europe's continental competitions will instead persist with the use of extra officials behind the goal to inform the referee's decisions. The English Football Association is a well-known advocate of goal-line technology, although Tuesday's announcement has come too late for either system to be used in this season's FA Cup.","FIFA award licenses to goal-line technology developers GoalRef and Hawk-Eye .

"Connecticut (CNN) -- Throughout my travels with UNICEF -- from Angola, to Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Sudan and Uganda -- I have met countless young girls and boys whose bodies and minds have been permanently damaged because they were malnourished during the first 1,000 days of their lives. Around 170 million children under the age of five are stunted -- their bodies and brains cannot develop to full capacity. A stunted child has difficulty in learning and in surviving. Such children are up to four times more likely to die from all causes -- including easily preventable diseases. Read more: Child stunting a 'silent emergency,' says Beckham . For too long, stunting has been a silent crisis -- a personal tragedy for each family. But the suffering of some 170 million children constitutes a global catastrophe that calls for an urgent response. Traveling for UNICEF for over more than a decade, my focus has been on countries -- particularly in Africa -- that are being impacted by conflict including the Darfur region, South Sudan, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- areas convulsed by violence. I have met countless families who have nothing to eat because they are on the run often hiding deep in the bush. Read more: Indian state's battle to build up its babies . But it is not only conflict that is leaving children so vulnerable. Last February, I paid a second visit to the sand swept town of Mao in the west of Chad along the belt of the Sahel. Drought, failed crops and skyrocketing food prices have left people with little to nothing to eat. Mothers carry emaciated children long distances across the sand to reach UNICEF-supported health centers for life-saving fortified foods. Often it is too late. At this moment one million children throughout the Sahel region of Africa are at risk of dying. They are in urgent need of our support. Wherever there is poverty, it is the children who pay the highest price. But here is a story of hope. When I visited Haiti before the earthquake, the stunting rates had been stubbornly high -- about 31%. Then, on January 12, 2010, the earthquake struck causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries. The devastation affected three million people, two thirds of them children. But the Haitian government and the international community joined forces and in just two years something extraordinary resulted. That stubborn stunting rate dropped to 23%. There is more work to do, but we can see that even in challenging circumstances it is possible to work together to ensure that the world's most vulnerable children, pregnant women and mothers have access to food and drinkable water. Wherever I go, I am always struck by the children. In the face of their courage, resilience and hope, I don't see how we can allow ourselves the luxury of feeling overwhelmed or helpless. We have the tools, we know what must be done. In the name of some 170 million children let's pull together and end the obscenity of hunger and stunting.","170 million children worldwide suffer stunting due to malnutrition .

"(CNN) -- A top British police officer being investigated over a cover-up in connection with the death of 96 people in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989 has resigned, his force said Wednesday. Sir Norman Bettison was with South Yorkshire Police at the time of the crush at Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium, and worked on an internal inquiry into what happened. Bettison has been under growing pressure since an independent report published last month was heavily critical of the role played by the police and emergency services. In response, Britain's police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, launched a criminal investigation into police misconduct -- saying the report ""revealed extremely serious and troubling issues for the police."" Bettison's resignation as Chief Constable of the West Yorkshire Police is effective immediately, the force said in a statement Wednesday. He had held the position since 2006. Media attention and the investigation by the IPCC were ""proving to be a huge distraction for the force,"" the West Yorkshire Police Authority said . Bettison said he had hoped to stay in his post to address the allegations against him, but was urged by the West Yorkshire Police Authority and others to stand down now. ""I do so not because of any allegations about the past, but because I share the view that this has become a distraction to policing in West Yorkshire now and in the future,"" he said. Bettison said he had ""always felt the deepest compassion and sympathy for the families"" of the Hillsborough victims and he shares their desire to know the truth about what happened. ""I have never blamed the fans for causing the tragedy,"" he said. Bettison said he would cooperate fully with the criminal and IPCC investigations into the police handling of the disaster. The crush at Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium on April 15, 1989, has cast a lasting shadow over Liverpool and the surrounding Merseyside area. The families of those killed and injured have battled for two decades to get to the truth about what happened on that awful day, with the report by the independent panel a key step along that road. The Hillsborough Independent Panel found there had been ""strenuous attempts"" by police to deflect responsibility for the disaster to Liverpool fans by falsely claiming they were drunk and aggressive. Its analysis also revealed that changes were made by South Yorkshire Police to police statements to remove and alter comments unfavorable to their organization. As many as 41 of those crushed could have survived had the emergency services' response been better, the panel concluded -- something that the families of the victims had long suspected. The tragedy occurred when thousands of fans were let through a gate into an already crowded standing area, leading many to be crushed against metal fences and concrete walls. Horrifying images from the scene showed panicked men, women and children pushed and trampled with nowhere to go as police lost control of the crowd. The impact of English football's darkest day lives on in the tributes still paid by Liverpool to its lost sons and daughters, husbands and fathers. But the tragedy also forced the sport to change on a national basis, and in a way still felt today, with stadiums modernized and made more family friendly, leading in turn to greater investment from sponsors and TV broadcasters.

"(CNN) -- This was Rick Santorum's first debate with front-runner status. That means it was his time to get grilled like a fine Kansas City steak. And I wouldn't say he came out of it like a filet. Even though his rivals missed some opportunities to press their case against the former senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum couldn't escape the barbecue. It was his old nemesis, Ron Paul, who had the most damning attacks. Perhaps we should have expected Paul, who has been arguing with Santorum ever since the first debates, to be the most prepared. After all, they have been sparring for more than six months. Paul began the debate by calling Santorum a fake. And he didn't shy away from it. One issue was the fact that Santorum voted for No Child Left Behind. Paul was arguing that Santorum couldn't control the deficit and cited the expense of No Child Left Behind as one example. Paul's best line came after Santorum compared his conservative record to other members of Congress -- the Texas lawmaker said the American people are sick of Congress, so it's a ""cop-out"" to compare yourself to them. He said Santorum had no credibility since he acted one way while in the Senate but argued for a different policy while running for president. I thought this was damning enough, but then later in the debate, Santorum stepped in deeper when he said he voted for No Child Left Behind even though it was against his beliefs, calling politics a team sport and saying he had been supporting President George W. Bush in that vote. I don't think he understood that he fed right into the critique Paul was making about Santorum's credibility and sticking with principle. (Did anyone find it ironic that the one word Santorum used to describe himself in the debate was ""courage""?) Paul countered that the idea of ""team sport"" is the problem with Washington. One's obligation should be to his or her oath of office and not to the party. There was another moment when Paul was on the offensive but failed to take full advantage of his position. Paul reminds me of so many debaters I've watched over the years who see an opening but don't quite know what to do with it. Paul correctly noticed a problem with Santorum's support for Title X, which funds family planning programs, coupled with Santorum's braggadocio solution of creating and voting for Title XX abstinence programs. To his credit, Paul mentioned that Title XX costs money too and, in his view, also overstepped the bounds of the federal government's rightful role. But he could have completed the argument with just a bit more thought. I've always loved the ""rephrase"" in debates. It is an incredibly effective and persuasive tool. I wanted to see Paul rephrase Santorum's position. Watch how easy it would have been: ""Rick Santorum now claims that he voted for one costly and intrusive measure (Title X) but made up for it by introducing another costly and intrusive measure (Title XX). Only in Washington do two wrongs make a right."" Santorum was in a trap, but Paul didn't know how to spring the dang thing. While the attacks weakened Santorum's debating performance, there were even more missed opportunities to score against him. These Republican presidential debates have demonstrated that it usually takes at least two full debates of being the front-runner before your opponents figure out the most effective attacks. Think back to Herman Cain and 9-9-9 (seems so long ago), or to Mitt Romney and the South Carolina debates or to Newt Gingrich and the Florida debates. Each time a front-runner was singled out by multiple other candidates over a series of debates, that front-runner faltered. But 9-9-9, ""RomneyCare"" and moon colonies were all ideas that escaped their first debate critiques before being skewered in a second attempt. My point is that Santorum is fortunate there aren't any more debates before Super Tuesday, because I think the other candidates would fare even better. Santorum had a couple of weaknesses in this debate that weren't challenged enough. These include the role of women in combat (where he all but said he would overrule the decisions of the military leaders if he disagreed with them), his vote in support of the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" (in how many elections will this be an issue?) and his oddly contradictory stance on contraception (he is against it while railing on the negative consequences of teen pregnancy and children born out of wedlock). On Wednesday night, Santorum was on the defensive, and so he was unable to make his best case for president. Gingrich, Romney and Paul all succeeded because they had strong debates, and they stayed, for the most part, out of the fire. There's only one debate left on the schedule, March 19. If it takes place, who will the front-runner be by then? Whoever it is, he will need to be more prepared to debate in my backward-step-pivot-forward technique. The football adage is that defense wins championships, and that could be the case. But it sure doesn't win any presidential debates. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is running against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, but the economy may truly be his greatest opponent. ""It's not the only factor, but it's arguably the most important factor,"" said George Washington University associate professor John Sides, who has created a computer model to analyze the impact of the economy on the presidential campaign. ""The forecasting model suggests a very close race with maybe a slight edge to Obama, but not necessarily a large edge -- nothing he can be very confident in,"" Sides said. Obama faces a perfect storm that threatens to sink his prospects of a second term. The price of gas is dropping but is still high. The stock market remains volatile, unemployment ticked up again, and the eurozone crisis lingers. In a brief statement Friday after which he also took a few questions, Obama described the depth of the nation's troubled economic recovery. ""The hole we have to fill is much deeper, and the global aftershocks are much greater,"" he said. Sides has crunched the numbers, using the president's approval ratings, economic conditions and consumer confidence. He compares those factors to past presidential races. What his models show him is that the president is facing similar conditions to what former President Jimmy Carter faced when he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980, with one exception: Carter was less popular than Obama among his own party. ""The president can count on a reservoir of support in his own party that previous Democratic presidents may not have been able to count on,"" Sides said. The gloomy news adds to the national frustration and could weigh on some voters. ""The best thing the president can hope for is not just a good economy but good economic headlines,"" Sides said. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, most Americans have doubts about which of the two presidential candidates can fix the problem. But a slight majority, 50% to 44%, says Romney has the right kind of business experience for the task, despite attacks by the Obama campaign on the former Massachusetts governor's record at private equity firm Bain Capital. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Romney uses the slow recovery to cast the president as a failure who is in over his head and frequently defaults to the blame game. ""The president's message in all this -- have you heard his campaign slogan? Forward! Forward! Forward over a cliff,"" Romney joked with supporters at a campaign event in Council Bluffs, Iowa. ""He is looking around; he is trying to find someone to blame."" To help lift the economy and his campaign too, Obama is putting pressure on Congress to pass items on his ""to-do"" list, even though Republicans aren't likely to act anytime soon.","Professor creates computer model to judge economy's effect on Obama's campaign .

"(CNN) -- A former prison guard responsible for leaking videos purportedly showing the abuse of prisoners at a penitentiary in the former Soviet republic of Georgia said Friday that he witnessed such torture on a daily basis since 2005. ""While working in prison, I used to witness beating of prisoners, torture of prisoners, humiliation of prisoners on an everyday basis,"" Vladimir Bedukadze told CNN. The acts were recorded in four videos that were made public this week and show prisoners being physically and sexually assaulted, humiliated and verbally abused by prison officers. Purported prison abuse videos prompt outrage in Georgia . Bedukadze left the country three months ago and is now seeking political asylum in Belgium in the wake of the tapes' release. Georgia television stations, including TV9, broadcast the videos Tuesday night. The faces of those being filmed were obscured. One man cries out while he is being raped with a broom handle. Another video shows an inmate being punched. Bedukadze slammed the administration of President Mikheil Saakashvili, accusing the leader of allowing a ""campaign of torture, humiliation"" under former Interior Minister Bacho Akhalaia. ""I have been working in the system since 2001, but since 2005 when Akhalaia was put in charge, he introduced his criminal elements of leadership,"" Bedukadze said. Akhalaia resigned his post Thursday after the videos' release prompted outrage both inside and outside the Eurasian country. Georgia's minister of corrections and legal assistance has also stepped down. And Saaskashvili himself condemned the abuse, saying Wednesday that what occurred at Gldani No. 8 penitentiary in Tbilisi is ""a horrific affront to human rights and human dignity."" Bedukadze said he had been collecting the footage for more than a year. ""When I realized that I could not take it any more, I decided to reveal it and depart for Europe,"" he said, calling for Saakashvili to resign and accusing the president of establishing ""a criminal government with the leadership of Akhalaia."" His comments echo a key allegation made by Georgia's opposition, which says senior government officials sanctioned the abuse. Saakashvili has said an active investigation is under way into those responsible, with some arrests already taking place. The country's interior ministry on Tuesday blamed certain prison employees for the degrading treatment. The ministry said a prisoner at the facility offered ""substantial reimbursement"" to employees for their actions and the video recordings. Its statement did not elaborate on the prisoner's motivation. The interior ministry identified that prisoner as Tamaz Tamazashvili, father-in-law of Irlakli Garibashvili, a member of the opposition Georgian Dream party. Garibashvili said Tamazashvili's life was in danger and that he was being held ""hostage"" by the president. Tamazashvili had nothing to do with the taped incidents, Garibashvili said. Bedukadze insisted that he has no political motivations for releasing the videos, and said he is not affiliated with any political party. ""They made up a lie that I was paid by the opposition leader ... and meant to use it to benefit the opposition. This was not my goal. I left the country independently,"" he said. Meanwhile Friday, the United Nations added its voice to a chorus of condemnation over the abuse. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights called on the Georgia government to ensure that these allegations are ""promptly, impartially and effectively investigated and that perpetrators are brought to justice,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. ""We condemn the acts of torture and ill-treatment perpetrated against inmates at a prison and a juvenile detention facility in Georgia,"" Colville added. He said the victims must have access to medical and psychological support. Interim Interior Minister Eka Zghuladze said that the country has built strong state institutions over the years and that all torture will be eradicated. The country's prisons were notoriously corrupt places where organized crime ruled, but those days are over, she said, citing personal experience. ""I allow myself to state this, as 18 years ago, I myself was the victim of police violence, and therefore, I am fully aware of my words and situation that we have in Georgia today,"" Zghuladze said. Torture is absolutely prohibited under human rights law, Colville said in Geneva, and Georgia has ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture. He praised the condemnation of the videos by Georgia's president and urged the government to stand by its promise to investigate all alleged human rights abuses, not just the ones exposed this week.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's famed yoga guru, Baba Ramdev, ended his hunger strike Tuesday, a day after he was briefly detained at a New Delhi stadium for protesting alleged government corruption. Ramdev's anti-corruption fast started on August 9 and ended Tuesday at the same stadium where he had been detained. The end to the fast was televised as many watched the bearded yoga teacher sip what appeared to be lemon juice. Ramdev, whose yoga television programs have been watched by millions, is seeking repatriation of Indian money he says is stashed in foreign banks. He has also criticized the ruling Congress party, blaming it for chronic graft. On Monday, police briefly detained Ramdev after he tried to lead an anti-corruption march toward the national parliament building, police said. He was transported to the stadium, where he was detained for hours. Ramdev and his supporters stayed overnight at the venue despite being released. He ended his protest fast and left the stadium with his supporters Tuesday after police told him to leave because of security concerns ahead of India's Independence Day on Wednesday. During the protest Monday, several senior politicians from the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance joined Ramdev. Ramdev also voiced a stinging assessment of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his handling of corruption allegations. A government official offered his own criticism. ""Ramdev has lost his identity as a fighter. He has now succumbed to the pressure of (the) BJP and also the NDA partners. There is no doubt about it. To that extent he has completely lost his credibility,"" federal minister M. Veerappa Moily told reporters Tuesday.","Baba Ramdev was released after short detention Monday, police spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The past few days have been difficult for Mitt Romney. His setbacks include the release of a secret video in which he said 47% of Americans thought of themselves of victims; the news that his campaign is not as cash-stashed as some had anticipated; and the latest poll numbers that show President Barack Obama widening his lead in some swing states, including Ohio. The smart money is betting on Obama to capture a second term, and it's easy to see why. He leads most major public opinion polls nationally and in the key swing states, and he has many more paths to a majority of 270 in the Electoral College. The probability is that Obama will emerge with a victory. But we're six weeks out. Theoretically, a lot can happen, some of it driven by the candidates and their campaigns. Could smart decisions, combined with a few favorable circumstances, propel Romney to an upset victory? We can all come up with fantastical scenarios involving international or domestic crises that would cause a plurality of Americans to say ""no more four years"" for the president. Occasionally, these things happen, as they did to first-term Democratic President Jimmy Carter. A dramatically shrinking economy, sky-high interest and inflation rates and the agony of the Iranian hostage crisis swamped his ship of state in 1980. But let's be more realistic. From now until Election Day, Romney's chances to surprise us will largely be dependent on the debates as well as his ability to better capitalize on the relatively weak economy. Goodness knows Romney has been practicing enough for the three debates scheduled to be held October 3, 16 and 22. Inevitably, the Republican has some zingers prepared that will bring down the house -- well, the Republican side of it. Opinion: Republicans risk being the party of mean . The key is to weave a larger narrative about what he will assert are ""Obama's broken promises and failures"" that can persuade the nation to do what it has been historically reluctant to do: send an incumbent packing. Romney has to employ outrage to energize his base yet use a tone that communicates more sorrow than anger that ""it just hasn't worked out as we had all hoped it would four years ago."" Ronald Reagan scored a knockout in his 1980 debate with Carter, and John Kerry landed enough hard punches to stun President George W. Bush in 2004's first debate. Can Romney measure up? And can the debates become intriguing enough to draw an audience that consists of more than confirmed Republican and Democratic partisans who tune in to cheer for their side? It's not easy to do in a polarized year when voters are dug in and as many as 95% of those who will cast a ballot have made at least a tentative presidential choice. Aside from the debates, Romney's best path to triumph is to portray himself relentlessly as an exceptionally qualified ""Mr. Fix It"" on the economy and to make hay of the economic reports still to come, assuming they contain bad news. Growth is still very slow, and the unemployment picture is unlikely to brighten before the election. The final jobs report will be released on the Friday before the Tuesday election; a disappointing number could enable Romney to win over a disproportionate share of the remaining undecided voters, though there might be few left. Romney has another advantage. He might benefit from the news media's desire for drama. Even though Republicans see the news media, on the whole, as biased toward Obama, most journalists aren't keen on a cut-and-dried presidential contest. Opinion: Why do the Romneys pay so little in taxes? For ratings purposes, if nothing else, they want a close, competitive race where the momentum goes back and forth. Otherwise, it will be 40 days and nights in the desert, much like it was in the numbing, dramaless 1996 match-up between President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Sen. Bob Dole. To win against the rising odds, Romney and his team have to exceed expectations in many ways and run the near-perfect campaign that has eluded them so far. That's very hard to achieve, but American electoral history is dotted with astonishing comebacks that defied the predictions of experts. It is not impossible that 2012 could record yet another. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Larry J. Sabato.","Larry Sabato: The past few days have been tough for Mitt Romney's campaign .

"(Wired) -- Being a tech dad is a curse. We are always chasing the latest and greatest that tech minds are producing despite our economic status, how many kids we have or whether or not the CFO at home (the wife) will approve. We want it. We need to have it. We don't want to wait. We don't care what it costs. Some gadgets are are more valuable than others -- to you personally and professionally. That's why I think the iPad is a must-have for all parents. I firmly believe that it was secretly made with kids in mind. Not only is the iPad a great tool for business needs, it's also the secret weapon of parenting. Other than the obvious -- games, education and creativity -- there's a slew of reasons why I think the iPad was created for kids -- at least tech-tech loving adults with kids. Reason #1: Your kids are going to get on your nerves . Every parent has been there. You're in a restaurant, out shopping or even chillin' at home when your kid has a breakdown of sorts. They are uncontrollable. They won't zip it up no matter what the heck you do or say. Just when you're about to flip your lid, bust out the iPad. It's like using duct tape to cover their mouths -- but legal of course. The secret weapon app in this case, of course, has to be ""Angry Birds."" The very addictive game is simple for even your toddlers to play. My four year old is obsessed with ""Angry Birds"" and even pressured my wife and me to get the plush toys. She's that obsessed. Reason #2: They are bound to ask, ""Are we there yet?"" Epic car drives are the death of any parent's sanity. If you're lucky enough, your kids will pass out from the humming of the tires against the asphalt. However, when (and I really mean when), your kid flies off the handle because they can't take another three hours before you get to Grandma's house, bust out the iPad and get back to the tranquility of wheels on asphalt. In terms of car-ride iPad savers, I'd have to suggest the instant classic ""Paper Toss,"" ""Little Things"" or ""LunchBox."" Reason #3: They always want you to read them a book at the most inopportune time . Kids love books. That's all good. What's not cool is when it's your time to put the little rascals to bed and they want you to read a book as you're watching the game. Of course, when you say, ""go pick out a book,"" they pick our the ""War and Peace"" of bedtime stories. In this situation, there are a slew of kids books for the iPad that are animated, do voiceovers, etc. You can slap on the game, put it on mute and let bedtime stories get autopiloted. Night-night, kiddos. The app that my kids seem to prefer is the ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" interactive book. With some voiceover and animation, it is an entertaining book for the kids and goes by pretty quickly so you can tuck the little rascals in and head back to the couch for the game. Reason #4: Mother Nature likes to ruin family plans . We've all been there. You and the family have outdoor plans for the weekend and mother nature decides to dump three inches of rain over your parade. You're stuck in the house and for the first 24 hours, the kids are good to go. However, promises of rollercoaster rides, cotton candy and games has turned into a long couch jockey session that turns the kids into anxious, rambunctious and pesky kids. A weekend stuck in the house comes with a breaking point and it's your job as a dad to know when that is. When you sense it coming, break out the iPad and fire up ""Smurf's Village,"" ""Fruit Ninja"" or the arcade classic, ""Frogger."" Reason #5: Ever try potty training a kid? Other than the no-sleep thing, potty training is the worst thing a parent goes through. It's such a frustrating experience. You know how easy it is to hit the head. You do it a zillion times a day. So, why doesn't your kid get it? Why does he insist on hiding behind the couch in the playroom and dropping something in his pants that should be quarantined by the Center for Disease Control? Well, in comes the iPad to the rescue. Trust me on this one. Find yourself a slew of games that he likes, plop him down on the bowl and let 'er rip. It might take a few tries, but eventually, little Johnny will be tugging at your leg pants and saying, ""Yo, pops, I need to drop one. Where's your iPad? I have to catch up on the scores from last night's game."" In my case, my youngest would play ""Pac-man,"" ""Cut the Rope"" and ""Stickman Golf."" Not sure if I was prouder of her actually doing the deed or selecting to play ""Pac-man."" My inner geek dad rejoiced. So regardless of all the PR speak that Steve Jobs fed the world when he launched the iPad and introduced the iPad 2, don't let him fool you. The iPad isn't a revolutionary communications tool.

"(Rolling Stone) -- How can a serious bluesman thrive in the age of Auto-Tune? That's the question Gary Clark Jr. grapples with on his major label debut. Since his teens, Clark has been the young titan of Texas blues, coming out of Austin in the early 2000s with a smoothly long-suffering voice and one hell of a mean guitar tone, playing solos that claw and scream their stories with ornery splendor. He's a full-fledged guitar hero of the classic school. And that's all he would need to be, if he only wanted to spend his career playing for roots-music die-hards and recording for his own Hotwire Unlimited, the Austin label that released his albums from 2004 to 2010. But Clark, 28, has a different trajectory and a much larger goal: to reach his own generation, the one that grew up on hip-hop and R&B. Clark spreads his musical bets on ""Blak and Blu."" Instead of having one signature sound, he tries a dozen, delving into modern R&B, retro soul, psychedelia and garage rock. A handful of the album's songs are cherry-picked from Clark's Hotwire catalog, remade in studios that make everything sound bigger and tougher. Abetted by producers Mike Elizondo (Dr. Dre, Fiona Apple) and Rob Cavallo (Green Day), Clark is clearly aware that young listeners have heard the Black Keys, Prince and the Roots. Although most songs have a live, hand-played flavor, a few of them -- including the title track -- tilt toward the static, looplike grooves of hip-hop. Videos: Gary Clark Jr. Plays New Songs at Rolling Stone Studio . The album's core is still the blues. Clark dips into the historical timeline, sampling a juke joint's worth of 20th-century styles: from the rural slide-guitar picking of ""Next Door Neighbor Blues"" to the desolate tidings and incendiary lead guitar of ""When My Train Pulls In"" to the Cream-y riffing and layering of ""Glitter Ain't Gold."" But Clark won't be genre-bound. ""Ain't Messin' 'Round"" is pushy, updated Stax-Volt soul with Clark's fuzztone leading the charge of a horn section. ""Things Are Changin'"" makes another Memphis move with a fat Al Green-style backbeat. As an album, Blak and Blu makes for a bumpy ride. The roaring, distortion-soaked blues of ""Numb"" -- which sounds something like Stevie Ray Vaughan tackling ""Come Together"" -- upstages the falsetto croon and string arrangement of ""Please Come Home."" The souped-up Chuck Berry boogie of ""Travis County"" collides with ""The Life,"" which has Clark ruminating over woozy, echoey keyboards: ""Can't go on like this/Knowing that I'm just getting high."" Clark and Warner Bros. clearly expect listeners to carve their own playlists from the album's 13 tracks. Outside the structures of the blues, Clark is still a journey-man songwriter, sometimes settling for easy rhymes and singsong melodies, as he does in ""Blak and Blu,"" which aspires to the thoughtfulness of Marvin Gaye, wondering, ""How do we get lifted/How do we not go insane?"" Give Clark credit for striving to be something more than a blues-rock throwback and singing from a troubled heart. And hope that he gets through the narrow portals of pop radio. But on this album, it's still his blues that cut deepest. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Clark spreads his musical bets on ""Blak and Blu""

"(CNN) -- Justice Department prosecutors said Friday that they are closing a criminal investigation of champion cyclist Lance Armstrong without filing charges that he used performance-enhancing drugs. A statement from the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles said the seven-time Tour de France winner will not be charged, but did not explain the reasons for the decision. Armstrong has consistently denied doping. He was accused of using performance-enhancing drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. Late Friday, he released a statement in which he said he was ""gratified"" to learn that prosecutors are closing their investigation. ""It is the right decision and I commend them for reaching it. I look forward to continuing my life as a father, a competitor and an advocate in the fight against cancer without this distraction,"" Armstrong said. Prosecutors called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles as they investigated the case, but they apparently determined that they lacked evidence to bring a charge. In May 2011, Armstrong once again denied claims from a former teammate that he used drugs during his cycling career. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drugs abuse in recent years with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May, in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News ""60 Minutes"" show by another American Tyler Hamilton. On his Twitter page, Armstrong said at the time: ""I have had a 20-year career, 500 drug controls worldwide, in and out of competition, and never a failed test. I rest my case."" In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting substance EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the American news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" Hamilton added: ""Armstrong took what we all took -- the majority of the peloton took. There was EPO, testosterone, blood transfusions."" Meanwhile, Armstrong's lawyer Mark Fabiani blasted the ""60 Minutes"" report, releasing a statement saying: ""Hamilton is actively seeking to make money by writing a book. ""He has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on ""60 Minutes"" and increase his chances with publishers."" Fabiani continued: ""Greed and a hunger for publicity cannot change the facts: Lance Armstrong is the most tested athlete in the history of sports: He has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition.""","NEW: Lance Armstrong says he is ""gratified"" by the decision .

Burial will be at Cedar Grove Cemetery in Clayton, according to Barclay Funeral Home. ""I know she's up there..."" a distraught Anthony Pasquale, Autumn's father, told CNN affiliate WPVI in Philadelphia. ""She's in good hands. She's going to be watching over us. She's going to be our little angel."" ""She'd want us to stay strong,"" added Jenn Cornwell, Autumn's mother. Two teenage brothers were arrested Wednesday and charged with first-degree murder in Pasquale's death, according to authorities. ""The brothers are ages 15 and 17 years old, and both are in police custody,"" Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said Tuesday, adding that the younger brother had also been charged with one count of luring. Prosecutors believe Autumn was lured this past weekend to the home of the boys' family, where they murdered her -- possibly for her BMX bike, which police found among some of the girl's belongings when they searched the site early Tuesday. Autumn's body was found Monday in a recycling container. Dalton said she was strangled and died from blunt-force trauma, but based on preliminary findings, there were no signs of sexual assault. Police were aided by the suspects' mother, who contacted police because of a suspicious Facebook posting, according to Dalton. The young suspects turned themselves in, accompanied by their court appointed attorneys, on Tuesday. ""We're strongly considering waiving them to adult court. However, we want to let the process take its part,"" Dalton said. In New Jersey, authorities are not permitted to release the names of juveniles charged with a crime. ""They need to pay for what they did for my daughter,"" Cornwell told WPVI. According Bernie Weisenfeld, spokesman for the Gloucester County Prosecutor's office, the juvenile defendants are due in court Friday morning for a detention hearing.","Funeral for 12-year-old girl killed in New Jersey will be Saturday .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Ten Ivory Coast soldiers have been killed in attacks Sunday and Monday by unidentified gunmen in Abidjan, the economic capital, the defense minister said. The attacks come just before the country celebrates its independence on Tuesday. The first of the attacks occurred before dawn on Sunday and took place in Abidjan's neighborhood of Yopougon, a stronghold of the former president, Laurent Gbago. The gunmen attacked the Abidjan's 17th district police station after about 50 people were arrested in the neighborhood in a preventive raid carried out by the Ivorian army earlier in the night, defense minister Paul Koffi Koffi said by phone from Abidjan Sunday. Read more: Thousands flee in wake of clashes in western Ivory Coast . He said six armed men carried out the attack in which three soldiers were killed. ""The gunmen arrived in a taxi and started to fire without any warning,"" said Koffi Koffi. The assailants wore army-style uniforms and were armed with AK-47 rifles, he said. The group of armed men then fired at a checkpoint of the Forces RÃ©publicaines de CÃ´te d'Ivoire, the national army's official name. The base is located in the same neighborhood and the shooting left two more soldiers dead, the defense minister said. There was no reason so far to think the attack was anything other than ""an act of banditry,"" Koffi Koffi said Sunday. But Monday before dawn, 30 gunmen attacked an Abidjan military camp, killing five more. Again, some were wearing army-like uniforms, though not all, he said. He added that one soldier is missing and one attacker was killed in the incident. Read more: Seven peacekeepers killed in Ivory Coast . An Ivoirian soldier who was in the camp during the fight said the gunmen were targeting soldiers from the Dioula ethnic group, a population native to the Northern Ivory Coast and said to support President Alassane Ouattara. At least 3,000 people were killed last year in five months of post-election violence after ex-President Laurent Gbagbo refused to cede power to Ouattara. An emergency security meeting with army and government officials was held Monday in Abidjan by Ouattara, Koffi Koffi said. The president pledged to reinforce the security in the country before the Independence Day, Koffi Koffi said. There was another attack Sunday against a military camp in Abengourou, which is about 140 miles northeast of Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's state media reported, citing anonymous sources. The report said no one was killed.","Five Ivory Coast soldiers are killed by unidentified gunmen Monday, the defense minister says .

"(CNN) -- Toronto police made a gruesome discovery Wednesday when they opened a suitcase that two boaters on Lake Ontario had towed back to shore. Inside was a badly decomposed human torso, its gender unknown. Investigators are in touch with two other police departments investigating the recent discovery of body parts in their jurisdictions, said Toronto Det. Leslie Dunkley. ""It is a very serious case and a very serious incident and we are going to do our best to get to the bottom of it,"" Dunkley told reporters Wednesday afternoon. The floating suitcase was spotted 1.5 miles offshore and was brought to Bluffer's Park, police said. A post-mortem examination is scheduled for Thursday. Authorities have been investigating the death of Guang Hua Liu, whose body parts were found in mid-August in several places. The investigation began along the Credit River in Mississauga, west of Toronto. Liu's torso is still missing. CNN affiliate CTV said Liu, 41, was a Canadian citizen of Chinese descent who once owned a spa in Toronto. She lived in Scarborough and was the single mother of three. Peel Regional Police, near Toronto, last week said an arrest was made in Liu's death. Wednesday's discovery of the suitcase came one week after a woman's torso was found in the Canadian portion of the Niagara River. Niagara Regional Police said the unidentified white woman, likely in her mid-20s to early 40s, was a homicide victim. The torso was recovered near the Rainbow Bridge close to Niagara Falls. The Niagara River case is not related to Liu's death, police have said. The Niagara River connects Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- After 18 months of violent unrest, clouds of black smoke suggest conflict is closing in on Syria's capital. On the streets of Damascus, no one flinches when artillery shells explode just a few miles away. Residents who support neither the government nor the opposition say the situation is out of their control. ""Every day, we are hearing this boom, boom and everything else, but there is life that is going on,"" said Rama Hamdi, seeking a bit of normalcy at a beauty salon. ""I am worried sick about it, but there is nothing we can do."" Jolie visits Syria refugees in Iraq . Despite an abundance of people at an ancient bazaar, several storekeepers say business is down. They said they are afraid to talk on camera, worried about what the government might say and what the rebels might do to them. When asked about the shelling heard in the background, the storekeepers say they are afraid because they think the war is getting closer. And they're right. Destruction from when government forces chased the rebel Free Syrian Army lies just a 10-minute drive away. On many days, the reported death toll from around the capital is far higher than from areas surrounding other cities. ""Nowadays, I cannot go to the countryside without being worried someone will stop me,"" said Rauda Alaita, the salon owner. ""Is it the real army or the other army stopping me?

"(CNN) -- One of China's biggest banks is planning to make the country's biggest foreign bank acquisition to date and has set its sights on potential targets in Europe. China Construction Bank, the second-ranked Chinese bank by assets after Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, could spend as much as $15bn on a deal, according to Wang Hongzhang, the group's chairman. ""Some of the banks in Europe have been put up for sale,"" Mr Wang told the Financial Times in an interview. ""Now we are looking for the right choice."" He said CCB had Rmb100bn ($15.8bn) of capital available to acquire a whole bank or, at a minimum, to buy a stake of 30-50 per cent in a larger entity. Mr Wang, who praised the progress of European policymakers in addressing the eurozone crisis, would not be drawn on individual names but said an investment in the UK, Germany or France would be most attractive. He valued the partnership agreement CCB has with Bank of America, which owns a 1 per cent stake in the Chinese bank, but did not plan to support it with a shareholding. Any acquisition would have to have a reasonable international presence, Mr Wang added, rather than just a single-country domestic focus. An internationally minded acquisition target would pose fewer ""cultural challenges"", he said. Investment bankers believe banks that were part-nationalised amid the financial crisis could make appealing targets. RBS, 82 per cent owned by the British government, has a market capitalisation of Â£17bn. Commerzbank, the German bank that is 25 per cent government-owned, is worth barely â‚¬9bn. Analysts and deal bankers have long predicted that Chinese groups, which retain relatively high market valuations, could swoop on comparatively cheap western rivals. But so far there has been little activity. ICBC's $5.5bn acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in South Africa's Standard Bank has been the biggest deal to date. The Chinese financial sector has been scarred by the few deals they have done abroad. China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth fund, took big stakes in Morgan Stanley and Blackstone just before the global financial crisis savaged their share prices. In Europe, China Development Bank has seen a big paper loss on its investment in Barclays, while Ping An, a life insurer, bought a stake in Fortis just before it ran into trouble and had to be split up. With Europe's debt problems deepening over the past two years, Chinese regulators have advised the country's banks to keep a safe distance from European financial institutions. At one point they were even told to avoid basic foreign exchange transactions with certain European counterparties because of the financial risks. ""In the past several years what happened to Chinese investors was not particularly encouraging,"" Victor Wang of Macquarie Securities said. ""In my base case, I am not expecting any large-sized overseas acquisitions. ""But if they are talking about investing in a listed entity, it may look interesting from a long-term perspective because the asking price must be reasonable now."" Guo Shuqing, Wang Hongzhang's predecessor as chairman of CCB, insisted last year that price alone would not be enough of a reason to do a deal. Mr Guo, who is now China's chief securities regulator, appealed for caution when looking at foreign banks: ""Their shares have really fallen,"" he said at the time. ""Just looking at the prices, it might seem a good deal. But it would not necessarily suit our development strategy.""","One of China's biggest banks is planning to make the country's biggest foreign bank acquisition .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The death toll from fighting between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in western Myanmar last week has risen to 84 and at least 22,500 people have been displaced by the sectarian violence, state media and the United Nations say. The state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Monday that 129 people were also injured during the violence, which erupted on October 21 and has cast a pall over recent reforms in the Asian nation. However, the paper added that no new clashes had been reported since Sunday and the areas affected had returned to ""normalcy."" Following a visit to five townships where the fighting took place, Ashok Nigam, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Myanmar, on Sunday said his team had seen ""large-scale"" destruction of houses and the displaced were in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. ""I am gravely concerned by the fear and mistrust that I saw in the eyes of the displaced people in both communities,"" Nigam said in a statement. ""It is critically important that the government ensures that the rule of law prevails."" The fighting also prompted Islamic organizations to cancel the four-day religious holiday of Eid al-Adha, which ends on Monday. The groups gave no explanation for the move, but locals regarded it as a precautionary measure. The worst fighting, according to the New Light of Myanmar, took place in Kyauktaw, a village in Rakhine state, where 12 people were killed. Security forces used tear gas and other riot control devices to ""disperse the mob"" and seized 71 firearms. Q&A: What's behind the sectarian violence in Myanmar? There has been tension between the Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims since May, when violence began in Rakhine state after three Muslim men were arrested on suspicion of raping and killing a Buddhist woman. Nigam said that, according to government estimates, 4,600 houses had been set ablaze across eight townships in the latest flare-up. The number of people who have fled their homes could be higher, with the country's government still checking the numbers of displaced people and those that have fled the violence by boat, he added. The U.N. is already assisting around 75,000 people forced to flee their homes during violence in June earlier this year. Most are living in makeshift camps. ""The violence, fear and mistrust is contrary to the democratic transition and economic and social development that Myanmar is committed to. It should not become an impediment to progress for all people of Myanmar,"" Nigam said. Dramatic satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch showed what it said was extensive destruction of buildings in a predominantly Rohingya area of the coastal town of Kyauk Pyu. The swath of arson, the group said, stretched over 35 acres and included houseboats and floating barges. It added that local police shot at Muslims trying to put out the fires. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the government in Myanmar has done little to address the root causes of the violence and the discriminatory treatment that many Rohingya face. ""Extremists in both communities have been empowered by a lack of accountability where people involved in sectarian violence haven't been bought to justice so it's a very, very bad situation and one that is getting worse,"" he told CNN. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar doesn't recognize them as citizens. Unrest between the Rohingya and majority Buddhists has tested President Thein Sein's administration, which is trying to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. The government has sent extra security into the troubled region and declared a state of emergency. The president's office warned Thursday that ""manipulators"" behind the violence can expect to be found and prosecuted. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking in Parliament on Friday, called for a greater security presence and urged authorities to investigate suspected human rights offenses. CNN's Kocha Olarn, Paul Armstrong and Katie Hunt contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll from sectarian violence in Myanmar rises to 84, state newspaper says .

"(CNN) -- When was the last time you heard someone say it's important to hire a qualified white person for a job? No, seriously, I really want you to think about that question. Whenever there is a discussion about diversity, inclusion or affirmative action, we always hear folks say, ""We do a great job of trying to find qualified minorities."" That always tickles me, because when it comes to hiring whites, the assumption is that all are qualified, so there's no need for the qualifier ""qualified."" That was the first thing that came to mind when former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu gave his opinion on ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on Thursday regarding Gen. Colin Powell's endorsement of President Barack Obama. Booker: Sununu's comment was 'unfortunate' ""Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama,"" Sununu said. When Morgan asked him what that reason is, Sununu said, ""Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him."" Oh, John, you're such a charmer to say you applaud Colin Powell for being a righteous brother and supporting his brother from another mother. All I could do was laugh at how incredibly stupid and asinine Sununu's remark was. But Sununu isn't alone. He's like the many idiots who have e-mailed and tweeted me over the years, suggesting that comments perceived as favorable to Obama boil down to our skin color. Accomplishments? Oh, no. Intellect? Forget about it. It's always a black thing. News: Obama and the white vote . See, I'm not one of these black folks who are quick to deny that anyone voted for Obama because he's black. Actor Samuel L. Jackson has made it clear that he backs Obama because he's black, and he doesn't give a damn what any white person thinks. But it really is Sam's responsibility to tell us exactly why he supports the president. It's not our job to automatically assume that skin color is the reason during this season. For instance, in 2004, the Rev. Al Sharpton ran for president of the United States. Now, we know he's black, but a ton of black folks didn't even think of supporting him during his run or send him a dime. I recall betting a black New York media executive a big steak dinner that Sharpton would not win the primary in South Carolina, where nearly half of the voters are black. He was adamant it would happen, citing the Rev. Jesse Jackson's win there in 1988. Sharpton didn't win. During that same primary, former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun also ran for the Democratic nomination. Her campaign was about as ineffectual as Sharpton's, and few people, even black folks, backed her. Opinion: Why isn't Colin Powell a Democrat? Amazing. Two black folks running for president -- one a prominent civil rights activist and the other a former U.S. senator -- and black America as a whole didn't even give their candidacies a thought. So if in Sununu's mind a Powell endorsement comes down to race, how does he explain the many times a black candidate runs for office, and black support isn't guaranteed? What about all of the years black folks voted for white candidates? Was one whiter than the other? Since Sununu thinks it's about race, I need him to explain to me how Mitt Romney's whiteness has been the deciding factor behind his being a major surrogate for the Romney campaign. Please tell us, John, why you think Romney is the Great White Hope who will take down Soul Brother No. 1 at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Turnabout is fair play, right? If Powell is backing Obama because he's black, I need all of Romney's white supporters who are backing him because of the color of his skin to step forward. Please, don't hold back. Powell is an American hero. He has served as national security adviser, head of the U.S. Army Forces Command, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, secretary of state. Opinion: Both parties have a huge race problem . As a distinguished military man who has worked for four U.S. presidents, he has witnessed up close and personal what it takes to be president of the United States and commander in chief. It is ridiculous to assume Powell would be so shallow as to think race is the only determinant for him. The suggestion is beneath him. So, why did Sununu say it? Because it's easy to dismiss an accomplished black man who just praised another accomplished black man. By boiling it down to race, it's easy for others who think such a thing to say, ""Oh, that's it!"" Unfortunately, we see this type of thinking in America all of the time. I crack up when someone white e-mails me, saying I owe my job to affirmative action. Their bigotry and racial animus is obvious, and I e-mail them back saying, I'm laughing at them. Why? Because it must hurt more to have a black man they can't stand laugh at them. My accomplishments are clear and many. I owe no one an explanation for my success, and Powell owes Sununu and no one else an explanation other that what he said on CBS's morning show, citing Romney's confusing foreign policy views and Obama's steady leadership. ""When he took over, the country was in very, very difficult straits. We were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression,"" Powell said. ""We were in real trouble. ""I saw over the next several years stabilization come back in the financial community. Housing is now starting to pick up after four years. It's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising. So I think generally, we've come out of the dive, and we're starting to gain altitude. It doesn't mean we are problem solved. There are lots of problems still out there. The unemployment rate is too high. People are still hurting in housing. But I see that we are starting to rise up."" Ain't nothing like a critically thinking brother, right, John? This issue will not get a rise out of President Obama or Gen. Colin Powell. They won't even dignify Sununu and others who think like them. They'll just keep laughing all the way up the ladder to the next successful step, marveling at the childishness of some whites to reduce black support of another African-American to just the color of their skin and not the content of their character. The opinions expressed in this country are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: John Sununu said Colin Powell backed Obama because he is black .
He says it's asinine to say race motivates blacks' endorsements rather than accomplishment .
He wants Sununu to explain how Romney's whiteness earned his support .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have expressed their concern for the future of Rafael Nadal after their great tennis rival pulled out of this month's U.S. Open due to his ongoing knee problems. The Spaniard withdrew from the season's final grand slam event on Wednesday, when Federer began his preparations at the Cincinnati Masters with a 6-3 6-2 win over Russia's Alex Bogomolov Jr. ""I wrote him and he told me it wasn't looking good at all. I kind of knew,"" world No. 1 Federer told reporters after setting up a third-round clash with Australian rising star Bernard Tomic. ""But obviously when it's official it's disappointing for tennis, there's no doubt about it. I would love to have him in the draw. In particular 12 days before the Open you figure he might still have time to fix what he has to fix to get ready. ""That's what is sort of scary. There is obviously the whole debate going on if he is going come back for this year. I hope he will. He's definitely got some more weeks off now because of it. I hope in hindsight this is a very smart decision by him. But it's obviously a big blow and disappointing news for the tennis world."" Former No. 1 Nadal won a record seventh French Open title in June after his customary busy clay season, but lost in the second round at Wimbledon and was unable to defend his Olympic singles title at London 2012. ""Tennis is going to lose a little bit because of Rafa not being there and playing, because he's somebody that has made a history of this sport,"" said U.S. Open champion Djokovic, who began his Cincinnati campaign with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 win over Andreas Seppi of Italy, having retained his Toronto Masters title on Sunday. ""We all know how good he is and how popular he is. Obviously it's that serious that it takes him out from the tour for the last couple of months. I'm sure that if he was able to perform in the U.S .Open he would come."" Nadal and Djokovic had contested four successive grand slam finals, a run that was broken at Wimbledon when Federer beat Andy Murray to join Pete Sampras on seven titles at the grass major and reclaim the top ranking from the Serb. Djokovic, last year's Cincinnati runner-up, is seeking to improve his form in his next match against Russian veteran Nikolay Davydenko. ""Really just trying to put another ball more in the court than my opponent was enough to win,"" he said. ""I'm obviously not very satisfied with the performance. I will have to play much better than I did in order to go far."" Murray, who succeeded Nadal as the men's Olympic champion after a revenge win over Federer at Wimbledon this month, also paid tribute to a player he has faced in five grand slam semifinals and two quarterfinals. ""I like Rafa a lot as a friend. I'm disappointed for him,"" said the world No. 4, who beat American Sam Querrey 6-2 6-4 in his Cincinnati title defense opener, having pulled out in Toronto after his first match due to a knee worry of his own. ""It's obviously tough for him. He's had trouble with his knees in the past. So, you know, I hope he can rest, doesn't come back too early, and gets them fixed so he can get back to playing his best tennis."" The 25-year-old will be hoping for a good run in Cincinnati before continuing his quest for a first grand slam title at Flushing Meadows. ""In the immediate aftermath of big wins or good tournaments, normally you'll feel quite confident and comfortable going for your shots in the important moments and even at the beginning of matches,"" he said after setting up a third-round clash with France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan 6-4 6-3. ""I'm hoping it helps me not only this week but going into the U.S. Open and big matches in the future. I think it will give me that extra bit of confidence and probably feel a bit calmer going into them."" Fifth seed Tomas Berdych will play 2011 Rookie of the Year Milos Raonic following a straight-forward 6-3 6-0 win over Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu. Canada's Raonic advanced courtesy of a battling 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 6-4 defeat of world No. 42 Marcos Baghdatis. In the women's tournament, Venus Williams joined sister Serena in the last 16 after coming from behind to beat South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 2-6 6-3 6-2. Williams will next face French Open finalist Sara Errani of Italy, who she thrashed in straight sets at the Olympics. Fourth seed Petra Kvitova, who had a first-round bye after winning her first title this year in Montreal on Monday, defeated Germany's Mona Barthel to earn a clash with China's Peng Shuai. Montreal runner-up Li Na joined the Czech in round three, where the Chinese ninth sed will play Swedish qualifier Johanna Larsson, while Polish top seed Agnieszka Radwanska and former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki also progressed.","Roger Federer says Rafael Nadal's absence from the U.S. Open is a ""blow""

"(CNN) -- For the 23rd and 24th time in less than two weeks, shots were fired at seemingly random targets in southeastern Michigan and, for the first time, someone was struck, police said. A driver suffered non-life-threatening injuries, details of which were not disclosed, when he was hit by a bullet around 12:20 p.m. ET west of Fowlerville, said Clarence Goodlein, director of public safety in Wixom and spokesman for the eight-agency task force investigating the shootings. After that incident -- which occurred about 35 minutes after another shooting, both affecting vehicles heading eastbound on Interstate 96 -- authorities shut down the highway, looking for evidence. It reopened shortly after 5 p.m., without anyone in custody or a named suspect. Authorities investigate spate of roadways shootings in Michigan . Michigan authorities have released a composite sketch of a man with short-cropped hair who they believe was involved in an October 18 shooting in Ingham County. And police have said they are looking for a black Ford Mustang with blue-tinted front lights and a racing stripe down the center, while other witnesses have pointed to an older-model Chevrolet Cavalier. Saturday's highway shootings are the latest in a series that began October 16 in Wixom and a neighboring community. They have all occurred over a roughly 35-mile stretch west of Detroit. Goodlein said authorities have indications the suspect or suspects were themselves in vehicles when they fired at other vehicles that were driving in the opposite direction. What would motivate them to do so, however, is a mystery. ""We have no idea why these events are occurring,"" Goodlein said. In one of the shootings, a man taking out his trash heard a bullet ""whizzing by his head, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said earlier this month. In another, a bullet went through the driver's side of a car, lodging inside the passenger-side door. And on one day, five vehicles were shot along the same road in a span of ""two to three minutes,"" according to Goodlein. ""The scariest thing about it is the suspect, or suspects, are not targeting certain individuals,"" said Brian Cheesvro, a detective with the Wixom police. The incidents have stirred memories of the D.C. sniper shootings, when 10 were killed and three wounded over a terrifying three-week span in October 2002. John Allen Muhammad, the mastermind behind those shootings, was found guilty and executed in 2009. Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 17 at the time, is serving a life sentence. Over the past two weeks, dozens of law enforcement officers have come together to form a task force to probe the Michigan shootings. Goodlein said about 500 leads have come in through a tip line, and he encouraged people to keep calling -- even if they are not sure whether their thoughts or observations will impact the investigation. ""Our experience has been ... that one piece of meaningless information, or what seems to be meaningless to someone, when it is combined with some other information ... becomes extremely valuable,"" the chief said.","A driver suffers non-life-threatening injuries when he's shot in southeastern Michigan .

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani politician critical of U.S. drone strikes said Saturday that American authorities detained and questioned him at a Canadian airport. Imran Khan, a former cricket star, this month led a march to the border of Pakistan's tribal region to protest drone strikes, which he says end up killing more civilians than militants. Khan said he boarded a New York-bound plane in Toronto on Friday when two U.S. immigration officials asked him to step outside. The officials made him wait for about 40 minutes before interviewing him for another 20 minutes, he said. ""I kept asking them what was this all about, and then one guy interviewed me and he was so confused, he had no idea what he was saying,"" Khan told CNN by phone from Seattle, another stop on his trip. ""He was talking about some fund-raising, so I asked him to come to the point, and he said, 'We're worried you might use violence against drones.' I mean, it was so ridiculous, I didn't even know how to answer it."" Khan: ""We'll sweep the election"" Khan missed his flight, but he eventually made it to New York, and later Seattle, for fund-raisers for his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. He has two more fund-raisers on the schedule, in San Francisco and Los Angeles, before he returns home to Pakistan, Khan said. The cricket legend said he suspects U.S. officials simply wanted to make him miss an anti-drone protest Khan was scheduled to lead in the United States, without realizing the protest had already been postponed because of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. A State Department official acknowledged that Khan was ""briefly delayed"" before boarding the next flight to the United States. ""The issue was resolved,"" the official said. ""Mr. Khan is welcome in the United States."" Khan has been a fierce critic of U.S. policy in Pakistan and the use of drone strikes, calling them a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a strategy that stokes militant anger toward Washington. In recent years, the U.S. government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region, widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. American officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare. Anti-drone peace march halted in Pakistan . Khan says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians. That, he said, is counterproductive to the war on terrorism. ""If you alienate them, you lose the war, because they're the ones who are going to eventually provide logistical support,"" he said. ""From these people will be the recruits to the militants.""

"(CNN) -- The ""official"" night set aside for ghosts and goblins is nearly here, but if you're bewitched by the macabre and the supernatural, there are plenty of places that provide spooky sensations year-round. You won't need a costume to take in these attractions, but if you're looking for ideas on what to wear on October 31, you might find some inspiration from these historic -- and sometimes horrific -- destinations. Send us the scariest shots from your Halloween celebrations . Ohio's unusual tourism trend . Anyone with a penchant for gloom and doom may want to head for Ohio. The state's tourism department is promoting all things grim -- and it has nothing to do with Halloween. ""These experiences are all genuine and originated due to someone's desire to preserve the history, traditions and tools of the trade,"" says Tourism Director Pat Barker. That trade is the funeral home business. Highlights include historic hearses, celebrity death memorabilia and how-to lessons on embalming and burial. The Peoples Mortuary Museum is part of a working mortuary in Marietta, Ohio, and it boasts a collection of classic hearses from past centuries, even a horse-drawn hearse from 1895. Staff members double as tour guides to educate the public on the post-death process. Funeral transportation is also in the spotlight at the William Lafferty Memorial Funeral and Carriage Collection in West Union, Ohio, with vehicles dating back to 1848. The antiques were collected during the four generations that the Lafferty family served in the Ohio funeral business. The Famous Endings Funeral Collection in Dover, Ohio, is a must-see for history buffs curious about celebrity deaths. Inside you'll find programs from the farewell ceremonies of everyone from Ronald Reagan to Evel Knievel to George Burns. There's the original temporary crypt marker for Humphrey Bogart and a memorial card from Farrah Fawcett's funeral. This quirky collection even has a Facebook page. If you want to spend the night in the company of such unusual history, check in at the Sturgis House, a funeral parlor turned bed and breakfast in East Liverpool, Ohio. The death mask for Charles Arthur ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, who was Public Enemy No. 1 in 1934, hangs above the washing machine in the downstairs laundry room. It's just steps away from the embalming equipment that remains on display as an informal mortuary museum. Voodoo culture in New Orleans . Novelist Anne Rice was born here and her popular tales often include spirited descriptions of her hometown. She's not the only one to imagine New Orleans as vampire-friendly: The supernatural side of the Big Easy is easy to find on your own or with the help of a professional guide. Several companies offer tours specializing in cemeteries, voodoo or the city's impressive array of stores selling all things eerie such as custom-blended potions, Tarot cards and authentic voodoo dolls. West Africans brought the voodoo way of life to New Orleans in the 1700s, and the religion flourished in the 19th century. Delve into its many layers at the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum, where admission is $5 for adults. Public rituals were once performed in Congo Square, an open space inside Louis Armstrong Park just north of the French Quarter, and even today you can find a voodoo spiritual temple nearby where a modern-day priestess performs rituals. Perhaps the most popular voodoo-related attraction sought by history-loving tourists of all kinds is the marked tomb of Marie Laveau, the city's famous ""Voodoo Queen."" On any given day you'll find tourists in spiritual meditation or simply gawking at all the graffiti and triple-X markings on her tall white tomb inside the walls of St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Each set of X's represents someone making a request in the fashion of an age-old voodoo ritual. There's also a cornucopia of New Orleans hotels where the paranormal is considered normal, such as the Monteleone, where you can stay in a haunted room or ride an elevator that seems to have a mind of its own. In 2003, a team of paranormal researchers stayed in the hotel and allegedly confirmed contact with more than a dozen spirits. The ghost of a confederate soldier is said to be an occasional guest at the newly opened Audubon Cottages; rumor has it he enjoys relaxing on the balcony of cottage No. 4, overlooking the pool. Chills in Charleston, South Carolina . Chilling attractions in this historic port city include Civil War relics such as bloodied uniforms, an amputation kit and plenty of deadly weapons. It's all on permanent display at The Charleston Museum. Imagine the fear of James Wiley Gibson, shot and killed by a sniper during the Battle of Secessionville. His uniform is part of the ongoing exhibit, complete with a fabric tear from the bullet's deadly path. If that doesn't make you shudder, have a look at the primitive tools and instruments of the Civil War amputation kit. Be sure to stop by the Charleston Library Society, a downtown cultural hot spot where you're likely to find someone who's an expert on the city's darker side. If you're there in October, have a glance at the bloodstained manuscript of Henry Timrod. Known as the poet laureate of the Confederacy, this Charleston native produced passionate prose until his death in 1867. His final project was splattered with blood coughed up from the tuberculosis that killed him -- and the morbid page is on display every Halloween season. The spirits of upstate New York . Fall paints the landscape of upstate New York with colors that lure leaf-peepers from around the world, but this vacation region is also home to a historic fictional intrigue. Thirty miles north of New York City, you'll find Sleepy Hollow, a village made famous by the legend that bears its name. Washington Irving's classic story about a headless horseman was published in 1820. Various characters and scenes from the legend are said to be based on the people and places of Sleepy Hollow, such as the burial ground at the Old Dutch Church. Irving attended services at the Old Dutch Church as a child, and the author is buried in the adjacent Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (others buried there include Andrew Carnegie and Elizabeth Arden). Guided walking and evening lantern tours are offered. If you're lucky, you'll spot the town's own resident headless horseman. The area makes for a literary scavenger hunt for those obsessed with the frightful folktale, and Irving's former home, Sunnyside, also hosts ""Legend Weekends"" where musicians, magicians and puppeteers entertain and encourage continued awe for the author. Edgar Allen Poe also lived near Sleepy Hollow, and readings of his works often take place at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Where the witches were: Salem, Massachusetts . A short drive north from Boston leads to ""The Witch City"" of Salem, where witch-related tourism is the lifeblood of the economy. The Salem Witch Museum takes visitors back to the summer of 1692 and the infamous trials that resulted in the execution of 20 people accused of devil-inspired activity. The town goes all out in October with its weeks-long lineup of Haunted Happenings. Visitors serious about studying this chapter of history can use the museum as an educational starting point, then spend hours, days or weeks traveling through the region touring the homes, historic markers, grave sites and other relics related to witchcraft hysteria. The museum can provide a map and a list of more than 30 sites in the area. To help put you in the right mindset for a modern-day witch-hunt, check out the museum's blog at www.salemwitchmuseum.com/blog for more information, including suggestions for pre-arrival reading. Eerie traditions in Edinburgh, Scotland . An international witch hunt might lead you to Scotland, where the North Berwick Witch Trials happened in 1590-1592, some 20 miles from the capital of Edinburgh. The gothic architecture and peculiar history of the Scottish capital add to the city's allure as a bewitching destination. Grave robbers are a notorious part of Edinburgh history and urban legend tells morbid tales of plague victims left to die in underground streets. Even luxury respects the role of witches and the supernatural: October guests at the prestigious Balmoral Hotel can enjoy the perk of Halloween Afternoon Tea, but the concierge staff says the demand for tours of the eerie and bloodcurdling is high year-round. The top draws include a castle dungeon attraction featuring actors and thrill rides and the Real Mary King's Close, a series of underground lanes and housing spaces located beneath the Royal Mile that lend themselves to visions of murder and disease. The underground area will host Dark Truth Tours from October 26-31. Any time of year you might find a library reading, a festival or an underground tour honoring Edinburgh's darker side. If you're one to study the history of Halloween itself, you'll find plenty of claims that the tradition of All Hallow's Eve has Scottish roots. Finding traditional haunts . From scream parks to corn mazes to haunted homes, sites that evoke ghoulish pleasures are so popular that the Haunted Attraction Association was formed in 2010, to promote the top haunted places around the world, a $300 million industry. If you want to find a scary site in a specific area, the HAA website has a ""Haunt Finder"" and you can also check out past winners of the organization's annual Oscare Awards.

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is calling on Muslims to kidnap Westerners, citing the success in the abduction of American aid worker Warren Weinstein in Pakistan. In a two-part, more than two-hour video posted on jihadist websites, al-Zawahiri called for the abductions as part of a vow not to ""spare any efforts"" to free Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. ""God the great and almighty granted us success to capture the Jewish American Warren Weinstein,"" al-Zawahiri said in the video posted Wednesday, according to the terror monitoring group SITE Intelligence. ""We are seeking, by the help of God, to capture others and to incite Muslims to capture the citizens of the countries that are fighting Muslims in order to release our captives."" Also in the video, al-Zawahiri called for Sharia law to be instituted in Egypt, and he questioned Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy for his stances on a number of issues, including Israel. ""I call on every free and honorable (person) in Egypt to participate in every protest against the Israeli Embassy, against the peace treaty with Israel, against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land, and against every siege of Gaza,"" al-Zawahiri said. ""Islamic movements and masses must be at the forefront of those protests and the first to sacrifice for their sake."" The video is the latest in a series released by al-Zawahiri, who was al Qaeda's No. 2 leader under Osama bin Laden. He took over leadership in June 2011 following bin Laden's death, according to statements posted on jihadist websites. In the latest video, al-Zawahiri apologized to Abdel-Rahman, dubbed ""the blind sheikh,"" for his imprisonment. The Egyptian-born Abdel-Rahman was convicted in 1995 of conspiracy. He is serving a life sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the August 2011 abduction of Weinstein from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore. Months later, al-Zawahiri made a number of demands of the United States in exchange for Weinstein's release. Among the demands was the release of Abdel-Rahman. Al-Zawahiri messages show interest in exploiting Syria violence . In May, al Qaeda released a video of the 71-year-old Weinstein pleading with President Barack Obama to meet the demands. ""My life is in your hands, Mr. President,"" he said in the video. ""If you accept the demands, I live. If you don't accept the demands, then I die."" U.S. officials have said Washington will not bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein was captured after his kidnappers managed to overcome the three security guards who were protecting him. One of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, al-Zawahiri has played a defining role in al Qaeda. He is believed to be hiding somewhere in Pakistan's tribal region that borders Afghanistan. He was indicted in absentia for his alleged role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others, according to the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the U.S. federal government. The FBI is offering a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount as the reward for bin Laden. Al-Zawahiri's wife and three children were killed in December 2001 in a U.S. attack on the family's residence in Afghanistan.","Ayman al-Zawahiri calls for the kidnapping of Westerners .

"(CNN) -- In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves. We've witnessed the warmest spring since record-keeping began in 1895. Thirty-one states reached record-high temperatures. The period between July 2011 and June 2012 was the hottest 12 months on record. And last year 14 extreme weather-related events caused an incalculable loss of human life and cost the U.S. economy more than $55 billion. Understandably, many Americans are wondering if these events are manifestations of a longer-term shift in climate. Opinion: Why the drought affects me -- and you . At present we cannot definitively link any single extreme event to climate change. But it is worthwhile to consider whether the apparent increase in some extreme events has roots in a larger, longer-term trend, since that would predict a continuation of these events in the future. That kind of understanding can have practical importance because it can inspire action to reduce economic losses and human suffering â€” often in relatively simple ways. If a region is likely to continue to get rainfall heavier than has historically occurred, for example, then it is sensible for city planners to consider installing larger-bore storm sewers when the time comes to replace aging infrastructure. The science in this area is getting stronger all the time. In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events. In six of the seven, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that climate change caused by human activities played a factor in the events â€” affecting their severity, likelihood or frequency. News: Extreme weather -- get ready to see more of it . Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England. On the other hand, the study found no evidence that the devastating floods in Thailand last year were connected to climate change. Another new peer-reviewed article, the ""2011 State of the Climate"" report compiled by nearly 400 scientists from 48 countries, documents some of the longer-term trends that are underlying some of these changes. It found that: . -- Carbon dioxide and other major greenhouse gases continue to climb, with the 2011 yearly global average the highest yet; . -- Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making oceans more acidic; . -- The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and its sea ice is thinning dramatically; . -- And the globally averaged heat stored in the upper ocean was the highest since records began in 1993. Such striking trends have strong implications for climate, weather and environmental and human health. One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events. Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season. Emergency managers along the Mississippi, Missouri and Red River basins used NOAA climate data to help lessen flooding, months before it began. Opinion: Why we should expect more weather disasters . Coastal managers are using sea-level-rise data to protect crucial infrastructure. Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments. Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed. These are the kinds of practical actions that inspire me in my job as we work to make the best science available to understand and reduce the impact of extreme events on families, communities and businesses. These and other measures are essential to reducing the effects of extreme weather events and forging a safer future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Lubchenco.","Droughts, wildfires and heat waves have plagued the U.S. recently, says Jane Lubchenco .

"(CNN) -- English football continues to troubled by the scourge of racism, according to a Parliamentary report. Over the last year England's football authorities -- as well as England's justice system -- have had to contend with racism cases involving Patrice Evra of Manchester United and Liverpool's Luis Suarez as well as Chelsea's John Terry and Anton Ferdinand of QPR. In December, the English Football Association handed Suarez an eight-match ban and a Â£40,000 fine after finding the Uruguayan guilty of racially abusing Evra, while in July, ex-England captain John Terry was cleared of racially abusing fellow footballer Anton Ferdinand at Westminster Magistrates' Court . ""Much has been done to improve the atmosphere and behaviour at football matches and it has become a much more family-friendly activity,"" said chair of the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Committee John Whittingdale MP. ""However, recent incidents of racist abuse in the UK, both on and off the pitch, have highlighted the fact that there remain significant problems. ""It should be a priority for the FA to develop procedures for stewards to follow and regular training opportunities to ensure that all relevant staff at club grounds are capable of reacting swiftly and consistently to incidents of abuse."" And the CMS committee called on the FA to do more in tackling all forms of abuse in the game: . ""While the general level of progress in combating racism and racist abuse in the UK is positive and should be applauded, there is much more that can and must be done, and we believe it is for the FA to take the lead and set the example for everyone, from football authorities at all levels to the grassroots groups, to follow."" The FA, the Premier League and the Football League issued a joint response to the CMS report. ""We agree with the Committee that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game, challenges remain for all of the football authorities,"" said their statement. ""We remain committed, along with all of our stakeholders, to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football. ""We will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda. In doing so, we will consider in detail how the Committee's recommendations can support and influence this work. Evidence given to the CMS suggested that homophobia might now be the biggest problem football is facing. ""Recent research found that 25% of fans think that football is homophobic while 10% think that football is racist,"" said the CMS, which wants the FA to promote a campaign to ""highlight the damaging effect of homophobic language and behaviour in around football at every level."" As well as identifying homophobic abuse as well as ""laddish"" behaviour as significant problems, the report demanded a more active response from the authorities to racial abuse at grassroots level. The report noted that social media -- such as Twitter and online forums -- had been used to spread racist and abusive content but suggested the medium could be used more effectively to counteract the problem of abuse."" ""We believe that the football authorities should be using this developing forum for communication and debate, to spread positive messages about equality and diversity and also to speak out strongly against instances of racist abuse when they occur,"" added Whittingdale. There are very few black managers in English football's four divisions -- Chris Hughton is the only one in the Premier League -- and the CMS committee called for improved recruitment processes across all clubs and football authorities. ""More needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees, to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game,"" said the report. Although Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand in the courts the ex-England captain faces an FA racial abuse charge on September 24. The FA's three-man Independent Regulatory Commission will judge that case ""on the balance of probabilities"", a lesser burden of proof than ""beyond reasonable doubt"" which is used in the courts. English football is not the only sport that is currently facing the issue of racism. Toronto shortstop Yunel Escobar has been suspended for three games by the Blue Jays for wearing eye-black displaying a homophobic slur written in Spanish during a game last weekend against Boston.","A parliamentary report concludes racism a problem in English football .

"Washington (CNN) -- If you listen carefully, you can hear something important being debated in this election, in fact one of the most important questions of them all: . What hope is there for the average American worker? Once upon a time -- in the far-off days after World War II -- the average worker could look forward to a steadily rising standard of living. You didn't have to be anyone special or do anything special. Just keep doing your job, and over the three decades from the mid-1940s through the mid-1970s you could expect your wages to double. And that's after inflation. That was a long time ago. Even before the Great Recession, wages tended to stagnate or decline, except for the most skilled workers in the most robust industries: technology, finance, and so on. The middle stayed put; the top pulled away. There's little reason to expect that situation to change after recovery arrives. Opinion: Republicans risk being the party of mean . We live in a world of global competition now, where even white-collar jobs can be outsourced to India. If the jobs can't be exported, then the workers are imported, via legal or illegal immigration. Outside the government sector, unions wield little clout -- where they exist at all. For those reasons and others, the wage share of the economy had already sunk to record lows as of 2007. What -- if anything -- should be done? Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each have answers, although you have to listen carefully to reconstruct them. Here (as I read it) is President Obama's answer. (These are my words, except for the speech quote.) Purely free markets won't be generating wage increases any time soon. There's just too much low-wage competition out there. But we can do two things. As I outlined in my November 2011 speech in Osawatomie, Kansas, we can put more people to work in jobs funded by government contracts, where government can ensure high wages and benefits. That's what I meant when I said, . ""[M]anufacturers and other companies are setting up shop in the places with the best infrastructure to ship their products, move their workers, communicate with the rest of the world. And that's why the over 1 million construction workers who lost their jobs when the housing market collapsed, they shouldn't be sitting at home with nothing to do. They should be rebuilding our roads and our bridges, laying down faster railroads and broadband, modernizing our schools -- all the things other countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their shores. ""Yes, business, and not government, will always be the primary generator of good jobs with incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. But as a nation, we've always come together, through our government, to help create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed."" Government contractors can't employ everybody, however. So we'll plump up the low wages of those in the purely private economy with a growing array of wage supplements. We top up low pay with the Earned Income Tax Credit. We've added 14.6 million food stamp beneficiaries. After 2014, we'll be enrolling as many as 17 million additional low-wage workers in the country in Medicaid. We've increased subsidies for college tuition, and we subsidize heating fuel costs as well. Vote for me, and government benefits and government employment will compensate for the wage increases the private job market does not deliver. Mitt Romney has called the president's vision a ""government-centric"" one - and that seems exactly right. Here's the Romney alternative (again these are my words, not his): . I probably can't deliver rising wages for the typical worker any better than the president can. That's why I hardly talk about wages at all -- they're barely mentioned in my most important economic policy statement, the 57-point plan I released last year. My concern is less with the typical worker and more with the most ambitious and most talented. I want to protect the ""right to rise,"" as my supporters in the conservative media often phrase it. Under the president's approach, that right will be crushed by the weight of debt and taxes -- and what's debt, but future taxes? Instead of greater subsidies for those content to stay where they are, I offer lower taxes to those who want to better their condition. Their hard work and innovation will yield benefits for everyone. OK, maybe money wages haven't risen much since 1973 for the typical worker. But today that worker has a safer car, a bigger house, and smarter appliances. He or she enjoys products and services unimagined in 1973: personal computers, cellphones, video on demand. Food, furniture, and vacations are all cheaper and better. You can choose Coke with zero calories, and you don't have to line up at the DMV to renew your license plates. All these improvements were brought to you by people who got rich along the way -- and so will the next wave of improvements after that. The president's call for higher taxes on the rich will only stifle and slow consumer progress. The president is offering higher taxes to support more benefits. I'm offering lower taxes to drive more improvements in the private economy and better products and services for you. Vote for me. Don't expect the candidates ever to speak that frankly -- too risky. But if you pay attention, you can discover the inner message behind the warm fog of campaign rhetoric. So there's your choice, America: because while we may have put 100 new cereal varieties on the shelves, at the voting booth it's still just Red or Blue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: American workers have been losing ground for decades .
He says President Obama's answer is to make up for wage declines with government aid .
Romney's view is that government can't prop up wages but should enable innovators, Frum said .

"(CNN) -- Champion cyclist Lance Armstrong won't be allowed to compete in international Ironman triathlon contests while he's under investigation for doping, the World Triathlon Corporation announced Thursday. The ruling bars him from the Ironman France competition scheduled for June 24 in Nice, the agency said. The decision comes after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, confirmed Wednesday that it is opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. Armstrong said Wednesday the agency intends to ""dredge up discredited"" doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. The champion cyclist has always insisted he never took performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong was accused of using such drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. Armstrong started doing triathlons after retiring from cycling, and won a half-Ironman in Hawaii less than two weeks ago. He was the fastest cyclist and runner on the 70.3-mile course, and the third-fastest swimmer. But with the new investigation open, the World Triathlon Corporation suspended him. WTC rules ""dictate an athlete is ineligible to compete during an open investigation. Armstrong is therefore suspended from competing in WTC-owned and licensed races pending further review,"" the organization said in a statement. USA Triathlon said he can still compete in its events. ""Lance Armstrong is currently still eligible to compete in all USA Triathlon-sanctioned races, with the exception of Ironman events as stated earlier by the World Triathlon Corporation,"" said the body's communications director Chuck Menke. Armstrong lashed out at his accusers and the doping agency on Wednesday. ""Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,"" Armstrong said on his website. ""That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence."" A 15-page agency letter was sent Tuesday to Armstrong and several others. The Washington Post was the first to report the story. Justice Department prosecutors in February said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. ""These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two-year investigation,"" Armstrong said Wednesday. In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were ""fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions."" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of blood cells. Opinion: Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong . The letter said Armstrong and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011. Riders will testify that Armstrong used EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone and masking agents, and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005, according to the letter. In a statement obtained by CNN, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis T. Tygart said the five other people, formerly associated with the U.S. Postal Service pro cycling team, are three team doctors and two team officials. The letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations, Tygart said . ""USADA only initiates matters supported by the evidence,"" Tygart said. ""We do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures, intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence."" All named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, he added. According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. Armstrong said the organization has ""self-written rules"" and punishes first and adjudicates the facts later. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News ""60 Minutes"" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the American news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" On his Twitter page, Armstrong at the time said he never failed a drug test. Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject banned substances . CNN's Steve Almasy, Gary Morley, Terry Frieden and Jason Durand contributed to this report.","USA Triathlon says Lance Armstrong can still compete in its events .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev showed sympathy for the imprisoned members of Pussy Riot at a regional meeting for the ruling United Russia party today, the Wall Street Journal reports.

"(CNN) -- A late-night 911 call. Police race to the house of a venture capitalist in an upscale suburb of Detroit. Shots are fired at officers and one of them is killed. The house is surrounded, a SWAT unit is summoned and after a 20-hour standoff punctuated by more shots, the homeowner and suspected shooter is found dead. Two lives are over. One, that of a 12-year veteran of the police force, a married man with four children. The other, seen through legal documents and online resumes, appears to have spiraled downward from a high-flying career as a top-level auto executive with a wife and child to that of a divorcee facing legal issues and financial woes. At 10 p.m. ET Sunday, police officers responded to a report of gunfire at the home in West Bloomfield Township, Michigan, according to a police spokesman. Officer Patrick O'Rourke was shot several times by the gunman and later died at a hospital, said Lt. Tim Diamond. After a 20-hour standoff during which police knocked out a wall in the home and the suspect fired more shots, police sent in a robot outfitted with a camera, according to a release from the West Bloomfield police department. When a team of police officers entered the room they discovered Ricky Coley was dead, a police dispatcher said. The cause of death had yet to be determined, the release said. It appeared that the 50-year-old was on the verge of losing almost everything. According to court documents, Coley was scheduled to have an early intervention conference on Monday morning in his recent divorce case, a day on which he was reportedly about to be evicted. In her filing, Coley's ex-wife, Deniece, alleged he attacked her on June 12 and she moved out of the house. Deniece Coley said her husband had cheated on her and subjected her to ""physical, mental, emotional and psychological abuse."" The divorce was granted six days ago, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. The Coleys were married in November 1998 and have a 7-year-old child. Deniece Coley was granted sole custody of their child. According to CNN affiliate WXYZ, Ricky Coley was ordered to leave the house by Monday. He was also the subject of a federal lawsuit surrounding an auto carrier company that his financial holdings company owned until it closed its doors in January 2010. The complaint alleges that Translogic Auto withheld more than $9,600 from employees' paychecks that were intended for an insurance plan. The insurance company canceled employees' policies, due to nonpayment of premiums, the suit says, and employees and beneficiaries lost benefits. The suit also says Coley transferred more than $341,000 to himself or affiliates during the time when the company failed to pay insurance premiums. Coley was the sole defendant in the lawsuit, filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. WXYZ reported he was also found in default to two banks for $52,000 in one case and $43,000 in another. A page on LinkedIn, a business networking site, that appeared to belong to Coley said he was the chairman emeritus of CNC Holdings, the venture capital company that purchased Translogic in 2008. The page said he worked at Ford from January 2001 to January 2008, in the last year as North American plants operations manager/director, overseeing more than 30 plants and a $1.6 billion budget. Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker didn't confirm what role Coley filled at Ford. He also worked at General Motors and UPS, according to the LinkedIn page. A resume that was last updated in June 2011 on the website Indeed.com mirrored the LinkedIn profile. Deniece Coley said in her divorce petition that her then-husband hadn't worked in three years. His resumes show Ricky Coley held multiple degrees. He studied industrial and systems engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, earning an undergraduate and graduate degree. He also studied patent law at North Carolina Central in Durham, North Carolina, according to his LinkedIn profile. He also claimed an MBA from Queens College in Charlotte, North Carolina.","Police dispatcher identifies dead suspect as Ricky Coley .

"New York (CNN) -- As storm-battered residents came to terms with the extent of the damage Tuesday, organizers of the New York City Marathon were trying to determine if flight cancellations, flooding and power outages would affect Sunday's race. ""We are going to give everyone the time to get here and if they have to cancel, we will give them the chance to cancel up to Saturday,"" said Mary Wittenberg, president of New York Road Runners, which organizes the race. Wittenberg had declared Monday that ""time is on our side"" for the preparations, though she could not be reached for comment Tuesday after Superstorm Sandy barreled through the region. Superstorm Sandy breaks records . As many as 2 million customers in the state of New York were without power Tuesday afternoon. ""We are currently focused on recovery efforts, and our thoughts go out to all those affected by the storm,"" the race's website said Tuesday. ""Please stay safe -- we will update you later in the day as more information becomes available."" The group said race officials have been taking ""proactive measures to reschedule pre-race events and to accommodate participants affected by Hurricane Sandy."" Up to 20,000 international runners could be affected by flight cancellations or delays, but Wittenberg said the organization has ""a number of options to get them into any of our surrounding airports.""

"Torrevecchia Teatina, Italy (CNN) -- Six months ago, an Italian bricklayer behind on his taxes wrote a note to his wife of 27 years, then doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire outside a Bologna tax office. Giuseppe Campaniello died nine days later. ""He was a good person,"" said his widow, Tiziana. ""He wasn't given a chance to redeem himself because that's what he wanted to do. If Giuseppe had had the chance, he would have paid his debt, not what they wanted him to pay because he wasn't earning 20,000 euros a month."" She has joined with other women whose husbands took their lives to form a group called the ""Vedove Bianche"" - the white widows - to show that in this long drawn out economic crisis, the cost cannot be calculated on a tax form. Italy's ""white widows"" are the most recent example of the emotional toll the debt crisis and austerity measures are taking on Europe. In the first half of last year, suicide rates in Greece skyrocketed more than 40% year on year, according to Greek health ministry data. In the UK -- not a part of the eurozone, but whose economy is also struggling as it enters a double-dip recession -- researchers wrote last month in the British Journal of Medicine that the 2008-2010 recession may have led more than 1,000 people to commit suicide. Austerity drives up suicide rate in debt-ridden Greece . Now as Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, faces market pressure to make cuts after its borrowing costs rose dangerously high, ""austerity suicides"" that spiked in Greece are now being seen here. For decades, it was common for Italians to avoid paying their full taxes, but with the financial crisis, tax collection has become more aggressive. Mounting tax troubles, and financial hardship, have driven some to take their lives. Although statistics are hard to come by, one Italian small business association claims suicides related to economic hardship are twice what they were 10 years ago. Rome businessman Mario Frasacco, 59, shot himself in the chest last April. The factory he ran, which produced aluminum fittings, is now padlocked and its 10 workers unemployed. Family tragedy tells the story of Greece . Frasacco's daughter, Giorgia, worked with him and knew he was having financial difficulties, but hadn't the slightest hint he was contemplating suicide. ""The day before he killed himself, I said goodbye to him as I always did before going home,"" she recalled. ""I never read in his eyes any discomfort that would lead to this. After five months, I can't find a justification for what he did."" For the survivors of these economic suicides, there is anger that the government tried to maximize revenues and spending cuts, no matter the human cost. For Tiziana, she is left with questions of how to cope -- emotionally and financially -- in the aftermath of her husband's death. ""Who will hire me at 48-years-old, nearly 49? Who?"" she asks. ""Where can I go? Should I become a prostitute? Because that's where they're taking us. Or should I commit suicide and just get out of the way and be one less problem for the government?"" CNN's Kevin Voigt contributed to this report .","Giuseppe Campaniello set himself ablaze after not being able to pay a tax bill .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich extended their dream start to the Bundesliga campaign with a 3-0 thumping of Felix Magath's Wolfsburg Tuesday to make it five wins from five. Mario Mandzukic scored twice after Bastian Schweinsteiger's opener to secure an easy win for the Bavarian giants in the Allianz Arena. They have gone two points clear at the top after Eintracht Frankfurt were held 3-3 at home by two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Schweinsteiger struck the post with a pair of efforts before giving Bayern a 24th minute lead. Mandzukic doubled the lead with a header in the 57th minute and rounded off the scoring eight minutes later with the fifth of the league season for the Croatian star. Dortmund were two up after goals from Lukasz Piszczek and Marco Reus inside the half hour mark on their travels. But second-placed Frankfurt pulled level with two goals inside two second half minutes from Stefan Aigner and Takashi Inui. Dortmund substitute Mario Goetze looked to have won it when he stabbed home for their third but Anderson salvaged a point for the home side after 73 minutes. In other matches, Schalke beat Mainz 3-0 with Jefferson Farfan opening the scoring from the spot and new boys Fortuna Dusseldorf continued their unbeaten start with a 2-0 win at Greuther Fuerth. In Italy, Serie A leaders Juventus dropped their first points of the season in a goalless draw at Fiorentina.","Bayern Munich go two points clear in Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- Florida recorded its first death connected to the outbreak of a rare, noncontagious form of meningitis, raising the toll Tuesday to a total of 12 fatalities nationwide. Earlier in the day, federal authorities reported 11 deaths and 119 persons becoming ill in the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday. Those figures were an increase from Monday's count of eight deaths and 105 illnesses. Florida health officials also reported a total of six cases connected to the outbreak -- all in Marion County. That figure -- one more than federal officials have so far counted in Florida -- means that a total of 120 persons nationwide have become ill, according to state officials. The outbreak is linked to contaminated steroid injections, and as many as 13,000 people may have received the medicine between May 21 and September 24, the CDC said. The death of a 70-year-old Florida man occurred in July, prior to the discovery of the contamination, the state's health department said. ""Our disease investigation process discovered the link of this individual's death to the contaminated medication,"" State Surgeon General and Secretary of Health Dr. John Armstrong said. ""We will continue to work closely with our health partners to ensure that individuals who may have received the contaminated medicine are treated immediately."" The number of reported cases grew significantly in recent days as federal and state authorities continued to investigate the outbreak. Tennessee is the hardest-hit state, with 39 infections and six deaths, according to the CDC. Of the remaining deaths, three occurred in Michigan and one each in Maryland and Virginia, the CDC said. Patients contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spines with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation. Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered . The New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Massachusetts-based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week. On Tuesday, President James T. DeVita of the Massachusetts State Board of Registration in Pharmacy sympathized with the individuals affected by the contamination. ""On behalf of the board, I want to express our deepest sympathy for the patients and the families who have been impacted by this tragedy,"" DeVita said, reading from a statement during a board meeting. He added that ""NECC voluntarily surrendered its license and recalled all implicated products."" On Saturday, the pharmacy announced a voluntary nationwide recall of all its other products as well. NECC said the new recall was being announced out of an abundance of caution and that there is no indication any of its other products are contaminated. The Food and Drug Administration has already asked doctors, clinics and consumers to stop using any of the pharmacy's products. Last week, the pharmacy voluntarily surrendered its license to operate until the FDA investigation into the contamination is complete. Health officials say 75 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC. Other than Tennessee, deaths have been reported in Maryland, Michigan and Virginia. There are also confirmed cases of the disease in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio. The other states that received the contaminated products are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. Federal health inspectors began inspecting the NECC plant October 1. Inspectors found foreign particles in unopened vials, and after testing one of them, they determined the substance was a fungus. The investigation is still under way. Nearly 10% of drugs administered in the United States come from compound pharmacies, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report. Drugs manufactured by compound pharmacies do not have to go through FDA-mandated premarket approval. Instead, state health pharmacy boards are responsible for the oversight and licensing of these pharmacies. Compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals won't work, according to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens like fungi, according to the CDC. Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms of other forms of meningitis, but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first, the CDC says. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN that fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. Health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning May 21 and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away. The earlier a patient gets treatment, the more likely he or she will survive. Patients are treated with anti-fungal medication, which is given intravenously, so patients have to be admitted to the hospital, the CDC said. Patients may need to be treated for months. The FDA is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the NECC product to report it to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary reporting program, by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Elizabeth Cohen, Miriam Falco, Michael Martinez and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Florida records its first death in meningitis outbreak and reports additional case of illness .

"(CNN) -- What an upset! Before the first presidential debate, voters were telling CNN by nearly a 2-1 margin that they expected an Obama victory. Many commentators were ready to hold a coronation for the president. Now, by more than a 2-1 margin, voters who watched the debate are saying that Mitt Romney won it -- and we have a horse race on our hands. Opinion: Debate coach -- Obama, heat up; Romney, stay cool . Romney was one of the two big surprises of the night. His performance was head and shoulders above anything he has displayed so far. He drove the debate, had a coherent message that focused on jobs, showed a superior command of detail, was empathetic toward people hurting, and looked the president in the eye. He came in hungry. President Obama was the other surprise. He was unusually flat, failed to go after Romney on point after point (47%, Bain, corporations are people, etc., etc.), rarely looked Romney in the eye, and seemed annoyed. My hunch is that no one has talked to him like this since his election (except maybe Bibi Netanyahu), and he was shocked that Romney denied he had ever proposed a huge cut in taxes (which he has). The net result was that Obama seemed to withdraw emotionally just when he should have launched a counteroffensive. Opinion: Romney wasn't stellar, but Obama fell short . We won't know until the dust settles whether Romney has truly shaken up the race. After all, John Kerry as challenger beat President George W. Bush in debates and lost the election. In this case, Democrats are already charging foul against Romney for misstating facts. More to the point, we know from the past that incumbent presidents often come into a first debate a little complacent, lose, and then come roaring back in a second encounter (think Reagan 1984). Obama is highly competitive and will surely be loaded for bear next time. But the first night goes down as a big upset for Romney -- and it is now more likely that this race will go down to the wire. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Americans felt strongly Obama would win, but they scored Romney the winner .
Romney drove the debate, with a coherent message hammering at jobs issue, Gergen says .

"(CNN) -- Fall is time to get serious. School is back in session. The presidential election is just weeks away. Baseball's pennant race is on. Hollywood turns from popcorn features to Oscar-worthy drama. The same holds true in bookstores, where some of the biggest names in publishing are back on the shelves. With a slew of titles debuting in the weeks ahead, here are four hot reads for serious readers. Michael Chabon, ""Telegraph Avenue"" In stores now . In ""Telegraph Avenue,"" Michael Chabon does for used record stores what he did for comic books in ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay."" It's a sprawling multiracial story set in the Pulitzer-winning novelist's adopted home of Berkeley, California, along with its gritty neighbor to the south, Oakland. Like ""Kavalier & Clay,"" the story follows a pair of friends, Archy Stallings and Nat Jaffe. The two are struggling to hold on to their version of the American dream, an appropriately named used vinyl store, Brokeland Records, located of course on Telegraph Avenue. Complicating their entrepreneurial efforts, an ex-NFL quarterback who happens to be the fifth-richest black man in America announces plans to build an entertainment megastore just down the street. The supporting cast includes a pair of independent-minded midwives, a former blaxploitation star who can't let his movie career go, a Black Panther-turned-politician and a funky mix of aging jazz musicians. Chabon throws it all together in a funny and imaginative mix. The author is at the top of his game as his playful language pulses with a beat like the classic jazz and soul music he writes about, riffing on the counterculture and complex racial politics of the East Bay Area. Get the free enhanced e-book sampler of ""Telegraph Avenue"" Kevin Powers, ""The Yellow Birds"" In stores now . Kevin Powers is winning rave reviews for his first novel, ""The Yellow Birds,"" a personal and moving story of two young soldiers caught in the crossfire of the war in Iraq. Powers knows his subject firsthand. Before becoming a writer, he served as a U.S. Army machine gunner in some of Iraq's bloodiest battles in 2004 and 2005. In the book, two grunt soldiers, Bartle and Murphy, are bound together in basic training after their tough-as-nails sergeant commands Bartle to watch over the younger Murphy. We follow their platoon into battle and see the dangers the soldiers face up close: armed insurgents, excruciating heat and constant stress. In between the haphazard gunbattles and indiscriminate explosions, there are bouts of boredom, all of it taking a mental toll on the men. As reality begins to blur into a hazy nightmare, both soldiers do everything they can to protect each other from a war neither is truly prepared for. ""The Yellow Birds"" is written in a poetic style with a near-stream of consciousness feel as the story jumps back and forth in time and from Iraq to the home front. Powers goes beyond the battlefield to show the effects of the war not just on the soldiers but on their families as well. Powers is winning high praise from some well-known authors, and his book drawing lofty comparisons to other battlefield classics from Tim O'Brien and Ernest Hemingway. If you're looking for one of the first great novels of the Iraq war, this may be it. Read an excerpt from ""The Little Birds"" on Facebook . Michael Ennis, ""The Malice of Fortune"" In stores now . Before Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, Michael Ennis goes 500 years into the past to imagine the unlikely crime-solving duo of Niccolo Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci in ""The Malice of Fortune."" Although the story concerns a hunt for a Renaissance serial killer, the book is based on actual historical events. Ennis, a former art history professor, spent 12 years researching and writing the story, bringing multiple layers of authenticity to his epic w novel. It's a heady mix of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" Borgia politics and ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Think of it as CSI: Italy circa 1502, with Machiavelli as a detective and psychological profiler and da Vinci as history's first forensic pathologist. Ennis also wins points for perseverance with the book. His first draft was rejected by nearly two dozen publishers. The author then printed his own galleys, showed them to independent booksellers across the U.S. to build support and after three tries found a willing publisher in Doubleday. Now ""Malice"" is winning widespread praise from critics, fellow authors and booksellers. More than just history reimagined, Ennis claims to have discovered a secret buried in the pages of ""The Prince."" So if you're among the millions who read Machiavelli's political treatise in school, ""Malice"" may hold added appeal. Read an excerpt from ""The Malice of Fortune"" J.K. Rowling, ""The Casual Vacancy"" In stores September 27 . Perhaps the most anticipated title of not just the fall but the entire year is J.K. Rowling's ""The Casual Vacancy."" Publisher Little, Brown is betting big on Rowling's first novel since the Harry Potter finale. More than 2 million copies are due to hit store shelves across Australia, Germany, North America and the UK on September 27. Booksellers are hoping the billionaire author has kept her magic touch, but readers should not expect a return to Hogwarts in the new book. Set in an idyllic English town where everything is not what it first seems, the plot deals with the unexpected death of a member of the Pagford parish council and the machinations that follow to fill his empty council seat. ""The Casual Vacancy"" is described as a thought-provoking black comedy, but only a select few have read it. Little, Brown is offering no advance copies to reviewers, while Rowling herself is granting a few handpicked interviews to media outlets once the book is released. The secrecy only seems to be feeding the sky-high anticipation, with advance sales looking strong. We'll have to wait and see whether Rowling can repeat the phenomenal success of the Harry Potter series in her first novel for adults. What's your most anticipated book of the season?

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid made sure the lights didn't go out on its title challenge as it sparked into life with a 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano. Karim Benzema's 13th minute strike lit the fuse for Real before Cristiano Ronaldo's second-half penalty sealed the win. Real's margin of victory could have and should have been greater, but Ronaldo somehow contrived to miss from six-yards with the goal at his mercy. Rayo had their chances, particularly in the first-half through Andrija Delibasic and Mikel Labaka, but they were unable to find a way past the Real defence. Rayo's misery was compounded in stoppage time when Jose Manuel Casado was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Ronaldo's strike means he has now scored 152 goals in 152 appearances for the club in total and 41 in 40 matches for Real in 2012. With just one league victory to its name before kick off, Real could not afford to slip any further behind arch-rivals Barcelona. Late goals preserve Barcelona's perfect start to La Liga season . The Catalan side sat 11 points clear of Real after winning all five of their league games following its weekend victory over Granada. But Real moved up to seventh and to within eight points of Tito Vilanova's side following this win. After the drama of Sunday night where the game was postponed amid a suspected act of sabotage on the power supply at Estadio de Vallecas, Real wasted little time in asserting its authority. Football: Real Madrid game canceled . Angel Di Maria latched onto Ronaldo's pass on the left before crossing for Benzema to fire home from close-range. New signing Luka Modric should have doubled Real's lead 11 minutes later but he shot straight at the goalkeeper after finding space inside the penalty area. While Real looked dangerous in attack, it remained suspect in defense and only a wonderful save by Iker Casillas denied Delibasic an equaliser. The Rayo striker looked certain to score from close-range only for Casillas to block and Mikel Labaka's follow-up to be cleared off the line. The visitors continued to dominate after the break and Benzema wrongly had goal ruled out after the referee inexplicably brought play back for a foul to Real instead of playing the advantage. That decision could have proved costly for Mourinho's men, but Jose Carlos' strike sailed inches over the crossbar with Casillas beaten. Real finally got the second goal it had been craving 20 minutes from time when Jordi Amrat handled inside the penalty area and Ronaldo stroked home from the spot. The Portugal star should have wrapped the game up late on after being teed up by Gonzalo Higuain, but he somehow managed to hit the post with the open goal gaping. There was still time for Casado to see red for Rayo as the home side's frustration boiled over following a difficult night. Elsewhere, Sevilla claimed a 2-0 victory away at Deportivo La Coruna. Alvaro Negredo and Ivan Rakitic scored in the second-half to help Sevilla extend their unbeaten run to five games in the league and move to within four points of the leaders.","Real Madrid claim 2-0 victory at Rayo Vallecano .

"(CNN) -- It's every African-American parent's nightmare: seeing your son being led away in handcuffs when you know he's done nothing wrong. The surreal scene happened to me one recent morning. While sitting in my backyard I heard adult male voices around the side of the house. I opened the gate and saw a white police officer handcuffing my 13-year-old son. The plainclothes Evanston, Illinois, officer and his partner did not identify themselves as police. They did not ask our son's age or where he lived. They told him first to put his hands up and then handcuffed him. They assumed he was guilty, of what we didn't know. His crime appeared to be that he was a black male. Later, we would listen to the 911 tape of what preceded the incident. It was apparent police had targeted my son while he was riding his bike home from a friend's house. Why? According to officers, he fit the description of a burglary suspect who had allegedly entered a nearby home. The description they offered: a black male wearing cargo shorts. Our son was wearing cargo shorts, but that identification could have applied to hundreds of black males in Evanston on that particular day. Why didn't the 911 dispatcher ask for a more detailed description of his skin color? His build? Whether he had facial hair? (He doesn't.) Whether he had a tattoo or piercings? (He doesn't.) Or whether he was wearing a hat? (He was.) Authorities on the scene didn't care about my son's other attributes. He is an honor roll student, saxophone player, basketball player and law-abiding teenager. All they saw was his gender and race. To make matters worse, after handcuffing him, police paraded him to the front of our house in full view of neighbors and passersby, and at least three other armed, uniformed officers surrounded him and me. They leaned him against a cop car, his hands still cuffed behind him, and made him wait so the alleged victim could be driven over to identify him in what's known as a ""show up."" When I protested, asking why my son needed to be handcuffed, they told me he might flee. Give me a break! He's going to try to run with five armed cops and his mother standing near him? The humiliation of being forced to participate in a quasi-lineup was unconscionable. When the alleged victim said our son was not the intruder, the officer uncuffed him and his partners left almost as quickly as they had swarmed in. But before the officer who handcuffed our son left, I demanded an apology. The halfhearted response seemed insincere at best. He didn't even look either of us in the eyes. These officers clearly did not like it that I verbally resisted my son's detainment or my telling them it seemed like racial profiling. That police could handcuff a fully cooperating, nonresisting 13-year-old boy at his home with his mother in plain sight ought to leave all Americans shaking in their boots. It was unnecessary. It was unfair -- un-American. But it happens more often than we know, particularly to young African-Americans, who often don't have the resources to advocate for themselves. This is the United States of America, where one is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. But this rarely applies if you're a male of African descent. Trayvon Martin's killer has claimed self-defense, but did Martin deserve to be approached by a neighborhood watchman and shot to death? He was carrying a bag with soda and some Skittles candy, not a weapon. I'm reminded of the 2009 incident involving Harvard University Professor Henry Louis Gates, one of the nation's top African-American scholars. Gates returned home to find his key wouldn't work because his lock was jammed. Initially, police thought he was breaking into his own home. Even though he produced identification to prove he lived in the house, he was ultimately arrested for disorderly conduct after he angrily accused officers of racial profiling. Prosecutors dropped the charges. I teach at Northwestern University, which is home to the Medill Innocence Project, a program whose work has overturned wrongful convictions and influenced Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's effort to end the state's death penalty. It's not surprising that many of those exonerated are African-American men. In fact, the National Registry of Exonerations tracked 958 former convicts exonerated in the United States. Of that total, 45% were African-American men, even though they make up only about 6%-7% of the country's population. Racial profiling has a long history in the United States and there seems to be little relief in the so-called ""age of Obama."" A 2009 American Civil Liberties Union report called racial and ethnic profiling ""a widespread and pervasive problem throughout the United States, impacting the lives of millions of people in African-American, Asian, Latino, South Asian and Arab communities."" In 2012 it continues to be a common rite of passage for young black males. Just ask any black male you know and he will tell you a story. No wonder some hate the police. My husband and I cannot undo what happened to our son. At 13 he is now officially inducted into black manhood. I shudder to think what could have happened if I had not been home. Thank God we had taught him at around age 10 to cooperate with police. He complied in every way. But what if he'd gotten scared and run? What if he had reached for his cell phone and police thought it was a weapon? The officers never patted him down. What if police had planted something on him? What if the victim had lied and said my son was the perpetrator? To be sure, police officers have a tough and dangerous job and are vulnerable to injury at a moment's notice. They should try to catch criminals, but not at the expense of treating people with respect and dignity. We have to fight crime without automatically indicting black males. The ACLU report concluded that alienating marginalized groups would ultimately prevent police from reducing crime. When police make mistakes, they must own up to them. They could have identified themselves first and politely asked my son some questions with me present. They also could have profusely apologized. Despite our harrowing experience, I know we are lucky. It was 10 minutes of our lives. The truth prevailed and we will move on. But we will never be the same. The incident is forever seared into my brain and is giving me sleepless nights. The worry I already had for my son being away from home or school is now magnified right at the time he wants to be more independent. We've told our son that he shouldn't think all police officers are bad. However, it is clear more training of Evanston dispatchers and police officers is needed. To parents of African-American youth, as your children (particularly males) return to the routine of classes and homework, remember to school them about the police. They are not always their friends. It's unfair that black parents have to teach this lesson while most white parents don't. But if we don't educate them early and often we may be sending them to an early grave.

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old Pakistani girl who had faced life in prison for allegedly burning the Quran will have her case heard in juvenile court, the girl's lawyer told CNN. A local court ordered the transfer on Monday, Tahir Naveed Choudhry said. Pakistani police told CNN their investigation concluded Rimsha Masih is innocent and was framed by an imam. ""There was no legal evidence against Rimsha,"" officer Munir Jafri told CNN. These developments could mark an end to the Christian teen's nightmare since she was accused of blasphemy in August. ""This is a precursor to the case ending, and that is quite unprecedented in the 25-year history of Pakistan's blasphemy laws,"" said Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director of Human Rights Watch. Accused teen: 'I'm scared' Police have submitted the findings to the court. Pakistan courts usually go with what police recommend. There is a lot of evidence implicating imam Khalid Jadoon Chishti for framing the teenager and for himself tearing pages out of the holy book, Jafri told CNN. This is significant, said Human Rights Watch's Hasan, because ""never before has a false accuser been held accountable."" The teen's case sparked international outcry against the Pakistani government, some saying the blasphemy laws are used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities. Blasphemy laws have been a part of life in Pakistan for 25 years, first instituted primarily to keep peace between religions, Hasan said. But a military leader in Pakistan in the middle 1980s tightened the laws, introducing amendments that ""essentially made blasphemy a capital offense,"" Hasan said. ""They were vaguely worded ... and became an instrument of coercion and persecution,"" he said. ""The laws were disproportionately used against the weakest and most vulnerable in society -- religious minorities, women, children and the poor."" There have been 1,400 blasphemy cases since 1986, according to Hasan. There are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan, and 52 have been killed while facing trial for the charge, Hasan said. Rimsha was arrested on August 16. She and her family spoke to CNN in early September from an undisclosed location, in hiding after Rimsha was released on bail -- a move that appeared to be in reaction to the global condemnation of her jailing. The teen said she was happy to be with her family, but feared for her life. ""I'm scared,"" she said by phone. ""I'm afraid of anyone who might kill us."" The teen spoke in short sentences, answering ""yes"" or ""no"" in a shy and nervous voice. In Pakistan, people accused of blasphemy are often attacked and sometimes killed by vigilantes. During CNN's interview with her, Rimsha said, ""No, no,"" when asked if she burned pages of the Quran. She wouldn't answer questions about what happened on August 16. Pakistani investigators said Rimsha's neighbor accused her of burning pages of the Quran to use as cooking fuel. The neighbor began to shout in protest, drawing a crowd that grew angry. Some neighbors said the teenager was beaten. Others said she ran back home and locked herself inside. When police arrived, they arrested her. Rimsha's lawyers said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with the girl because the two didn't get along. They said it's likely that he liked the teen and she didn't feel the same. While the latest turn in her case this week appears largely positive, her ordeal is far from over. The next hearing in Rimsha's case is set for October 1 in juvenile court. Most victims of Pakistan's blasphemy laws belong to minority Muslim sects like the Ahamadis, who many of Pakistan's majority Sunnis perceive as nonbelievers, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Human Rights Watch. Rimsha's father, Mizrak Masih, is a Christian. He paints houses for a few dollars a day. He was adamant that no one in his family would dishonor the Quran. ""We respect the Quran just like we respect the Bible,"" he said. ""We couldn't imagine committing blasphemy, let alone doing it. Our children would never do this either."" A family representative said that aid groups in the United States, Italy and Canada have offered to the teen and her family a home outside Pakistan. But no matter how her case pans out, it's unclear what kind of life she might be able to have. She told CNN in September that she wanted to stay in her home country. People will believe what they want to believe, no matter what the courts or police say, Hasan said. ""She is certainly in grave danger,"" he said. ""It's the accusation that endangers your life, and can endure."" CNN's Rezah Sayeh contributed to this report.","Case of Pakistani teen facing life for blasphemy charge will go to juvenile court .

"(CNN) -- When Rupert Murdoch fired off a tweet Saturday about some ""scumbag celebrities"" he didn't mean ""any particular people,"" the News Corp boss later tweeted. ""I never referred to any particular people, just some 'dodgy' self promoting celebrities,"" he said, adding the words: ""Repeat apology for language."" Murdoch found himself in trouble on Twitter over the weekend for apparently referring to Welsh singer Charlotte Church, actor Hugh Grant and television presenter Jacqui Hames as ""scumbags"" after they met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the potential reform of Britain's media laws. It's not clear whether Grant attended the meeting, but on October 9 British media reported that Church and Hames met Cameron during the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England. The meeting came weeks before the Leveson Inquiry is due to report its findings on the culture, practices and ethics of the British press and its relationship with the public, police and politicians. The inquiry heard from Murdoch and former British Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, along with celebrities, sports stars and even the families of murder victims who claimed that their phones had been hacked by employees of the now defunct, Murdoch-owned newspaper, ""News of the World"" (NOTW). On Saturday, the media baron tweeted: . The missive prompted this retort from Church: . Hames, a former detective-turned TV presenter who fronted the British crime-fighting program Crimewatch, also demanded an apology, after earlier tweeting: ""I've been called worse, but admittedly not by CEO of large multinational corp."" Both women, along with actor Hugh Grant -- who is not on Twitter -- have been vocal supporters of Hacked Off, a pressure group that's fighting for ""a better press that is answerable to the public it is supposed to serve,"" according to its website. They were among 60 signatories to an open letter on October 6 that called on Cameron to keep an open mind when considering Leveson's recommendations on press reforms. It followed British media reports that suggested the British prime minister might be leaning towards self-regulation. Actor Grant told the BBC's ""The Andrew Marr Show"" on October 7 that campaigners had been concerned to hear ""weird rumblings"" from government ministers. ""We get these odd articles in The Times saying the government ... close sources or reliable sources at No. 10 say the government has already decided not even to listen to Leveson before it's published and to go with more, yet more self-regulation of the press,"" Grant said. Cameron appeared on the same program to say he didn't want to preempt Leveson's recommendations, but added, ""we don't want heavy-handed state intervention. We've got to have a free press."" Lord Justice Leveson is expected to hand down his findings in early November. Months of evidence included the high-profile grilling of Murdoch, who told the inquiry he didn't believe in journalists using phone hacking or private detectives, calling it ""a lazy way of reporters doing their job."" He painted News Corporation, which owns the Sun and the Times in London, as well as The Wall Street Journal, New York Post and Fox News, as a victim of the cover-up. ""Someone took charge of a cover-up, which we were victim to and I regret,"" he said. Last year, at one of two UK parliamentary inquiries into the hacking scandal, Murdoch said his appearance was ""the most humble day of my life."" A number of former News Corp. staff have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to intercept communications including former NOTW editor Rebekah Brooks who's scheduled to face trial next year. The phone hacking scandal erupted and drew international condemnation when it was alleged that NOTW reporters had hacked the mobile phone of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old schoolgirl who was abducted in March 2002 and found dead six months later. During her disappearance, NOTW reporters were said to have illegally accessed the teenager's voicemail, a move her parents said had given them ""false hope"" that their daughter was alive. However, a police investigation found that ""it is not possible to state with any certainty whether Milly's voicemails were or were not deleted."" Despite the lack of conclusive evidence in the Dowler case, dozens of other high-profile victims alleged that private information that could have only come from their mobile phones had been publicly divulged by the British press. In comments published Saturday, Grant said the soon-to-be released Leveson report would be a ""defining"" moment for the British public. ""No-one wants a state-run media, but what we have had for thirty-odd years is a media-run state,"" he wrote.","Media baron Rupert Murdoch tweets about ""scumbag"" celebrities .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan, the newest country in the world, is already facing a crisis. With more than 170,000 refugees on its northern border, and hundreds of thousands of people who have returned since independence, the newborn country is struggling. In July, the U.N. Refugee Agency accompanied South Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek to her native country during the one-year anniversary of its independence. Wek, a refugee herself, has used her celebrity status to raise awareness about refugee issues for more than a decade; last year a partnership between her and UNHCR began to gel. ""I went home for the independence with an open mind and to see how the returnees and refugees were doing,"" Wek said. In spite of the jubilee and pride that punctuated the independence festivities, the refugee situation is going from bad to worse. UNHCR is the lead agency managing seven camps on the contentious border between the north and the south. Torrential rains and complicated terrain are becoming lethal forces for the aid agency as it works to stave off an increasingly alarming situation. At the Yusuf Batil camp in Maban County, where Wek visited last month, 15% of the children are being rushed into acute malnutrition programs. In Upper Nile, nearly half the refugees are children under 11, and this group is suffering the most. After talking with refugees who had recently arrived in the camp, Wek said, ""I can't believe it's been 20 years and people are still fleeing violence."" Wek participated in handing out soap and mosquito nets as part of a widespread health and sanitation program. In spite of these efforts, the camp is seizing from the impact of diseases such as malaria and diarrhea. At a mobile health clinic, many people show signs of malaria, including aid workers. ""I am so impressed by UNHCR staff who live and work side by side with the refugees,"" Wek said. ""It's really remarkable."" All is not bleak though. Wek visited her hometown, Wau, where dozens of children greeted her before she went to see a new returnee village. UNHCR is assisting more than 330,000 South Sudanese who returned home from Khartoum, Sudan, and neighboring countries. ""This step in the process is exciting because it's the end of a long struggle,"" said Vincent Cochetel, the U.S. representative for UNHCR. ""What we work so hard for is for people to be able to go home."" While talking with a mother who was sharing her joy over finally coming home, Wek also learned that programs to help people restart their lives are at risk of being cut because of competing needs in the country. ""I was told that 100 more houses and a school program had to be cut because of the expense of the crisis on the border. I think we as the international community have a social responsibility to help,"" she said. The UNHCR's Sudan refugee emergency appeal of $219 million is only 34% met. Concerned about the funding gap, citizens are stepping up to help. Pierre Omidyar, who founded eBay, and his wife, Pam, made a donation of $500,000, with the hope their contribution spurs more. But even a little goes a long way. A container to transport clean water can literally save a life and just $20 can provide 10 jerrycans for refugees. Similarly, $55 can buy five mosquito nets to protect children from the deadly threat of malaria. For $100, donors can provide kitchen sets for five families, and $345 will provide a family with much needed shelter. Wek plans to work with UNHCR not only on generating awareness for the emergency but also by helping the agency generate funds to support the returnees and their access to education. ""Education is the key to the future. South Sudanese people are rich like the soil; they just need a little water and they will grow,"" the beaming supermodel said. UNHCR is the lead agency on the frontlines of three raging emergencies. With the situations in Syria, Sudan/South Sudan and Mali continuing to worsen, the organization is facing challenges in staffing and funding. In the past six months, the agency has assisted more than 800,000 people who have been forced to escape deadly conflict. The agency is working around the clock to ensure families are safe and receive shelter, water, food and health care.

"(CNN) -- New court documents released Friday in the Colorado movie theater shooting reveal that suspect James Holmes ""had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people"" months before the July 20 massacre. The new details about evidence gathered in the case against Holmes were made public in a court document filed by prosecutors over a defense move to keep some of the suspect's educational records from the University of Colorado private. ""The defendant had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people in March 2012, and that he would do so when his life was over,"" the document says. No other details are provided about those conversations. Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire at an Aurora theater last month during a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" leaving 12 dead and injuring 58 others. He has been charged with murder and attempted murder and faces two weapons charges. The new document also reveals more details about the timeline of events leading up to the theater shooting, beginning with Holmes failing his graduate school oral boards a month before the shooting. Holmes was a Ph.D. candidate studying neuroscience at the University of Colorado's Anschutz campus in Aurora. Soon after, he was ""denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor."" Prosecutors said Thursday that the threats were reported to campus police. Subsequently, Holmes ""started the process to voluntarily withdraw from his graduate studies program."" ""After he was denied access to the CU-Denver Anschutz campus, he began a detailed and complex plan to obtain firearms, ammunition, a tear-gas grenade, body armor, a gas-mask and a ballistic helmet, which were used in the commission of the murders and the attempted murders,"" the document says. A shackled Holmes, his hair still dyed red, appeared at a Thursday court hearing in the ongoing fight between defense attorneys and prosecutors over access to his educational records. The main issue is whether the prosecution should receive non-medical documents from the university. These would include admissions forms, grades and transcripts. Prosecutors argue that Holmes' records ""are relevant to the investigation."" The judge did not issue an immediate ruling. The University of Colorado said this month that it hired a former U.S. attorney to conduct an independent review into how the school handled Holmes. A court document revealed that Holmes was a patient of CU psychiatrist Lynne Fenton before the killings. She was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH reported this month, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. They told KMGH that Fenton contacted several members of a ""behavioral evaluation and threat assessment"" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. The ""BETA"" team consists of key staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus, the school says on its website. ""Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team"" in ""the first 10 days"" of June, but it ""never came together"" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH.","New court documents reveal conversations about wanting to kill .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Army is recalling more than 16,000 sets of body armor even though the secretary of the Army disagrees with a Department of Defense report that some of the ceramic plates failed testing and might not offer the protection required for troops on the battlefield. At issue are the removable bullet-proof ceramic plates that are part of a soldier's body armor. The report by the Department of Defense inspector general's office, expected to be released officially on Friday, says the Army had flawed testing procedures before awarding contracts to make the armor plates. ""DoD does not have assurance that its body armor provides a standard level of protection,"" according to the report. Army Secretary Peter Geren denied any problems with testing but said the armor is being recalled as a precaution and will be replaced with other plates that are not part of the recall, according to Army officials. The recall represents only about 1.6 percent of the 1.9 million sets of body armor that have been put in the field since 2001, Army officials said. Ceramic plates are the bullet-proof part of a soldier's body armor that slide into the front and back of the vest. In a letter of response to the report from Inspector General Gordon Heddell, Geren said he did not agree with the findings and was supported by the military's preeminent testing expert. ""According to the DOT&E (director of operational test and evaluation), the plates at issue passed the tests. Again, that is not only the conclusion of the Army, but of the Department of Defense experts in the highly specialized field of ballistic testing,"" Geren wrote. Because there is a disagreement between two Department of Defense entities, Geren is forwarding the matter to the deputy secretary of defense to make a final ruling on whether the questioned armor should be discarded or returned to the inventory for possible use, according to Army officials. The report focused on a number of issues, many of which the Army agreed with. However, the Army and the inspector general are at odds over a testing step called ""first article testing,"" initial testing of a product to meet Army standards. The inspector general says the Army did not perform the tests correctly on some of the plates. Army officials said there is no evidence of any imperfections in the plates. The inspector general's report also questioned why the Army had different criteria than the U.S. Special Forces in its testing of the equipment. ""The criteria differed significantly, even when testing against the same threats,"" the report said. ""Differences included the number of plates tested (sample size), the shot pattern, the environmental conditions, the type of tests, and the pass/fail guidelines."" Army officials close to the issue said not one soldier had been killed because of an armor defect. Officials said the Army has X-ray machines in the field to examine damaged plates to look for problems and build an information database to improve on the armor technology. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, who requested the audit and has been pressing the issue of looking into body armor since 2006, said that while the recall represents a relatively low percentage of plates, there is still a potential danger. ""It is way too high for me. We don't know how many soldiers could not live or escape being egregiously wounded because their body armor did not work,"" she said. The inspector general audit is the second requested by Slaughter, who did not like the initial findings and thinks the Army is wrong in its thinking about the current findings. She called the report ""devastating."" ""It was their responsibility to make sure that [the body armor] is state of the art and it will do everything it can to protect that soldier,"" she said. ""I am anxiously awaiting the results of this dispute.""","Secretary of the Army disagrees with Defense report citing flawed test procedures .

"(CNN)  -- A November 10 execution date was set Wednesday for John Allen Muhammad, convicted in a series of sniper-style shootings that terrorized the Washington area in 2002. John Allen Muhammad, pictured in 2004, was convicted in the 2002 murder of Dean Harold Meyers. Prince William County, Virginia, Circuit Judge Mary Grace O'Brien set the date at a teleconference hearing Wednesday, according to the Web site of Muhammad's attorney, Jonathan Sheldon. Prosecutors had requested a November 9 execution date. That date is a Monday, Sheldon wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""I pointed out that while I did not necessarily object to Monday, Nov. 9, executions are usually scheduled for Thursdays, and that often unpredictable events occur the day before an execution requiring action by the courts or governor, or others,"" he wrote. ""I asked that the execution be on a Tuesday so that government offices would be open the day prior to the execution. The [attorney general] did not object to this and the judge stated that it was a good idea."" On the Web site, Sheldon said he will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in October and ask Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine for clemency. Muhammad, 48, was convicted in the murder of Dean Harold Meyers at a Manassas, Virginia, gas station. Meyers was killed by a single bullet, which became the signature of the two-person sniper team. During a three-week period in October 2002, Muhammad and his young protege, Lee Boyd Malvo, shot 13 people, killing 10 of them, police said. The two also are suspected in other shootings, including ones in Tacoma, Washington; Montgomery, Alabama; and elsewhere in the Washington metro area. Muhammad was convicted in the Meyers killing and in a murder in Maryland. Prosecutors called the second conviction ""insurance"" in case the Virginia conviction was overturned. Malvo was convicted in one of the Virginia shootings and sentenced to life in prison.

"(CNN) -- Amy Bishop Anderson -- the professor accused of shooting six of her colleagues, killing three -- pleaded guilty to attempted murder charges on Tuesday and agreed to plead guilty to a capital murder charge in two weeks. Appearing in Madison County Circuit Court, Bishop Anderson accepted an agreement with the state and pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder. She also faces one count of capital murder. Bishop Anderson will plead guilty to the capital murder charge before a jury on September 24, according to CNN affiliate WAFF. Under Alabama law, juries are required in capital murder cases even when a plea agreement has been reached. According to the terms of the plea deal, Bishop could be sentenced to life in prison for each of the attempted murder charges. Police: Records on '86 shooting involving professor found . Prosecutors say Bishop Anderson, who taught at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, killed department head Gopi Podila and associate professors Maria Davis and Adriel Johnson during a biology department faculty meeting on February 12, 2010. Bishop Anderson, a Harvard-trained geneticist, had been denied tenure at the university a few weeks before the shootings. WAFF reported that prosecutors said Bishop Anderson's pleas on Tuesday confirm the facts of the shootings. The jury on September 24 will hear a shortened version of the case. A judge in March 2010 placed a gag order on attorneys and law enforcement personnel prohibiting them from talking to the media. Bishop Anderson also has been also charged in Massachusetts with the murder of her brother, Seth, in 1986. Her brother's shooting originally had been ruled an accident, but the case was reopened after the Alabama shootings.

"(CNN) -- The former director general of the BBC, in a letter to a British lawmaker, tried to explain what he knew about a journalistic investigation into claims of abuse by Jimmy Savile, a late children's TV presenter. A slew of sexual abuse allegations against Savile, a BBC star and household name in Britain, have emerged over the past month. A second scandal broke with the news that the BBC show ""Newsnight"" had been investigating similar allegations but dropped the case in late 2011. This week, Mark Thompson, who was director general of the BBC at the time of the ""Newsnight"" investigation, provided apparently conflicting statements on what he knew about the allegations and when. How celebrity child sex scandal has rocked the BBC . ""I was not notified or briefed about the 'Newsnight' investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation,"" Thompson said in a statement Monday. ""During my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile."" On Tuesday, an account published in the New York Times quoted Thompson as saying that a BBC reporter told him about the investigation at a party in December. Thompson is now the incoming chief executive at the Times. Questioned by British MP Rob Wilson, Thompson offered an explanation in a letter that attempted to reconcile his two statements. He explained that he learned of the investigation but not its details and was satisfied when he inquired to his senior management and was told that it had been dropped for journalistic reasons. ""I was never formally notified about the 'Newsnight' investigation and was not briefed about the allegations they were examining and to what extent, if at all, those allegations related to Savile's work at the BBC,"" Thompson wrote in the letter, dated Tuesday. Late BBC TV presenter accused of sex abuse . When he learned of ""Newsnight's"" investigation and was told it was dropped, he did not question it, because such decisions are common, he said. He added that he finds the bevy of sexual abuse allegations against Savile ""exceptionally grave."" ""I have been appalled by what I have read and heard in recent weeks and can only imagine the sufferings that these crimes have caused to the victims,"" he wrote. The public editor of The New York Times, Margaret Sullivan, wrote that the scandal is enough for the company to think about the baggage he is bringing to New York. ""His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The Times and its journalism -- profoundly. It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events,"" she wrote Wednesday. The scandal has gripped the UK media, with many questioning who knew what and when about the alleged abuse of young teenage girls, and it threatens lasting damage to the reputation of the UK's public broadcaster. Savile died in October last year at the age of 84. London's Metropolitan Police last week launched a criminal investigation into claims of child sexual abuse by ""Savile and others,"" many of which date back to the 1960s and '70s. The force said that more than 200 potential victims had been identified. The BBC said Monday that the editor of ""Newsnight"" was ""stepping aside"" over questions about why his show never broadcast its investigation into Savile. The furor has shocked a generation in Britain who grew up watching Savile, one of the most recognizable figures in British showbiz from the 1960s to the 1980s, or listening to his radio shows. He was the first host of the BBC's hugely popular ""Top of the Pops"" music show, and his own program, ""Jim'll Fix It,"" ran for almost 20 years. Thousands of children wrote in every week with special requests for him to ""fix,"" or make happen. The controversy has prompted a wider examination of an apparent culture of sexism at the BBC in past decades that may have fed into abusive behavior. The allegations against the famous Savile are a reminder of how little the public really knows about celebrities, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""It's another one of these instances that shows us whenever there's someplace we think we won't see scandal, eventually, we end up seeing it,"" he said. The scandal brings the venerable BBC into question and feeds the state of cynicism that the public feels for media institutions, he said. ""The whole thing is highly disturbing,"" he said.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The residents of zoos are often the first to be neglected when cities are hit by man-made or natural disasters. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson discovered a dire situation Tuesday at the Tripoli Zoo, struggling to function as a nationwide conflict rages around it. Robertson found the gates locked and was told the zoo was under renovation -- that there were no animals there. But a big cat's roar told a different story, and Robertson followed the sound -- underscored by the echo of gunfire in the distance -- to find enclosures holding a tiger, lions, giant tortoises, hippos, hyenas, bears, monkeys, deer, emus and more. All the animals appeared undernourished and struggling as they waited for food and for water where there was little or none to be found. A tiger, loose skin hanging on its frame, prowled its enclosure when it sensed visitors. ""Just looking at him, you can see how thin he is in the way he is walking -- those back thighs, they're so skinny,"" Robertson said of the big cat. ""There's no one here to tell us how often they're being fed or how much they're getting fed,"" Robertson said as he walked the deserted grounds. ""We don't even know if there's a vet here to take care of them."" During the CNN visit, the zookeeper arrived and explained that for seven days amid the turmoil of conflict in Tripoli, the animals got nothing. Now 10 of the 200-person staff have returned and are trying to feed all the animals. The big cats get only half of what they need. And all the animals languish with one essential in very short supply. ""Water is these animals' most pressing need,"" Robertson said.

The prospect of leaving my first child home with a stranger while my husband and I worked wasn't ideal, but the only day care center in our neighborhood had a year-long wait list and our families weren't in a position to help. Entrusting Jake, now 12, to a babysitter seemed like our only option. The catastrophic story unfolding in New York City of a nanny who has been arrested for stabbing to death two young children she was paid to care for is unimaginable for any parent. While I could never have envisioned anything as demonic as what 50-year-old Yoselyn Ortega is now accused of, I was anxious in those early weeks nearly every morning before I left for work: Would our new nanny shake my son if he cried? Would she scald him accidently, even intentionally, when she bathed him? I was so concerned that my husband and I installed nanny-cams around our apartment and hired a private company to perform criminal background checks. The Krim family likely followed their own safety checklist and never could have anticipated such a horror either. Their tragedy highlights the question turning in the pit of every parent's stomach: Is my child truly safe with this woman? Ms. Ortega was hardly a stranger to the husband and wife who hired her. On the mother's blog (which has since been taken offline) she apparently wrote about spending more than a week visiting with her nanny's family in the Dominican Republic. ""We spent the past 9 days in the Dominican Republic. We spent half the time at our nanny, Josie's sisters home in Santiago,"" she reportedly wrote. ""We met Josie's amazing familia!!! And the Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!! More pics to come!!"" As soon as I heard news of this story, it reminded me of the New York Times Magazine piece written by Lisa Belkin in 2007 about her babysitter, Noreen. Noreen Mulholland cared for Lisa's two sons, but went on to become a nurse in Ireland who was later convicted of assaulting two patients, poisoning one of them. One day when Lisa's son was 5, he confided in her that he didn't want Noreen to come anymore. ""Noreen scares me,"" Alex told her. Alex was never hurt, but her son's words and her nanny's reaction to them made Lisa start thinking that something wasn't quite right with Noreen. How can any family really know all there is to know about their nanny? Nanny- cams can't see into a person's soul and mental illness won't necessarily show up on a background check. I asked New York State's Office of Children and Family Services what parents can do during a nanny search to make the best (and safest) choices. The agency recommends obtaining a prospective caregiver's school records, criminal history, credit background and driving record. New York parents have access to this information in part because of Kieran's Law, passed in 1998 and named for Kieran Dunne, a 10-month-old boy who died in 1993 after a nanny threw him across a room. While all of the above might be helpful, the guidelines seem utterly toothless in the face of the evil we've seen in New York. The Krims could have done everything in their power to investigate their nanny before hiring her -- and none of the research could have predicted a mental snap of such massive proportions. My son grew up unscathed and developed a loving relationship with our nanny. And two years later when our daughter was born, our nanny was still with us, providing love and much-needed support. Clearly we were lucky. The opinions expressed are solely those of Allison Gilbert.","A New York nanny was arrested for allegedly stabbing two children to death .

"(CNN) -- The Giants proved they can win in many ways Thursday beating Detroit 2-0 after only getting five hits. The win gives the Giants a two games to none World Series lead and comes a day after the Giants pummeled the Tigers hitting three home runs in an 8-3 victory. ""We play a lot of close games, and these guys are used to it,"" said Giants coach Bruce Bochy. ""It's the best of seven, we're up 2. It's great to get off to a good start."" Three San Francisco pitchers combined to throw a two-hit shutout. Madison Bumgarner went seven innings, and Santiago Casilla and Sergio Romo each pitched a hitless inning as the National League champions scratched their way to the win. The Giants' Hunter Pence scored on a double-play groundout by Brandon Crawford to give the Giants a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the seventh and Pence hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth to make it 2-0. ""It was a great collective effort tonight,"" Pence said. "" I feel like everyone is on the same page, and we're just going out there and really playing as hard as we can for each other."" San Francisco only managed five hits but also drew four walks. Tigers starter Doug Fister gutted out six innings after being struck by a batted ball. Gregor Blanco lined a ball off the top of Fister's head in the second inning. The Detroit pitcher was struck just above the right ear and the ball went into center field for a single. The Tigers trainer checked on Fister and the pitcher stayed in the game. The series heads to Detroit for Game 3 on Saturday night.

"(CNN) -- Florida prosecutors dropped charges against a husband and wife accused of training for a race war as part of a white supremacist group, their attorney said Monday. Prosecutors haven't responded yet to CNN's calls. Ten other American Front members, including alleged leader Marcus Faella, are set for trial next month, while two co-defendants have entered guilty pleas. Jennifer and Mark McGowan were charged with violating a Florida law against participating in paramilitary training by taking part in target practice and hand-to-hand combat training with others in the American Front. ""They were a group of citizens having barbecues, and nothing illegal was occurring out there,"" attorney Sam Edwards said. ""The state made allegations they were firing guns and saying racial epithets against blacks while shooting into jugs, but there is no corroborative evidence. But even so, it is a protected First Amendment right."" According to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of skinhead groups. Faella, according to police documents, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups say has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California. The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL. ""Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race,"" investigators wrote in an affidavit, referring to the group by its initials. ""Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities."" According to police, Faella's group watched videos training members in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at a St. Cloud, Florida, compound, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote. The group was allegedly making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation. The charges came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound after Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had made of training exercises, according to the arrest affidavit. Defendant Kent McLellan, 22, pleaded guilty on October 16 to paramilitary training and was sentenced to four years' probation, prosecutors said. Christopher Brooks, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and will serve three years in prison. In exchange for his plea in August, prosecutors dropped two other felony counts -- participating in paramilitary training and conspiracy to shoot into an occupied dwelling -- according to Bernie Presha, a spokesman for the state attorney's office for Osceola and Orange counties.

"(CNN) -- ""Baby, law isn't a good profession for girls,"" my father told me. ""Stay with music, dear, that is what you and your people do so well,"" my high school dean said. I was 16, and asking them the most important question of my life: Will you tell me how to become a lawyer? My dad was a product of the segregated South. Orphaned at the age of 12, he pulled himself up by his bootstraps. After leaving Georgia for Washington, where he lived with a relative, he attended an integrated school, Dunbar High. Eventually, he earned his way into Syracuse University, where he was one of the first black men to graduate. In spite of his achievements, he and our family faced discrimination. Nevertheless, he kept his sense of humor, and worked hard to be a good provider. My father's message was loving and protective. He didn't want to see me hurt. My dean's message was scornful and discriminatory. She took a sledgehammer to my dreams, and when I left her office that day, I was crushed and fighting tears. I couldn't understand her answer. I wanted to go to a good college, attend a respected law school and advocate for people needing help and craving justice. I refused to abandon these high hopes. Opinion: Does Romney 'get' women who work? And I didn't. I followed my dreams and went to law school. More than 40 years later, I became one of the 10 women named to top policy-making posts in the early months of Gov. Mitt Romney's administration in Massachusetts. There, I headed up the Department of Workforce Development. During Gov. Romney's tenure, our state led the nation in terms of the ratio of women holding top spots in the administration, and to this day, that's something about which I am incredibly proud to have been a part of. And so, as I've heard criticism about Gov. Romney's admirable record of recruiting women to serve in his administration, I feel compelled to speak out about the Mitt Romney I know. I remember meeting him for the first time. I was struck by his authenticity, and over the years that I worked with him, I saw the accuracy of my first impression. Gov. Romney's overriding commitment was not to self-promotion -- as is so often the case for politicians -- but for the people he served, and the people he served with. He believes in empowering women. I would know, because I was one of those women he recruited and respected. Opinion: Romney's empty 'binders full of women' Today, there are more than 5 million women around this country -- mothers, daughters, breadwinners -- who are unemployed. They are not only robbed of their dignity and their self-respect; they are also robbed of the results of decades of hard work. More women are in poverty -- 25.7 million -- than at any time in our nation's history. And for too many young people, the doors of opportunity remain closed shut by these tough economic circumstances. Half of recent college graduates are either jobless or underemployed. The cost of college has continued to rise in the last four years and student loan debt stands at record levels. When Mitt Romney was governor, he worked with a legislature that was 87% Democratic to get things done. And to me, that really meant something: I consider myself a liberal Democrat. For him, it wasn't about who you were, it was about the quality of your ideas. That's how he improved the economy and balanced the budget, but that's not all he accomplished. Gov. Romney also initiated the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship to cover the cost of college at public institutions of higher education in the state for deserving high school students based on academic merit. During his time as governor, Massachusetts maintained its schools' ranking as first in the nation. Opportunity. Empowerment. That's what Mitt Romney has stood for while in politics and in business, and that's what matters to women. In government, he created opportunities for young people to attend college. In business, he took a chance on people to allow their dreams to flourish into realities. I've been able to rise in life because of people who see the world this way. Looking back, I'm grateful to those who believe that education is a civil right and that the dreams of all should be encouraged and cultivated. And that's precisely why I'm supporting Mitt Romney.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A top Lebanese intelligence official was on his way to discuss a recent threat allegedly linked to Syria when he was assassinated last week, a lawmaker told CNN on Monday. A car bomb killed Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and two others Friday, 30 minutes before he was to meet with Lebanese lawmaker Amar Houri to discuss a threatening text message sent to the lawmaker from a Syrian phone number, according to parliamentarian Ahmad Fatfat. Similar threats had been sent via text message to three other lawmakers, including Fatfat, although they did not realize it until after al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said. All four are members of Lebanon's Future Movement, the largest member of the vocally anti-Syrian March 14 political coalition led by Saad Hariri. After al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said he and his colleagues received another text from a similar phone number threatening further killings: ""Congratulations, the countdown has started,"" the text read. ""One of ten."" Al-Hassan, who was killed along with a bodyguard and a bystander, was an icon among many fellow Sunni Muslims -- including those aligned with Hariri's opposition coalition -- for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. But as much as he was loved by some, he angered others -- especially those backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and many affiliated with Hezbollah, the Shiite militant and political movement that has a prominent role in Lebanon's government. The U.S. government labels it a terrorist organization. However, Hezbollah is widely popular with many of Lebanon's Shiite Muslims. Al-Hassan: A polarizing figure . The lawmakers had told al-Hassan about the threatening texts they had received before Friday's attack, and al-Hassan had agreed to meet with one of them Friday to discuss the details. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday that an FBI team will be sent to Lebanon to assist in the investigation into al-Hassan's death. Since the assassination, sporadic fighting has erupted across Lebanon, threatening to plunge the country into chaos and raising fears that it could be drawn into the bloody 19-month-old civil war in neighboring Syria. After al-Hassan's funeral Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward the prime minister's office, calling for his dismissal. By midday Monday, at least three people had been killed in the northern city of Tripoli, while another person was killed in the southern city of Sidon, and another killed in Beirut, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported. More than two dozen people were injured nationwide. Amid the unrest, the youth wing of the March 14 coalition called for a peaceful rally in Beirut's Martyrs' Square on Monday evening. The March 14 movement is an anti-Syrian coalition that emerged after the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. His son, Saad, leads the coalition. Key players in Lebanon's latest crisis . Syria has condemned the attack but that hasn't stopped accusations it is behind Friday's killing, which marked the country's highest-profile assassination in more than seven years. The United States has also condemned the attack and vowed to assist in investigating the bombing. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: An FBI team is en route to Lebanon .

"Ortley Beach, New Jersey (CNN) -- Anthony Duszczak cast an eye towards the roiling sea and shrugged. ""We're staying, we're local. We'll figure it out."" His dad, Wayne, feels the same. ""You don't get to see many things here normally -- everything's pretty boring,"" he says. Not boring today, though, and it will be less so in the hours ahead. Wayne, 62, is a retired field technician for Verizon. He lives here year round and feels safe. ""We'll be fine,"" he tells me. ""If it floods, I've got a boat, and if we need to get out quick I've got a big truck."" Anthony, 20, was born on the island and has lived here his entire life. ""I'm a surfer and the waves are normally good after a storm,"" he says as the wind whips down their street, shooting stinging nettles of rain into our faces. ""It's pretty crazy but I'm sure we'll be OK."" We're on Ortley Beach on New Jersey's barrier islands -- one of the frontlines awaiting the official arrival of Sandy. Packed with vacationers during the summer months, it's quieter this time of year. Most of those who remain are retired, or tourism workers taking some down time. If our few hours there showed Sandy's warm-up, her actual arrival might make Wayne and Anthony Duszczak regret their decision to stay. Hours ahead of the worst of the weather, sea water cascades down residential streets. Debris is already piling up on side streets, some of it jetsam from the ocean, some of it washed from front yards. Down the road at the Joey Harrison Surf Club, a local landmark, damage is already being done. The outside wooden deck is gone, the railings too, and the surf that is normally at least 50 yards away across the beach is rolling inside the club. A door is shattered, hanging by its hinge, the floor sodden, and members' faces long. ""This could be worse than 1962,"" says one of the club managers, Gordy Mack. ""If it's like this now, who knows what it will be like tonight."" Gordy is one of those planning to stay through the storm. As we speak, one of the biggest waves of the day smacks into the concrete patio and spills over us as we run inside. The wave follows us. More to clean up tomorrow. Local police chief Mike Mastronardy says emergency workers have done what they can. ""We've had the mandatory evacuation order out and most folks have gone, but some are determined to stay,"" he says. ""But I'm worried. The sea has broken through the dunes in several places and we're not even close to the worst of this."" The vast majority of residents have heeded the call to leave, and there's a ghost town feeling. Those who have ignored the advice to leave are hunkered down. Not far away we find Joe Lewis taking a cell phone video of the sea coming over the dunes and coursing down a street. ""I'm not staying -- it's a little ridiculous,"" he says. ""I want to be able to live through this. ""It's pretty bad. I was talking to one of my friends who was here in 62 and he's leaving, so..."" Joe heads to his car to leave the island, leaving his unfinished sentence to speak for itself. We head back across the bridge to the mainland. ""Glad you got back,"" says one of the police officers who's helping block access the other way. ""Gonna be a long night.""","On New Jersey's barrier islands, most residents are leaving .

"(CNN) -- British police investigating abuse claims against disgraced TV host Jimmy Savile arrested a London man Sunday on suspicion of sexual offenses. Police did not release the suspect's name, but said the man they arrested falls under the ""Savile and others"" strand of their investigation. The man was later released on bail. British media reported that the man arrested was 1970s pop star Gary Glitter. A TV documentary a month ago detailed allegations of sexual abuse against Savile. Police investigating the scandal are dealing with about 300 apparent victims, Cmdr. Peter Spindler told reporters. Savile's favored targets were apparently girls in their mid-teens in what Spindler said was ""alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale."" The British TV icon died in October 2011 at age 84. But authorities have said they are preparing an arrest strategy for others, still living, against whom allegations have been made in connection with the Savile case. Profile: Idolized in life, reviled in death . Countless Britons who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and his children's program ""Jim'll Fix It"" have been left reeling by the slew of claims against him in the past month. The reputation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, his former employer, has also been tainted by the scandal amid questions over how his abuse went undetected, and its decision to drop a program investigating allegations him last year. ""Now the BBC risks squandering public trust because one of its stars over three decades was apparently a sexual criminal; because he used his programme and popularity as a cover for his wickedness; because he used BBC premises for some of his attacks; and because others -- BBC employees and hangers-on -- may also have been involved,"" BBC Chairman Lord Patten wrote in an editorial published Sunday in the Daily Mail. The BBC has said it is horrified by the revelations and has launched two independent inquiries. How scandal has rocked BBC . Sunday's arrest comes a day after Savile's family made its first public statement since a slew of claims of sexual abuse of under-age girls destroyed the reputation of a man they had regarded as a hero. Savile's nephew, Roger Foster, had defended his late uncle -- who hosted shows watched and heard by a generation of young Britons -- in a newspaper interview before the allegations emerged in a TV documentary a month ago. But as those few claims snowballed into hundreds, the family had to face up to the horrific truth: that the man they were so proud of as a media star and tireless charity fundraiser had a far darker side to his past. ""I watched the program in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle. This wasn't the man we knew and loved,"" Foster said. ""We began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle. How could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing? ""Why would a man who raised so much money for charity, who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts? How could anyone live their life doing the 'most good and most evil' at the same time?"" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","British media say that the man arrested was 1970s pop star Gary Glitter .

"London (CNN) -- If there's one thing you notice in the Financial Times' sprawling office building on London's Southwark Bridge it's that there are newspapers...everywhere. Piles upon piles of trademark salmon pink paper, the fruit of endless days of hard work that even the most seasoned journalists can't bring themselves to recycle.

"Fort Belvoir, Virginia (CNN) -- Charges against the Army officer who refused deployment to Afghanistan because he says President Barack Obama doesn't have the authority to send him, should be thrown out says his attorney, Paul Jensen. Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin went before a military judge -- and a standing-room-only courtroom -- in Virginia on Friday to face three charges of disobeying a lawful order, one count of missing movement (not deploying with his unit) and one count of dereliction of duty. He did not enter a plea at the arraignment hearing, and Jensen asked to defer any plea until after the court could consider a motion to dismiss the case. Judge Denise Lind, an Army colonel who was wearing basic camouflage fatigues under her black robes, agreed to the request and gave Lakin's attorneys until August 20 to file a motion to dismiss. Both the prosecution and the defense will then have until August 27 to formulate and send written responses to the motion. Hearings on the motion will follow on September 2 and September 14. Future hearings in the case will be at Fort Meade, Maryland. If the charges are not dismissed, court martial proceedings will begin on October 13. Lakin and his legal team -- Jensen, Jensen's assistant and Lakin's free-of-cost military attorney -- arrived 15 minutes late, then the lawyers went into a meeting with Lind. The colonel remained in the 34-seat courtroom, which was full of soldiers, primarily officers, all wearing basic camouflage fatigues. Lakin smiled once while talking with Jensen's assistant but otherwise didn't convey much emotion or say much except ""Yes, ma'am,"" and ""No, ma'am"" to the judge. In addition to pushing back his plea, Lakin waived the opportunity to choose whether a judge or jury would decide his fate. Lakin is a decorated Army doctor and an 18-year veteran who is now facing court martial for disobeying orders to ship out for another tour of duty in Afghanistan. He specializes as a primary care physician and flight surgeon. Doctors in those positions often fly in medevac helicopters in the war zone. Lakin says the orders are illegal because, he claims, Obama --  the commander in chief --  has not proven he was born in this country and is therefore ineligible to be president. Lakin wants Obama to produce his birth certificate. ""It's a fundamental of the Constitution, and my oath of office is to the Constitution. And I believe we need truth on this matter,"" Lakin told CNN's ""AC 360"" in May. Two newspapers in Honolulu, Hawaii, published announcements of Obama's birth there in August, 1961. The Republican governor of Hawaii, Linda Lingle, has recently certified Obama's birth certificate as legitimate. ""I had my health director, who is a physician by background, go personally view the birth certificate in the birth records of the Department of Health,"" Lingle recently told WABC. ""The president was in fact born at Kapi'olani Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii. And that's just a fact."" ""It's been established he was born here,"" the governor continued. ""I can understand why people want to make certain that the constitutional requirement of being a natural-born American citizen ... but the question has been asked and answered. And I think just we should all move on now."" Despite the evidence, roughly a quarter of Americans remains skeptical, including Lakin and other so-called ""birthers."" Birthers have argued that Obama was not born in Hawaii, or that if he was, his citizenship was invalidated by living overseas as a child. Lakin has been steadfast in his own defense. ""I am not guilty of these charges, and will plead 'not guilty' to them because of my conviction that our commander in chief may be ineligible under the United States Constitution to serve in that highest of all offices,"" Lakin said in a news release issued this week by the American Patriot Foundation -- a group that has established a fund for his legal defense. ""The truth matters. The Constitution matters,"" he said. ""If President Obama is a natural-born citizen, then the American people deserve to see proof, and if he is not, then I believe the orders in this case were illegal.""

"(CNN) -- Christian Finnegan describes his character on the TBS comedy ""Are We There Yet?"" as ""the obnoxious wacky neighbor,"" but also admits he's ""... probably more properly known as 'the white guy' on the show."" For better or worse, it's a role he tackles with a bit of experience. ""This is not my first go-round as the representative of American whiteness."" It's true. Some people may remember him as Chad from the classic ""Chappelle Show"" sketch ""Mad Real World."" You can find it online, but be warned that it's beyond not safe for work.

These days, however, Finnegan is rather svelte. In our video interview, he discusses his dramatic weight loss and why he doesn't talk about it in his act. Other fans -- or at least casual observers of things that happen on TV -- may also remember Finnegan for his stint on VH1's ""Best Week Ever"" where, for a time, his personal and professional life revolved around being on top of everything related to pop culture. It's a job he's happy to call his past. ""I am so relieved to not have to give a (expletive) any more,"" he says. ""Like the Kardashians ... that kind of came after 'Best Week Ever' and it's such a delight to not have to know anything about those idiots."" Finnegan still considers himself somewhat savvy when it comes to contemporary lifestyles and people-being-famous-for-being-famous, but his real interest is government -- a passion that eventually led to regular appearances on MSNBC's former show ""Countdown with Keith Olbermann."" ""I'm kind of obsessed with politics,"" Finnegan says. ""It's really just sort of the only way a guy in his 30s can procrastinate and justify it. I will watch the same episode of ""Hardball"" three times and tell myself, 'I'm watching the news. I'm staying on top of things.' No, you just don't want to do any work.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Fifteen crew members of a South African Airways flight spent the night in jail after customs officials found marijuana and cocaine worth nearly half a million dollars hidden aboard a long-distance flight to London, British customs officials said Wednesday. South African Airways said it has a zero-tolerance approach towards any criminal activity. The 10 women and five men -- who include three pilots -- were detained on arrival from Johannesburg, South Africa, after customs officials found 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of marijuana and 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of cocaine in three pieces of baggage, HM Revenue and Customs said. The drugs are estimated to be worth a total of £310,000 ($428,000), customs officials added. Border agents arrested the crew at London's Heathrow Airport on suspicion of involvement in smuggling prohibited drugs into the United Kingdom, customs spokesman Bob Gaiger said. He said he was not able to disclose what led investigators to believe the suitcases belonged to the crew members. Customs officials interviewed the crew members overnight, and all were released on bail Wednesday pending further inquiries, Gaiger said. They were not charged, according to the airline. South African Airways said it launched its own investigation involving the airline's security and the South African Police Service. ""SAA has a zero-tolerance approach towards the use of the airline's services for any criminal activity,"" airline spokeswoman Robyn Chalmers said.","10 women and 5 men were detained on arrival from Johannesburg .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Ryanair attacked ""idiot"" and ""lunatic"" bloggers Wednesday after a customer highlighted what he said were flaws in the budget airline's Web site. Jason Roe said he found the comments by Ryanair staffers offensive and was disappointed by the airline's response. Dublin-based Web developer Jason Roe was booking plane tickets online when he discovered what he thought was a glitch that allowed him to book free Ryanair tickets. He duly posted details of the ""glitch"" on his blog as well as a message on Twitter. Soon people were trying to replicate what he had done with little success, and he later confirmed that he was unable to book the tickets without paying. But among responses on his Web site were three purporting to be from Ryanair staff. One read: ""You're an idiot and a liar!! fact is! you've opened one session then another and requested a page meant for a different session, you are so stupid you dont even know how you did it!"" Another said: ""Website is not perfect, Life is not perfect...If you would work in your pathetic life on a such big project in a such busy environment with so little resources, you would know that the most important is to have usual user behavior scenarios working rather than spending time on improbable and harmless things."" Tell us what you think . Roe said he later traced the IP addresses of the postings to the airline's headquarters in Dublin, something Ryanair later confirmed to CNN. ""Ryanair can confirm that a Ryanair staff member did engage in a blog discussion,"" said the airline's spokesman Stephen McNamara. ""It is Ryanair policy not to waste time and energy in corresponding with idiot bloggers and Ryanair can confirm that it won't be happening again. Lunatic bloggers can have the blog sphere all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of air travel."" Roe told CNN he was disappointed with Ryanair's response. ""I was hoping the corporate response wasn't in line with the staff members, whose comments I found offensive. This wasn't a big issue and was really just a small problem; they could have said they were working on it and they over-reacted."" ""You can only imagine how many customers they could lose by treating them like this,"" he added. A spokesman for ABTA, which represents tour operators and travel agents, said the comments by Ryanair came as no surprise. ""They treat their customers with contempt. We know that Ryanair doesn't put any store on customer relations,"" said Frances Tuke. ""This is the way Ryanair conducts its business. Their clear goal is to provide cheap flights but we don't believe this is the way to provide customer satisfaction. Our members don't do this -- their customers expect a high level of service.""","Ryanair slams ""idiot, lunatic"" bloggers after customer highlights flaws on Web site .

"(CNN) -- It was the longest game in Premier League history, and Saturday's unconvincing victory must have lasted an eternity for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini and the disgruntled fans of the big-spending English club. Last season the Italian was a hero as he guided City to a first league title in 44 years, but with a second successive early Champions League exit imminent following Wednesday's defeat at Ajax, his future does not seem so certain. Criticized for tactics that his players apparently could not understand, Mancini made more changes for the match at home to Swansea -- but a lackluster first half ended to the sound of booing from the stands. Carlos Tevez, last season's enfant terrible after going AWOL following his feud with Mancini, came to the manager's rescue after being pulled back to a deeper striking role. The Argentine netted the only goal of the game, his first since September 1, with an opportunist effort from distance in the 61st minute that sparked the first of two lengthy delays as goalkeeper Michel Vorm collapsed with a groin injury that has ruled the Dutchman out for up to six weeks. City then had an anxious wait as defender Micah Richards -- who publicly questioned Mancini after the Ajax game -- was stretchered off with a knee injury, needing an oxygen mask. With almost 13 minutes of time added on, the game beat the previous record set when Arsenal drew with Liverpool in 2011. The win moved City up to second place, a point behind Chelsea -- who take on third-placed Manchester United on Sunday. ""Our performance in the first half was so-so because I think we were so tired, but in the second half we played better, we had a lot of chances to score,"" Mancini told reporters. ""In this moment, when you are in a difficult moment, after a defeat in the Champions League, it is important we start to win quickly. ""We played three days ago and Swansea played very well. They were fresh, so it was important to take these three points. ""We now have one week when we can recover and I hope we can recover a couple of (injured) players for the next game and we can work."" Arsenal also rebounded from midweek European defeat as midfielder Mikel Arteta scored a late winner against bottom club Queens Park Rangers, who had Stephane Mbia sent off. The match marked the return of young England international midfielder Jack Wilshere after a 17-month injury absence, and the 20-year-old lasted more than an hour as he helped the London side bounce back from losses to Schalke and Norwich last weekend. Arteta's 84th-minute goal, on the rebound after his initial header hit the bar, came soon after Mbia was red-carded for kicking out at Thomas Vermaelen. ""I am very happy with the result because we lost two big games in our head, . and the confidence was a bit jaded,"" manager Arsene Wenger said after seeing his team move up to fourth place . ""We were serious, we moved the ball quite well and we needed to be patient. It was important not to make a mistake, and wait for our chance and take it."" Fulham moved up to sixth after conceding a last-minute equalizer in the 3-3 draw at Reading, who remained in the bottom three. Former Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov put the London team 3-2 up in the 88th minute, but Hal Robson-Kanu snatched his winless team's fourth draw from eight matches. Wigan moved away from the relegation zone with a 2-1 win at home to midtable West Ham, while Sunderland and Stoke played out a stalemate and Norwich drew 1-1 with fellow strugglers Aston Villa, who had Joe Bennett sent off with 40 minutes to play.","Carlos Tevez scores only goal as Manchester City struggle to 1-0 win over Swansea .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi continued his assault on the record for most goals in a calendar year as Barcelona moved three points clear in Spain with a 5-0 win at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. The Argentina star netted twice, taking him to 73 overall in 2012 -- just two short of the mark set by the legendary Brazilian Pele in 1959, and 12 behind the milestone set by German striker Gerd Muller in 1972. He gave Barca a comfortable 2-0 lead three minutes after the break with his 300th for club and country, adding to David Villa's first-half opener, and wrapped up the scoring in the 89th minute. It took the 25-year-old to a leading 13 goals in La Liga this season and 17 in all competitions. The victory put more pressure on second-placed Atletico Madrid, who host Osasuna on Sunday. Defending champions Real Madrid, now 11 points adrift of their arch-rivals, cannot afford to slip up in the trip to Real Mallorca. Barca thrashed Vallecano 7-0 in last season's corresponding fixture, but this time the home side looked like earning a more respectable result after a first half featuring striker Villa's fourth league goal this season, courtesy of Cesc Fabregas' ninth assist. But Messi smashed in a superb 48th-minute effort after Marc Montoya delivered from the right, then 25 minutes later veteran midfielder Xavi netted his 50th in La Liga from fullback Jordi Alba's cutback. Fabregas volleyed in Pedro's cross soon after, and Messi rounded the keeper to make it a five-star showing and extend new coach Tito Vilanova's unbeaten run in the league. Earlier Saturday, third-placed Malaga lost ground on the leaders after being held 0-0 at Espanyol, a result which left Manuel Pellegrini's team seven points behind Barca. Real Betis moved up to fourth with a 1-0 win at home to Valencia, while Celta Vigo drew 1-1 with third-bottom Deportivo La Coruna. Meanwhile in Italy, AC Milan bounced back from the Champions League defeat by Malaga to snatch a much-needed victory against Genoa. With coach Massimiliano Allegri under pressure after the club's worst start to a season since the 1940s, and owner Silvio Berlusconi sentenced to jail for tax evasion, the Rossoneri were indebted to a 77th-minute goal from young striker Stephan El Shaarawy. The Italy international marked his 20th birthday with a close-range finish that lifted Milan up to eighth place, with three wins from nine games. Genoa, in the club's first match under new coach Luigi Del Neri, remained in midtable. In Saturday's other match, bottom club Siena drew 0-0 with Palermo. Champions Juventus travel to Catania on Sunday while second-placed Napoli host Chievo.","Lionel Messi scores twice as Barcelona move three points clear in la Liga .

"(CNN) -- Carrie Mathison is sorely in need of some vindication on ""Homeland,"" but the fictional character's show just got more than it could hope for -- taking home four Emmys on Sunday night for outstanding drama series, writing for a drama series, lead actor (for Damian Lewis, who plays Nicholas Brody) and lead actress (for Claire Danes, who plays Carrie). All the Emmy love for ""Homeland's"" spectacular first season -- in which Danes' troubled CIA agent tried to prove that Lewis' returned prisoner of war had been turned by the enemy -- can only help build anticipation for the around-the-corner second season, slated to kick off this coming Sunday on Showtime. ""We're all wondering what's next,"" said Mandy Patinkin, who plays Carrie's CIA mentor, Saul. ""What's going to happen to her? To him? To them? To the world? We're all so curious. It's wonderful. It really is a piece that second-guesses every answer, five or 10 seconds later. It's like, 'Whoa! I didn't see that coming.' "" When the show returns, six months have lapsed since Carrie voluntarily started electroshock treatment for her bipolar condition, which caused her to lose a few crucial memories -- including one about Brody yelling out the name of a terrorist's son in his sleep. Not knowing this, the discredited Carrie has been able to let go of her obsession to prove Brody has been turned by al Qaeda and has spent her time away from the CIA living with her sister and her father, teaching ESL to adult students. Meanwhile, Brody, after deciding not to detonate a bomb to kill the vice president, has further entrenched himself into politics. Not only has Brody been elected to Congress, but he's also being vetted as a potential candidate for the next vice president, which ups the stakes in a number of ways. ""Brody's just everybody's b**** now,"" Lewis says with a laugh. ""Last year, it was all about Carrie getting squeezed by her illness, her condition, and this year, it's about Brody being caught between the forces, the two sides,"" executive producer and writer Howard Gordon said. ""He could be more dangerous in a political position. He's asking, 'Why kill a person when I can kill an idea?' And then we wonder, does he mean that? Or is he now playing both sides?"" Although the audience knows now whether Brody had in fact been turned and if Carrie was off-base in her suspicions, season 2 won't suffer from any loss of ambiguity, Lewis said. ""I was concerned at first, because season 1 presented Brody as the threat, the menace of the show, while at the same time, eliciting sympathy from the audience,"" the actor said. ""I enjoyed the confusion of that, too. But there is more pressure this season -- more anxiety, more paranoia, more sweaty palms!"" Even in Carrie's absence, the pressure is on the home front because Brody's wife, Jessica, is ""no longer in the dark,"" said Morena Baccarin, who plays Jessica. Brody's daughter Dana, who made the crucial phone call to stop Brody in the act last season, ""knows something's not right,"" said actress Morgan Saylor, who portrays the teen. ""There are things that are going to come out,"" Saylor added. ""Carrie definitely planted a seed in her."" Carrie's eventual return to the CIA -- even just informally, not as an employee -- also sweats Brody's palms as he wonders whether she's back on his trail. (She's not -- at least not initially). In the first episode of the season, ""The Smile,"" a CIA source refuses to talk to anyone but Carrie, which causes the agency to seek her help. ""There will be things that come out of that meeting,"" Gordon promised. ""And there will be battles and allegiances within the agency involved in bringing her back. There's sort of a turf war, and it's sort of incendiary."" The operation takes place in Beirut (but was shot in Israel), and to get into the region, Carrie changes her appearance and travels under a false ID. ""I love Carrie as a brunette,"" Showtime Chairman and CEO Matthew C. Blank said. ""I told Claire, 'You're the only one who can look that hot as a blonde and a brunette in a single hour.' "" Although she's disguised, her cover at one point gets blown -- and she gets out of the jam with an ingenious technique that signals that the Carrie of old is back. ""She's been put through the wringer, right?"" Danes said. ""So I think she's starting to get some validation and the vindication she's been looking for. And I think people are rooting for her. I'm so honored to be playing her. I love her."" ""The first year, we knew we had something special,"" Patinkin said. ""But you have to ask why: 'Why do they like it?' So in hindsight, I'd say that it hit a nerve about the longing to understand, and the lost ability to listen and understand like Carrie does."" Although Carrie has spent the past six months of the show not listening, and not understanding, there will come a point when she recognizes that she wasn't wrong after all, Gordon promised. ""Carrie reconciled herself to the belief that she was wrong,"" he said, ""and the pieces realign and take off in a way where there's a huge reckoning. It's a season-long process,"" building, perhaps, to a moment when Carrie and Brody finally meet up again. (Or so it seems from the previews, which also suggest a blood-covered Brody burying a body. But as everyone involved with the show cautions, ""It's not what you think it is."") ""The season really is about how does the Carrie-Brody story pan out,"" Gordon said. ""There's a lot more to come, but those two, whenever Carrie and Brody are on-screen together, it's amazing. The screen just explodes.""","Anticipation is sky-high for the return of Emmy-winning Showtime series 'Homeland'

"(EW.com) -- Distracted by the easy money of Halloween slasher films, Hollywood has long ignored the more fun-spirited side of the modern, billion-dollar Carnivalesque holiday. But it's the perfect setting for the brand of teen comedies that made John Hughes and Chris Columbus famous. That's clearly the idea behind ""Fun Size,"" which tells the story of a smart and responsible high-school senior (Nickelodeon's Victoria Justice) whose All Hallow's Eve turns into a disastrous adventure in babysitting. She wants to go to the cool dress-up party â€” her idea of a great costume is Ruth Bader Ginsberg â€” with her shallow bff (Jane Levy). But when her pathetic widowed mother (Chelsea Handler) pawns her devilish little brother on her so she can party like a teenager herself, chaos and coincidences ensue. She loses the kid at a neighborhood haunted house and has to track him down him before mom gets home. You'd hope that ""Gossip Girl"" creator Josh Schwartz, directing for the first time, would have a better feel for such matter, but ""Fun Size"" blatantly and lazily traces mediocre versions of the genre. (Who wants to be a poor poor-man's version of ""Can't Hardly Wait""?) There is no attempt to reinvent, and what might have been a half-decent homage is undermined by numbing comic failure. 'Vampire Diaries': Like Elena as a vamp? At least Levy delivers her lines with some snap, and even though she could play the snarky best friend in her sleep, she still has fun with it, which is greatly appreciated. Handler, on the other hand, looks literally pained, and fans of the talented comedian will wonder why she's already taking thankless mom roles after films like Bridesmaids proved a market for brassy female-driven comedies. Axl Rose brings gifts to 'Kimmel' crowd . This movie has no courage and little brains, and is salvaged, if at all, only by its heart.

"(CNN) -- Paul Pogba was the man Manchester United never wanted to lose -- now he's beginning to show why as he fired Juventus four points clear at the top of Serie A. Pogba struck a 92nd minute winner to see off lowly Bologna and help Juve claim a 2-1 win to make it nine victories from ten league games. The 19-year-old caused shockwaves after rejecting the chance to remain at Old Trafford and instead sign a four-year deal with the Italian club. The horror of Heysel: Football's forgotten tragedy? Fabio Quagliarella had given the home side a 54th minute lead only for Bologna to hit back through Saphir Taidi. But Pogba fired home in stoppage-time to give his side all three points and help take advantage of Napoli's surprise defeat. Napoli, who began the night in second, went down 1-0 at Atalanta, courtesy of Carlos Carmona's first-half strike. That result allowed Inter Milan to move into third place after it came from behind to see off Sampdoria 3-2. Gianni Munari had given Sampdoria a 20th minute lead but Diego Milito grabbed his 200th career goal to bring his side level. Rodrigo Palacio and Freddy Guarin then put Inter in the driving seat and despite Eder grabbing a late consolation, the hosts held on to take the points. Lazio was held to a 1-1 draw by Torino as it slipped to fourth but it sits four points clear of fifth place Fiorentina. Parma moved up to sixth position following a 3-2 victory over Roma. Ishak Belfodil scored and was sent off as the hosts came from behind to see off a Roma side, which had taken an early lead through Erik Lamela. Belfodil equalised before Marco Parolo and Cristian Zaccardo put Parma 3-1 ahead with Francesco Totti's strike failing to bring Roma a reward. Elsewhere, Cagliari overcame Siena 4-2, Chievo defeated Pescara 2-0 and Udinese was held to a 2-2 draw by Catania. In Spain's Copa del Rey, Real Madrid carved out a 4-1 win away at Alcoyano. Karim Benzema scored twice, while Kaka and Jose Rodriguez were also on target for the Spanish champions. Champions League contenders Malaga was given a tough test by minnow Cacereño as it sneaked a 4-3 win. Malaga's malady: When foreign ownership goes wrong . The Primera Liga giant had led 2-0 before the home side rallied to level before half-time. Roque Santa Cruz's second of the night and a Duda strike appeared to have killed off Cacereño, which had Pablo Vargas sent off. But the Segunda B side refused to give in and Carlos Esteve's 87th minute strike reduced the deficit to just a single goal going into the second leg. There was no such problem for Atletico Madrid as it cruised to a 3-0 victory at ten-man Real Jaen. Diego Costa, Adrian and Raul Garcia were on target for the visitors, while Dani Torres was sent off after just 26 minutes for Real. Elsewhere, Las Palmas edged out Rayo Vallecano 1-0, while Real Zaragoza triumphed over Granada by the same scoreline. Almeria recorded a two-goal advantage in its first leg after defeating Celta Vigo 2-0. Bayern unbeaten run in Bundesliga halted by Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN) -- Sergei Shevchenko is standing in an old Soviet era school building, staring at photos on a wall. The images show 10 smiling young men, wearing hockey jerseys. ""Vitali Anikeyenko. I remember this young guy very well. He was very kind. He came from Kiev,"" Shevchenko says, pointing to a picture. ""Maxim Shuvalov was the youngest. Born in 1993. He had just graduated from school."" Russia mourns hockey players killed in plane crash . Shevchenko knew them all. He was their history teacher and principal at Yaroslavl's School Number 9. He watched them learn, grow and realize their dream of playing for the only professional sporting team anyone in this small Russian city really cares about -- the Lokomotiv Hockey Club. Those 10 men were among the 37 players and officials from Lokomotiv who died when their plane crashed on September 7th, 2011. ""They were truly heroes of their time,"" Shevchenko says. ""Successful, healthy, strong and beautiful. Of course everyone wanted to be like them and they were icons to everybody."" School Number Nine gives an insight into what ice hockey and Lokomotiv mean to the people of Yaroslavl. Parents send their children here to learn maths, history, literature and hockey. The school set up its hockey program 20 years ago after teachers noticed too many students were skipping class to stay on the ice. Shevchenko says many boys from the age of five decide they want to spend their life playing hockey and the school's job is to support them. NHL feels the loss from Russian plane crash . ""Training, games, everything here is managed to achieve one goal - to make the students real, professional hockey players,"" he says. ""The spirit of hockey throughout these years has filled the life of this city so deeply it's now impossible to say where Lokomotiv ends and where Yaroslavl begins. They are one."" That bond between the city and its team was shown to the world in the days after the plane crash. The Russian built Yak-42 was supposed to carry the Lokomotiv players to Minsk for their first regular season match of Russia's top competition, the Kontinental Hockey League. The plane only stayed in the air a few moments after takeoff before slamming into a nearby river. 44 people on board were killed. One member of the crew survived. Investigators blamed pilot error. Dozens killed as Russian plane carrying hockey team crashes . The city's grief was overwhelming and one year on emotions are still raw. On the first anniversary of the crash large crowds of people visited the club's arena and the cemetery where 14 of the men are buried. They left flowers and wept openly. Friends and families of the victims marked the day by returning to the site of the plane's fiery impact. They prayed and threw flowers into the river. Some fell to their knees and broke down, still consumed by loss. The trauma is also felt far beyond Yaroslavl, throughout the international ice hockey community. Many of Lokomotiv's players and coaches came from across Russia, Europe and North America. Lokomotiv's head coach was Canadian Brad McCrimmon. His wife Maureen, daughter Carlin and son Liam traveled from the United States to be at the crash site one year after his death. They held each other and stood by the river with hundreds of other people who feel the same pain. Probe: Pilot error caused crash that killed hockey team . ""It was very hard but I couldn't imagine being anywhere else today,"" Maureen McCrimmon says. ""It feels just as bad as it did the day we found out. Sometimes I think it hasn't even sunk in yet. We still can't believe it when we come here and see this."" While many in Yaroslavl have focused on healing, the Lokomotiv hockey club has also had to dedicate a lot of effort to rebuilding. It carefully selected new players and coaches and trained hard to achieve the club's ambitious goal of returning as a competitive force in top level hockey just one year after losing its whole team. ""We're hoping to give that team an awful lot of pride to look down on and watch the way we play in a very professional manner,"" says Lokomotiv's new head coach, American Tom Rowe. On September 16th almost 10,000 screaming people watched the new Lokomotiv play a KHL game on home ice for the first time. The Yaroslavl crowd roared and desperately willed them to victory. It wasn't to be. They lost 2-1. But Lokomotiv's fans still cheered the players as they left the ice. In Yaroslavl overwhelming sadness is slowly giving way to pride and hope. But the loss of the community's most loved heroes will not be forgotten. Russian hockey player dies from injuries after plane crash . At School Number 9 principal Sergei Shevchenko says he now takes all new students to see the memorial to the lost players. It sits next to another plaque, remembering former students who died in Russia's recent wars. In Shevchenko's office he gently holds his most valued possession, a hockey stick that used to belong to his former pupil and Lokomotiv star Ivan Tkachenko. It was recovered from the plane's wreckage. ""In my arms is a piece of what Ivan used to touch, with what he went into battle with each game, with what he was never apart from for all his life, devoting it to this sport. It makes you want to be closer to him and his favorite activity. But it's very sad that the thing that Ivan used to hold exists when Ivan does not."" Editor's note: .

"(CNN) -- His stare stayed with them for days. The cold, harsh way he looked at them. The unease they just couldn't shake off when he did. So, when Austin Reed Sigg was arrested Tuesday night, accused of strangling 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing her body parts under the two-story home where he lived, many of the girls in that Denver suburb weren't shocked. ""He was so infatuated with the idea of death,"" Hannah Bane, a college classmate, told a local reporter. Detectives spent a bitter-cold Wednesday at Sigg's home in Westminster as crime scene technicians gathered more evidence in the gruesome case. They said they found parts of Jessica's body stuffed in a crawlspace under the home. The bespectacled blonde girl disappeared October 5 while walking to Witt Elementary School. Five days later, police first found parts of her body at a park 5 miles away. Volunteers formed search parties and continued scouring. The big break came Tuesday night, when Sigg's mother called 911 and handed him the phone. Sigg, police said, confessed. The arrest shocked many in the city, known for its interconnected walking trails and lush open spaces. But Christie Mueller wasn't one of them. She had bumped into Sigg, 17, twice on an isolated trail in the city. And both encounters startled her. Sigg was with friends, and the way he stared at her made her fear for her safety, she said. ""It just really freaked me out,"" Mueller told a local reporter. She said she brought her dog with her on the trail, a rugged-looking pit bull. ""I think if he hadn't been with me that day, I just wonder what would have happened."" Those who know him say Sigg was into forensics. He won awards in student crime scene investigation competitions. His father, on the other hand, had a history of committing them. The father had been arrested many times, local television stations said -- accused of domestic violence, assault, bank fraud. Sigg's parents are divorced. The local district attorney said Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, will be tried as an adult. His first court appearance is set for Thursday. Along with charges related to Jessica's death, Sigg is also accused in the May assault of a 22-year-old woman on a hiking trail. One woman shocked by all of this was Sigg's ex-girlfriend, who spoke to a local reporter but only under an assumed name. ""The Austin I knew would never have done anything like that. He was my first boyfriend. He was my first kiss. He was my first date,"" said Danni. ""He was so sweet and so kind. I know that heart is still in him."" But in his neighborhood, Sigg was known more for his penetrating stare. It was so cold, Emily Alexander said, that it bothered her daughter for days. ""She was freaked out by a teenager staring at her at the park,"" Alexander said. ""After Jessica was kidnapped, she told me she knew who it was. ""She was sure she knew who it was, and it was this teenager. Because he was 17. I didn't believe her."" Now her daughter, like many in the neighborhood, find themselves once again facing that stare -- from Sigg's mugshot as it blares from television newscasts. And, once again, feeling uneasy.

"(CNN) -- As a politically active Millennial invested in this year's election, I was surprised by my own response to the first presidential debate: I was bored. But not for all the reasons the pundits are talking about. To be sure, President Barack Obama's lackluster performance and Mitt Romney's free rein over the moderator led us into the weeds of policy without a compass. But that wasn't the only reason the candidates didn't speak to me. The debate was supposed to be about domestic issues, but focused exclusively on economic policies and health care plans. As a Millennial, or a member of the generation born in the 1980s and 1990s, I care deeply about the economy and health care. My generation faces crushing educational debt of $904 billion in 2012, up from $241 billion a decade ago; many of us don't have health insurance; and we face an unemployment rate that, at 12%, is 50% above the national average. But we also want our leaders to connect the dots. Opinion: A plea to millennials -- get out the vote . Among my own Millennial friends, we don't debate economic reform without addressing the immigrant labor force. We never discuss health care without also grappling with women's rights. And yet, the candidates Wednesday night managed to debate fine points of policy while missing the big picture. We can't build a moral economy or health care system without considering the major social challenges of our time: civil liberties, immigration, women's rights, domestic extremism and climate change. None of these issues was even mentioned in the debate. The failure to speak clearly and consistently to our generation's concerns about the world we will inherit has consequences in this election. In the 2008 election, Millennials made up 17% of the electorate and voted 66% for Obama, compared with 32% for John McCain. We were responsible for Obama's decisive seven-point victory, accounting for 80% of Obama's national popular vote margin over McCain. Our generation now makes up 24% of the electorate and could make up the deciding vote again, but only if we make it to the polls. We are not nearly as engaged this election season as the last time around. We lag behind older voters in interest in the election and intention to vote. Only 18 percent of us under 30 are following this election closely, down from 35% four years ago. Just 63% of those of us registered say we will vote, down from 72% last time around. While these numbers hold for both young Democrats and Republicans, a dip in voter turnout is most consequential for Obama, who leads among our peers. Why are we losing interest? Let's put this election in context. For the majority of us who voted for Barack Obama, electing the president in 2008 felt like changing the course of history. Opinion: Who are millennials? Our generation came of age in the shadow of catastrophe -- the aftermath of 9/11, the genocide in Darfur, Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and a faltering economy. We had hoped that the historic election of our first African-American president, a candidate who embodied our diversity in being and breath, would initiate a new era that broke from Bush-era politics. Instead, the president inherited a punishing economic recession and GOP obstructionism that made even modest reforms challenging. Even worse, his administration continued some Bush-era national security policies he promised to end, from indefinite detention at home to drone warfare abroad. As a result, Millennials I know have become disillusioned about national political change, turned to local politics and community engagement instead and focused on getting through tough times. Still, many, like me, are not giving up. This election year, I've sobered up about the meaning of hope. Hope requires action beyond casting a vote; it requires holding our elected leaders to task. The president repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell, came out for marriage equality and created a program that allows undocumented youth to live and work legally in the U.S. I believe that Millennials can be critical of the political process and still have faith that incremental change is possible if we organize before and after Election Day. Opinion: Why this election is so personal . Of course, it's difficult to organize if our candidates are not even discussing our concerns. No matter who we support, let's ask that our candidates debate all the issues that determine the future of our nation. No one has more at stake than the generation who will inherit it.

"London (CNN) -- An Olympic bronze medal stolen from a London nightclub earlier this week has been reunited with its owner. A spokesman for the London Metropolitan police said a medal belonging to the British field hockey player Hannah Macleod had been mailed anonymously to the offices of England Hockey on Friday. The player had appealed via her Twitter account for the medal to be returned in this manner. A bronze medal belonging to fellow British Olympian Alex Partridge, a rower, remains missing. ""We are still looking to recover the second medal, and we stress that our inquiries remain active,"" said Detective Chief Inspector James Harman. ""Alex's medal has yet to be traced, and he is understandably keen to be reunited with it as soon as possible."" The medals were taken after Partridge, 31, and Macleod, 28, left their blazers, with the medals inside, unattended as they danced in the upmarket Mahiki nightclub, following a reception with Britain's queen for London 2012 athletes at Buckingham Palace. On Thursday, following an appeal from the athletes via their Twitter accounts, Partridge's jacket was handed in at a London police station, without his medal. A man was subsequently arrested, before being bailed to return in November pending further inquiries. Both athletes tweeted images taken from the club's security footage of a man present that night. The image has been retweeted thousands of times. Macleod had earlier tweeted that she was ""totally devastated"" by the loss. Partridge tweeted a request to ""keep your eyes open all over London,"" and thanked the public for its support. Partridge won his bronze as a member of the men's eight rowing team, and won silver in the same event at the 2008 Games in Beijing. Macleod received hers as a member of the women's field hockey team. Harman said police wanted to hear from anyone with information on the thefts. ""Our appeals for information stand and I take this opportunity to reiterate them -- if the public can help, we ask them to do so.""","One of two Olympic medals stolen from a London nightclub has been recovered .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Registered child sex offenders in Simi Valley, California, will not have to post a sign outside their home this Halloween reading in part ""no candy,"" but they still are prohibited from decorating their houses and handing out candy, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. This is a partial and temporary victory for a group of the city's sex offenders and their wives who sued the city claiming that a recently passed law was unconstitutional and sought a temporary injunction of the law before a full hearing next month. The Simi Valley law placed the following Halloween restrictions on child sex offenders within the city who appear on a statewide database: . -- Post a sign stating ""No candy or treats at this residence"" -- Leave all outdoor lighting off during the evening . -- No exterior Halloween decorations and refrain from answering the door for trick-or-treaters. U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson ruled that all but the sign provision could still be enforced. ""Plaintiffs have, however, made a clear showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their facial challenge to the sign posting requirement of the Halloween Ordinance and that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order,"" Anderson wrote. Attorney told CNN before the ruling that she believed the signs would attract more attention to her clients' homes and could incite vandalism or violence. ""We are pleased with the judge's decision,"" said Janice Bellucci, who is representing the 10 plaintiffs, in a statement to CNN. ""This requirement, if enforced, would have branded registrants and placed them as well as member of their families at significant risk of harm."" ""I make no apologies for introducing this to our City Council,"" Simi Valley Mayor Bob Huber told CNN earlier this month. ""The number one goal and priority of government is to protect its citizens, particularly its most vulnerable -- the innocent children.""","Judge strikes down part of Simi Valley's restrictions on registered child sex offenders .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra ""love nest,"" where her romance with Richard Burton started, was trashed while it was on loan for filming of Lindsay Lohan's ""Liz & Dick,"" the owner of the dressing room trailer said. Fox Studios spent more than $75,000 in 1963, about a half million in today's dollars, to create an environment fit for the queen Taylor was playing. She rested away from the set between roman columns with walls and ceilings handpainted in the style of Cleopatra's era. Angel Alger, a Taylor fan, bought the pink, lavishly-decorated 38-foot travel trailer for $50,000, her life savings, in June. But she only had two days to enjoy it before it was delivered to Silver Screen Pictures. It was a condition of the sale since the seller had contracted to rent it to the producers for a week of filming. ""I was specifically told that it would come back in pristine condition and in even better condition than it was at that time,"" Alger said. When she saw it again in July, she was devastated to see damage she estimated to be at least $100,000. Photos show cigarette burns on fabric, furniture and even a portrait of Taylor. Dishes, mirror and glass were broken. What's worse is what's missing, Alger said. An exquisite antique European rocking chair that Taylor sat in after filming every night was taken. ""I did not get to enjoy using the lavish French phone that she used or even her personal hair brush that probably still had some of her hair in it,"" she said. Who trashed Taylor's trailer? ""Only a psychotic and rebellious person or people would steal irreplaceable museum belongings and leave it in this vandalized condition,"" Alger said. Alger said she suspects it was Lindsay Lohan, based on a studio employee's comment to her that the actress and her friends had access to it each night after filming. But she acknowledges she has no evidence to prove it. She collected the cigarette butts left in the trailer, which she said appeared to be special cigarettes. But Lohan's publicist said there was no way Lohan, who he said worshiped Taylor, would ever destroy anything connected to her. ""This has nothing to do with Lindsay,"" Steve Honig said. ""You should ask the producers about it."" Alger said she would like more information from the studio to help solve the mystery. ""Liz & Dick"" executive producer Larry Thompson did not return several phone calls from CNN on Wednesday. His assistant said he was busy editing the movie. An insurance representative from the studio met with Alger to tour the trashed trailer in early August, but she said since then her calls have been unreturned. She is hoping media attention to her story will change that. ""I want these things back because, truly, there is not enough money to replace these one-of-a-kind items,"" Alger said. ""These have been taken from me and my family who would inherit them. Maybe they are still in the studio somewhere? I was told they would be looking for them."" She had plans to make money exhibiting the trailer in Los Angeles. With many irreplaceable furnishings missing and others broken or marred, those plans are on hold for now, she said. ""Liz & Dick,"" set to air on the Lifetime channel on November 3, chronicles the relationship and two marriages of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.

"(CNN) -- Anyone can turn on a TV, scan their newsfeeds or fire up a laptop to quickly get a sense of the important topics being discussed at the Republican National Convention. This is not about those. This is for those other moments -- the ones that make us SMH or LOL or unfollow certain people on Twitter. These are the moments that prompt us to show our phones to the person next to us, eyes wide with disbelief and mischief. It's not news. 1. Strange looks . Men and women had plenty to say about Condoleezza Rice's lipstick malfunction on Twitter and Instagram during her Wednesday speech. ""I don't care what their beliefs are I will always feel completely awful for any woman who has lipstick on their teeth in public,"" wrote Twitter user @Morgan Murphy. Others were not so kind. ""A good friend would have told Condi she had lipstick on her teeth. Where's Ann? Dropping the ball, that's where,"" wrote @mkusek01060 . At least no one created a Twitter account for Condi's Lipstick. The distraction theme continued as Paul Ryan and his widow's peak took the stage. ""Paul Ryan. The charisma of Edward Kennedy. The widow's peak of Edward Munster,"" wrote @SteveintheKT . ""All you listen to Ryan for his powerful speech, I just stare at his widow's peak,"" wrote @bey_guy87 . On Facebook David Atherton attributed the following to Wikipedia, ""In political polling, widow's peaks are considered to be a facial attribute for candidates that is a clear positive ... associated with being seen as more competent and with greater integrity."" 2. Making faces . Continuing on the distraction theme were these tweets from co-creator of ""The Daily Show,"" Liz Winstead. ""McCain is doing his blinky thing! The one where he blinks a bunch when he doesn't believe what he is saying,"" she posted. ""Blab all you want abt Ann Romney's speech- nothing will help if Mitt doesn't lose that 'I have a weird thing on my tongue' face."" This guy thinks he and Paul Ryan look alike. And in one of the fantastically creepy trends to emerge from the convention delegates snapped photos of themselves wearing paper masks of Paul Ryan and then posted them to Instagram. 3. Bringing sexy back . But before Paul Ryan even opened his mouth Wednesday night, Twitter was already reflecting on Paul Ryan's sex appeal. @chrissyadeleke Pretty ballsy speech by Paul Ryan. Not gonna lie. I liked it. He makes politics sexy. Because he is sexy. @cMMoore6 Paul Ryan is sexy. #simple . @sarahcgoldstein Paul Ryan has the most handsome blue eyes. Very sexy. @Lynzeebug22 Paul Ryan is kinda hot... Sexy vice president. Im down . You get the idea. 4. Elevator music musings . Step into the nearest elevator and what do you hear? Probably the Village Voice furiously typing this tweet after Ryan made a reference to the generation gap between him and Romney based on their music preferences: . @villagevoice Paul Ryan fails to realize that classic rock is pretty much the new elevator music http://bit.ly/NExCe8 . Comedian @robfee quipped, "" 'Haha Paul Ryan has dumb music on his iPod!' - Joe Biden as he duct tapes a Ray Stevens cd to his walkman"" 5. Give Santorum a hand? How many times did Santorum mention #hands during his Tuesday night speech? We stopped counting at 20. Huffington Post senior editor Craig Kanalley said, ""Rick Santorum said #hands 24 times,#Romney 3 times in that speech."" See for yourself in this uncut replay on YouTube.

"(CNN) -- Top jockey Richard Hughes achieved the remarkable feat of seven winners from an eight-race card in a meeting at Windsor Monday. Hughes, who is heading for the title of champion jockey for the most wins in a season, all but secured the honor for the first time with his remarkable display at the racecourse in the south of England. He came close to going through the card -- only stopped from a clean sweep in the sixth race in which he finished third in a competitive handicap. The odds on his feat were a massive 10,168 to 1, but British bookmakers reported that their losses were likely to be limited because betting volumes were low on a working day. ""It would also have been far worse had he rode seven winners on a busy Saturday. ""If we could choose a day for this to happen then Monday would be it,"" said a spokesman for a leading firm. The 39-year-old Irishman is only the second jockey to achieve seven wins on the same day at a British meeting, the other was Frankie Dettori at Ascot in 1996. He told broadcaster At the Races: ""I'm over the moon -- it's great to do it. I always said I might do it one day at Windsor, my lucky track."" Hughes achieved the first two wins on mounts trained by his father-in-law Richard Hannon, who supplies him with many favorable rides. ""Without Richard Hannon I wouldn't be doing any of it,"" he added.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The United Nations finds a tiny glimmer of good news in Afghanistan in a new report out Wednesday, saying that violence against civilians fell in the first half of the year. But even with attacks down 15% compared with the first six months of 2011, violence is taking a ""devastating toll on civilians,"" the United Nations said. It cited the case of a father who brought his family to collect ID cards from a government office in Herat province, leaving his children and their mother by the gate while he went to find staff members. ""I heard a loud explosion and I ran back to the gate. I saw people lying in blood on the ground. I saw one of my daughters dead on the ground and my other three daughters and their mother wounded,"" said the man, who was not named in the report. Another of his daughters later died of her wounds in the April attack that left 13 people dead and 57 wounded, the U.N. said. They were among 1,145 people killed and 1,954 injured in the first six months of the year, the report found. That's down from 1,510 killed and 2,144 injured in the same period a year earlier. But the drop does little more than to bring levels of violence down to what they were in 2010, says the report from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. Still, the drop marks the first time in five years there has been a fall rather than a rise in violence against civilians, the report said. Eighty percent of the attacks against civilians are by anti-government forces such as the Taliban, the U.N. said, while 10% are by government forces. The world body could not determine responsibility for the other 10%, the report said. The Taliban rejected the report as ""baseless and untrue,"" saying its fighters were taking more care not to kill civilians. ""Our freedom fighters are now more responsible and careful when it comes to civilian casualties. That is why, in general, civilian casualty has decreased,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said. He also disputed the U.N. definition of ""civilian,"" saying: ""The Kabul administration and whoever either works for them or supports them in one way or the other can be our target."" He accused ""the invaders"" and the government of killing, injuring and jailing civilians, and said the U.N. report did not include them. ""The Afghan people are our own people, and those who don't have any links with invaders will always be safe, and we would put our lives at great risk to keep them safe,"" he said.","NEW: The Taliban rejects the report, saying it is trying not to target civilians .

"(CNN) -- Japanese raider Orfevre failed in his bid to become the first non-European trained winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe when he was denied by home-grown outsider Solemia at Longchamp Sunday. After a huge last-to-first move, Orfevre was dramatically run down in the final strides by Solemia to give jockey Olivier Peslier his fourth win in the race, breaking thousands of Japanese hearts in the process. Orfevre, already a Triple Crown winner in his home country, looked to be pulling clear of the field as they entered the home straight. But four-year-old filly Solemia responded to her jockey to run down Orfevre, ridden by four-time champion jockey Christophe Soumillon, winning by a head. Although not considered among the favorites heading in to the Longchamp showpiece, Solemia's victory maintains the successful recent record of fillies in this race. Last year's winner, Danedream, was also a filly. Thousands of Japanese fans and more than 100 accredited journalists from the country had descended on Paris to witness arguably their best chance at capturing the Arc since Deep Impact in 2006. Racing-mad Japan has long had designs on Europe's most prestigious race, having sent their first runner to Longchamp in 1969. Japanese Horse of the Year Orfevre was widely considered among the favorites for this year's edition, despite being drawn in the unfavorable stall 18 -- the widest possible berth. Widely considered Europe's most prestigious all-age race, this year's running was notable for its high-profile absentees. First Ed Dunlop's tough filly Snow Fairy, third in this race in 2011, was ruled out after suffering a slight injury in training. Then defending champion Danedream was sensationally scratched after an outbreak of swamp fever at her training center in Germany. Although Danedream herself is completely healthy, German veterinary authorities immediately slapped a travel ban on all horses entering or leaving the facility, meaning she was unable to make the trip to Paris. With Frankel, rated the best horse in the world, also opting to sit this one out, it appeared to leave the field wide open for Orfevre, who had previously demonstrated form over the mile-and-a-half distance, as well as a devastating turn of foot. Outside of the duel for first place, Masterstroke, ridden by French jockey Mikael Barzalona, finished third. The Aiden O'Brien-trained Camelot, ridden by Godolphin jockey Frankie Dettori, never factored and finished down the field in seventh place.","Outsider Solemia wins Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp .

"(CNN) -- A new named tropical storm, Philippe, formed Saturday in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center reported. Philippe is expected to strengthen over the next 48 hours, according to the forecast. Still, it remains far away from land -- the closest being the Cape Verde Islands off Africa, some 345 miles (550 kilometers) away, with the closest Caribbean islands about 3,000 miles away. As of 5 p.m. Saturday, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. It was moving west-northwest at around 14 mph, with the hurricane center predicting a gradual turn more northwest -- a slight slowdown -- on Monday. Tropical storm-force winds, measuring 40 mph or stronger, are blowing about 45 miles from its center. Tropical Storm Ophelia, meanwhile, is slightly more powerful and significantly closer to the Caribbean and the coastal United States. It had sustained winds of 45 mph, with tropical storm-level winds measured up to 260 miles from its middle. It weakened slightly over the course of Saturday, according the hurricane center's 5 p.m. advisory. Ophelia's movement is described as ""erratic,"" as it heads in a general west-northwest direction at around 12 mph and is then expected to turn more northwest on Monday. Its eye is now located about 295 miles from the Leeward Islands. As of Saturday evening, there were no coastal watches or warnings in effect for either Ophelia or Philippe.","Philippe is in the far eastern Atlantic and has sustained 40 mph winds .

"(CNN) -- When New York City Marathon organizers announced that the destruction wreaked by Hurricane Sandy would not cause the cancellation of Sunday's prestigious race, few people will have been as relieved as Adam Chataway. The Londoner is a man on a mission -- he ran five marathons on five continents before making it to the Big Apple, and cycled the last leg of the journey from Boston. Sunday's race will be his sixth in less than 30 days, all run to honor the memory of his late fiancee and provide an education for Ethiopian children. ""There are fallen trees, electricity poles and stuff like that,"" the 34-year-old told CNN from the roadside after the hurricane had caused widespread disruption along the east coast of the U.S. ""It has certainly made it more interesting. I imagine the fine people of New York will show their character and come out and represent. I'm sure it will be a special occasion."" The superstorm has claimed more than 140 lives across North America and the Caribbean, but that has not deterred Chataway as he moves closer to the final 26.2 miles of his task. ""I think people thought we were daft when we said we were going to cycle from Boston to New York, but now they know why, as we couldn't have flown to New York,"" he said after arriving in the U.S. on Tuesday. ""There hasn't been too much of a chance to get a sense of people. Obviously it is all over the news and I think people, especially here on the eastern seaboard, are a little bit shellshocked."" His global quest began in South America on October 7 with the Buenos Aires marathon. He has since completed a punishing schedule which included races in Australia, Jordan, Kenya and the Republic of Ireland. The long road Chataway has traveled began in 2006 when his bride-to-be Vicky was killed in a cycling accident on her way home from work in London. Adam established ""Vicky's Water Project"" in her memory to help bring clean water to a region of Ethiopia. ""I was fortunate enough to get a lot of time off work and I wanted to do something worthwhile with it,"" explains Chataway. ""I worked with the charity ActionAid to establish a project in Ethiopia, which is now up and running. As a result of that being set up, children no longer need to spend all day collecting water. So there's now a shortage of classrooms."" The shortage gave birth to Chataway's latest fundraising venture, which he hopes will generate enough money to build four classrooms in the Lera Town area of Ethiopia. He set off with the aim of raising Â£10,000 ($16,000), but he is close to doubling that figure. To date, Chataway has collected around Â£18,000 in his ""adventure of a lifetime."" Chataway comes from a family with running pedigree -- his father Christopher is a former 5,000 meters world record-holder and was a pacemaker when fellow Briton Roger Bannister became the first man to run one mile in under four minutes in 1954. ""I wanted to do every marathon close to the three hours and 45 minutes target,"" Adam said. ""I thought it was pushing myself close to the limit while also being able to sustain it. All of them have been there or thereabouts, my legs have held up to the rigors of it."" Chataway might not have met that target -- clocking four hours and 45 minutes for the Nairobi marathon in Kenya -- but he did achieve something even his father and the great Bannister would have struggled with. In his schedule, the Nairobi and Dublin Marathons were numbers four and five respectively, which presented a problem. The two races were on consecutive days and being staged on different continents. ""The Nairobi marathon was at seven on Sunday,"" he explains. ""I went to the start line in the knowledge I was up against the finest marathon-running nation on the planet, so knew I was on a bit of a hiding to nothing. ""I daubed myself down with a wet wipe, much to the disappointment of my fellow passengers on the five-hour flight from Nairobi to Abu Dhabi. ""I had six hours on the ground there and just tried to get as much water as I could and some food inside me and stretch my legs. I took off from there at 2:30 a.m. and landed in Dublin at 6:45 a.m. ""I got changed at the airport, met friends and family at the start line and I managed to get around the Dublin marathon in three hours and 38 minutes on slightly weary, but thankfully forgiving, legs."" So with just New York left to tick off on this testing trip, what is next for this Running Man? ""Sleep and beer,"" he replies. ""In London.""","British man is running six marathons on six continents in less than 30 days .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani police say they suspect two boys of nearly killing a Pakistani teenage girl internationally famous for campaigning for girls' education. On October 9, Malala Yousufzai was on her school van in the Taliban-held Swat Valley when armed thugs stopped the vehicle and jumped on board. They demanded that other girls riding identify 15-year-old Malala. Then they shot two girls and fired at Malala, striking her in the head and neck. Profile: Global symbol, but still just a kid . At the time, Malala was well-known in Pakistan, and her profile was growing internationally. She had been campaigning since she was 11, encouraging her fellow Pakistanis to stand up to the Taliban who were trying to push girls from classrooms. Pakistani authorities believe that one of the boys distracted the van driver, while the other asked someone to point out Malala, Pakistan's interior minister told CNN. ""Obviously they had done their homework,"" Rehman Malik said. ""They had seen the vehicle of Malala going up and down, and accordingly they acted on that."" Read more: In rebuke to Taliban, Pakistan college named for Malala . On Monday, police told CNN they were searching for two boys and a man they say drove the youths to the van. Malik identified the adult suspect as Attah Ullah Khan, 23, but he did not name the boys. Police said last week that they had arrested six men in connection with the shooting but were searching for Khan. Khan is a masters' chemistry student, police said. A 'miracle for us' Malala is recovering in Great Britain, where a team of international doctors are caring for her. She's made some progress, but her caregivers have said she has a long, hard road ahead. Her father, Ziauddin Yousufzai, has described her survival as a ""miracle for us."" Malik, the Pakistani interior minister, visited Malala's hospital in Birmingham, England, on Monday. He later met with foreign ministers from Britain and the United Arab Emirates. The UAE provided the air ambulance that flew Malala from Pakistan, where she was treated in the initial days after the attack, to the United Kingdom. ""The people of the UAE were appalled by what happened to Malala, which is why we helped to bring her for medical care in the UK,"" Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah Bin Zayed said, adding the emirates believe girls should be educated. Malala is in ""our prayers,"" he said, according to a release from British Foreign Secretary William Hague. Hague said he personally thanked the team of doctors helping Malala. Hague said officials are ""determined to do all we can to champion education for women and girls in Pakistan."" In his interview with CNN, Malik was asked about the progress of the investigation. He replied by saying, ""Within 24 hours we were in a position to identify almost everybody."" He said Pakistan should not involve the military in finding Malala's attackers. ""A military solution is not the solution,"" he said. 'Pride of Pakistan' When Malala was 11, she worked with the BBC and published a blog in 2009 detailing her struggles to attend school in Swat. In January of that year, the Taliban issued an edict ordering that no school should educate girls. iReport: Messages for Malala . As Malala breathed on a ventilator and the world grew increasingly outraged about her shooting, thousands in Pakistan rallied. Many were aghast that the Taliban would attack a teenage girl. The Taliban issued a statement online saying that if Malala lived, they'd come after her again. In his interview with CNN, Malik called the teenager ""the pride of Pakistan."" He said that the country ""would love her to come back."" If Malala were to return to Pakistan, guards would protect her family, with a female contingent surrounding Malala. The government would pay to provide the service, he said. Malik told CNN that he knew Malala is doing well in the hospital because she has asked for her schoolbooks so she can study. He said that if she comes back to Pakistan, they'll find her old books and give them to her.

"(CNN) -- It's been 11 years since John Meletse, a deaf, gay South African man, first learned he was HIV positive. But the events of that day are all too vividly etched on his mind: After a brief but anxious wait inside a Soweto clinic, near Johannesburg, a doctor called him in his office. The doctor, unable to communicate with him in sign language, quickly wrote something in a piece of paper and stuck it in front of him. ""You are HIV positive"" read the note. ""He didn't explain anything,"" Meletse recalls in sign language as tears roll down his face. ""He just stuck this paper in my face and I was like: 'Me? What you're telling me is the truth?' And the doctor said 'yes,' and I could lip read and I asked him 'is it the truth' and he said 'yes' and the doctor told me 'go now, bye bye.'"" The news left Meletse shocked and devastated as he struggled to grapple with how to cope with the disease and a community unsure of how to deal with him. ""It was hard for me -- first I'm deaf, secondly I'm gay and thirdly I'm HIV positive, these three things, what must I do?"" says Meletse, who was 25 when he was diagnosed with HIV. He decided, however, not to hide but to share his story and use his experience to inspire the deaf community to communicate openly about sex. ""I thought for myself, I need to make a stand and I need to be open and out -- I'm gay, this is me, it's my identity, I'm the same as everyone else. A lot of deaf people still are closed up, keep it covered in the closet and I'm taking a stand."" Today, Meletse's stance has seen him become a leading figure within the deaf and the gay rights community in South Africa. Over the last few years, he's been visiting schools for deaf children across South Africa, organizing workshops where he uses visual techniques to teach deaf sex education counselors how to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS. ""When I turned 30,"" Meletse says, ""my family came together and I'm out -- I'm out about being gay, about HIV positive, my sister fainted, they thought I was going to die and I said 'no, I'm going to be a role model for the deaf community, I'm going to motivate them, support everyone, I'm going to educate everyone, I'm going to try and stop HIV, I'm going to stop the blame and still I feel good about that.'"" Meletse cites South African constitutional court judge, Edwin Cameron, the first South African official to publicly announce his HIV status, as his own role model. When Meletse heard him speak a few years ago, Cameron had already been living with HIV for 20 years. Cameron's public announcement inspired Meletse to also spread his heartfelt message. ""I wanted that same feeling, I wanted to stop this stigmatization within the deaf community.'"" ""There's no education, the clinics aren't helping, we're just hitting a brick wall, what does HIV mean? Nobody knows and they're just dying, I was like I'm going to stand up and say I'm going to show you -- the same that I saw Edwin do -- for the disabled community."" Meletse recently collaborated with Human Rights Watch which chose him to be part of a public awareness campaign about HIV in the deaf community. ""People with disabilities throughout the world -- and we're talking about a billion people here -- are often ignored when it comes to issues of HIV and AIDS prevention, access to treatment, access to counseling and other preventative techniques,"" says Tiseke Kasambala, senior researcher in the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. ""This is because people living with disabilities are assumed not to have a sexual life, and it's something that for us is of great concern because we're seeing an increasing number of people living with disabilities who are now at risk of contracting HIV and AIDS because they simply don't have the information or the access to that kind of information,"" she adds. Driven by his desire to help others, Meletse is determined to work hard to dispel myths and change attitudes. ""People look at disabled people and they say 'ha, they don't know about sex.' No, we're all the same, deaf people have sex, hearing people have sex. So blind people also have sex, all these things, we all do it. ""But it's hard -- interpreters at clinics, there are so few. For blind people in Braille, what material is printed? Ramps for people in wheelchairs entering the clinic, it's hard. I respect the disabled people for trying in this world.""","John Meletse is a deaf, gay HIV positive South African activist .

"(CNN) -- In 2009, Lu Qi, an author of martial arts novels, published his first book on a slightly different type of combat sport: office politics in China. The book, titled ""Hidden in the Office,"" contains 23 rules for getting ahead in the workplace. For example: . Rule 8: Those who are just above you in the hierarchy are the most dangerous. Those of similar rank are enemies. Rule 11: You don't have to be loyal to your boss. You use him. Rule 12: You are the dumbest if you think you are the smartest. Rule 18: You have to worry when your boss tells you not to worry. Each rule is accompanied by an allegorical story surrounding the life of a white collar worker in a multi-national company that illustrates what the rules mean and how to put them into practice. More than a million copies have been sold. Lu is not alone in his success. In China, where competition is cutthroat and workplaces are characterized by opaque politics, complicated relationships and twisted love affairs, an entire literary genre has emerged on how to navigate a job-scape that is more like law of the jungle and survival of the fittest. The genre, known as Zhichang xiaoshuo, or ""workplace novels,"" is comprised of hundreds of titles offering practical career advice conveyed via soap opera tales about secretaries, salespeople, entrepreneurs, executives, even government officials, and what they had to do to get ahead in their careers. Many are authored by employees who, using pen names, chronicle their workplace stories and the scandals, sex and secrets they experienced while on the job (think ""Secret Life of a Call Girl"" meets ""Your Dream Career for Dummies."") ""The middle class is still developing in China,"" said Lu. ""Most people want to climb up to that level. They want to have better lives. They have ambitions, and they want to achieve it. They acquire knowledge from wherever they can. Books are one of the ways."" ""Du Lala's Promotion Diary,"" the story of how a secretary climbs the corporate ladder of a Fortune 500 company to become a human resources manager, is one of the genre's most famous works. It has sold millions of copies, inspired a movie, television series and three sequels. How the internet is changing China's office politics . In ""The Boiling Money Route,"" author Xu Yu exposes the collision of government and business in a shadow banking industry in Wenzhou, a city near Shanghai known for its ruthless entrepreneurs and questionable business ethics. Xu Yu ""grew up in a wealthy family, worked at his family's bank, a stock company and also fooled around in underground gambling,"" says the book's cover. ""So he has lots of inside stories,"" it boasts. ""Xie Zhengxiang, the owner of a leading underground bank, acquires 100 million marketable securities from his mistress, Wang Anxiang. Before he can launder this through the black market operated by a Wenzhou guru, the situation of underground finance changed when an investigation team was sent by the government,"" the book's summary says. ""Special Promotion: How a Small Potato Gets Promoted"" is a tale of how to move upwards as a government official ""in a non-traditional way."" Even quirkier titles include ""The Confession of a Beautiful Female Department Head in Prison."" There are eight books in a series called ""The Notebook of a Government Department."" Subject matter ranges from ""how to get the leader of your leader to notice you"" to ""the higher you go, the more politics are involved."" Are cool offices the key to success? ""(The books) are popular because it is a very complicated and delicate situation with the government in China,"" said a 29-year-old surnamed He who was browsing for a book about power struggles between high-level officials at a bookstore in Shanghai. ""We all want to know more about how the government officials are working."" Dancy Liang, a 32-year-old administrative assistant at a university in Shanghai, says such novels have helped her to know how to dress better and deal with sometimes complicated relationships. ""Like a man who is your boss likes you, and he often troubles you, asks you to go on business trips together, and you don't know how to refuse him,"" she said. ""Sometimes if we meet these kinds of problems, (the novels) will help us solve these problems. We read them because we can find a part of ourselves within them."" Quiz: How to negotiate office politics . Daisy Wong (a pen name) has authored countless columns about the personal and professional life of a 28-year-old female attorney working in high-powered law firms in Hong Kong. Her columns have been turned into books, which have topped best-seller lists both in Hong Kong and in mainland China. ""Career topics are always popular,"" Wong said. ""Life is so quick. Relationships come and go. In a cosmopolitan place, this kind of genre hits the heart of the people -- people are lonely."" Liu Jianmei, an associate professor of modern and contemporary Chinese literature at Hong Kong University Science and Technology, says she feels like workplace novels are demoralizing. ""They drive people towards utilitarianism and materialism,"" she said. ""They fail to pay attention to something more important, such as rebuilding positive cultural values. They may emphasize personal strength, enduring hardship, tolerating unpleasant human relationships, but on the journey for the pursuit of success, what is left at the end?""","Hundreds of titles crowd the ""workplace"" genre in China's bookstores .

"(CNN) -- The Iranian navy fired four missiles into the Persian Gulf, sinking a target the size of a warship, the country's military said, according to state-run Press TV. The missile drill comes as the United States and other military conduct massive minesweeping exercises in the Arabian Gulf. The U.S. military says these exercises are strictly ""defensive,"" but the show of force in light of Iran's threats to mine the Strait of Hormuz is hard to ignore. The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps fired the missile simultaneously at the large target, which sank in 50 seconds, Navy Cmdr. Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi said, according to Press TV. Fadavi pointed out that Iran's missile systems can reach the entire Persian Gulf, including past where U.S. bases are located, Press TV reported. In reference to the minesweeping drill, Fadavi said Iran is keeping a ""moment-by-moment watch on every move of the Americans."" ""Over the past years, we have not neglected to enhance our naval capabilities, particularly in the field of mines, and these capabilities are unimaginable to the Americans,"" Fadavi said, according to Press TV. The Pentagon did not immediately confirm if such a missile test was carried out.","Iran says a drill included the launching of four missiles .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When the curtain rises on the 64th Primetime Emmys Sunday night, viewers can expect ""genuinely weird stuff"" from host Jimmy Kimmel and perhaps TV award show history made by ""Mad Men."" With 26 statuettes to be handed out, the three-hour ABC-TV broadcast from the Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles should be packed with hastened acceptance speeches, but at least some drama. ""Mad Men"" has dominated the best drama category in its four seasons and could set a record with a fifth-straight win this year, but Showtime's psychological thriller ""Homeland,"" which just started a second season, and AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" may stand in its way. ""Downton Abbey,"" last year's best miniseries or movie winner, is competing for best drama series this year, along with HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" and ""Game of Thrones."" While ""Mad Men"" was the most nominated show last year, with 19 nods, and this year, with 17, the AMC series has yet to win an acting Emmy. It has four chances Sunday to change that, including Jon Hamm's fifth best drama actor nomination for his role as ad exec Don Draper. Emmy snubs: What the Academy got right and wrong . ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston, who beat Hamm in his first three seasons, is nominated again, along with Michael C.

""Mad Men"" actress Elisabeth Moss, whose work as Peggy Olson has earned three nominations but no trophies, is contending for best actress in a drama against last year's winner Julianna Margulies from CBS' ""The Good Wife,"" ""Homeland's"" Claire Danes, Glenn Close of DirecTV's ""Damages,"" Michelle Dockery from ""Downton Abbey"" and Kathy Bates, who plays Harriet Korn in ABC's ""Harry's Law."" Bates, who recently revealed she had a double mastectomy because of breast cancer, will also present an Emmy category Sunday night. She was given the best guest actress in a comedy for playing the ghost of Charlie Sheen's character in CBS' ""Two and a Half Men."" It was presented at the Emmy's creative arts ceremony last week. ABC's ""Modern Family,"" the country's highest-rated sitcom, will try to repeat its domination of the Emmy's comedy categories. Last year's show seemed like the ""Modern Family"" awards at times, with the series taking home five trophies. CBS's ""The Big Bang Theory,"" HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" NBC's ""30 Rock,"" and HBO's ""Veep"" are challenging ""Modern Family"" for the best comedy series Emmy, which the ABC show has won for the last two seasons. ""The Big Bang Theory's"" Jim Parsons, who won best comedy series actor last year, is lined up against ""30 Rock's"" Alec Baldwin and Jon Cryer of ""Two And A Half Men"" again this year. Other nominees include Larry David, who plays himself in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" Don Cheadle for Showtime's ""House Of Lies"" and Louis C.K. for FX Networks' ""Louie."" The best comedy series actress competition includes Melissa McCarthy, who won a year ago for the CBS sitcom ""Mike & Molly,"" two-time winner Tina Fey for ""30 Rock,"" Lena Dunham for HBO's ""Girls,"" Zooey Deschanel for FOX's ""New Girl,"" Edie Falco from Showtime's ""Nurse Jackie,"" NBC's ""Parks And Recreation"" star Amy Poehler, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus for ""Veep."" 'Mad Men' leads Emmy nominations . The reality show competition has lacked competitiveness over the past decade, with CBS's ""The Amazing Race"" finishing first eight of the last nine years. Still, ABC's ""Dancing With The Stars,"" Lifetime's ""Project Runway,"" ""So You Think You Can Dance"" from FOX, Bravo's ""Top Chef"" and NBC's "" The Voice"" will try. ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart"" has won best variety show for nine years in a row, but this year it has a new competitor, ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" But Kimmel may not spend much time thinking about his chances, since he'll have his hands full hosting the Emmy broadcast. Kimmel told CNN the Emmy producers have given him a lot of creative freedom to make the show entertaining. ""I pitched them a number of ideas and they're letting me do some genuinely weird stuff on the show,"" he said. ""I really appreciate it, and I'm kind of surprised to how open they've been. There will be a couple of things that have never been done for sure that I think will surprise people in the best possible way."" Ricky Gervais, who provided plenty of surprises as host of the Golden Globes, will take the Emmy stage as a presenter Sunday. Michael J. Fox, whose acting career continues 21 years after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, will also present. Fox was nominated for best guest actor in both the comedy and drama series categories, but lost.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- At 160 meters long, there is nothing quite as luxurious as the world's largest and most expensive super-yacht -- Dubai. Roman Abramovich has one heli-pad on his yacht Pelorus, but he is rumored to be after a yacht with two. Except, of course, for the next nineteen boats that make up the top 20 super-yachts on the planet. Packed with more features than a Bond villain's base, including jet-ski docks, indoor swimming pools, helicopter pads (in some cases two helipads), Jacuzzis and submarines, no expense is spared on these ocean-going giants. The internationally-renowned Fort Lauderdale Boat Show is set to get underway at the end of October, where many of the world's top super-yachts will be on display. Now, you can take a look at some of the biggest and best yachts in existence. Included in our photo gallery are five of the top ten largest and most expensive super-yachts ever built -- and you'll recognize some of the names on the owners' list. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Octopus is inside the top ten, as is Oracle's Larry Ellison, with his vessel Rising Sun. Click here to view a photo gallery of the super-yachts. » . Wealthy Middle Eastern businessmen and leaders also have a strong presence at the top. Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum owns Dubai, the number one vessel, while the boat currently ranked second largest is owned by Sultan Qaboos of Oman. Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich is also a major player on this list. Abramovich owns Pelorus, a 115-meter vessel which has its own heli-pad, while he reportedly gave away (!) Le Grand Bleu (currently the world's 16th biggest super-yacht) to present owner Eugene Shvidler. As well as owning several other large yachts, Abramovich is believed to have a new super-yacht under construction. Rumored to be called Eclipse, the vessel is expected to overtake Dubai as the largest super-yacht in the world. And it's also tipped to possess two helipads -- because obviously, one is never enough. You won't want to think about how much Eclipse is going to cost, however, because Dubai, the world's current biggest yacht is reportedly worth well over $300 million. Other super-yachts featured in the gallery are Australian businessman James Packer's Arctic P, and a French-owned yacht which French President Nicolas Sarkozy has spent time enjoying on vacation. Which yacht would you most like to own and why? What super-toys would you fit your vessel with? Or is the super-yacht just a shameless display of wealth?

"(CNN) -- Who says the media aren't interested in good news? Fox News has been broadcasting lots of it for Mitt Romney this week. Never have so many gray clouds had silver linings as those hovering over the hapless Republican candidate and his deflating campaign. I bring you this report after having ventured into Bill O'Reilly's ""No-Spin Zone,"" and believe me, his initial shout-out urging viewers to exercise ""caution"" before watching is fully, if unintentionally, appropriate. Apparently in Fox World, ""no-spin"" means ""I am now going to share my news-based fantasies."" The Wednesday broadcast featured Dick Morris, Karl Rove and Dennis Miller, an a-cappella chorus humming O'Reilly's favorite tunes: that the mainstream media is rooting for Obama; that the polls consistently misrepresent a race that is still a dead heat; that Romney will re-emerge from this autumnal swoon by winning the October 3 debate through his superior if often-invisible oratorical skills; that Romney is in decline simply because voters don't yet understand the necessity of top-end tax cuts, the sanctity of corporate profits and the horror of social welfare spending run amok. Across its programs, the Fox News mantra is ""there's still plenty of time."" That's a truism, but chanting the obvious is not among the standard definitions of journalism. Institutionally, Fox is in denial about the state of the campaign. Romney is looking very weak very early. The attempt to avoid reporting this state of play in a ""fair and balanced"" way is producing comical results. Stylistically, the O'Reilly quartet may be on to something new. We've had mainstream journalism, alternative journalism, conservative journalism. This appears to be vaudeville journalism. Wednesday, the verisimilitude of the performance was maintained by the illusion that of the four, only Miller is a stand-up comic. Toobin: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? Rove's role is nuttily professorial. He has adopted one of those erasable white slates popularized by the late Tim Russert. On it he scribbles integers with plus or minus signs. These, he alleges, are the amounts being added to President Barack Obama and/or subtracted from Romney by such daredevil organizations as The New York Times, The Washington Post, CBS, NBC, CNN, Gallup and the co-opted poll-averagers at the website RealClearPolitics. Bottom line: This vast conspiracy is downgrading Romney three to nine points by using screens that overstate the votes of blacks, Latinos, Asians, women and the young. Morris, who is beginning to bear a waxen resemblance to Orson Welles, explained, I think, that pollsters cheat by using false baseline figures from previous elections. Morris didn't have time to explicate fully how every news organization except Fox has signed up to help Obama by disseminating these cooked figures. Even so, O'Reilly thanked Morris for explaining polling mysteries he said he had not previously understood. Opinion: Why Romney's rallies are a waste of time . The effect was somewhat spoiled by an unscripted guest from reality, Larry Sabato, the scholarly political scientist from the University of Virginia, who immediately dismissed Morris' rant as ""grassy-knoll"" statistics. He added that the poll averages on RealClearPolitics had things about right. Obama was ahead by about four points nationally. Of the big-three swing states, Sabato said, perhaps in order not to appear rude to his host, only Florida is still close. The presence of Miller is apparently driven by commercial considerations. He and O'Reilly now have a lecture-circuit act that is selling out in such venues as Houston and Las Vegas. The closest I've heard Miller come to elegant public-policy analysis was to call Obama a ""crap president"" earlier this week. As a nod to factuality, O'Reilly does call Miller a ""satirist"" and, less plausibly, an NFL expert, due to his badly reviewed stint on Monday Night Football. In any event, it's hard to imagine anyone with a master's in public policy from Harvard, which O'Reilly has, consulting Miller on an important national election -- unless there's money in it. Which brings us to the interesting case of O'Reilly himself. O'Reilly is no dummy, and he did work as a broadcast news professional before veering into infotainment with ""Inside Edition"" and the Fox gig. For all his pugnacity, these days O'Reilly has the look of a man doing beautiful pirouettes on increasingly thin ice. He's clearly angling to survive a Romney train wreck with some credible deniability by leaving the delusional commentary to Rove et al. and hinting at his suppressed misgivings about Romney's chances. Opinion: For GOP, it's the social issues, stupid . He's not a man easily knocked off balance by contrary evidence. Thursday he opened with Fox's own poll, which presumably lacked the evils defined by Rove and Morris. It showed Obama's favorability up by 51% to Romney's 48%. It was, from a Foxian point of view, a nicer number than Obama's five point head-to-head lead, 48% to 43%. Cannily, he drops in terms such as ""in fairness to Obama,"" praises the president's campaigning skills and takes note of criticism of Romney by other conservatives. He hangs his hat on the observation that October 3 is Romney's last chance to get back in the race. This leaves him room to turn around if the polls -- we're talking the real ones here -- don't. O'Reilly's newest hedge, unveiled with Fox's bleak new poll, is that the ""likability"" factor gives Obama an advantage with ""uninformed, casual voters."" I think there's a secret behind O'Reilly's trademark smirk. Were it in his interest to say what's on his mind about the candidates' performance to date, he'd almost certainly admit that Obama has come on like a superstar candidate of the Reagan ilk, and so far Romney is one of the biggest duds in post-World War II presidential elections. Right now, Fox News' general excuse for Romney is that he's not getting his ""message"" across. I'll tune in from time to time to see when the news from the real world arrives in the Fox studios. The message of Romney's tooth-and-fang financial-market capitalism is driving down the polls, and the messenger is coming across as an unlikable empty suit, even when he ditches his tie and jacket. At a certain point, campaigns in early decline begin to reek of impending defeat. I can't wait to see how they spin that in the no-spin zone. Meanwhile, we can contemplate the dilemma of another O'Reilly regular, the Loneliest in the Public Opinion Trade, aka pollster Scott Rasmussen. He's telling O'Reilly the race is tied within the margin of error around 46% or 47%. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howell Raines.","Howell Raines: Fox News has been contorting to deliver good news for Romney's campaign .
He says commentators' spin attributes Obama gains to media distortion, voter ignorance, etc.
Raines: Bill O'Reilly says evenhanded things for deniability if spin is wrong, Romney fails .
Raines: It will be interesting to see Fox spin if campaign should begin to reek of defeat ."
"(CNN) -- To his credit, Mitt Romney has framed the question just about right. On Thursday night he said: . ""How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America? Many of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and change had a powerful appeal. But tonight I'd ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. The president hasn't disappointed you because he wanted to."" Romney cannot win unless thousands of people who voted for Obama four years ago abandon him in November. Obama cannot win by asking people if they are better off now than they expected to be four years ago. For most Americans, myself included, that is surely not the case. The expectations for Obama, again mine included, were so off-the-charts as to be unachievable. Nevertheless, we reveled in the fantasy. And it was a fantasy. How could Obama possibly have accomplished much more than he did, given the complexity of the problems, the little power the president has over either the world situation or the domestic economy, and, of course, the deep commitment the Republicans voiced from the beginning of his term to deny him any progress that required congressional support? (The GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell was clear. In the run-up to the 2010 election he said: ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" He was candid at least, defeating Obama was more important to him than, say, making progress on the economic challenges facing the country or the seemingly intractable disputes in the Middle East.) Obama himself began to understand this dilemma near the end of the 2008 campaign. He began to talk about the multiple, unreachable and sometimes conflicting dreams and hopes that the electorate had put on him, a process with which he had readily colluded in his quest for power. So, from day one of his presidency, the challenge for Obama was not what he could accomplish, but whether he could do the tough work of leadership. In two dramatic cases, he showed he could -- launching the risky mission that killed Osama bin Laden and plowing ahead with the comprehensive health care bill after Scott Brown's win in Massachusetts. The work of getting elected is about pandering to your own people, telling them what they want to hear. Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012 have pandered with the best of them, albeit with different approaches. Obama pandered by talking about his aspirations so abstractly (""hope and change"") that everyone could believe he was talking to them individually. Romney did it by taking any position on any issue that the Republican base wanted to hear, regardless of whether it was consistent with his past views or made any sense. The work of leadership is about telling your own people the hard truths they need to hear or, to say it more sharply, disappointing your own people at a rate they can absorb. Romney is counting on the possibility that the inevitable disappointment in Obama that many people feel and the gap between their always unrealistic expectations and the hard realities are so large that he can wean enough of them away and sneak into the White House where if he and Paul Ryan really try to wrestle with the tough issues they, too, will repeat the same syndrome, disappointing their own people at a rate they can absorb. The advantage that the Romney/Ryan team will have over Obama is the expectations for them will be so low that the inevitable disappointment will be much less four years from now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marty Linsky.","Marty Linsky: Mitt Romney drew attention to 2008 expectations for President Obama .

"(CNN) -- DNA evidence links a now-dead American convict to the murder of a Canadian teenager who disappeared in 1974, authorities in British Columbia said Tuesday. Bobby Jack Fowler, who died in an Oregon prison in 2006, is responsible for the murder of 16-year-old Colleen MacMillen, Inspector Gary Shinkaruk of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at a news conference. Authorities said while the case is closed on MacMillen's death, investigations continue into the abductions and killings of other women in the same region of Canada, and the search is still on for information in those cases. ""Today's announcement and public plea for assistance is a significant milestone in our commitment to solving a series of missing and murdered women investigations in British Columbia,"" said Deputy Commissioner Craig Callens, commanding officer of the RCMP in British Columbia. New DNA work may offer break in 36-year-old Michigan slayings . On August 9, 1974, MacMillen disappeared near Highway 97 in Lac La Hache, British Columbia, according to Shinkaruk. She was found dead 47 kilometers (about 29 miles) south of her last known location. A DNA profile of an unknown male was established in 2007 from evidence in her case, but Canada's National Crime Scene Databank did not turn up a match, Shinkaruk said. A higher-quality sample was submitted to INTERPOL in 2012, and the new sample was matched with Fowler. The development brings to a close one of 18 open cases in British Columbia involving women who went missing, with some later found murdered, stretching back to 1969. The cases are being investigated by a task force named Project E-Pana. The mission of the Project E-Pana is to solve the homicides of 13 women and the disappearances of another five women who remain missing, according to Shinkaruk. The name of the task force comes from an Inuit word describing the spirit goddess that looks after souls, according to the RCMP website. Fowler has been ruled out as a suspect in eight of the eighteen cases, though he remains a ""person of interest"" in the remaining nine open cases. Fowler also has been named as a suspect in the 1995 murders of two Oregon teenage girls and as a person of interest in a 1992 double homicide, according to the district attorney's office in Lincoln County, Oregon. ""Our heartfelt sympathies go out to the families of the victims of these crimes,"" Canadian Minister of Public Safety Victor Toews said in a statement. ""Anyone with information about this individual should come forward as soon as possible,"" he added, referring to Fowler's movements through the region during the time that the killings and abductions occurred. Fowler, 66, was arrested in 1995 for a violent attack on a woman in Oregon, and died in a prison there six years ago. Shinkaruk said his office has released photos and a video of Fowler. The RCMP has also created a timeline for Fowler's movements over the last 40 years, and Shinkaruk called on citizens of Canada and the United States to think back to the 1970s, '80s and '90s and contact the RCMP with any new information in the still-open cases.

""We're a phenomenally snobby society and it's such a rich seam,"" Rowling said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper by way of explanation, in words that might as well have been attributed to Jane Austen, George Eliot, Joanna Trollope or any number of other female British writers. ""The middle class is so funny, it's the class I know best, and it's the class where you find the most pretension."" Still, Rowling clearly has an authorial eye for the preoccupations of her middle-brow audience. Britain can sometimes feel like a country in the midst of a permanent, low-intensity class war in which all targets are fair game and all are left feeling routinely persecuted. While the wealthy and privileged are derided as snobs and ""toffs,"" members of the working class are grotesquely parodied and vilified as illiterate ""chavs"" and the middle class is roundly mocked, often from within its own fragmented ranks, for its petit bourgeois obsessions with house prices, farmers' markets and amateur dramatics. Julian Fellowes, the script writer behind lavish Emmy-nominated period saga ""Downton Abbey"" complained last year that ""poshism"" was the ""last acceptable form of prejudice"", while Benedict Cumberbatch, the well-heeled star of ""Sherlock"" said last month he had contemplated relocating his career to the U.S. because ""posh-bashing"" in the UK had gone too far. At the opposite extreme, Owen Jones, the author of ""Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class,"" argued that the widespread blaming of last year's riots in London and other cities on a supposed feral underclass was ""classic demonization, reducing complex social problems to supposed individual failings and behavioral faults."" Class, swearing and sex fill J.K. Rowling's first adult book . If Rowling needed any further evidence of the enduring power of issues of class and status to raise British heckles, it came last week in the blundering form of Andrew Mitchell, a senior member of Prime Minister David Cameron's cabinet, whose job as chief whip is still in the balance over whether or not, during an altercation with a policeman, he called the officer a ""pleb"" and suggested that he ought to ""learn his f****** place."" For critics of Cameron's government, Mitchell's alleged insult and the fact that, like the Eton-educated prime minister and many of his colleagues, he attended one of the UK's elite fee-paying public schools appeared to offer further proof of a blue-blooded conspiracy to keep the proles firmly in their place. As Kevin Maguire wrote in the Mirror newspaper: ""In Mitchell's angry flash of social superiority ... we glimpsed the naked prejudice of the posh boys sitting at the cabinet table. The mask slipped to reveal how voters, the great British public, are viewed as inferior creatures, drones expected to know their place and tug a forelock at Conservative rulers in their government castle."" Yet there are good reasons, aside from unvarnished prejudice, why class remains such a potent political issue. For those worst affected by the present government's austerity program, portrayed by opponents as an ideologically motivated assault on the founding principles of Britain's welfare state, the ""We're all in it together"" mantra coined by British Finance Minister George Osborne -- the heir to a baronetcy and a multimillion dollar wallpaper fortune -- understandably rings hollow. Class remains the single most important factor in shaping the life prospects of every single person born in Britain; a fact most glaringly illustrated in terms of life expectancy itself, with men in the most deprived areas of the Scottish city of Glasgow typically dying at 71, while those in London's wealthy enclave of Kensington and Chelsea can expect to live beyond 85. Time: We read 'The Casual Vacancy,' here's what we think . At the heart of the British class structure still sits the English public school, the best known archetype of which is now probably Rowling's own Hogwarts -- a place of arcane rituals and Latin lessons, bunk-bedded boarding houses and Gothic grandeur. Real-life public schools may not offer lessons in magic and wizardry, but they do equip the offspring of those willing to cough up annual fees of tens of thousands of dollars with access to a world of privileged connections and a fast track via a well-oiled ""old boys' network"" into lucrative and successful careers in the upper echelons of politics, government, the military, the judiciary, banking and business. About 7% of English pupils attend fee-paying schools yet alumni of the top 100 public schools make up almost one third of annual admissions to Oxford and Cambridge -- universities whose own peculiar traditions owe more to their archaic ties to those institutions than to the rigors of a modern, egalitarian education system. Opinion: J.K. Rowling's daring leap . Former public schoolboys even punch above their weight on our screens, with two of Britain's leading actors -- Damian Lewis, an Emmy winner this week for his starring role in ""Homeland"", and Dominic West, celebrated for his portrayal of a rough-edged Irish-American detective in ""The Wire"" -- both also alumni of Eton. It remains to be seen whether Rowling has anything novel to add to the class debate, but one thing of which she is undoubtedly aware is that it is a subject that will shift copies from the shelves in droves. As ""Downton Abbey"" and the entire careers of Hugh Grant and Richard Curtis have demonstrated there remains an insatiable appetite beyond British shores for the sort of cut-glass accents, excruciating social awkwardness and polite self-effacement that the country has turned into a thriving export industry. Rowling, famously canny businesswoman that she is, will surely already have negotiated movie rights to a story that will be lapped up as eagerly across the Atlantic. Social class, swearing and sex permeate Rowling's first adult book . The opinions in this piece are solely those of Simon Hooper.","J.K.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Anti-government rage erupted in central Beirut Sunday as protesters clashed with security forces after a funeral for the nation's intelligence chief. A mob pushed toward the prime minister's office, hurling sticks, stones and flags and calling for his dismissal. Gunfire could be heard as police used tear gas to turn away crowds. At least 15 members of the military were wounded, according to the office of Prime Minister Najib Mitaki. A smaller, peaceful demonstration continued later Sunday as government figures called for calm. But deep-rooted political and sectarian tensions still simmered. Protesters, many of them allied with Sunni coalitions that have long been sharply critical of the Lebanese government's perceived closeness with the Syrian regime, blamed Mitaki for not preventing Friday's deadly car bomb blast that killed Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan. Don't know who is who in Lebanon? A guide to key players . Many anti-Syrian politicians in Lebanon blamed Syria for the assassination. ""We don't want our prime minister to be our leader, hiding (Syrian President) Bashar (al-Assad's) crimes,"" one angry protester shouted as he rushed toward the government building. ""They are responsible for Wissam al-Hassan's blood."" Friday's attack -- in broad daylight, at one of the capital's busiest areas -- left a crater more than a meter (3 feet, 3 inches) deep and also killed al-Hassan's bodyguard and a bystander. The intelligence chief's death brought a sense of deja vu to Lebanese, recalling the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which triggered the end of Syria's occupation of Lebanon and the turmoil that followed. Mikati, a billionaire supported by Syrian ally Hezbollah, announced Saturday that he planned to stay in power, despite having offered his resignation to appease those who claimed Syria's al-Assad was behind Friday's car bombing that killed al-Hassan. ""To hold me personally responsible for the assassination is unfair,"" he told reporters Saturday. ""I have always respected and admired al-Hassan, who has done great things for Lebanon."" Al-Hassan had spearheaded investigations of Hariri's death and a series of killings that targeted major anti-Syrian political figures. Sunday's violence broke out after a series of political speeches given to the crowd gathered in Beirut's central square for al-Hassan's funeral. ""This government is responsible for the assassination of martyr (al-Hassan) and his companion martyrs, therefore, this government must leave,"" former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora told the crowd. After his speech, ""the participants immediately called on people to head to the prime minister's office. The call was mentioned repeatedly in provocative language,"" read a statement from Mitaki's office. ""We put these facts forward to the public and we hold those people, who provoked with their slogans and actions, responsible for the attempt to storm the prime minister's office."" A mob surged from the central square toward the minister's office, growing in number and in intensity. Dozens rushed toward police lines. Clashes also took place in Tripoli, Lebanon, between supporters and opponents of Syria's government, Lebanon's National News Agency said. Some politicians had called for a day of rage Sunday, as accusations over who's responsible for the most high-profile assassination in Lebanon in more than seven years homed in on al-Assad's government. Others, including speakers at the funeral, had urged crowds to remain peaceful. Syria and Hezbollah condemned the blast very quickly after it happened on Friday. But al-Hassan's work would have earned him a number of enemies, particularly among pro-Syrian elements in Lebanon and in Damascus. He was aligned with the March 14 movement, the anti-Syrian regime coalition that emerged after Hariri's assassination in 2005. That movement was key in forcing the withdrawal of Syrian troops, which had long occupied neighboring Lebanon and pulled out months after Hariri was killed. He had worked closely with the U.N. Special Tribunal for Lebanon investigating the Hariri assassination. He had survived two assassination attempts, including one that killed an official getting evidence in Hariri's killing. While Lebanese authorities continued investigating Friday's attack, many among the crowd at Sunday's funeral said they were convinced Syria was responsible for al-Hassan's death. Some booed when Mitaki's face flashed across large screens showing the event. ""If you're against the Syrian government, you'll be eliminated,"" one attendee named Ahmed said. ""If you're not against it, then you're fine, you're safe."" A woman named Nathalie said she came to the funeral to show the world that Lebanon would never surrender to terrorism. ""We're all here today to show the whole world and even the Syrian regime that we'll never be afraid of them,"" she said, ""and Lebanon will never be Syria.""

"New York (CNN) -- Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the influential publisher who transformed The New York Times in his long tenure, has died at age 86, the newspaper reported Saturday. Sulzberger died Saturday at his home in Southampton, New York, after a long illness, the paper said, citing his family. He started in 1963 as both publisher of the paper and chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company. He left the publisher's job in 1992 and the chief executive's job in 1997, handing both reins to his son, the paper reported. The Sulzberger family has helmed the paper since 1896, when it was bought by Adolph Ochs, Sulzberger's grandfather. With the family having such a long history at the Times, some staffers felt like part of the family, too. ""For those of us working at the NYT, the passing of Arthur O. Sulzberger has the sharp feel of a death in the family,"" wrote Times national correspondent John Schwartz on Twitter. Jim Roberts, an assistant managing editor at the Times, called the late publisher a ""monumental contributor to journalism."" U.S. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by news of Sulzberger's death . ""He was a firm believer in the importance of a free and independent press -- one that isn't afraid to seek the truth, hold those in power accountable, and tell the stories that need to be told,"" Obama said in a statement. When Sulzberger took over the paper in 1963, the paper was respected and influential, often setting the national agenda, the Times said. But it also had financial troubles. Under Sulzberger's tenure, the Times was transformed into a paper with a national scope, sold on both coasts, and at the heart of a diversified, multibillion-dollar media operation that included newspapers, magazines, TV and radio stations, the Times said. ""Mr. Sulzberger's insistence on independence was shown in his decision in 1971 to publish a secret government history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers,"" Times columnist Clyde Haberman wrote in Saturday's obituary. ""It was a defining moment for him and, in the view of many journalists and historians, his finest."" The Nixon administration demanded the Times stop its series of articles on the papers, citing national security, but the newspaper refused on First Amendment grounds. It won its case in the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling on press freedom. Sulzberger was also responsible for expanding the newspaper from two sections to four, separating metropolitan and business news and introducing new ones geared toward consumers, the Times said. The sections were SportsMonday, Science Times, Living, Home and Weekend. They were a gamble, aimed at attracting new readers and advertisers, but they became an instant success and were widely imitated, the Times said. A billion-dollar investment in new printing facilities enabled the paper to have a national edition, regional editions, and the daily use of color photos and graphics, according to the Times. ""Punch,"" as many called him, remained on the board of directors until his retirement in 2001. ""Punch will be sorely missed by his family and his many friends, but we can take some comfort in the fact that his legacy and his abiding belief in the value of quality news and information will always be with us,"" wrote his son, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .","NEW: Obama calls Sulzberger ""a firm believer"" in a free press .

"(CNN) -- English football has been plagued by racism scandals in the past year, and now its ruling body must deal with what is thought to be the first case of racial abuse by a Premier League referee. League leaders Chelsea made a complaint over ""inappropriate language"" used by ref Mark Clattenburg during Sunday's controversial 3-2 home defeat by Manchester United. Chelsea's complaint focused on comments made to two of its players in two separate incidents. Clattenburg had already infuriated the European champions by sending off two of their players, dismissing Fernando Torres for diving even though he had been fouled and then allowing United's winning goal to stand even though television replays showed it appeared to be offside. With the issue of racism in English football under intense scrutiny, and following in the wake of Chelsea's own problems with captain John Terry's ban for racially abusing an opponent, the allegations against Clattenburg come at a time when the Football Association is under pressure to be seen to be taking a strong stance. ""I can't think of any previous such incident in the professional game off the top of my head,"" an FA spokesman told CNN. ""In grassroots football, yes, I can recall incidents but in the professional game I would have to check the record books."" The FA said on Monday they had launched an investigation into the allegations, while Clattenburg has welcomed ""the opportunity for the facts to be established."" ""We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regard to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents during (the) match,"" Chelsea said in a statement said on Sunday. ""The match delegate will pass the complaint to the Football Association. We will make no further comment at this time."" British media have reported that one of the players involved was Chelsea's Nigeria international John Obi Mikel. For the past year, the Blues have been at the heart of a racism row after an incident involving Terry and Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match in October 2011. The FA found Terry guilty of racially abusing Ferdinand, even though a court had earlier cleared the former England captain. The FA -- which requires a lower burden of proof than an English criminal court -- barred the 31-year-old for four games for the incident and also fined him £220,000. Terry missed Sunday's Stamford Bridge clash with second-placed United, who now trail Chelsea by just a point, as he served the second game of his ban. Chelsea's complaint means the FA will now have questions to answer after an allegation against one of its top referees. The body which represents Premier League referees -- the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) -- said it is aware of the allegations and ""they are being treated with the utmost seriousness."" ""Mark will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be established,"" it said in a statement. All four match officials -- the referee, his two assistants and the fourth official -- wore microphones and ear pieces that allowed them to hear what each other was saying throughout the match. But under the guidelines of football's world governing body FIFA, what is said between them is not recorded. The allegations against Clattenburg come at a time when the FA is already under fire from several black players, who feel that the punishment meted out to Terry for his racist abuse was too lenient. London's Metropolitan Police have also launched an investigation after a steward was injured in the aftermath of Manchester United's winning goal. Scorer Javier Hernandez appeared to be pelted by objects from the crowd while footage emerged of a steward falling over advertising hoardings and onto the pitch. Earlier this month, a number of black players refused to wear T-shirts promoting an anti-racism campaign in protest at a perceived lack of action about the problem from the game's leading bodies. The Clattenburg case came on the same afternoon as referee Andre Marriner earned the wrath of Everton manager David Moyes, who felt that Uruguay striker Luis Suarez should have been sent off for a bad tackle in Sunday's Merseyside derby against Liverpool, which ended 2-2 at Goodison Park. Suarez himself was at the center of a racism row earlier this year, receiving an eight-match ban after being found guilty by the FA of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. Four years ago, Evra, who played against Chelsea on Sunday, was banned for four matches and fined £15,000 after clashing with a groundsman at Stamford Bridge, with the FA saying that charges that Sam Bethell used racially abusive language towards the France international could not be proven.","Chelsea lodge complaint with English FA over referee's ""inappropriate language""

"(CNN) -- Troops from the African Union and Somali army say they made significant gains Friday in an assault on one of the final strongholds of an al Qaeda-linked militant group in the nation. AMISOM, the African Union force, said that its soldiers had successfully entered the port city of Kismayo in the morning. It said more forces are on their way. Thousands of Somalis flee as troops close in . Kismayo, south of the capital of Mogadishu, is a key battleground between African Union forces and Al-Shabaab, an Islamic group that has long tried to overthrow the Somali government, but has been increasingly beleaguered. ""We urge all fighters remaining in Kismayo to lay down their arms,"" said Lt.-Gen. Andrew Gutti, the commander of the African Union force. The Kenyan Defense Force, which is part of the offensive, said on its Twitter account that its troops were expanding into the rest of the city. The Kenyan and Somali forces mounted ""a fierce assault on air, sea and land"" to take Kismayo, said Col. Adan Ahmed Rufle, the spokesman of the Somali army in Lower Juba, the region around the city. Read more about Al-Shabaab on CNN's Security Clearance blog . He said the Al-Shabaab fighters were in ""disarray"" and some had been killed. He was unable to provide precise numbers of casualties. But the militant group said it was still in control of the port city. ""Kismayo remains firmly in the hands of the Mujahideen, stay tuned for updates,"" said a posting on a Twitter account believed to be controlled by the Al-Shabaab. The looming fight for Kismayo prompted thousands of civilians to flee the city this month, according to the U.N. refugee agency. It said that Somalis were leaving in minibuses, in trucks and on donkey carts. Related: Mogadishu bombing kills broadcaster . Kenyan forces said last week they were using land, sea and air forces to attack the militant group before the Kismayo offensive. Military analysts believe, however, that Al-Shabaab is militarily cornered. After losing control of much of Mogadishu last year, Kismayo became even more critical to the militant group. Al-Shabaab uses the port to garner much needed tax revenue from the illegal charcoal trade and smuggling operations. Since crossing into Somalia in October, Kenyan commanders and politicians have stated more than once that capturing Kismayo was the ultimate aim of their operation.

"New York (CNN) -- Timothy Haydock, an emergency room physician and Kennedy family friend, took the stand Thursday in the trial of the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Douglas Kennedy is accused of twisting one nurse's arm and kicking another in January as he tried to leave the maternity ward of a suburban New York hospital with his newborn son. Haydock, who was with Kennedy at the time of the incident, previously asserted that the ""nurses were the only aggressors"" and is considered a key witness for the defense. His testimony largely fit the defense's narrative that Kennedy's actions, captured on hospital surveillance video, were the result of an overly aggressive hospital staff and the product of a father's instincts to protect his child. Nurses describe alleged assault by Kennedy son . He said one of the nurses had been trying to ""exercise unnecessary control over the behavior of the father and son,"" and lunged at the pair. Judge John Donahue -- not a jury -- is hearing the case involving misdemeanor charges of harassment and child endangerment. Kicking off the trial, the two sides outlined significantly divergent scenarios of what happened at Northern Westchester Hospital. One of the nurses, Anna Lane, testified Monday that she'd initially reached in to hold open an elevator door to prevent Kennedy from leaving that way. When he headed toward a stairway door, she ran to it and put her hand on the doorknob. ""I had my hand behind my back and he grabbed my left hand -- which was on the doorknob -- and twisted my arm,"" said Lane. Kennedy raised his foot and kicked another nurse, Cari Luciano, who'd come to help before entering the stairway, Lane added. But he only got down as far as the next landing, where he was met by security. The defense team was tough on the nurse. Suggesting she had an ulterior motive given Kennedy's high profile, lawyer Robert Gottlieb questioned a tearful Lane why, if recounting her story was so emotionally difficult, she had recounted her version of what happened so soon after the incident on NBC's ""Today Show."" After Kennedy was arraigned in February, his attorney released a statement stating that nurses initially agreed to let him take the baby outside and demanding ""appropriate disciplinary action"" be taken against Lane and Luciano.

"South Bend, Ind. (CNN) -- When you say ""Notre Dame"" and then throw in words such as mystique, storied and blessed, you create as many folks rolling their eyes as wiping away tears of joy. This has been so throughout the 125 seasons of football for the Fighting Irish, especially when they are good. Well, forget about placing ""Notre Dame"" and ""good"" in the same sentence for a moment. With overwhelming losses to supposedly inferior foes on a consistent basis and underwhelming coaches from Bob Davie to Tyrone Willingham to Charlie Weis, ""Notre Dame"" has been ""mediocre"" or less during the last two decades. Now, with Brian Kelly in his third year of leading the Irish while having the fourth-most victories of any coach among the big boys of college football since 2006, ""Notre Dame"" is flirting with ""greatness"" at 7-0 despite a monster schedule and all those haters. Oh, and lovers. This gets a little confusing. After all, no team this side of the New York Yankees, Duke basketball and the Dallas Cowboys is more polarizing than the famous -- or is that the infamous? -- one that resides among the majestic oaks, maples and pines of Northern Indiana. Notre Dame can further its return to prominence Saturday night, when it takes its No. 5 ranking in the Bowl Championship Series standings on the road to No. 8 Oklahoma. Not surprisingly, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops is calling this the biggest game for his team in 12 years -- maybe ever -- because it's Notre Dame. It will be televised nationally on ABC, and the ratings will be huge, partly because of the game's magnitude, but mostly because of the staggering number of Notre Dame haters and lovers. I'll show you how this works, and I'll start with a confession: I was born and raised a few punts from the Notre Dame campus. Not only that, I was at the Irish's home game last week against Brigham Young during their attempt on a heavily overcast afternoon to remain undefeated this late in a season for the first time since 2002. They trailed BYU by four points deep into the third quarter, but then something happened -- first away from the playing field and then on it. The sun burst through the clouds, and as I looked to my left inside the Notre Dame Stadium press box toward the nearby Hesburgh Library, I saw the brightest of sunlight touching the face of Jesus on the mosaic that is as high as half a football field. They call the mosaic Touchdown Jesus around here. Needless to say, Notre Dame's offense promptly roared to the end zone after that to take a lead the Irish would never relinquish. Then, after the Notre Dame Marching Band finished its eternal playing of the Victory March at the end, the Irish players gathered before the student section for one of Notre Dame's slew of traditions. The others? The pep rallies on the Friday night before every home game, with a crowd as high as 20,000 at times. The public luncheon (average attendance of 1,500) that happens on the Friday afternoon before every home game. The lighting of candles on campus at The Grotto for miracles ranging from game-winning field goals to huge interceptions. The Midnight Drummer Circle, featuring those from the Notre Dame Marching band spending 45 minutes in front of the Golden Dome leading cadences and cheers. But back to the BYU game, when Notre Dame players continued a post-game home tradition that happens whether they win or lose. After they reached the front of the student section, they joined those who remained from the sellout crowd of more than 80,000 to sing Notre Dame's alma mater called ""Notre Dame, Our Mother."" Tears were everywhere. You may roll your eyes now. I haven't even mentioned that the whole Notre Dame Nation these days is inspired by Manti Te'o, the Irish's senior linebacker from Hawaii with a story built for Hollywood -- you know, like the one about George Gipp, otherwise known as The Gipper. Gipp was the Notre Dame running back who played for legendary Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne from 1917 to 1920 before his death from a throat infection. Notre Dame's dynamic coach and player duo inspired the phrase ""Win one for the Gipper,"" and they were immortalized in the 1940's movie ""Knute Rockne, All American."" Somebody named Ronald Reagan played The Gipper. To hear political pundits tell it, that role contributed to his earning the right to spend two terms in the Oval Office. You may roll your eyes again. Either that, or you can wait to hear more about Te'o, the undisputed leader of Notre Dame's bone-crunching defense. Before Notre Dame went to then-10th-ranked Michigan State in September, Te'o's grandmother and girlfriend died in Hawaii within six hours of each other. He played anyway. Along the way to a 20-3 victory, he had 12 tackles, broke up two passes and intercepted the first pass of his four-year Notre Dame career. After the interception, Te'o pointed to the sky, with emotion -- the kind he sends through the rest of his teammates. ""There are a lot of leaders that think a quality of a leader is just to talk,"" Te'o told me after the BYU game. ""I think the strongest leaders are those who not only verbally communicate but communicate by action."" Exhibit A: With much help from Te'o, the Irish rank second in the nation by allowing opponents just an average of nine points per game. They also possess the only defense at the NCAA's highest level of football that hasn't allowed a rushing touchdown. Te'o leads the team in tackles, ranks second in the nation in forcing turnovers (four interceptions, two fumble recoveries) and is among the handful of legitimate candidates for the Heisman Trophy, which is college football's top individual award. He would join Michigan's Charles Woodson (1997) as the only person to win the Heisman Trophy as primarily a defensive player. He also would help Notre Dame break its tie with the University of Southern California for the school with the most Heisman Trophy winners (7). (Seven trophies also have gone to Ohio State, but two went to the same player.) In addition, when it comes to The Associated Press and The USA Today/ESPN (formerly the United Press International) polls, Notre Dame has more consensus national championships than anybody (11). Nobody has more consensus All-Americans than Notre Dame's 80, and the Irish lead everybody in first-round NFL draft picks with 63 and in overall No. 1 NFL draft picks with five. Still, the haters would mention Notre Dame hasn't won a national championship since 1988. In contrast, the lovers would mention Te'o isn't alone as an Irish star these days. Notre Dame has other splendid players, such as future NFL tight end Tyler Eifert, athletically gifted quarterback Everett Golson and the speedy 6-6 and 303 pounds of Stephon Tuitt at defensive end. With Kelly's expertise and the Gipper's guidance, they are on the verge of turning Notre Dame's glory days of the past into those of the present and the future. You may roll your eyes some more.","Notre Dame hasn't won a national championship since 1988 .

"(CNN) -- European delegates got an unusual reprieve at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday when the Iranian President offered them no reason to get up and walk out, a move that has become a bit of tradition for western delegations. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has a history of controversial statements, but in his eighth and final appearance in front of the assembly's iconic green marble podium his tone seemed to shift from blustery to almost conciliatory. He said Iran was committed to peace, though he also accused world powers of double standards in pursuing an arms race. Ahmadinejad then told delegates that Iran has a ""global vision and welcomes any effort intended to provide and promote peace, stability and tranquility"" in the world. Bill Clinton not persuaded by Iran on nuclear weapons . The world is at a ""historic juncture"" now that Marxist systems are virtually gone and ""capitalism is bogged down in a self-made quagmire,"" he said, which could allow for other nations to ""play a more active role"" in global decision making. However, the seats set aside for the U.S. delegation were empty as he spoke. The Canadian delegation also did not attend the speech, and Israel's representatives were absent in observance of Yom Kippur. ""Over the past couple of days, we've seen Mr. Ahmadinejad once again use his trip to the U.N. not to address the legitimate aspirations of the Iranian people, but to instead spout paranoid theories and repulsive slurs against Israel,"" said Erin Pelton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. Earlier this week, the Iranian leader stoked controversy at the session when he declared that Israel has ""no roots"" in the Middle East. But on Wednesday he offered a more subdued discourse, after being widely expected to serve up a rebuttal to a series of sharp jabs from Western leaders, who accused him of fostering instability in the region by backing international militants, supporting Syria's embattled president and forging ahead with its nuclear program. Though Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, Western leaders believe Tehran wants to build a nuclear weapon. U.N. inspectors have also expressed doubts about the program's aims. Iran's president talks Israel, slams homosexuality . Still, Ahmadinejad managed to draw American ire with generalized comments about its election spending as well as with comments about inequality of U.N. leadership. He also told delegates that the body should be restructured, noting that many global issues are the result of poor management, and that ""self-proclaimed centers of power ... have entrusted themselves to the devil."" An ""arms race and intimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction by the hegemonic powers have become prevalent,"" he added, noting that Iran has now found itself under threat. ""Continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality,"" he said. ""A state of mistrust has cast its shadow on the international relations, while there is no trusted or just authority to help resolve world conflicts."" Though Ahmadinejad's speech was not as provocative as some had predicted, his presence in New York nonetheless drew demonstrations outside the United Nations, with Gotham's former Mayor Rudy Giuliani among the speakers. ""I'm here to oppose Ahmadinejad and (Syrian President) Bashar al-Assad,"" said Ahmad Tawfik, an 18-year-old protester from Ottawa. ""I lost a friend last week, and he was killed by Assad's regime with Ahmadinejad's weapons."" President Barack Obama, who's campaigning for re-election, blasted the Iranian president the previous day, suggesting that Iran and Syria are on the losing end of a sweeping tide of democracy in the region. A viewer's guide to the assembly . The United States ""will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said Tuesday, reminding other leaders in attendance that a ""nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained."" World leaders this week continue to discuss a range of issues, including poverty, global warming, women's empowerment and the prospect of renewed conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa. But Syria's 18-month civil war and renewed violence in the Middle East and North Africa are expected to continue to dominate the session. British Prime Minister David Cameron joined the chorus of voices at the U.N. Wednesday who oppose turning a ""deaf ear to the voices of suffering"" in Syria. A range of other global issues were also raised over the course of the day. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda made an indirect reference to his country's ongoing territorial disputes, which include a tense standoff with China over a set of islands in the East China Sea. States have a responsibility to guarantee peace, ensure the safety of their people and protect their sovereignty on land and at sea, Noda said in his speech to the assembly. Japan will ""fulfill such responsibility in accordance with international law,"" he said, calling for greater adherence to the ""rule of law"" by other nations. Noda noted that there are ""a number of territorial and maritime disputes in many parts of the world."" His speech didn't specifically mention Tokyo's island quarrel with Beijing, which has provoked violent anti-Japanese protests in China and soured diplomatic and economic ties between the two nations. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon sought to keep world attention focused on the worsening crisis in North Africa's Sahel region, which has been plagued by a deadly mix of drought, famine and Islamic militancy. ""The Sahel is at a critical juncture,"" he said Tuesday. ""Political turmoil, extreme climatic conditions and fragile economies are combining to create a perfect storm of vulnerability."" ""The people and governments of the region need urgent international support,"" he added. Mali's prime minister said Wednesday at the U.N. that his country has requested the adoption of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing military force to help retake the northern part of his country. Following a military coup in the capital in March, Islamists seized control of roughly two-thirds of the Texas-sized nation. Mali, seen as a stable democracy and an example for other less stable countries in the region, was thrown into chaos. Obama stresses use of diplomacy, humanity during speeches in N.Y. Earlier Wednesday, Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi took the podium, reaffirming his nation's commitment to the fight against Islamic militants. But he also offered to talk with extremist groups, including al Qaeda, provided they put down their weapons and repent. President Mohamed Morsy of Egypt also addressed the assembly Wednesday, marking what is regarded as an important foreign policy speech for a nation still reeling from the effects of a popular revolution that brought down Hosni Mubarak, a longtime U.S. ally. Morsy used the opportunity to draw attention to the issue of Palestinian statehood, calling for ""measures to put an end to colonization, occupation, settlement and the alteration in the identity of occupied Jerusalem."" He also sought to contextualize recent violence in the region after an anti-Islam film spawned protests and attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities across the Middle East and North Africa. Egypt will work to strengthen ""mutual understanding between Islamic countries and the rest of the world,"" he said, and get rid of the ""causes of misunderstanding used by fanatics on both sides to wrongly prove that differences between us are great.""

"(CNN) -- Few players, pundits or fans would argue who the best two players in the world currently are. Trying to choose between them is another matter. But not for former Brazil striker Ronaldo. ""I give preference to Messi, because he's a player who fascinates us more, who shows more creativity -- even though he's from Argentina, which has a big rivalry with Brazil!"" the Brazilian great told CNN's Shasta Darlington. He admires both players he says, but ""Messi is a little above Cristiano Ronaldo."" Like Messi, the 35-year-old is a three-time winner of the FIFA's Ballon d'Or and enjoyed a highly successful club career including spells at Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid -- winning two league titles with the reigning La Liga champions. The 35-year-old who finished his playing days at Corinthians in February 2011 was plagued by knee injuries during an illustrious career which reached its peak at the 2002 World Cup in Japan. Ronaldo inspired Brazil to their fifth victory in the competition, claiming the Golden Boot award with eight goals -- with two coming in the final against Germany. ""It was an incredible experience. Especially because after 1998 when we lost the final match to France,"" said Ronaldo. Hours before that final in 1998 Ronaldo had what his teammates described at the time as a convulsive attack at the team hotel and was rushed to hospital. Nonetheless he played against France -- making little contribution -- as the hosts coasted to a 3-0 win. ""Brazilians and players were left with that bitter taste in our mouths,"" added Ronaldo. ""Then came the World Cup of 2002 with big expectations and thank God we managed to make it to the final and beat Germany. I scored two goals in the final, it was truly unforgettable."" With all eyes on Brazil as it prepares to host the next FIFA World Cup in 2014, Ronaldo says his country faces challenges on two fronts. ""First, the organization of a World Cup, which is the biggest challenge in terms of country-wide organization. (The World Cup) today is a very complex event to organize,"" he says. But it will also be a challenge to satisfy the expectations of a football-mad nation, he says. ""The Brazilian people have high expectations about winning the cup in our own country and I'm certain that by the time we get to the cup, our team is going to be competitive."" Adding a sixth gold star to the famous yellow and green jersey will be difficult -- Brazil lost to Netherlands at the quarterfinal stage at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa -- but not impossible, Ronaldo says. ""I think in the last victories we had in the World Cup (1994 and 2002), the team was traditionally created in the last year. So I think we still have time,"" he said. ""We have Neymar, who is a huge talent, Pato, Thiago Silva, who is another excellent defender. Ganso, Oscar. We have a very young team, but it's playing at a high level and gives us big hope for a victory."" However Ronaldo also advised Neymar, who plays for Brazilian club Santos, to sign for a European club and help him join the level Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are playing at. ""I think Neymar still has a phase to compete -- to play in Europe and triumph playing in Europe,"" added the Brazilian great.","Former Brazil striker picks Messi ahead of Portugal forward as world's best player .

"(CNN) -- The small, seaside town of Piran, Slovenia, is thousands of miles away from Washington, but headlines are heralding its new mayor as the city's Barack Obama. Peter Bossman beat out an incumbent Sunday to become the first black mayor in Slovenia's history, securing 51.4 percent of the vote in a run-off election. The 54-year-old doctor from Ghana said race rarely came up during the campaign -- though opponents did try to use his accent when speaking Slovenian against him. ""They weren't really very harmful comments. It was more comments like, 'We would prefer to have a real Slovenian be mayor,'"" he told CNN Tuesday morning. There are only about 200 African immigrants in Slovenia, he said. But Bossman is hardly new to the European nation, which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. He first arrived in the country's capital of Ljubljana as a medical student in the late 1970s, and he has lived in Piran with his wife for more than 20 years. Bossman, a general practitioner, posted pictures on his Facebook page of campaign promises written on prescription paper -- including history, diagnoses and recommendations for treatment of the city's problems. His plans for the city of 17,000 include encouraging people to drive electric cars down its narrow streets, building a golf course to draw more tourists and promoting local products. ""We have so many thing going for us here. It's a shame that we don't promote them more,"" he said. His campaign strategy paid off at the polls, and captured media attention across the country. Several weeks before the election, the headline of a column in the Dnevnik newspaper -- sold nationwide -- read, ""Peter Bossman for President* (well, first as mayor)."" ""When the Americans made a historic move and elected Obama for president, this was a tectonic shift. A new chapter of national history...The real question is whether we are able to do what the Americans did,"" columnist Vlado Miheljak wrote. The Obama analogy started at the beginning of his campaign -- and stuck, Bossman said. ""I said that I'm flattered by the comparison, but I'm in no way Obama. I'm Peter Bossman, and I'm just running for mayor of a small town,"" he said. And Bossman says he has no plans to seek higher office once his four-year term as mayor ends. ""I want to be a good mayor. I want to help people,"" he said. ""I'm not really thinking about what I'm going to do in the future.""","Peter Bossman is Slovenia's first black mayor .

"(CNN) -- Rio Ferdinand has been found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 ($70,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for comments posted on Twitter relating to his England teammate and Chelsea star, Ashley Cole. Announcing its decision on Friday, the FA's Regulatory Commission concluded that Ferdinand's comment, which described Cole as a ""choc ice,"" brought the game into disrepute by referencing a person's ethnic origin, color or race. The Manchester United and England defender was charged in July after he responded to a tweet describing Cole as a ""choc ice,"" re-tweeting: ""I hear you fella! Choc ice is a classic! Hahahahahaha!!"" The FA heard evidence from Herman Ouseley, a former chair of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality who explained that ""choc ice"" was ""an offensive and insulting term ... used to question a person's identity, based on the notion that they have a dark outer skin but inside they act as a white person ... It means the person is fake."" Ferdinand's comment was posted on July 14, the day after John Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand's younger brother Anton during a Premier League match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers in October 2011. Cole had been called as a character witness for his Chelsea teammate during the hearing held at Westminster Magistrates Court in London. Although upholding the charge and fining Ferdinand, the FA stressed that it did not believe Ferdinand to be a racist, describing him as someone who has ""a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football."" Ferdinand, who is one of football's most high profile ""Twitterers"" with over three million followers, has declined to appeal the decision. Greg Stobart, a football correspondent for Goal.com told CNN: ""The fine is perhaps a little bit harsh. The thing I would say is that it was a foolish thing to do, but we know Rio was emotional because his brother was involved in the case."" He's not the first to fall foul of the FA for comments on Twitter, Stobart says, with Arsenal's Emmanuel Frimpong recently being fined £6,000 ($9,500) after admitting a charge of improper conduct. ""Players need to be more careful,"" Stobart said. ""(Twitter) is a public forum ... you've got to be responsible."" Despite being cleared by the court, John Terry has also been charged with improper conduct by the FA for his alleged comments to Anton Ferdinand during the match last October.","Manchester United defender found guilty of improper conduct and fined by English Football Association .

"(CNN) -- The military psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in a 2009 Fort Hood shooting spree has been admitted to an Army hospital for treatment of an undisclosed condition, the Army base said Monday. Maj. Nidal Hasan was admitted Saturday to Carl Darnal Medical Center on the Army base in Texas and is expected to be released within 48 hours, Fort Hood's public affairs office said. The military did not disclose why Hasan was in the hospital, citing federal government regulations against conveying patients' medical information. He was in ""good condition"" Monday, according to Fort Hood. His lead military attorney, Lt. Col. Chris Poppe, said only that his client wasn't suffering from a self-inflicted wound. Hasan is accused of opening fire at the large Army post's processing center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq, in November 2009. The solo attack left 32 people wounded, in addition to the 13 killed, while Hasan himself was paralyzed from the waist down after police officers exchanged fire with him. His court-martial tied to the shooting had been scheduled to start last month. But the Army Court of Criminal Appeals this month delayed its start indefinitely to determine whether his beard can be forcibly shaved during trial. Judge orders accused Fort Hood shooter to have his beard shaved . If convicted, Hasan could be sentenced to death. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, he was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings, but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. Hasan is a Muslim who had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations tied to the Fort Hood shootings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the prominent and radical Yemeni-American cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- An arrest warrant has been issued for Julius Malema, a youth leader in South Africa, his attorney said Friday. Neither she nor her client have been informed of the exact charges, said Nicqui Galaktiou. They are cooperating with authorities and expect to have a court appearance next week, she said. Malema was expelled from South Africa's ruling African National Congress this year in the wake of a speech he made that was critical of President Jacob Zuma. In his comments, Malema suggested that Zuma was running the party in a dictatorial and intolerant way. ""It is under President Zuma that we have seen the youth of the ANC being traumatized, being expelled from their own home,"" Malema said, according to an ANC statement. ""It is under President Zuma we have seen a critical voice being suppressed. We have seen, under President Zuma, democracy being replaced with dictatorship."" Malema and the ANC Youth League helped propel Zuma to power in 2009. But in recent years, he has become one of Zuma's fiercest critics, accusing the administration of failing to improve the lives of the poor. The youth leader has also been the subject of a criminal investigation by the national revenue service over allegations that he used his political position to influence the awarding of government contracts. He has denied the allegations.","Julius Malema's attorney says she does not know specific accusations .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Dozens of Japanese factories and stores reopened Thursday in China after violent protests forced their closure amid fury over Japan's plans to buy disputed islands in the East China Sea. Chinese plants for electronics makers Canon and Sony, along with Japanese automakers Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mazda and Suzuki, have reopened in China, company officials told CNN. Nearly 200 7-11 stores in Beijing and Chengdu operated by Seven & I Holdings and convenience stores operated by Lawson Inc. also reopened. Toyota Motor Company wouldn't reveal whether its China operations had reopened, telling CNN that the decision is up to individual plants. Honda has yet to reopen two plants in Guangzhou province, while Panasonic has yet to reopen operations in Zhuhai, site of an employee strike, and in Qingdao, where part of its facility was set ablaze last weekend by protesters. Meanwhile, trade data released Thursday shows that Japanese exports dropped 5.8% year-on-year in August, with trade to China dropping nearly 10%. Analysts attributed the fall to a general global slowdown in demand for Japanese goods. The decline underlines the economic significance of China, Japan's largest trading partner, and highlights the risk a prolonged dispute poses for Tokyo. The figures were compiled before the widespread calls in China for a boycott of Japanese goods. Earlier this week, ratings agency Fitch warned that the credit ratings of Japanese auto and technology manufacturers could come under pressure ""if the clash between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands escalates and is prolonged."" The dispute with China comes as Japan Inc. has been battling to recover from the twin disasters last year of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, as well as floods in Thailand which hurt Japanese electronics and automobile manufacturers that operate in the area. Export-driven companies are also struggling against a stubbornly high yen, which hurts the competitiveness of Japanese companies abroad. Tensions in the dispute, a perennial source of nationalistic anger on both sides of the East China Sea, rose on September 10 after Japanese government agreed to buy the uninhabited islands from its private Japanese owners. China claims historical ownership of the island chain, while Tokyo maintains it has been in Japanese hands since 1895. The islands â€” known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in China -- were administered by the U.S. occupation force after World War II. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. The islands sit among popular fishing waters and are also believed to be rich in oil resources. Ownership of the chain would allow exclusive commercial rights in the seas surrounding the islands.

"(CNN) -- The bodies of an American couple killed on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten were released to family members Tuesday as questions about their deaths remain unanswered. A man arrested in connection with the stabbing deaths had been scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday, but that appearance was pushed to Wednesday, according to the island's solicitor general, Taco Stein. The proceedings will not be open to the public. Stein gave no reason for why the appearance was rescheduled. Autopsies were performed Monday on the couple, found stabbed to death in their St. Maarten home, the solicitor general said. The bodies of Michael and Thelma King of South Carolina were discovered Friday at their oceanfront residence in Cupecoy, in what Stein described as ""an ugly scene."" The suspect was arrested Sunday, and authorities are working to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to keep him in custody. No charges have been filed against anyone so far in the case. ""There are strong indications he is involved in the crime,"" Stein said Monday of the suspect, without divulging details. Identifying him only by his initials M.K.J., the St. Maarten Public Prosecutor's office described the suspect as a 28-year-old, Jamaican-born man. The prosecutor's office said the suspect ""heavily resisted his arrest,"" engaging in a confrontation that ended with both him and a police officer ""wounded."" After being treated at an area hospital, the man was taken to a police station. ""He has been cooperative to a certain extent, but was reluctant to answer critical questions,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement. The suspect's attorney, Brenda Brooks, said she met with her client Monday at a police station in St. Maarten's capital Philipsburg, where he is being held. He had signs of a ""beating,"" according to Brooks. St. Maarten is a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, whose economy is based on the tourism industry. More than 1 million tourists visit the island each year. Stein, who was once solicitor general for Aruba, said authorities ""are not certain of the motive in the case."" ""Some things are missing"" from the King's home, but there were no signs of a break-in, he said. The killings occurred in what is ""generally considered a safe area"" that is popular with tourists, according to the solicitor general. ""This is something that does not happen every day,"" he said. The suspect and the slain couple didn't appear to know each other, said Stein, noting they ""were not moving in the same circles."" Topper Daboul, a restaurant owner in the area, said he was a friend and business partner of the Kings. ""They were beautiful people,"" he said, adding he is ""still in shock."" ""They were kind to everybody."" Zane Jackson offered a similar story and sentiment in an interview with CNN affiliate WIS. Describing himself as a friend and business partner of the Kings, who helped him open a sports bar in Columbia, South Carolina, Jackson said, ""They'd have given anything to anybody."" ""It just seems very senseless,"" he said. ""They were good people."" CNN's Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: The suspect, who was due in court Tuesday, will now appear Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A couple weeks after attending his first United Nations General Assembly meeting as president, Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What a difference three years makes. Back in his first months in office, simply being Barack Obama was enough to bring cheering crowds into the street. Whether it was because he was not George Bush or because he was promising to end American policies that were widely despised or whether it was because -- as the first African-American to be elected U.S. president, he embodied an ideal of opportunity for all that was core to this country's appeal -- it hardly mattered. Convene a crowd, and they would find something to like about Barack Obama. Back then, he seized the moment with great speeches that offered a vision for a new era in American leadership. In Cairo, he spoke of new relations with the Islamic world. In Prague, he spoke of eliminating nuclear weapons. He embraced the G-20 as a mechanism of coordinating the response to the global economic crisis. He didn't bully. He charmed. Indeed, Obama is probably the first person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize largely for his charm. Or, alternatively, he may be the first person ever to have won the Nobel Peace Prize for the simple achievement of not having been the guy who had the job before him. (This can be an important achievement. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson once said one of the secrets to job success is picking the right predecessor.) Opinion: Why you shouldn't vote for Obama . It was a great start. But the problem with great speeches of the kind Obama delivered then is that they contain promises, and if those promises are not kept future speeches not only ring hollow, they are reminders of what has not been fulfilled. As President Obama prepared to deliver his remarks Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly, the world that had been so supportive had turned less receptive. The echoes of his Cairo speech seemed very faint indeed as neither Obama nor Mohammed Morsy, Egypt's new president, seemed to know how to characterize the U.S. relationship with that country, once an important ally in the region. Further, the hope for a new relationship with Islam seemed deeply damaged in the wake of recent anti-American protests and the killings in Benghazi, Libya. The Prague speech's promise of a world without nuclear weapons was predicated on the idea that the world's two most important nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, would move to a more constructive relationship. That has not happened. The relationship is deeply strained. And the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons to Iran was a central subject of the president's remarks. He said such a threat could not be contained and therefore the United States would not tolerate it arising. But clearly, the question mark associated with past unkept promises hung in the air over that firmly delivered assertion. Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on the assumption that he would be the president who got the United States out of the wars in the greater Middle East that had cause so much dissent during the Bush presidency. But Obama subsequently chose to increase the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. He serially violated national borders with special operations missions, drones and cyber-attacks. He changed U.S. doctrine but seemed to continue to embrace a ""we'll do what we choose"" American exceptionalism. The notion that the Middle East is itself somehow more peaceful today than it was when he received that prize is ludicrous. The United States has turned away from the G-20 as the primary mechanism of global economic cooperation. Indeed, the president has turned away from the United Nations for campaign purposes, stopping only for a speech and campaign press appearances, not to meet with international leaders. It would be wrong to suggest that President Obama is solely responsible for these developments. He could no more control the Arab street than he could the behind-the-scenes machinations of a tin-pot thug like Vladimir Putin. He has racked up some considerable foreign policy achievements as well. America is out of Iraq. Bin Laden is dead. So too is Ghadafi. The U.S. economy is slowly turning a corner. And the president has been blessed with an adversary in this campaign who responds to every potential crisis for the president with a bigger self-inflicted crisis for his own campaign. Indeed, it sometimes seems that the GOP would be better running with no candidate at all than the one they have got. Opinion: The true difference between Obama, Romney . Speaking to the United Nations, President Obama tried to evoke the strength and promise of that first year. His language was soaring and his themes were resonant. He evoked the kind of understanding for international perspectives that were signatures of that first year in office. Of the costs to the Middle East of intolerance. Of the strength of American values like free speech and government for, by and of the people. It was apparent once again that this was a compassionate president and a man of good values. But for every strong assertion that echoed through the hall, the echoes of three years of past speeches added a question: Are good values enough? Can this president, any president, any man or woman, deliver the results that would have warranted that premature prize Barack Obama was awarded in 2009? Was it not so much an award to a man as it was to an idea of the leadership we have ever since needed but have yet to find? Barack Obama right now has his sights clearly set on the challenge of winning the November election. But for him, that is a far smaller hurdle than what awaits if he wins: one last chance to live up to the hope that ushered him into office, one last chance to earn the prize he has already won. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: In 2009, Obama got Nobel shortly after his first U.N. General Assembly .
He says back then, world saw him as leader to end wars, which proved too hard to do .
He says no end in sight for turmoil in Middle East, relationship with Islam damaged .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Atlanta Falcons defensive end John Abraham was arrested late Monday, accused of obstructing police and firefighters at the scene of an attempted suicide. He is the second player from the Atlanta football team to be arrested in a week. Running back Michael Turner was booked for driving under the influence on September 18. Abraham entered an area responders had cordoned off with crime scene tape, while trying to talk down a woman who was threatening to jump from a floor of a high-rise hotel, said Atlanta Police spokesman John Chafee. A firefighter ordered the football player repeatedly to leave the scene, Chafee said. But Abraham refused, even when police intervened. ""He again refused and insisted on continuing further into the scene,"" Chafee said. ""Officers then took Mr. Abraham into custody."" He was charged at the county jail with two misdemeanor counts of obstruction. Abraham's relationship with the woman, if any, was not immediately clear. According to CNN affiliate WSB, the woman did not jump and was taken to a local hospital.

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old student died of a self-inflicted gun shot wound Wednesday morning at a junior high school in Stillwater, Oklahoma, police said. Sherry Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the city of Stillwater, said no one else was injured in the shooting at Stillwater Junior High School. Students were moved to another location so parents could pick them up or buses could take them home, Fletcher said in a statement. Stillwater police Capt. Randy Dickerson told reporters that a school resource officer had heard the gun shot from an adjacent hallway and raised the alert. The officer found the 13-year-old boy with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, he said. He was unable to confirm whether the student had been bullied, saying the investigation had just begun. The ""horribly tragic situation"" was an isolated incident, Dickerson said. Stillwater school Superintendent Ann Caine said there was nothing in school computer records to indicate the teenager had been bullied. ""It is with a huge heart that I offer my condolences to this student's family,"" she said. The boy, who was an eighth-grader, had only been at the school for a short time, but staff that knew him said he had ""the biggest smile,"" she said. The gun shot was heard shortly before 8 a.m. as students were getting ready to go to class, she said. Caine said the area had been evacuated as quickly as possible and parents alerted. Other students likely witnessed the shooting, which was in a hallway near lockers and classrooms, Dickerson said. Some schools in the area were under a temporary lockdown after the shooting. Stillwater is about 70 miles northeast of Oklahoma City.","The 13-year-old boy who died was an eighth-grader at Stillwater Junior High .

"Delaram, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Marines stand under the blazing sun at Camp Bastion airfield waiting for their ride to take them far beyond the perimeter fence. Wearing body armor and weapons, they dump their helmets and bags in the dirt and look out onto one of Afghanistan's busiest runways. A $25 million Harrier jet flies past, leaving the roar of its engine in its wake, while a C-130 Hercules touches down to pick up troops and cargo. An Osprey aircraft -- half helicopter, half plane -- hovers in the distance before landing to join the dozen other Ospreys sitting on the tarmac.

They don't turn their backs to the assault of sand, dirt and gravel but hold their ground and stare right into it -- a display of Marine toughness that could come in handy in the mission ahead. They're headed to Nimroz province, where the insurgency is growing stronger by the day. Opinion: Green-on-blue attacks show there's no easy way out . As I stand there wondering if all these Marines will return from their tour in the badlands of southwest Afghanistan, a lanky 19-year-old soldier with a buzz cut strolls by and strikes up a conversation. He tells me he was in the third grade in Minnesota when the September 11 attacks occurred. ""I grew up watching the war in Afghanistan on CNN, and I knew I wanted to come here and fight for my country,"" he says. We've come to the front line of this war to see the transfer of power that is under way between U.S. and Afghan forces. But a spate of so-called ""green on blue"" attacks -- Afghan soldiers or police attacking U.S. and other international forces -- has caused serious alarm for U.S. and ISAF troops, and the transition process has been fast tracked. Read more: U.S. restricts Afghan ops after 'green-on-blue' killings . The Marines have sent us to Delaram, at the crossroads of Helmand, Nirmroz and Farah provinces, to show how joint patrols are still happening, despite NATO's orders to suspend many of the operations. As we touch down in this dusty, desolate landscape, it quickly becomes apparent the Marines are no longer training the Afghans. They've handed over the reins of this outpost to the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the 28 Marines who remain here are working in an ""advisory"" role, marking off the days on the calendar until they are scheduled to go home for Christmas. While everyone lives inside the massive compound, the two camps are divided by high barbed-wire fences, with several hundred meters of land between them. The Marines and Afghans live, eat and sleep separately. They only come together and mix on common ground where the central command headquarters is located. A Marine introduces me to the man in charge -- Gen. Abdul Wasea Milad from the ANA. The former Mujahadeen fighter is leading 5,000 Afghan soldiers from the Iranian border east to Kajaki -- some of the most dangerous territory in the country. He's just returned from a 10-day trip visiting many of his outposts, driving hundreds of kilometers along Highway One. It's a journey the Americans wouldn't even consider doing by road because of all the improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, planted daily by insurgents. When I ask the general about the dangers he faces, he just laughs and tells me: ""This is Afghanistan. My men sweep the roads for landmines every morning, so they're fine to travel on during the day. It's when we sleep that the Taliban puts them out again."" While standing in Wasea's office, a soldier informs him of a report of a suspected IED outside the local police headquarters. He takes us in his Humvee to the site about three kilometers (two miles) beyond the wire from Camp Delaram. The Americans are not accompanying us. They have no desire to leave the fortified compound, as they explain this is now an Afghan operation. Lt. Jan Mohammad, who has been with the ANA for the past two years, is leading the mission. He and another solider are carrying a metal detector, a block of C4 explosive, detonators and a drag rope. The site is off the main highway on a dirt road leading to a village. We walk in single file, aware of every single step, in case there are other mines that have been laid under the surface. The soldier sweeping the road suddenly stops when his equipment starts beeping -- a sign it's picked up something possibly very dangerous. We all crouch down and he gently picks at the earth. After a painstaking search he declares there's nothing there and we move on. Soldiers armed with M4 machine guns stand above us on the dusty hill watching in case there's an ambush. A local villager on a motorcycle attempts to drive in our direction. The soldiers point their weapons and yell out a warning, telling the driver to head off in another direction. Suicide bombings are also a common tactic for the Taliban, and these soldiers are only too aware of the dangers that now face them. We reach the site and Lt. Mohammad takes over. The 30-year-old officer earns less than $300 a month, risking his life every day to disable these deadly devices. I ask how much experience he has, and he tells me: ""It's not my first time. I have defused 70 IEDs in Kajaki in seven days when I was there with the Marines."" When I ask him why he does this dangerous line of work he replies: ""If I lose my life it wouldn't be a problem. But if others die while I am doing this then I would feel bad because I don't want others to die. This is my job -- to save my people from the risk of these IEDs."" As he lies on his stomach assessing the area, he digs with his hands to remove the earth. He slowly stands up and sweeps the metal detector over and over again, making sure he identifies the exact spot before lying back in the dirt to continue digging. After 20 minutes, he stands up and declares the site is clear explaining the Taliban must have removed the IED after it had been reported to the police, or a local came and took it to claim the $100 reward. As we walk back to the Humvee I ask Lt. Mohammad how he feels about the U.S.-led coalition pulling out of Afghanistan by 2014. He says: ""It wouldn't make a difference to me if they leave because it is my country and I will keep doing my job.""","Coalition forces engaged in transition of power to Afghan National Army (ANA)

"Washington (CNN) -- First Mitt Romney makes two references to 47 percent. Then he suggests President Barack Obama ""starts off with 48, 49."" ""These are people who pay no income tax,"" Romney said at a May fund-raising event that was secretly recorded and is now at the center of a campaign controversy. Because of that remark, most of the commentary has understandably assumed he was referring at all times to the roughly half of Americans who don't pay income taxes. CNNMoney.com: Romney's '47%' - Washington's tax break obsession to blame . I think not. The first reference -- 47 percent -- is the ballpark number smart pollsters in both parties consistently use to describe the president's most loyal base. The math behind that? Begin with the president's steady support among African-Americans, Latinos and other non-white voters. Then add in his backing among white, college-educated women. So when Romney told the fund-raiser crowd there are ""47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what"" he was on solid ground and reflecting the consensus of his polling and political team. But how he got from that data point to describing Obama's coalition as ""victims who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them"" is a mystery. Not to mention a sweeping insult to many working-class voters and other taxpayers who support the president. Romney's remarks huge mistake or plain truth? In the recording, obtained by the left-leaning Mother Jones, Governor Romney twice uses the ""47 percent"" figure pollsters, including his own, suggest is the president's base. Moments later he uses the numbers ""48, 49,"" presumably a reference to the nearly half of Americans who, in 2009, were not represented on a taxable return, according to data from the conservative Heritage Foundation. In any event, much of what he says in describing these voters is eye-popping. 'Anatomy of a leak' of the Mitt Romney video . ""There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that they are the victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, you name it, that that's an entitlement and they will vote for this president no matter what."" Many GOP strategists in Washington see this as another self-inflicted political wound, and the Obama campaign and its Democratic allies are gleeful for the opportunity to suggest it is proof that Romney is disdainful of working-class Americans and insensitive to those, who because of economic hardship or other reasons, need government help. Secretly taped comments put Romney back on defense . Now, to be clear, some grassroots conservatives are not unhappy, and are hoping Romney defends his remarks and pushes a debate on government assistance and dependency. While a healthy debate about government programs and priorities is always useful, such sweeping generalizations as those used by Romney are often a path into political quicksand. In 2008, Obama won 95% of the African-American vote, two-thirds of Latinos, 64% of other minority voters, and 52% of white women who are college graduates. Take another look at those numbers. Now think all of those voters fit this?: ""These are people who pay no income tax."" Or this?: ""I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."" It was recorded in May, but released seven weeks before Election Day, at a time when there is mounting evidence that the contest, while still highly competitive, is trending in the president's direction. They say timing is everything in politics. The timing for Romney here is horrible. He needs to be making his case about tomorrow's economy, not trying to explain away things he said months ago.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With just over a week to go before the first presidential debate, both campaigns are weighing what they can do to take advantage of the three head-to-head matchups in October that will help decide the race. Republican pollster Whit Ayres said GOP nominee Mitt Romney must use the debates to ""score points"" on the economy, the No. 1 concern of voters. ""The most important thing that Mitt Romney can do is give people confidence that he knows how to fix this economy,"" Ayres told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union."" ""They don't believe (President Barack) Obama has or can, but they are not yet persuaded that Mitt Romney can either. That's the most important thing to come out of your debate."" While national polls like Gallup show Obama and Romney neck and neck, recent ones in Florida, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin -- key battleground states that will help determine the winner in November -- show the president pulling ahead, with much closer contests in Colorado and Nevada. That could make it harder for Romney to do what analysts say he must to win the White House -- carry all the states Sen. John McCain did in 2008, plus about half a dozen that Obama turned from red to blue. Battleground polls seem to give Obama upper hand . With the conventions over, the debates are the last opportunity for the two candidates to reach the kind of large television audiences that could help them win over the dwindling number of undecided voters and energize their bases. On ABC's ""This Week,"" conservative writer Ann Coulter said the debates would be important ""not because Romney is such a fabulous orator, but to the contrary -- for the first time, Americans will be able to see Romney unfiltered. And I think it will make a big difference."" And South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on ""State of the Union"" that the former Massachusetts governor was ""in good shape"" and the debates would help shift the focus from perceived gaffes and missteps made by Romney in recent weeks -- most notably his remarks calling 47% of the U.S. population ""victims"" who are dependent on the government -- to Obama's record. Graham: It's about your bank account, not Romney's Swiss account . Former President Bill Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that Romney would have to explain the ""47%"" comments in the debates. The challenge for the president is to convince doubters, some of whom may have been supporters in 2008, that his policies will succeed in turning the economy around. ""We've got an electorate that is disappointed in the president they elected in 2008, but not at all convinced that the Republican challenger offers a good alternative,"" USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page told Crowley. Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs continued to try to lower expectations for the president on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I think it's always a big moment when two candidates get to sit side by side and answer the same question,"" he said. ""Mitt Romney I think has an advantage, because he's been through 20 of these debates in the primaries over the last year. He even bragged that he was declared the winner in 16 of those debates. So I think, in that sense, having been through this much more recently than President Obama, I think he starts with an advantage."" In other quarters, the discussion turned to whether the Romney campaign needed to make changes. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker survived a recall election with the help of a strong Republican ground game that the Obama campaign believes is benefiting Romney in that traditionally blue state. Walker said he wanted to see more passion from the GOP contender and suggested he needed to spend more time campaigning. ""I think you gotta get off the hills and you gotta get out and charge forward,"" Walker said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Certainly, in part, this is a referendum on this president, there's no doubt about it. But I think for most Americans -- particularly in my state, where there's an awful lot of swing, independent voters -- they want to know more than what's wrong with this president. They want to know what's right and what's going to move this country forward. I think Mitt Romney's got this plan. I want to see fire in the belly."" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus dismissed the handwringing among some Republicans about the state of the campaign and insisted Romney had a good week, despite an intense focus in the media on the ""47%"" comments, which were secretly recorded at a fund-raiser in Florida months ago. Priebus on Romney: 'Not the best week' ""We had a good week last week, I think in retrospect, in that we were able to frame up the debate last week in the sense of, what future do we want, and do you want, out there for your kids and grandkids. And clearly, things are not going well in this country,"" Priebus said on ""This Week."" Priebus' comments echoed ones Romney made in a ""60 Minutes"" interview set to air Sunday night, in which he said his campaign did not need a turnaround. ""Actually, we're tied in the polls. We're all within the margin of error,"" Romney told CBS's Scott Pelley, in excerpts released ahead of showtime. ""We bounce around, week to week, day to day. There are some days we're up. There are some days we're down."" Obama campaign officials say it is not the national polls but the swing state polls that matter. ""We're either tied or in the lead in every battleground state 45 days out,"" campaign manager Jim Messina told reporters in Milwaukee on Saturday. ""I think you will see a tightening in the national polls going forward. What I care way more about is Ohio, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, etc. In those states, I feel our pathways to victory are there. There are two different campaigns, one in the battlegrounds and one everywhere else. That's why the national polls aren't relevant to this campaign."" Romney plans to spend part of the last full week before the October 3 debate on a bus tour in Ohio, while the president is scheduled to speak at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, before making campaign stops in Ohio and Virginia.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 100 people, including police, volunteers and family members, were searching Monday for a University of Florida student who went missing four days ago in Gainesville. Police fear Christian Aguilar could be seriously injured, disoriented and unable to seek medical attention. Aguilar, 18, disappeared last week after an altercation over a girl, his father told CNN affiliate WCJB. According to police, Aguilar and another 18-year-old man had an altercation on Thursday. The second man told investigators he left Aguilar in the parking lot, but searchers using helicopters and scent dogs failed to turn up any trace of him, police said Sunday. Authorities have said the man is a ""person of interest"" in the case and charged the 18-year-old with depriving a victim of medical care, a third-degree felony. He underwent a psychiatric evaluation Monday after he told investigators that he wanted to kill himself and was subsequently booked in the Alachua County Jail, Officer Ben Tobias said. Police suspect foul play, Tobias said. Family members, who have plastered the area with fliers and taken to Twitter to generate leads, have invited a nonprofit search group to help look for Aguilar alongside family members and police.

"(Mental Floss) -- When it comes to parasites, it's all about perspective. You may call a lifetime of growing and feeding off another organism lazy, but we call it opportunistic. In fact, these life-sucking go-getters have managed to carve out some of the most ingenious survival strategies in the world. This snapper refused comment when asked if he still had a tongue. 1. Cymothoa exigua: Biting your tongue, so you don't have to . When fish mommies want to strike fear in the hearts of their misbehaving fish babies, we suspect they draw on the chilling animal savagery of the Cymothoa exigua. As a youngster, this nasty little parasitic crustacean begins a life of terror by fighting its way through the gills of its fish host of choice, the snapper. Once there, it attaches itself to the fish's tongue and begins feeding on the rich blood pumping through the artery underneath. As the parasite grows, it drinks more blood and eventually causes the tongue to atrophy and disintegrate. But does the Cymothoa mouth-squatter leave its fishy friend tongueless? Of course not. It does what any crafty parasite would do and replaces the old tongue with its own body. The fish is actually able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue, only it has to share all the food with its new friend. Yes, the whole foster-tongue thing seems like a pretty nice gesture on the part of ol' Cymothoa --until you remember there was nothing wrong with the fish's old tongue in the first place. 2. Sacculina carcini: Reasons you shouldn't pick up a hitchhiker . If you ever have a choice between being possessed by the devil and being possessed by a Sacculina carcini, opt for the devil -- no contest. A female sacculina begins life as a tiny free-floating slug in the sea, drifting around until she encounters a crab. When that fateful day arrives, she finds a chink in the crab's armor (usually an elbow or leg joint) and thrusts a kind of hollow dagger into its body. After that, she (how to put this?) ""injects"" herself into the crab, sluicing through the dagger and leaving behind a husk. Once inside, the jellylike sacculina starts to take over. She grows ""roots"" that extend to every part of the crab's body -- wrapping around its eyestalks and deep into its legs and arms. The female feeds and grows until eventually she pops out the top of the crab, and from this knobby protrusion, she will steer the Good Ship Unlucky Crab for the rest of their commingled life. Packed full of parasite, the crab will forgo its own needs to serve those of its master. It won't molt, grow reproductive organs, or attempt to reproduce. It won't even regrow appendages, as healthy crabs can. Rather than waste the nutrients on itself, a host crab will hobble along and continue to look for food with which to feed its parasite master. 3. Filarial Worms: Proof you need thicker skin . Filarial worms are the nasty little suckers you can thank for lymphatic filariasis, which, according to the Pacific Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, is the second-leading cause of permanent and long-term disability in the world. (Mental illness is No. 1.) Filarial worms are round, thread-like parasites that travel from human to human via that harbinger of disease transmission, the mosquito. How do they make the leap of host? In an interesting (if scary) example of parasite ingenuity, filarial worm embryos living underneath the skin can sense the onset of night, which is their cue to head upward to the skin's surface in order to increase their chances of being picked up by a passing 'skeeter. Should they get sucked up, they grow into larvae within the mosquito's muscle fibers and then get themselves injected into new hosts. Once they've returned to a human home, they open up a franchise in the family business -- Wreaking Havoc. Filaria often lodge in the body's lymphatic system, where they can inflict any number of torturous symptoms, not the least of which involves carting your genitals off to the elephantiasis clinic in a wheelbarrow. 4. Guinea Worms: Exposing parts nobody wants to see . Where there are guinea worms, there is Guinea Worm Disease -- and that's usually in Africa. When a human consumes water contaminated with guinea worms, the little buggers infiltrate their host's intestinal walls and commence mating. After conception, the males die off, and the females hang around for about a year, growing and eating. Eventually, these slender ladies get bored and decide they need to lay some eggs. To do so, they make their way down the body to the lower extremities, where they bore a small hole through the skin. The resulting lesion begins to fester and burn, which usually leads the host to plunge his or her foot into a soothing bucket of water. (Of course, in areas where an entire village shares a single water source, this helps spread the infection.) Unfortunately for the sufferer, the water doesn't solve the problem of having a three-foot female worm dangling its genitalia out of your foot. And to complicate matters, if you yank on that sucker, it'll break apart and could cause a fatal infection. So how do you rid yourself of the not-so-little hitchhiker? You go see a doctor, who -- over the course of three or four weeks -- will kindly wind the worm around a stick, inch by agonizing inch. Not the most pleasant method, but certainly a proven one. This cure for a guinea worm infection has been around so long, some believe it's where we get the snakes-around-a-staff symbol for medicine. 5. Leucochloridium paradoxum: Parasite for sore eyes . Prepare to be dazzled. This parasite's got a life cycle more mind-bending and chilling than an M. Night Shyamalan film. Leucochloridium paradoxum are a type of fluke (a.k.a., parasitic flatworm) that prey on birds -- a fascinating turn of events considering they begin their lives as eggs in bird droppings. Thus, the problem facing baby Leucochloridium paradoxum is, ""How do I get myself back into one of those feathery things?"" Taking a page from Greek history, the infant flatworms rely on Trojan trickery. First, they hang out in the droppings until a snail happens along and eats the bird dung. Then they initiate their devious plan of action by taking up residence in the snail's eyestalks. (Sure, it sounds slimy and gross to us, but after a childhood spent living in bird feces, it's a step up.) As they mature, the flukes become visible through the snail's translucent skin. And that's when things really get interesting. To a bird, this fluke-filled eyestalk looks like a caterpillar. So the bird devours the stalk and ends up with a bellyful of Leucochloridium paradoxum that will, of course, lay eggs and begin the cycle again. Meanwhile, the snail shakes its head, shops for an eye patch, and vows never to eat feces again. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- As Bill Clinton walked out onto the stage of the Democratic National Convention last night, there was love in the air. Television cameras scanned the faces in the crowd and it was as if each man and each woman, regardless of their ages or where they came from, was seeing again the person who first stole their hearts. But however deep their affections, however dizzying their passion, it was clear that it was at least equaled by the love of the speaker for the crowd he faced, for the role he was playing and for the limelight he once again commanded. Throughout Clinton's 49-minute address, at turns both masterful and meandering, the intensity of the love affair grew. At times, it was almost too much to watch. One woman on whom the cameras lingered for a moment was so close to a swoon that I thought she would topple over at any minute and that, in any event, she would never again look at her husband or lover again in the same away. They would always be second best. It was in that moment easy to imagine that on some level, off-stage, watching, Barack Obama was wondering whether he too would suffer a similar fate. Opinion: Bill Clinton brings it for Obama . To be sure, as he strode out to congratulate Clinton after the speech, Obama and his team and his fervent supporters filling the arena in Charlotte were likely thrilled by the job the 42nd president had done in supporting the cause of the 44th. But, as David Gergen said on CNN shortly after the speech, ""Clinton told the Obama story better than Obama has."" That is saying something, of course: Obama is a gifted speaker. Sometimes, he even soars. But as he himself noted recently when asked about his weaknesses during his first term, he has failed to effectively communicate why people should support his policies at critical moments. Recognizing this is no doubt why Obama, who was disinclined to consult with Clinton early in his presidency as much as the former president would have liked, turned to Clinton to play such a central role in this convention and in his re-election campaign. But there was a risk. He would pay a price. He would violate one of the first rules of show business: The closer on stage you stand to a taller actor, the shorter you look. With his speech last night, as with his post-presidency, his successes at the Clinton Global Initiative, the ascendancy of his wife as a senator and then as an exceptionally effective secretary of state, and the position he holds with her today, high atop the polls as the most popular leading politicians in the Democratic Party, Clinton has earned consideration as the most dominant American political figure of the past two decades. Warts and all, he is to his generation as Franklin Roosevelt was to his. For a man as proud as Obama, this must be galling. Sure, the president is no doubt grateful for the brilliance with which Clinton defended his policies, the deftness with which he sliced up Mitt Romney with a razor made of finely honed, carefully forged praise for his Republican predecessors. Obama, like everyone else watching, must have been particularly struck by how Clinton could speak of the same issues that divide average pols and make them ennobling. ""We're all in this together is a far better philosophy than you're on your own,"" was effective. But in the current era, his ""Democracy does not have to be a blood sport. It can be an honorable enterprise that advances the public interest"" was both timely and transcendent. Part rhetoric. Part prayer. Opinion: Now it's up to Obama . On some level, Barack Obama must have wondered, ""have I unleashed the reverse Clint Eastwood? A guy who will upstage me not with ill-conceived clownishness but with genius?"" But eventually, after running on for even longer than his 1988 convention address, one almost universally panned for its verbosity, Clinton's speech came to a close. And when Obama walked out to embrace him and then usher him off into the wings, the younger man set the stage for perhaps his last chance to change the Clinton-centric narrative that has been Democratic politics since 1992. Tonight in his address to the delegates in Charlotte and to viewers across America, Obama will have a chance to step up and truly become Bill Clinton's successor, rather than a supporting player living in his era, in his shadow. Clinton's speech was superb even served as it was without portion control. But it did not do what only Obama can do. It did not offer the current president's vision for the future. It did not offer new solutions to the new problems we face as a country. Clinton may have forcefully said we're better off now than we were four years ago, but Obama can and must say how we will be better off four years hence and how that will better position America for future growth beyond that. Clinton didn't do that and as an ex-president, he couldn't. (And mimicking Clinton-era policies won't work because many of them are outdated and frankly some, like financial deregulation, proved wrongheaded.) Romney has not done it either, his convention speech offering few ideas, no new ones and no specifics. Wrap-up: 5 lines that killed at the DNC . The country is at a watershed moment. It has only one president at a time and that man right now is Barack Obama. Starting with tonight's speech and continuing through this campaign and into a next term if he has one, by dint of creativity and vision or lack thereof, Obama will demonstrate whether he is a new force, not a secondary player, in modern history. Bill Clinton's speech reminded us of his place in history. Barack Obama's will help determine his. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Bill Clinton dazzled reverent audience that had eagerly awaited him .

"(CNN) -- The saga of Lance Armstrong raises a lot of unsettling questions about the culture of sports. A recent report garnered nearly 5,000 comments.

But others, such as LarryRollins, say they are no longer interested in watching the competition because ""they are all cheating"" and ""we might as well be watching robots pedal up mountains in France."" The 41-year-old cyclist's cancer fight helped focus attention on his Livestrong cancer charity and its iconic yellow bracelets, bringing even more dimension to the story.

"(CNN) -- At first glance, ""The Flat"" might seem like an episode of ""Hoarders,"" Israeli-style. The documentary film opens after an elderly woman dies in Tel Aviv. Her grandchildren assemble to clean out her apartment, packed with dusty books, vintage clothing (dozens of pairs of fancy gloves, for instance), enough purses to stock a department store, jewelry, mementoes and closets full of knickknacks. But buried among the detritus they chance upon something remarkable -- mysterious papers linking the grandparents to an important Nazi figure. How could such ardent Zionists, who left their native Germany in the early 1930s, have been involved with an SS official like Leopold von Mildenstein? ""The film developed as a detective story,"" says Israeli director Arnon Goldfinger, grandson of Gerda Tuchler, the woman who owned the flat. Of all his family members, only Goldfinger seemed driven to uncover the secrets of his family's past. The mystery . ""I discovered very strange newspapers in my grandparents' flat,"" he says. ""A newspaper with a swastika on it, Nazi newspaper, that turns out to be travelogues by a very famous Nazi writer (von Mildenstein) that describes a journey to Palestine. What I found out was this journey, the Nazi (von Mildenstein) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents,"" Goldfinger told CNN. It was a unique period in which, says Goldfinger, ""Nazis and Zionists shared the same aim: Both of them wanted the Jews to leave Germany and settle in Palestine."" The plot thickens . The mystery of the newspapers prompted Goldfinger to dig deeper. Additional documents, photos and letters pointed to only one conclusion -- Gerda and her husband Kurt were not simply acquainted with von Mildenstein and his wife -- they had become the warmest of friends. This became all the harder for Goldfinger to digest when he learned more about von Mildenstein: He was no mere travel writer, but the head of the Nazi's Jewish Affairs Department in the early 1930s. In that capacity von Mildenstein is said to have recruited an up-and-coming member of the party -- Adolf Eichmann. A twist in the tale . Goldfinger's investigation took him to Germany, where he tracked down von Mildenstein's daughter, Eda, who proved receptive to his efforts to shed light on their families' intersecting past. She helped him confirm something that may sound astonishing: After the war -- a conflict that claimed the lives of millions of Jews, including Gerda Tuchler's own mother -- Gerda and her husband remained friends with the von Mildensteins. This discovery left Goldfinger feeling irritated and angry, he told CNN, and forced him to revise the idealized view he held as a young boy of his grandparents. ""I think as a grandchild you are not really used to thinking about your grandparents as human beings,"" Goldfinger says. ""They're grandparents; they need to think about you!"" ""Then for five years I thought about their life, motivations and strangely -- even now they're gone, after their death -- I feel much closer to them. I saw them not just as the heroes I had imagined (during his childhood), but as human beings with very (conflicted) feelings inside. Now I can feel sorry for them. I can feel compassion and also anger. When you are finally feeling those complex emotions inside I think I become closer to my grandparents."" ""The Flat"" doesn't end there. Goldfinger continued to investigate, and what he found would confront him with an ethical dilemma. The tangled web . What became of Leopold von Mildenstein after the war? Like many ex-Nazis, he managed to re-enter civilian life (at one point he even sought assistance from Kurt Tuchler to ease his transition). He worked for Coca-Cola in West Germany, concealing the true extent of his pre-war activities. The secret of his real position within the Nazi hierarchy remained buried in East German archives, until Goldfinger uncovered it. Having destroyed the fiction von Mildenstein promoted -- that he had split with the Nazis before the war -- Goldfinger then faced a difficult decision: whether to share what he had learned with von Mildenstein's daughter, Eda. ""Morally I felt I had no alternative. I cannot say -- as my mother did in the film -- 'It's not our business.' (I decided) I must tell Eda what I know. I cannot anymore hide the secrets, so it was a very tough moment and very hard to understand how to do it."" Ultimate mysteries . ""My family was surprised when they first saw the film,"" Goldfinger told CNN. ""My siblings and especially my mother were not so interested in the history of my family, of our family,"" he says. The film touches on the ultimate and universal mysteries of identity, memory and family. Why was Goldfinger's mother so lacking in curiosity about her family's past? Why did Goldfinger feel compelled to investigate the family mystery while his siblings evinced so little interest? How and why did Eda shield herself from the truth about her Nazi father? For some mysteries there are answers. For others, alas, there are not.","Israeli director Arnon Goldfinger was shocked by what he found out about his grandparents .

"(CNN) -- Fiona Apple recently spent a night in a jail in Texas. She apparently was a little ticked off at the behavior of some of the folks who watched over her stay. The Grammy-winning singer told the audience at her next show about it, and videos of her harsh speech were posted on the web. The Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office must have gotten wind of it because its public information officer issued a sharp rebuttal Monday. Rusty Fleming even had some advice for Apple: ""Just shut up and sing."" Border Patrol agents arrested Apple after finding marijuana and hashish on her tour bus on Wednesday. Investigators found 0.010 pounds of marijuana and 0.010 pounds of hashish, a statement said. After she was released from jail, Apple did a concert in Houston where she launched into her critical remarks before her first song. ""Most of the people were very nice to me,"" she said. ""There are four of you out there, and I want you to know that I heard everything you did. I wrote it all down with your names and everything you did and said stupidly thinking I couldn't hear or see you."" Then it got interesting. Apple said she ripped the paper up, not before ""encoding"" the information and putting it in a ""lock box"" or a ""holding cell."" Another holding cell holds the decoder and Apple is the only one with the key, she said. She said the behavior of the four was inappropriate and likely illegal. Fleming said it was the official position of the sheriff's office that if she has a legal complaint she should call the state attorney general. ""We'll give her the number if she needs that,"" the release said. Apple told the Houston concertgoers that she was going to keep the information private unless ""you're interested in being a celebrity, I'll make you ... famous any time you ask,"" she said, referring to members of the sheriff's department. Fleming was not amused, it seems. ""First, Honey, I'm already more famous than you, I don't need your help. However, it would appear that you need mine. Two weeks ago nobody in the country cared about what you had to say. Now that you've been arrested it appears your entire career has been jump started. Don't worry, Sweetie, I won't bill you,"" he wrote. The sultry-voiced singer first shot to fame in 1997 with her hit single, ""Criminal,"" which earned her a Grammy Award for best female vocal rock performance. She is currently on tour promoting her new album and was scheduled to perform in New Orleans on Monday night. So far, no new videos on YouTube. More celeb arrests: Lindsay Lohan in trouble again .

"(CNN) -- An American Airlines executive's threats to discipline pilots over delays and file legal action against its pilots union may poison already heated contract negotiations, a union spokesman said Thursday. Earlier this week, American's management contacted the union to ask for talks on a new labor deal, according to the Allied Pilots Association. Then, on Wednesday, executive Denise Lynn wrote a letter to union leaders voicing concern about what she called ""mounting evidence that certain pilots are engaging in an unlawful, concerted effort to damage the company."" She cited a number of issues that caused delays, including ""unnecessary checks, increased and late-filed maintenance write-ups and ""slow taxiing."" ""I ask that you communicate immediately and unambiguously with your members that such work actions are unlawful and that any individuals engaging in such activities will be subject to both company and (union) discipline,"" Lynn wrote. If the union ""fails to comply with (its) legal duty"" to discipline those responsible, she added, ""we will have no choice but to seek appropriate injunctive relief."" Thomas Hoban, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, referred to the letter on Thursday. ""This kind of threat is not conducive to good-faith bargaining and will only further serve to enrage an already frustrated and angry pilot group,"" Hoban said. AMR, American's holding company, filed for bankruptcy in November. It has said the new working conditions imposed on the pilots, including greater use of flights by other airlines and more hours worked by the pilots, are necessary to be competitive with rival airlines such as Delta Air Lines, United Continental and US Airways, which have been through bankruptcy themselves in the past decade. The airline is also proposing to freeze or terminate the pilots' pension plan and has stopped making contributions to that pension fund. Earlier this month, American won bankruptcy court approval to throw out the pilots' labor agreement and impose new working conditions on its 8,000 active pilots. Pilots have already overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that was more beneficial to its members than the rules imposed by the airline. Since September 16, the airline has struggled. More than half its flights have been delayed, and more than 600 flights, or about 3% of its total schedule, have been canceled, according to flight tracking service FlightStats.com. As it did in Wednesday's letter, airline management has blamed the problems on pilots for filing what it claims are frivolous maintenance reports. Management also said there has been an increase in pilots calling in sick. The pilots union denies that there is an increase from historical norms in the number of pilots calling in sick. It also denies the maintenance reports being filed are for trivial items, saying they pose safety issues for the aircraft. But the union also says its members need to be more careful in strictly following rules given their contract situation. American spokesmen Bruce Hicks said earlier that management has always wanted to reach a consensus deal with the pilots as it did with its other unions, and told the union it was ready to talk even before the delays and cancellations started. ""Our desire to talk has nothing to do with the operational disruptions we're seeing,"" he said. CNN's Dave Alsup and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","American Airlines sends letter for its union saying pilots are hurting the company .

"(CNN) -- Without firing a shot, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has achieved remarkable results in his efforts to counter Iran's nuclear program. In little more than a year, the prime minister has managed to move the Iran nuclear issue to the top of the international agenda, to toughen sanctions, and in an extraordinary move, to push U.S. President Barack Obama to strengthen American policy so that preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons became the focus, rather than just containing Iran and its nuclear program. Indeed, if you throw in Republican challenger Mitt Romney's unwillingness to accept Iran even having the capacity to produce a nuke, Netanyahu's record is even better. But Israel's policy is approaching a point of diminishing returns. By stressing red lines it can't or won't enforce, Netanyahu threatens to overplay his hand, irritate a close ally and undermine Israel's own credibility. And here's why. News: Netanyahu asks U.N. to draw 'red line' on Iran's nuclear bomb plans . Club Red Line: Who else is going to join? The logic of getting a great many countries to sign on to some new line in the sand on paper might make sense. Since Israel can't or won't (yet) enforce its own new red line -- Iran is moving to enrich higher levels of uranium -- it will require others to join it to be effective. But this is a club few seem ready to join. Indeed, Israel's most important ally seems very reluctant to get locked into trip wires or red lines that might commit it to what Obama seems determined to try to avoid -- a military strike against Iran's nuclear sites. In fact, the cruel reality from Netanyahu's perspective is that with the exception of Israel's government, which sees a putative military strike as a war of necessity, everyone else -- without exception -- sees it as a war of discretion. Iran has no weapon. It hasn't tested one and doesn't have enough fissile material to produce one. Nobody is ready for Iraq War redux, least of all an American president who is running on extricating America from costly and unpredictable wars, not getting the United States into new ones. Undermining Deterrence . The more Israel talks about red lines, green lights and military options without actually acting, the more its credibility and deterrent capacity is undermined. Once a day and twice on Sunday, Israeli politicians are either talking or leaking why Israel is going to strike Iran. These war scares are becoming something of a joke, truly. One Israeli source told me that he was getting so tired of this Cry Wolf line that Israel ought to just hit the Iranians and get it over with already. You can only imagine the chuckling going on in Teheran. This past spring a war scare prompted a parade of senior U.S. officials to run to Israel to reassure their counterparts, then it was the ""October surprise"" scare that Israel would strike before the November elections. And now the prime minister has stated in his U.N. General Assembly speech that it wouldn't be until next spring, or at most by next summer, at current enrichment rates, that Iran will have finished the medium enrichment of nuclear fuel and move on to the final state, all but implying that Israel would probably not act until next year. You have to wonder why anyone would lay down red lines publicly if he can't credibly enforce them nor expect others to? If red lines are to deter war not facilitate it as the prime minister says, then Teheran would have to stop enriching uranium out of fear of an Israeli strike. But given the reality that Iran knows Israel is bluffing, figures it can absorb and even exploit an Israeli strike, and the U.S. and the international community don't want war, where's the urgency? In this case, there's very little reason for the mullahs to worry. News: Three things we learned from the U.N. General Assembly . Angering the President . Even without Iran to complicate it, the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is among the most dysfunctional in the history of the U.S.-Israel story. There's little sense of confidence and trust and a pronounced sense that each would like to close his eyes and make a wish that the other would disappear. Netanyahu thinks Obama is bloodless and cold when it comes to understanding Israel's fears and its security challenges; Obama thinks Netanyahu is a conman who thinks only of himself with little sense of respect or sensitivity for American interests. Indeed, one of the reasons Obama doesn't want to endorse Netanyahu's red lines is that it will make it harder for the Iranians to cut a deal, and that is still Obama's preferred option. The Iranian nuclear issue has actually made the relationship between the two leaders worse. By appearing to jam the president politically by questioning Obama's refusal publicly to accept red lines a month before an election, Netanyahu -- with a good deal of help from Romney -- has thrown the nuclear issue into the middle of the campaign. Only the interminably obtuse believe that Netanyahu wouldn't prefer his friend Romney to be the next president. The president's much publicized phone call today with Netanyahu (these calls are never touted this far in advance) may help to keep matters from getting worse. But the Netanyahu-Obama relationship could easily deteriorate, particularly if the president believes as he must that Netanyahu wants his rival to win. The only thing worse for Netanyahu than a re-elected Obama is an angry re-elected Obama. The smart play for Netanyahu would be to stop talking about Iran publicly at home and abroad, desist from creating the impression that he's pressing the president before the elections and start a quiet dialogue with the United States about how best to handle the period ahead. He should explore what assurances the Obama Administration is prepared to give Israel and other American allies in the Gulf and give the United States three months to get through the elections and the immediate aftermath of the vote. This might actually create a greater sense of confidence that Netanyahu was giving the Americans the benefit of the doubt and build up some currency in the bank which Israel will need if in fact it does decide it must go it alone against Iran in the spring. Another several months will not matter. Indeed, as former Israeli Military Intelligence Chief Amos Yadlin has said, the zone of immunity may be much less important than the zone of trust between the two allies. Whether through negotiations, diplomacy or war, the Americans and Israelis will need one another to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat. Red lines aren't the answer -- lines of trust and communication between two allies are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller: Israeli PM Netanyahu has scored some victories on Iran nuclear program .
But he says Netanyahu's new emphasis on drawing a red line is counterproductive .

"(CNN) -- It is possible, even likely, that the most important decision either President Obama or a President Romney would make in the next four years is whether to bomb Iran and its nuclear facilities. The debates were never likely to tell us much that would be useful about how either man would make that decision. No amount of stage presence or posturing can reveal the deepest recesses of the presidential mind -- the place where, especially in the age of mass destruction, decisions about going to war must be made. Of course, Obama or Romney will not be the first president to ponder a pre-emptive strike against a rising nuclear power. The first was Dwight Eisenhower. In late summer 1953, shortly after Eisenhower became president, the Soviets detonated their own crude H-bomb, code named Joe IV (after Stalin) by the Americans. About nine months earlier, the United States had set off its own first H-bomb, code named Mike -- 500 times more powerful than the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. ""I've never seen the president so concerned,"" the president's national security adviser, Robert Cutler, told the chief White House speech writer, Emmet Hughes, in early September. Cutler quoted Ike as muttering, ""My God, 10 of these things and ..."" The president didn't finish the sentence. The United States still had the capacity to knock out the Soviet Union with a massive first strike. But for how long? At a secret national security meeting on September 24, 1953, the president gathered his closest advisers and asked: Would it be morally wrong not to attack the Soviets before it was too late? ""The question could no longer be excluded,"" a note taker wrote, ""and it was the duty of the president and his advisers to find the best answer to it."" But while anyone could ask the question, in the end only the president could answer it. Opinion: Obama's foreign policy on trial . Eisenhower and his advisers ultimately decided not to strike first, disregarding the wishes of some -- such as the Strategic Air Command's Gen. Curtis LeMay -- who continued for many years to hope that Ike would unleash America's nuclear forces in a pre-emptive attack. Certainly, Eisenhower made very clear throughout the rest of his presidency that he was willing to use nuclear weapons to stop communist aggression, remaining purposefully vague about when or under what circumstances. Such haziness was entirely intentional. As a West Point cadet and as a young army officer, Eisenhower had been a great poker player. Indeed, he had to quit the game because he risked hurting his career by taking money from too many fellow officers. (He switched to bridge, at which he was also expert.) Always a good bluffer, as president he did the same with nuclear weapons. He used the threat of their use to get America out of Korea in 1953, and similarly threatened during crises in Vietnam in 1954, with Red China in the Formosa Straits in 1954-55 and again in 1958, during the Suez crisis in 1956 and in Berlin in 1958-59. Bergen: Romney endorses Obama's national security policies . Would he have actually used these weapons if push came to shove? He never told anyone -- not his wife or son or closest advisers. To do so, in a city with no permanent secrets, would make his threats less credible. Ike knew how to hold his cards, even if doing so hurt him politically. In 1958, when he was under tremendous pressure to build more missiles to catch up the Russians, which had just launched the first satellite, Sputnik, and seemed to be creating what the press and some Democrats were calling ""the missile gap,"" Ike seemed strangely passive. He knew that the CIA's spy plane, the U-2, had not found any Soviet ICBMs, but he wanted to keep the existence of the spy plane a secret. The president's bland public statements disappointed even his followers and gave rise to mutterings that he was too old (68) and playing too much golf (about 100 times a year). In the winter of 1958, Eisenhower was visited by the poet, Robert Frost, who gave him a book of his poems inscribed with the notation, ""The strong are saying nothing until they see."" Ike wrote a friend that Frost's words were his ""favorite maxim."" Eisenhower was accustomed to carrying great responsibility. In his breast pocket on D-Day, he carried a note he had written in case the landings failed. ""The responsibility is mine alone,"" it read. On his first day as president in 1953, Ike wrote in his diary, ""Plenty of worries and difficult problems. But such has been my portion for a long time."" Neither Obama nor Romney have Eisenhower's experience or credentials. But you can see just by looking at Obama's face that he has been forced to learn on the job. He or Romney will face greater tests. Both men have said that containment is not an option when it comes to Iran getting the bomb. Will either man strike first? Wait for Israel to strike first? Get ready to join a wider Middle East war? The strong are saying nothing until they see. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Evan Thomas .","Evan Thomas: Biggest decision for next president could be on bombing Iran's nuclear facilities .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York police officer, in an apparent accident, shot and killed a grocery store clerk early Friday as the man fled a robbery, authorities said. The case in the Bronx marked another deadly shooting involving police in recent weeks. Other high-profile incidents occurred around Midtown landmarks in broad daylight. in Friday's incident, police said three suspects entered the corner bodega around 2 a.m. and ordered Reynaldo Cuevas, 20, to lie on the floor as they took cash, lottery tickets, and cigarettes. One suspect pistol-whipped the night manager, who was there with Cuevas, before retreating to the back of the store after a look-out warned that officers had arrived, police said. Apparently sensing an opportunity to escape, Cuevas sprinted from the scene and collided at full speed with one of the responding officers, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said at a news conference. ""The two became entangled, at which point we believe the officer accidentally discharged his weapon,"" Kelly said. Cuevas, who was unarmed and was the nephew of the store's owner, was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital from a gunshot wound to his left shoulder, police said. The officer was not identified. The robbery was captured by surveillance cameras and shown at the news conference. New York police were involved in two high profile shootings last month. Nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds when police shot and killed an armed man outside the Empire State Building on August 24.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The coalition air effort to halt the Libyan government's attacks on civilians continued into Thursday for a sixth day, with an airstrike in the Tripoli suburb of Tajura, a government official said. On Wednesday night, the government reported that military and civilian locations in the neighborhood of Al-Jfara and in the Tagora district of the capital had been struck by ""crusading colonial"" bombardment. In response, Joint Task Force Operation Odyssey Dawn Lt. Cmdr. Jim Hoeft said in an e-mail to CNN, ""It is not likely that civilians were a part of any airstrike today."" He said coalition forces ""have been using all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Libya from the violence and killing inflicted upon them by Colonel Gadhafi."" An opposition activist in Tripoli accused state media of lying about civilian victims of the coalition airstrikes. For example, she said, she was accompanying a cousin to a hospital for medical care when she saw a TV producer asking some people to close their eyes and play dead and others to pretend they were wounded. Some of the ""wounded,"" she said, were soldiers in civilian garb. On Wednesday, government officials invited CNN and other journalists to visit a house in Tripoli that had been damaged in an air raid, but -- after driving around for more than half an hour -- were apparently unable to find it and so returned the journalists to their hotel. The drive revealed a city quieter than normal -- about half the stores were closed. People appeared apprehensive, anxious. Opponents of Gadhafi were afraid to speak publicly. In Ajdabiya, parts of the city fell to opposition forces even though Gadhafi's men, who had been pounding the area with artillery and heavy tank bombardments, retained control of the northern and western gates, opposition fighters and witnesses told CNN. A hospital staffer and opposition fighters said nine people were killed Wednesday in fighting near the northern gate. So far, the coalition has crippled the Libyan air force, and established a no-fly zone that spans Libya from east to west along its coastline, said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber. Hueber, the chief of staff for U.S. operations said Wednesday that coalition planes had flown 175 sorties over Libya -- 113 of them by U.S. planes. But the coalition had no indication that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was complying with a United Nations mandate to stop attacks against civilians. On Wednesday, troops loyal to Gadhafi terrorized residents of the besieged rebel-held city of Misrata. One witness said Gadhafi's forces had attacked the city's main hospital, where 400 people -- about half of them patients -- were located. The push began at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET), when ""heavy tanks for Gadhafi troops start attacking the hospital -- the bombs falling here 20 meters (66 feet) around us,"" said one person inside the hospital. He said two deaths had occurred ""around the hospital."" At one point, shelling occurred without respite for 40 minutes, he said. ""Now, fortunately, no more shelling, but the situation is so serious that all the teams here -- the doctors, the patients -- are paralyzed, scared."" He called for international intervention to protect the civilians inside the institution. ""Nobody can work here,"" he said. Ambulances were not able to leave the hospital, which had lost its electricity and was using generator power, he said. Coalition jets are using smart bombs to target mechanized forces and mobile surface-to-air missile sites and impede supply lines for their ""beans and bullets,"" Hueber said. The targets include Libya's premier 32nd Brigade, commanded by one of Gadhafi's sons and fully engaged in the fighting. ""It's an extremely complex and difficult environment,"" Hueber said about going after forces in populated areas. ""And our primary focus is to interdict those forces before they enter the city ... cut off their lines of communication and cut off their command and control,"" he said. ""There have been no reports of civilian casualties. Our mission here is to protect the civilian populace and we choose our targets and plan our actions with that as our top priority."" Wednesday night's outbreak of violence broke a respite that began earlier in the day with the coalition attacks -- the first calm in a week, Misrata residents reported. ""We would like to express our gratitude to the international community since there were airstrikes this morning,"" said Mohammed, an opposition spokesman in the city who would identify himself only by his first name. Gadhafi's forces had been stationed on the outskirts of the city, where they were providing support and supplies to loyalists fighting rebels in Misrata proper. Earlier in the day, grocery stores and other shops opened in the city, which is located two hours east of Tripoli and has been inaccessible to journalists. One person inside the hospital told CNN that five more people were killed in the last 24 hours, raising the death toll to at least 95 in the last seven days. A man who died Wednesday morning was shot by a sniper, the person said. Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis, a former interior minister who quit to lead opposition forces, said rebels have requested weapons from several nations to help the embattled city. ""Misrata is destroyed and they need weapons,"" Younis told CNN. ""We try to send them weapons, but of course they were all light weapons. There were no heavy weapons."" Asked about the situation in Misrata, Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes said, ""We're concerned about it, but I think you're actually seeing some indications that the effort of the coalition is ... focused on Misrata and is having an effect there."" The rapid advance of Libyan forces had been halted, particularly their move toward the nation's second-largest city, Benghazi, Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One. Libya's elite forces are drawn from tribes loyal to Gadhafi. Though they comprise no more than 10,000 men, those forces are on the offense, Hueber said. ""Those forces are fully-engaged in this conflict, that are attacking those civilian populations,"" he added. Though the rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago, the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge, a U.S. official said. They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition, are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively, the official said. Rhodes predicted the transition of command and control to another entity would be effected in ""a matter of days."" NATO will likely play a key role in the command and control, he said, adding that he would not describe the conflict as ""an open-ended war, a land invasion in Libya."" The international airstrikes against Libyan military positions began over the weekend after Gadhafi defied a United Nations-mandated cease-fire in attacks against civilians. The strikes are intended to help establish a no-fly zone. Sweden announced Wednesday it has frozen more than $1.53 billion in Libyan assets in response to EU sanctions imposed on the northern African country. France  launched the air campaign in Libya and Britain and the United States followed. Germany is not participating in the military action, though it agrees with the United Nations resolution in principle, and moved Wednesday to ensure that its ships were far removed from the Libyan campaign. A German navy spokesman said Wednesday that all German ships previously under NATO command in the Mediterranean Sea were reassigned to operate under national command and are returning to previously scheduled port stops in Europe to await further instructions. German crew members of NATO fighter jets were also under German command. Britain has announced an international meeting for next Tuesday to assess the situation in Libya. The war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians, prompting the international community to take action. However, a Johns Hopkins University professor said the coalition can achieve only so much through aerial strikes. ""We have to understand the limits of what air power can do,"" Fouad Ajami told CNN's ""AC360."" ""This is a recipe for a stalemate,"" he said. Criticism and questions persist about the international campaign, with no clear answer on who will take over command of the mission and what the exit strategy will be. U.S. President Barack Obama said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days, not weeks. NATO said Wednesday it will decide shortly what its role in the operation will be. A spokesman added the alliance is well prepared. ""This is the bread and butter of NATO,"" an official said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has voiced his opposition to NATO taking political leadership over the Libya campaign. He suggested that a commission composed of foreign ministers from the participating states play that role. Ajami, however, said the Arab world would welcome NATO involvement. ""They know that the calamity is unfolding in Libya, and they know that no help is going to come other than from the West and from the United States."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday that Kuwait and Jordan have agreed to provide logistical support to the Libyan effort. Jordanian government spokesman Taher Edwan told CNN that Jordan's role will be limited to a humanitarian one. ""Jordan did not and will not have any military participation in Libya, neither in planes or on the ground at all in Libya,"" he said. Qatar has already contributed planes to mission. The United Arab Emirates said Tuesday it will participate -- but only in providing humanitarian assistance. Toward that end, the country has sent a ship and two planes with basic relief supplies, the country's news agency said.

"(CNN) -- Top diplomats from Ecuador and the United Kingdom failed to reach an agreement Thursday over the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, but they agreed to meet again to discuss the issue. ""We still do not see, of course, an immediate solution, but we understand that there is a willingness to discuss the topic."" Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino told reporters after the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Ecuador granted Assange asylum in August, but he faces arrest in Britain if he leaves the South American country's embassy in London. On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague told Patino ""that the UK was under an obligation to extradite Mr. Assange to Sweden"" and that ""the concept of 'diplomatic asylum,' while well-established in Latin America, did not feature in UK law,"" a spokesman for his office said. For much of 2011 until June, Assange had been under house arrest in Britain while he filed appeals against his extradition from Britain to Sweden. Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Sweden has said it wants to question Assange on allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman there. Assange has denied the sex allegations, describing them as a ruse to get him to Sweden, which would then extradite him to the United States. Several U.S. officials have asserted that Assange violated the law by publishing in 2010 and 2011 a trove of classified war documents and diplomatic cables. Patino called on British authorities to reconsider the case, given Ecuador's granting of asylum and ""the right to not be extradited when politically motivated causes are involved."" The Ecuadorian Embassy is a sovereign space upon which authorities from other countries cannot encroach. But Patino told reporters Thursday that a key concern for Ecuador is that it is currently impossible for Assange ""to enjoy his condition of asylum"" while forced to stay inside the embassy. Ecuadorian authorities were also concerned about what would happen if Assange faced a medical emergency inside the embassy, Patino said. ""Both ministers agreed that they were committed to the search for a diplomatic solution to Mr. Assange's case,"" the UK foreign secretary's spokesman said. The founder of WikiLeaks delivered an impassioned appeal Wednesday for the U.S. government to end its actions against him, his website and those who support it. ""It is time for the United States to cease its persecution of WikiLeaks, to cease its persecution of our people and to cease its persecution of our alleged sources,"" Assange, speaking via satellite from London, told a packed conference room at the United Nations, where world leaders were attending the United Nations General Assembly. The event was held by the Mission of Ecuador on U.N. grounds, but was not officially sponsored by the world body. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Ecuadorian foreign minister: ""We still do not see, of course, an immediate solution""

"(CNN) -- The economy and global affairs will undoubtedly play key roles in the 2012 election, but many voters may also be watching for candidates' stances on more personal issues. CNN posed questions about several hot-button topics related to social issues, and Facebook users responded enthusiastically; some even got into feisty commenting debates. Health care, immigration and same-sex marriage were three of the most popular topics. The readers shared their thoughts via the I'm Voting app, which asks potential voters how the president should handle key issues. This project, in partnership with Facebook, aims to increase voter engagement ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Click through the gallery for a look at respondents' views, broken down by demographics gleaned from Facebook profiles. Party and age divisions showed more variation than in last week's look at foreign policy views. But when looking at gender groups, as in frame 2, the pie slices stayed remarkably consistent. 1. Health care . Question: Should Americans be required to have health insurance? Terence Madison: ""A heath care system that's for profit is BS. They are not there for you. It's about the board of directors and rather it's making money. To me, that's a dangerous system. If it weren't for the fact that federal law says that they must take you, only the rich would live long full lives. And it's that way now. Just not to the extreme it would be without that law. Health care should not be for money. It should be for the people."" Patrick Frankovich: ""Doctors wouldn't go to college if it weren't to earn a good living. Forced insurance is bull. If Obamacare is such a great thing, why are Congress and the president not covered by it?"" 2. Immigration . Question: Should states be able to enact tougher immigration laws than the federal government? Glenn Dickey: ""if the federal government won't enforce the existing laws, why not let the states control their own borders? After all, it is costing the states way too much to continue supporting undocumented immigrants and their families."" Maritza Cristina Nunez: ""We seem to forget our history and keep making the same mistake over and over again. During World War II, we sent hundreds of Japanese-Americans to concentration camps! Now we are doing the same to the undocumented immigrants, mainly the Latinos. I don't hear as much about the European Illegals. These undocumented aliens are the ones that make it possible for you and me to eat our vegetables. They do the jobs that we American deem beneath us. So please, instead of focusing on illegal immigrants, why don't we focus on repairing our economy? Let's put our priorities in order and remember that the immigrants were the ones that made this country great!"" 3. Same-sex marriage . Question: Should same-sex couples be able to marry? Eric Maisel-Smithey: ""Same-sex (couples) should be able to marry and get the same rights as everyone else, regardless of what state you live in, period. It does not matter what goes on in anyone's bedroom but your own."" Norman Copeland: ""Sorry, I don't care for the term same-sex marriage. As a Christian, I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the definition of marriage to me. I do believe that those so inclined should have a right to a civil union or partnership, whatever, but that is not a marriage. I have gay friends and family members that I love very much, but I just can't go there. Let them sign a contract or whatever and have the rights to health care and insurance, or to a divorce like the rest of us, LOL. Just leave marriage alone!"" Other questions posed on the app were about gun control, gun laws and abortion. Each of these questions received numerous comments. It's important to note that -- unlike in scientific polls -- anyone from the online audience could respond. A relatively large percentage of respondents in the Facebook surveys identified themselves as Democrats. The breakdown (as of Wednesday) was 54% Democratic, 21% Republican and 25% independent. Compare those numbers with a 2008 national exit poll showing 39% Democratic, 32% Republican and 29% independent. In 2010, the breakdown was 35% Democratic, 35% Republican and 29% independent. There are still plenty of questions waiting to be asked, so readers are encouraged to participate. Here's how it works: Users first declare their intention to vote and then answer a series of multiple-choice questions. They then can share their answers or compare responses with other Facebook users. Be sure to visit the app, where we'll be posting new questions through Election Day.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto has accused Islamabad of waging ""a typical disinformation campaign"" by saying it planned to lift longstanding corruption charges ahead of her planned return to Pakistan for upcoming elections. Benazir Bhutto says she plans to end her self-imposed exile and return to Pakistan on October 18. ""The charges have not been dropped against me,"" she told reporters Wednesday before a meeting of her Pakistan People's Party in London. ""This is just a typical disinformation campaign by the present regime."" She said the move has ""totally stalled"" talks on a power-sharing deal with Pakistan's President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Speaking on CNN Tuesday, minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad said a majority of Pakistan's Cabinet ministers agreed that the charges against Bhutto should be lifted, allowing her to participate in parliamentary elections scheduled for later this year or early next year. He said the decision came out of an emergency session called by Pakistan's Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and was expected to be finalized in the coming days. Following the announcement, Bhutto said she was inundated with hundreds of congratulatory calls but had heard nothing from Islamabad about the reported decision. ""I asked the Pakistan People's party president to ring up the presidency and see if it was correct,"" she said. ""They said it was not correct, even though it came from a Cabinet minister."" Bhutto said she still intends to end her self-imposed exile and return to Pakistan on October 18. Former prime minister Bhutto is walking a fine line between supporting Musharraf's regime by negotiating a power-sharing deal with him, and criticizing what she called a ""military dictatorship"" that she blamed for rigging the last elections that followed Musharraf's 1999 coup. She said the power-sharing talks are an effort ""to save democracy"" in Pakistan, but it has prompted criticism from other opposition leaders -- including her rival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who questioned, ""How can a democrat share power with a dictator?"" Sharif was swiftly sent back to Saudi Arabia last month when he tried to return to Pakistan after the top court lifted the exile order imposed against him following his ouster from power by Musharraf. Bhutto had previously demanded that Musharraf step down from his army post before seeking a third term as president -- something that she conceded will not happen before Saturday when Pakistan's parliament and four provincial assemblies are scheduled to choose a president. Musharraf has agreed to give up the army post after his expected re-election to the presidency, even naming a successor to head Pakistan's military on Tuesday. Bhutto indicated that she is prepared to continue negotiating a power-sharing deal with Musharraf, which could mean her return to the prime minister post. But she clarified her opposition party ""is not in the business of saving military dictatorships."" ""We want to save democracy and if General Musharraf's dictatorship can take the measures necessary to demonstrate that Pakistan is moving towards democracy, we have an understanding,"" Bhutto said. ""But unfortunately there are (three) days to the presidential elections ... and we don't have that movement."" Led by the two candidates vying to replace Musharraf as president, Pakistan's opposition is petitioning the country's Supreme Court to block Saturday's vote on the grounds that it is unconstitutional for a military officer to seek the presidency within two years of holding rank. In addition, they are arguing that Pakistan's constitution calls for an elected official to step down and wait a year before seeking a third term. Eighty-five Pakistani opposition lawmakers submitted their resignation Tuesday to protest Musharraf's bid for another term, which would begin on November 15. Over the weekend, Pakistan's election commission handed Musharraf a key victory, accepting his nomination to seek a third term. That decision prompted clashes between police and anti-Musharraf protesters. If the vote goes ahead on Saturday, Musharraf is expected to secure the more than 50 votes in parliament needed to secure a new mandate. Musharraf on Tuesday named Lt. Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani -- currently the head of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence agency -- to take his place as Pakistan's military chief. Musharraf did not announce when Kiyani will take over as army chief. The Pakistani leader has only said that he will abandon the post sometime before he takes the oath of office again, if lawmakers approve a fresh mandate on Saturday. The new five-year term will start on November 15. Arif Nizami, editor of the Pakistani daily, The Nation, said Kiyani is generally regarded as ""in the same mold as General Musharraf."" ""Musharraf has chosen a successor very carefully who will continue his policies and he will be as pro-western as General Musharraf is,"" Nizami told CNN International. However, he pointed out that ""once the army chief is there, he is his own man and you can't be 100 percent sure what kind of policies he'll pursue."" Musharraf led the 1999 coup as Pakistan's army chief, a position he has been reluctant to relinquish because his real power base resides in the military, not with the Pakistani people. Musharraf has seen his power erode since a failed effort earlier this year to fire the Supreme Court's chief justice. His administration is also struggling to contain a surge in Islamic militancy.

"(CNN) -- The eruption of a volcano in Guatemala was diminishing Friday, emergency officials said, though a heightened alert for the communities near the Volcan de Fuego remained in place. ""For the moment, all that are seen are weak and moderate explosions as well as flows of lava that also diminished in length,"" the government said on its website, citing the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. ""People are returning to their houses now that the activity has lowered,"" said David de Leon, a spokesman for CONRED Guatemala, which organizes disaster relief. But, he added, ""We tell them it might be necessary"" to leave again, should the volcano's activity spike. Though 35,000 people might theoretically have been affected by the columns of ash and smoke that rose from the ""Fire Volcano,"" only 5,000 live southwest of it, the direction that was threatened, he said. On Thursday night, only about 800 people sought refuge at the four shelters set up by the Red Cross, said a Red Cross spokesman, Vinicio Sarazua Santillan. ""Many of the people who were evacuated decided to go back to their houses, and others never left,"" he said. He predicted that the shelters would be empty Friday night ""if the volcano continues in tranquility."" Sarazua said that a number of people refused to evacuate out of fear that their belongings could be stolen. But, he said, as of Friday afternoon he had heard no reports of looting. De Leon said he also had heard no reports of looting. A government photo of Volcan de Fuego showed a massive wall of smoke that was lighter where it rose into the sky, and dark gray as it drifted. The average height of the column of smoke had decreased from about 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) to 700 meters, the agency said. Still, civil protection authorities kept in place the heightened ""orange"" alert. The volcano began spewing ash at 10 a.m. Thursday and was continuing to belch late in the afternoon near the country's former capital, Antigua, said Carmen Maria Caballero of the Guatemalan Red Cross. CNN iReporter Harby David Marroquin had been working at a nearby golf course when he saw nature's pyrotechnics and shot video on his iPhone. It showed white smoke pouring out of the top of the 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano. Listening to the volcano gives him peace of mind, Marroquin said. ""You feel an indescribable energy, and this time was no different."" Three people were treated at mobile health centers for respiratory problems, according to de Leon. Thursday's eruption marked the sixth -- and the strongest -- this year, Caballero said. ""It's a very active volcano,"" she added, but said that did not necessarily mean Thursday's eruption would last longer than others. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the volcano is one of Central America's most active. Is Yellowstone atop a supervolcano that can threaten Earth?

"(CNN) -- The chief of Houston's police department has asked the FBI to help investigate why an officer shot and killed a disabled man Saturday. Over the weekend, police said that the wheelchair-bound man was acting aggressively and had tried to stab an officer with a pen. ""The Houston Police Department places the highest value on human life and events like these are tragic and unfortunate for everyone involved,"" Chief Charles A. McClelland said in a press release Monday afternoon. ""All Houston Police Officers receive mandatory crisis intervention training specifically dealing with persons experiencing mental crisis. As we do in all instances of this nature, the Houston Police Department's Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions, and the Harris County District Attorneys Office, Civil Rights Division, are investigating this incident."" Police kill amputee in wheelchair at group home for the mentally ill . McClelland vowed to be ""open and transparent in all aspects of our response to this tragic event."" ""It is my desire to have everyone reserve judgment until all the facts and evidence in this investigation have been gathered,"" his statement read. On Saturday officers went to a group home for the mentally ill where Brian Claunch lived. A reported schizophrenic, Claunch was acting aggressively because his caretaker refused to give him a cigarette and a soda, according to police and the facility owner. Police said Claunch was clutching an object as he advanced on one of the police officers. ""The officers made verbal commands for the suspect to drop whatever he had in his hand, to stay still and to speak with the officers, but the suspect continued to make threats,"" Jodi Silva, a police spokeswoman, told CNN affiliate KTRK in Houston. Claunch trapped one officer with his wheelchair in the corner of a room ""where he couldn't get out,"" said a Houston police department representative who declined to be identified. As he advanced toward the officers, Claunch was ""refusing to show his hands,"" the representative said. The object turned out to be a pen, which Claunch attempted to stab the cornered officer with, according to police accounts reported in the media, including by KTRK. The other officer, Matt Marin, was ""in fear of the safety of his partner and the safety of himself,"" Silva said. Marin shot Claunch in the head, police said. On Sunday, the unidentified police representative offered more details, saying that, unlike his partner, Marin was not cornered at the time he opened fire. Claunch died at the scene, investigators. said . Marin has been placed on administrative leave per department policy, police said. The incident was the second shooting involving Marin. In October 2009, he shot and killed a knife-wielding man who stabbed his girlfriend and a neighbor, according to published reports at the time. Marin joined the Houston Police Department in 2007. Claunch had been at the Healing Hands group home for 18 months, owner John Garcia told KTRK. He lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. Houston police have not released the identity of the man, though Garcia identified him as Claunch. Garcia told the Houston Chronicle that Claunch liked to ""doodle,"" which may explain why he was holding a pen. Garcia reportedly said he had given Claunch a black felt pen for drawing. Garcia told the Chronicle he did not know if that was the pen Claunch was clutching when he was shot. Garcia said Claunch suffered from schizophrenia and a bipolar disorder. ""He had a temper. He could fly off once in awhile,"" he told CNN affiliate KHOU. Claunch was capable of flying into outrage and making people in the house feel threatened, even though he was confined to a wheelchair, Garcia said. ""Emotionally disturbed individuals, when threatened, are going to react, in most instances, excessively,"" Dr. Ed Reitman, a clinical psychologist, told KTRK. ""This was an incident that didn't have to take place if the individual -- a police officer -- had been trained in dealing with emotionally disturbed individuals.""

"(CNN) -- Buyout guys usually ""run the numbers"" on a takeover target before spending too much time on it. As takeovers go, the United States looks pretty good. Here's a tongue-in-cheek look at how a private equity executive might sum them up for a former private equity guy. To: Mitt Romney . Re: Project November . From: The Buyout Nation Team . The team has finished running the numbers on Project November and they look really strong. First, if we're successful in the upcoming auction (they call it an election), we will have bought in cheap and should make a killing since the economy is improving and is likely to do so for the next four years even if we don't do much after the takeover. Second, it looks like we have a lot, and I mean a lot, of room to increase sales. I've never seen a business with so much ability to raise prices. The customers (they call them taxpayers) have little opportunity to leave, by law they have to pay, and not many have the resources to take advantage of the tax-minimizing options in Switzerland and the Caymans. But the pricing structure is a total mess. While every other business charges premium customers more, since they have the cash and benefit most from the services, here it's backwards. A lot of the premium customers, the ones who've done really well for the last decade or two, actually pay the lowest rates! So raising prices on these guys should be a cinch. And we can also get some early revenue from one-time gimmicks like drilling a million gas wells, selling non-core assets (Guam?), sale-and-lease-backs on real estate (the Capitol?) and more aggressive corporate partnerships (Exxon-Yellowstone National Park?) Third, on the expense side things look equally promising. As Larry Summers first discovered, a lot of the value created in takeovers can come from promise breaking and we've got great opportunities to do that with Medicare and Social Security. Even better, our modeling shows that if we only break promises for younger people (say, under 54) they won't feel any real pain until after 2016 or 2020 when we'll already have exited the deal and been long gone. Another easy option is to cut expenses for the poor and for kids since it turns out that they can't vote (too young), don't vote (those new ID rules), or won't vote for you anyway. (By the way, where did you get that 47% from? Your overall figure feels about right but the team wants to double-check the calculation.) We also found big potential cost savings from outsourcing not just jobs but entire government departments to India. This may be an option for lower value-added departments like Housing and Urban Development, and Education. Another potential expense-cutting option is the military, but this seems a bit tricky given the whole military-industrial complex thing. But a takeover of the nation also presents some unique challenges compared with the smaller companies we usually target. First, if things get tight, we can't save cash by slashing long-term investments because it turns out that there aren't any. I know it's unbelievable, but there just isn't much money going into the stuff that will pay off big time for competitors in the long-run: education, public transport, bridges and infrastructure, and clean/green technology. Second, we're unlikely to make money by restructuring or refinancing the debt. It's already dirt-cheap (we could borrow for 30 years at 3%) and the experts I've spoken with are convinced that the nation really is too big to fail. I know you've been through a lot of tough restructurings, think the market should be allowed to work things out, and were willing to let the auto industry go to the wall. But I've pushed these guys hard and they remain adamant that if we get too close to that fiscal cliff, really bad stuff will start to happen: markets gyrating, interest rates rising, the dollar plunging, rating downgrades, you name it. While this type of chaos might actually be a boon to some of our hedge fund supporters, I really think we should try to avoid it. (And there's no guarantee that the guys running your blind trust will have had time to bet against America before things start to unravel.) Finally, I reviewed the nation's shareholders agreement and bylaws (they call it the Constitution) and it's a catastrophe. In fact, the bottom line is that even after we take control, there will be real limits on what we can do without the support of some really crazy people. People who don't appear to believe in arithmetic or science, let alone rationality and analysis. These guys are definitely not the McKinsey and Goldman types we're used to dealing with so it's going to be a total nightmare. It makes me wonder whether this whole thing is really worth the hassle. Where's the upside? Do we really have a special insight that makes us the natural owner or are we just willing to spend more than the competition to win? I'm a little bit worried that we may have a touch of deal fever for another trophy on the wall. Anyway, the model is ready so just send me your plan so I can finalize the assumptions about price hikes, expense reductions, investments and the like. I couldn't find a copy on the server and everything in the public domain is vague and contradictory.

"Washington (CNN) -- It was his breakout moment on the national political stage. ""(T)here's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America,"" a little-known Illinois state senator named Barack Obama declared as he gave the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. ""There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America."" Obama's rousing speech helped to introduce him to Democratic loyalists and lay the groundwork for his long-shot bid for the White House in 2008. With both parties set to hold their conventions in the next few weeks, the political world will be watching to see who, if anyone, breaks out to become the next rising Democratic or Republican star. Drama is rare in modern conventions . Will it be the high profile Cuban-American senator from Florida who was on Mitt Romney's vice presidential short list? Could the law professor-turned-consumer-rights-advocate-turned-Senate-candidate in Massachusetts break out? And what about the young, Latino mayor of San Antonio or the senator from Kentucky who is the son of Rep. Ron Paul? 'We need (a) Moses now because we're in the desert' Republican strategist Alex Castellanos says the next breakout GOP star should be a speaker who focuses not so much on policy but on vision, conviction, leadership, an orientation toward the future, and the establishment of an emotional connection with the audience. In other words, the next big GOP star must have what pundits frequently call ""the vision thing."" Rare opportunity for speakers at GOP convention . Castellanos, a CNN contributor who was also the chief media consultant for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, says the GOP is longing for someone who can paint a vision of a brighter future built on Republican principles -- someone who, in Castellanos' words, can compellingly deliver the message, ""Follow me. There's a better place."" ""We need (a) Moses now because we are in the desert,"" the GOP strategist says. ""We're stuck. We don't know where we're going."" REPUBLICANS . Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: Even though he already has a substantial national profile, Rubio is the best bet to have an Obama-like performance at the GOP convention, Castellanos says. Elected with support from the tea party movement, a Latino and a fluent Spanish speaker, Rubio is from an important battleground state and the son of immigrant parents. He seems tailor-made to help the GOP speak to the nation about a brighter future under Republican stewardship. ""He's the future of the party,"" Castellanos says. ""I'd keep an eye on him. ... He's the real thing. He has that gift."" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky: A fiscal conservative who is beloved by the tea party movement and the son of Ron Paul, Rand Paul also has potential to make a splash on the national stage, according to Castellanos. In particular, the freshman senator appeals to conservatives and libertarians who want to shrink the size, scope and power of the federal government. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire: Another tea party favorite from a battleground state, Ayotte was one of the few women believed to be on Romney's short list of vice presidential prospects. ""She has tremendous potential,"" Castellanos says, ""She could be your dark horse."" Congressional candidate Mia Love: Black, Mormon and fiscally conservative, Love is an unlikely candidate to be the new face of the Grand Old Party. But the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, is greatly loved by tea party activists and by conservative women. Love is running to represent Utah's 4th Congressional District. If elected, she'd be the first black Republican woman in Congress' lower chamber. Love is aware but resolute about her unique status in the GOP. ""There are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person,"" Love, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, told CNN in May. ""I'm not a victim, and I don't allow anybody to put me in a box."" 'Someone who can electrify the hall' Raw political talent is the first and most important criterion in picking a keynote speaker and doling out other prime-time speaking slots during a convention, according to Democratic strategist Paul Begala. ""You're looking for someone who can electrify the hall and speak to the people back home,"" says Begala, a CNN contributor. Begala also highlighted a speaker's ability to address important themes. ""I want someone who can stand up there and talk about the middle-class American dream and how that dream persists because of the Democratic Party,"" Begala says, adding that the November election could well be decided based on whom voters believe is doing the most to support the middle class. DEMOCRATS . Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren: The Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts would seem to be the perfect messenger to deliver her party's message about tackling income inequality. ""Nobody fought harder for Wall Street reform, the reform that is now law and protecting consumers all across the country, than Elizabeth,"" Obama said after Warren introduced him at a June campaign event. ""She has been a fierce advocate since before I knew her for the middle class, and she has been advocating on core issues that matter to families her entire career."" Begala says, ""What she has is, I think, a very deep sense of how real people are affected by the economy. She's not just talking about abstractions."" San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro: Castro has been tapped to give the keynote address at the Democratic convention. Although he isn't well-known nationally, fellow Texan Begala says the mayor is known back in the Lone Star State. ""Everybody's been talking about him for a while,"" Begala says of Castro's reputation in Texas. Castro is the first Latino to deliver the Democratic keynote, according to convention organizers. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper: Before the recent Colorado wildfires and the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, the state's Democratic governor was already one to watch. Hickenlooper is the highly regarded governor of a battleground state with a background as a small business owner. Colorado governor: Questions about Romney taxes 'almost visceral' California Attorney General Kamala Harris: California's chief law enforcement official is another one to watch, according to Begala. ""I've been really impressed with her,"" the Democratic strategist says, adding that Harris has the needed combination of raw political talent and substantive knowledge to become a figure on the national political scene.","President Barack Obama broke onto national political scene after 2004 convention speech .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A new government report says there are now more than three quarters of a million names on the U.S. government's terrorist ""watch list,"" raising concerns the list may be becoming too large. Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is concerned about the list's size. A Government Accountability Office study out Wednesday said the Terrorist Screening Center's watch list contained approximately 755,000 names. But because many potential suspects have multiple names or aliases on the list, investigators are not certain how many distinct individuals are actually represented. Officials at the Terrorist Screening Center told CNN in September that the number of individuals on the list is about 300,000. Sen. Joe Lieberman, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said the ""sheer size"" of the list raises concerns. Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said the list contains an even higher number of records than 755,000. ""It contained 158,000 names including aliases in July 2004,"" Lieberman said during a hearing on the list. ""That grew to 755,000 names by May of this year, and now stands at about 860,000 names just five months later. That's nearly a 500 percent increase in three years."" Timothy Sparapani, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Congress to tighten its oversight of the process ""before we all become suspects in the eyes of the Terrorist Screening Center."" Overall, the GAO -- the investigative arm of Congress -- credited the Terrorist Screening Center, which compiles the government's unified watch list, for making improvements in the system and providing a reliable single coordination point for terrorist screening data. But found the government ""has not finalized guidelines for using watch list records within (key segments of) the private sector."" The GAO report said government agencies had encountered individuals who were on the watch list about 53,000 times since the system was started in December 2003. That number includes repeat matches from the same individuals multiple times. Most of the hits did not result in arrests because of a lack of sufficient evidence of any terrorist or criminal activity. But Deputy Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Paul Rosensweig said that is only part of the picture. ""With our current security layers,we have prevented thousands of dangerous people from entering the United States, including individuals suspected of terrorism, murderers, rapists, drug smugglers and human traffickers,"" Rosensweig said. ""In fiscal year 2007, Customs and Border Patrol alone encountered 5,953 positive watch list matches."" Wednesday's report comes on the heels of a Justice Department inspector-general's report, which expressed concern about the quality of some of the data in the watch list, but noted continuing improvement in the system. Terrorist Screening Center Director Leonard Boyle expressed particular satisfaction with the recent execution of a multi-agency agreement, which he said ""provides a full and fair review of any watch list record that is the cause of an individual's complaint."" Lieberman and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said they were concerned about a report that a Mexican citizen with tuberculosis was able to cross the border into the U.S. more than 20 times without being stopped. Rosensweig attributed the problem to a complicated and unusual pattern in the man's name combined with inaccurate birth date information.

"(CNN) -- French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Friday that the government's newly unveiled spending plans for 2013 are a ""combat budget"" that will tackle debt and bring much needed growth to the nation. About 30 billion euros ($39 billion) in savings are needed to reach President Francois Hollande's ambitious target of lowering the deficit to 3% of gross domestic product by the end of 2013, from a forecast of 4.5% this year. A third of the savings will come from cuts to public spending, the president's office said, while an additional 10 billion euros will come from a tax on companies. The remainder will be raised through tax increases on high-earning individuals, including a 75% levy on incomes higher than 1 million euros ($1.26 million) and a new 45% tax bracket affecting 6.2 million households. However, nine out of 10 earners will not see income tax increases, the government said. The 2013 budget is viewed as a test of confidence for Hollande, who was elected in May on a pro-growth and anti-austerity platform, and his Socialist government. Addressing reporters after a meeting of ministers Friday morning, Ayrault sought to stress that the tough measures were necessary -- and that most of the burden would fall on those best able to pay. ""It's a combat budget to fight against a debt that only continues to increase and that rests on the shoulders of French taxpayers and generations to come,"" he said, adding that it was ""a courageous and responsible budget."" Ayrault said the French national debt had increased from 64% of GDP to more than 90% in five years -- and that's why the government's deficit reduction target must be met. ""The 3% is a realistic objective, it is an indispensable objective,"" he said. Ayrault also said that the budget, while cutting public spending, is one ""which made choices"" in favor of lower-wage earners. ""The working and middle classes have been exempted from the revenue tax. Nine households out of 10 ... will not be taxed further, this is the guarantee that we are giving to the French people,"" he said. Who is Francois Hollande? Speaking this month in front of the Cour des Comptes, a government financial body, Hollande said the reduction of public debt was going to be ""the most important effort in 30 years."" However, some economists, including those at Citigroup, anticipate that the government's deficit reduction target will be missed, with Citi forecasting a deficit for the year of 3.7% of GDP. Political analyst Christian Malard, of broadcaster France 3, told CNN that the French public was also skeptical about the government's ability to reduce the deficit without raising taxes more widely. ""A majority of the French know that 2013 is going to be for them a very terrible year,"" he said, citing tax hikes, continued high unemployment and difficult times for entrepreneurs as among the challenges they face. ""The French are very aware of the fact that everyone will have to pay."" The government's move to raise an extra 10 billion euros from taxes on businesses could further stifle growth and force companies to move overseas, Malard said. Many people in France now fear that France could join other southern European nations such as Spain, Greece and Italy, whose ailing economies have prompted wider fears about the stability of the eurozone group of nations, he added. As the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe, France is a major concern to global investors. It's also the United States' third-largest trading partner in Europe, after Germany and the United Kingdom, the U.S. State Department says. Analysts had predicted that Hollande would have to present a harsher budget than first expected because of fears that otherwise, France's cost of borrowing will spike, and any savings made will have to be spent on increased interest payments. Since his election in May, the French president has been under growing pressure to reduce the national debt, boost growth and create new jobs, while seeking to avoid angering the public with big cuts in public spending. But his popularity has already taken a knock since he beat the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, to the top job. A survey conducted by polling firm IFOP for the Journal du Dimanche last Sunday suggested that four months into his presidency, only 43% of French people are satisfied with Hollande. This was an 11% drop in his satisfaction rating, compared with August. The figure represents one of the worst popularity plunges for a French leader in decades, the newspaper said. By comparison, Sarkozy's satisfaction rating at the same point in his presidency, surveyed by IFOP in September 2007, was 61%, Le Monde reports. Hollande acts over wealth tax crisis . Figures released Friday by the country's national statistics institute reveal zero growth in France in the second quarter of 2012, compared with the first quarter, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reports. However, individual spending power increased slightly over the same period, after several quarters of decline. Speaking Thursday on public television station France 2, Ayrault said that the government was aware of the gravity of its mission and that it has a long-term plan for the country's future. The prime minister defended the government's forecast 0.8% growth rate for 2013 as ""realistic,"" rejecting doubts about the figure as ""defeatist."" He also said it was important to set ambitious targets to tackle rising unemployment. The country's unemployment rate stood at 10.2% at the end of June this year, according to the national statistics institute. France's budget announcement comes against a backdrop of unease in the 17-nation eurozone, where many governments are plagued by high debt and low growth. Neighboring Spain announced its own budget Thursday, outlining new spending cuts, tax increases and structural adjustments aimed at bringing down its huge deficit. The government's efforts have proved unpopular with many Spaniards, who have taken to the streets in large numbers to demonstrate against austerity measures. Spain's next crisis: regional splits?

"GAINESVILLE, Florida (CNN)  -- It has been 48 hours since college student Andrew Meyer was stunned with a Taser during a forum with Sen. John Kerry, and some students are still in shock over what happened. University of Florida student Dayron Leon took this photo of Tuesday's student protest. But other students at the University of Florida are already tired of hearing about it. While about 350 students protested the incident Tuesday, the opinions on campus seem to be evenly divided over whether the officers acted properly. On the popular online networking Web site Facebook.com, students from around the nation have already created more than 80 groups discussing what happened Monday. Even among those groups, the count is almost split between the number who oppose the police's action and those who support their decision. ""I was pretty horrified by what happened. I was shocked that the people we are supposed to trust would turn against us,"" said Vanessa Wood, a freshman who is majoring in psychology. This is what I saw at the Kerry forum on Monday: Meyer, a 21-year-old telecommunications major, jumped up to the microphone already flanked by University Police. He interrupted another student's question, and although Kerry had earlier said he was taking no more questions, he told Meyer he'd take his comments next. Kerry asked the police to allow Meyer to speak. When it was his turn, Meyer first asked about the 2004 presidential election and followed with statements about whether President Bush should be impeached. At that moment the microphone was turned off and police began to take Meyer out of the auditorium. Meyer then started to struggle with the officers. As they pulled him toward the exit, Meyer broke free and tried to get away. At that point, six officers tackled Meyer to the ground and told him to roll over. He continued to yell for help and a female officer warned Meyer if he did not stop he would be Tased. He kept yelling and one of the other officers gave the order to Tase him. The audience remained seated and watching the confrontation until they heard the loud zap of the Taser. Then several people at the event started yelling at the officers. ""I was startled by the noise, considering what was happening in front of me. And after they Tasered him there was a stench that was not overpowering but it was unsettling,"" said Ben Omar, a University of Florida graduate student. The videotape of Meyer screaming as he was shocked quickly got the attention of news services and became a YouTube hit. Campus rumors now circulate that Meyer, known as being a prankster, was simply trying to be obnoxious and get attention at the Kerry speech. Meyer spent a night in jail on charges of disturbing the peace and resisting an officer. Later, the school's president, Bernard Machen, said two police officers involved were placed on administrative leave. Since the incident, Meyer has kept a low profile. But other students haven't been so quiet, with Tuesday's rally protesting what the students' claimed was a case of police brutality and another rally being planned. ""I am glad that we are starting a civil discourse debate, because this is a subject that needs to be addressed,"" Omar said.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- ""Voluntourism is not about martyrdom,"" says Christopher Hill, CEO of Hands Up Holidays, a London-based company that arranges high-end excursions that incorporate volunteering. ""It's about making a difference, even if you're staying at a luxury hotel."" A visitor traveling with Micato Safaris meets a group of young Kenyans in Nairobi. With a growing number of hotels and tour operators offering trips that give back, the experience is more accessible than ever -- from stints building houses with Hands On New Orleans and four-week HIV awareness programs in Thailand with the Global Services Corps to helping orphaned children in Kenya with Micato Safaris. But the key to a successful volunteer vacation involves a few basic considerations: What kind of an impact are you looking to have? How will the project you choose benefit the local community? (The latter is of particular concern, since less reputable charities and companies that overstate responsible-travel claims are all too common.) ""The most efficient and reputable organizations are those whose ultimate goal is to help communities work independently,"" says Brian Mullis, president of Sustainable Travel International, in Boulder, Colorado. Travelers who would prefer a relatively simple, low-key project, such as conducting a wildlife survey in Costa Rica, can opt for a hotel program. For a longer trip that involves daily contact with locals, a tour operator or nonprofit may be your best bet. To help you decide where to start, we've outlined what to watch for, and how to continue to make an impact after you return home. Travel + Leisure: 10 tips for traveling green . Hotels and travel companies with outreach programs . If you'd rather devote only part of your vacation to a cause, there are other, less demanding ways to give. Check out the many philanthropic programs offered by hotels (both high-end and chain brands) and travel companies, including opportunities for guests to volunteer. According to the International Ecotourism Society, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, more than 66 percent of American travelers believe that hotels have an obligation to protect the environment and support local communities. The concept isn't entirely new -- eco-lodge Lapa Rios in Costa Rica, for example, has offered travelers the chance to volunteer for almost a decade. Travel + Leisure: Best new green hotels . Ritz-Carlton recently launched Give Back Getaways (givebackgetaways.com), a program that invites guests at 62 properties to help with projects ranging from research at Dubai's Hutta Dam to river cleanups. Fairmont (fairmont.com/environment) and RockResorts (giveandgetaway.com) have also instituted outreach programs at properties worldwide. Booking advice: . • Make sure the fees fall into the right pockets when a trip requires that you pay to volunteer. Before signing up, ask your hotel what percentage of your money goes directly to the local community (rather than to the hotel's balance sheet). • Many hotels will exchange philanthropic work for reduced room rates; on select dates, for example, the RockResorts in Colorado offer discounts to guests who volunteer at national forests within the state. Responsible tour operators . Unlike hotels, travel companies have no universal third-party eco-certification. As a result, a tour operator might offset 100 percent of its carbon emissions for clients' airline travel, but place them in a lodge that dumps untreated wastewater into local rivers. To assess how responsible a company actually is, Martha Honey, cofounder of the Center on Ecotourism and Sustainable Development in Washington, D.C., suggests starting with some simple questions: What are the company's environmental practices? Does it give a portion of its profits to charity? (New York-based Micato Safaris, for instance, pays the administrative costs of its nonprofit AmericaShare, so 100 percent of donations made go directly to the community.) What kinds of projects do they fund? What does the company do to help guests understand local development and conservation issues? Also, look at online message boards, such as Lonely Planet's Thorn Tree Travel Forum (lonelyplanet.com/thorntree) and tripadvisor.com, for trip reviews. Or vet potential operators at Sustainable Travel International (sustainabletravelinternational.org), Responsible Travel (responsibletravel.com), travelphilanthropy.org and Orbitz's multipurpose green site, eco.orbitz.com. Finally, consider checking bona fides with a third-party auditor such as Green Globe (greenglobe21.com) or Green Leaf (greenleaf.org). Booking advice: . • Smaller tour groups and hotels (think 20 versus 100 people, and boutique hotels versus megaresorts) have a lower ecological impact. Reputable charities . After returning from a vacation, you may be moved to continue to help fund a project in the destination you've visited. If you're not careful, however, your money may not end up in the right place. Vet the charity through watchdog groups such as charitynavigator.org, BBB Wise Giving Alliance (give.org) and the American Institute of Philanthropy (charitywatch.org). These organizations rate nonprofits based on such factors as availability of financial and operational information to the public, efficiency of fund-raising activities and how donations are spent. Many international aid organizations have regional or national partners that can use your support -- UNICEF, for example, allies itself with a number of local NGO's in destinations in the Pacific Islands, Africa and South America. Also, consider charities that will allow you to make targeted donations. At globalgiving.org, travelers can search for projects by area, while kiva.org enables individuals to make microfinance loans in communities around the world. Targeting your donation: . • Rather than giving a small amount to each of several charities, donate to one or two organizations to ensure the highest impact. • Ask whether your tour company or hotel has a practice of contributing to local causes. Abercrombie & Kent (abercrombiekent.com), Six Senses (sixsenses.com), CC Africa (ccafrica.com), Intrepid Travel (intrepidtravel.com) and Lindblad Expeditions (expeditions.com) all sponsor nonprofits that work in destinations abroad.

"(CNN) -- Who says we can't strike a balance between energy exploration and wildlife protection? For years, a false either/or argument has stalled progress in Washington on energy development. But now we have a chance to both develop and protect one of our nation's natural treasures. Lying west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and roughly the size of Indiana, the nearly 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska supports a stunning diversity and abundance of wildlife considered globally significant by scientists. The region also contains hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. Given today's polarized politics, is it possible to protect these lands while tapping their resources? Emphatically yes. For proof, look no farther than the August 13 announcement by U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar of a strategic plan that provides a responsible and equitable approach to managing the reserve. Opinion: Next global warming worry: Thawing tundra . The new guidelines would make 11.8 million acres -- roughly half the reserve -- available for oil and gas leasing, while protecting important wildlife and waterfowl habitat in the remaining half. As Salazar said, the plan ""will provide a road map to help facilitate the transition from leasing and cautious exploration to production and smart development"" and ""builds on efforts to help companies develop the infrastructure that's needed to bring supplies online."" This plan is great news for the caribou, grizzly bears, wolves and dense populations of peregrine falcons, golden eagles and other nesting raptors that live and breed on these lands. The offshore and coastal areas also provide important habitats for seals, beluga whales and polar bears. The Teshekpuk Lake area is one of the most important goose molting habitats in the circumpolar Arctic, used by tens of thousands of Pacific brant, white-fronted, snow and Canada geese. Rare yellow-billed loons, spectacled eiders and millions of other migratory birds from the Pacific, Central, Mississippi and Atlantic flyways, and from as far away as South America, journey each year to the wetlands, ponds, lakes, streams and rivers on the reserve's coastal plain. The region has also sustained Alaska Native communities for thousands of years. The reserve was originally established by President Warren G. Harding in 1923 when the U.S. Navy was converting its fleet from coal to oil, and has been managed by the Bureau of Land Management since 1976. Opinion: Why we should look to the arctic . Although this spectacular area was set aside as a ""petroleum reserve,"" the secretary of interior was given the legal authority and responsibility to ensure the protection of the environmental, fish and wildlife, and historical or scenic values there. About 1.5 million acres is already leased for oil and gas development. Salazar has publicly committed to pursuing a policy of accelerated development by offering annual lease sales in the reserve, the next in November, while also protecting ecologically important and sensitive areas. Beyond protecting these irreplaceable lands, this plan demonstrates that energy and environmental policy need not be in conflict. We see this balanced, responsible approach unfolding around the world, from the protection of the vast Canadian Boreal forest to the creation of the Coral Sea marine reserve off the coast of Australia, both of which preserve critical but fragile resources while strengthening standards for sustainable use. But this way of thinking is not really new. It harkens back to President Theodore Roosevelt's vision for sustainable and achievable conservation to protect the environment while still enjoying the economic benefits of our natural resources. The proposed National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska plan is an important step in the right direction for all Americans, including Alaska natives, sportsmen and other conservationists who want to balance energy exploration with wildlife protection. But it's not a done deal; a final decision is expected in December. By dropping the old debate, Washington can demonstrate that a new era of compromise over conflict is possible. Instead of either/or, this is a win-win. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Rebecca Rimel, Dale Hall: National Petroleum Reserve has abundant wildlife and oil .

"(CNN) -- Former naval aviator Bob Besal was just 24 when his life literally took a dive. Besal was piloting a Vought A-7C on a training mission 20 miles east of St. Augustine, Florida, more than 37 years ago when his light attack aircraft collided with another plane at 15,000 feet, sending his jet spiraling into the Atlantic. Besal ejected safely from the cockpit; his plane sank to the bottom of the ocean. The other plane limped back to base. This month, Besal's past caught up with the present as divers found his wreckage, and the story can now be written about the people who recently found it and Besal's reaction. See photos of the wreckage . It was mid-morning on December 2, the first Monday after Thanksgiving in 1974. Lt. (j.g.) Besal and three other A-7 Corsair II pilots had taken off from Cecil Field Naval Air Station about 10 miles from Jacksonville. They were rolling their aircraft and doing simulated bombing runs. He estimates they were flying at 300 to 350 knots (345 to 402 mph). By his own admission, Besal said he got too close to the plane piloted by his commanding officer, Cmdr. Peter Schoeffel, a former Vietnam POW. ""The event is burned in my brain,"" Besal, 62, a retired rear admiral who served 30 years in the Navy, said by phone this week from Charleston, South Carolina, where he now teaches aviation maintenance technology at Trident Technical College. ""It was gray and rainy, not a nice day to be sitting in the ocean,"" laughed Besal in an obvious understatement. ""I was literally bobbing like a cork in a tiny raft."" Besal remembers ejecting and free-falling for a couple thousand feet before his parachute opened automatically. He said he was floating in water with an air temperature of about 40 degrees ""shooting off pencil flares"" to get the attention of a nearby helicopter. ""Absolutely unbelievable,"" he said thinking back after he was pulled to safety. A newspaper article at the time from the Florida Times-Union reported, ""The helicopter was operating in the area on a routine water indoctrination flight."" As luck would have it, that helicopter crew was trained in search and rescue. An accident investigation board was convened by the Navy to determine the cause of the collision, but Besal knew who was to blame. ""Pilot error. It was entirely my fault,"" he said humbly. ""Truthfully, I got a little disoriented. I thought 'Oh my God,' it would be close. The planes were in a climb. I heard a huge bang. My airplane almost immediately went out of control, lost hydraulics."" The vertical tail of his jet was broken off. Besal, the oldest of nine siblings, said he never really focused on what happened to his plane once he saw it disappear below the clouds, but over the years, he's never forgotten. ""The memories have never left,"" he reflected. It's likely not something Joe Kistel is ever going to forget either. Kistel, who at 31 is half the age of Besal, is the man who found Besal's plane by accident this month. Kistel is the executive director of TISIRI (Think It Sink It Reef It), a Jacksonville-based company in the business of building artificial reefs and environmental conservation. Kistel and his team of divers -- Larry Davis, Ed Kalakauskis and Nate Tucei -- were mapping the sea floor 20 miles off the coast of St. Augustine, when they spotted wreckage 80 feet down in the Atlantic Ocean. Bringing closure to relatives of those killed in 1952 Alaska crash . They took photos and launched their own investigation in hopes of identifying the aircraft. ""By a stroke of luck,"" Kistel said, he found a key part. It was what appeared to be a small flat part riveted to another piece. He brought it to the surface, removed years of growth and discovered a data plate. TISIRI supporter Steve Blalock used the documentation to identify the aircraft and find Besal. ""It's a great feeling. This endeavor was very much worthwhile. Much effort was spent on searching the actual site and researching with no promise of finding any results,"" Kistel said. ""Due to much luck and perhaps insistence, we were able to locate the right components that lead us to the identification. To actually be able to solve the riddle of this aircraft wreckage is quite gratifying."" For Besal, who went on to earn two Distinguished Flying Cross awards and the Bronze Star in Desert Storm and whose career included duty as commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS America, the collision nearly four decades ago and the recent discovery of his plane have brought back memories and another opportunity for a teachable moment. ""I was fortunate to grow up in a Navy system that accommodated some human error,"" Besal reflected. ""I had a lot of people that gave me another chance. I was blessed.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Frances Lewine, who covered the White House for The Associated Press during six presidential administrations and spent nearly three decades as a CNN editor and producer, died Saturday of an apparent stroke. She was 86. Frances Lewine holds two winning tickets in August 2007 at Charles Town Races in West Virginia. Lewine was regarded as a trailblazer who battled for women's rights in journalism, fighting to open the National Press Club and the Gridiron Club -- a Washington journalists' organization -- to women. ""It's amazing that at her age, Fran was still staking out administration and elected officials after weekend talk shows,"" CNN Washington Bureau Chief David Bohrman said. ""All of journalism has lost a true pioneer."" Lewine was assigned to the White House in 1956 to cover the activities of first ladies and the Washington social scene. But in 1965 she became the AP's first full-time female White House correspondent.  Take a look at Lewine's career » . In 1977 she left AP to join the administration of President Jimmy Carter, and became the Department of Transportation's deputy director of public affairs. When Carter left office in 1981, Lewine moved to the newly created Cable News Network -- at age 60 -- as an assignment producer and field producer. ""When President Reagan was shot, I walked over to CNN that day and asked to help,"" Lewine said in a 2005 article in a newsletter for Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. ""My claim to fame was, I found out what type of gun was used. They paid me $80 for my work."" Sunday would have been Lewine's 87th birthday, co-workers said. She had been recovering from surgery, but was expected to return to the office as soon as this week. ""I don't understand people who quit,"" Lewine said in the newsletter article. ""We have the best jobs in the world. I have a front-row seat to history. What are you going to do that's possibly better than this?"" Lewine was born in 1921 in New York and grew up in Far Rockaway. She graduated from New York's Hunter College, where she edited the college newspaper and worked as a reporter for the Plainfield, New Jersey, Courier-News before moving to the Newark AP bureau. Lewine wrote that she began covering the White House full time ""with the arrival of the glamorous young Kennedys"" and recalled that her working attire often was an evening dress. She accompanied the family to Vienna, Paris, and Rome and followed first lady Jacqueline Kennedy on a vacation trip to India and Pakistan, as well as two yachting excursions in the Mediterranean. On one of those trips, the first lady's staff attempted to keep reporters in Athens, Greece, Lewine recalled. But she and several other journalists on a rented yacht followed her from island to island and, ""much to the anger of the White House,"" kept track of the first lady's activities by listening in on ship-to-shore radio. Lewine's wrote that she was often frustrated at being ""relegated to social and family stories and sidebars while male colleagues covered the president."" She wrote that it was a ""source of disappointment and anger"" that the AP never considered her an equal to male White House colleagues. That anger, she wrote, energized her ""to become a leader in the movement of women journalists in the 1950s, '60s and '70s to protest discrimination against women in their jobs and assignments."" To protest the Gridiron Club's policy against women, Lewine founded the ""Counter-Gridiron."" A group of women reporters and sympathetic male reporters met regularly at her home to organize protests, she recalled. Eventually, she was the second woman invited to join the Gridiron. Lewine was one of six plaintiffs in a sex-discrimination suit filed against the AP, which was settled out of court for $2 million and changed the news organization's policies. Lewine was also a member of the National Press Club, Executive Women in Government and the Society of Professional Journalists. She was elected to the Washington Society of Professional Journalists' Hall of Fame and to the Hunter College Hall of Fame. Last year, she was awarded the Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism, the highest honor bestowed by the Missouri School of Journalism. ""In times like these, when the credibility of our nation and our president often comes into question, it is the reporter on the scene that can raise issues and put the spotlight on problems so the nation can address them,"" she said in her acceptance speech. ""Reporters should understand that they have an obligation to search for the truth and to stand in the front line in holding governments and officials accountable for their actions.""

"(CNN) -- It's J.K. Rowling's first foray into fiction for adults. And thanks to her Harry Potter fame, her new novel, ""The Casual Vacancy,"" is already a best-seller, even before its release Thursday. But some parents worry that their children might expect another adventure at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which this book is not. ""I'm dying to read 'The Casual Vacancy,' "" said Kacy Faulconer, a 40-year-old mother of four kids ages 5 through 15. ""But I'll have to read it first before I decide whether my kids can read it."" Faulconer writes about books and parenting on her blog, ""Every Day I Write the Book."" But even if she decides to let her kids to read ""The Casual Vacancy,"" she isn't sure they'll want to. ""Frankly, even though we are huge Harry Potter fans, I'm not sure they'll be that interested since it doesn't take place at Hogwarts."" Four hot reads for fall . Harry Potter is certainly a tough act to follow. The seven-book series sold more than 450 million copies and spawned a multibillion-dollar film franchise. ""The Casual Vacancy"" is set in an English town rocked by the death of a parish councilman. Publisher Little, Brown and Company asks in a statement, ""Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity, and unexpected revelations?"" According to reports by the select few who have actually read ""The Casual Vacancy,"" the new book includes real-world problems such as poverty and drug addiction. Opinion: J.K. Rowling shows why muggles obsessed with class . To make sure that children don't stumble into a disturbing story, Cindy Hudson, author of ""Book by Book: The Complete Guide to Creating Mother-Daughter Book Clubs,"" suggests that parents read the novel alongside them. ""The best thing is to just pick it up and read it at the same time,"" Hudson said. ""It gives the parents a chance to talk about some of the issues that come up."" Social class, swearing and sex permeate Rowling's first adult book . ""The Casual Vacancy"" is under a strict embargo until its release. But the novel has been at or near the top of Amazon's best-selling book list for the past several weeks -- even though it doesn't come out until Thursday. Sara Nelson, editorial director of books and Kindle e-readers at Amazon, isn't surprised. ""She is a beloved author,"" she said. ""Her books are always best-sellers."" She also points out that Rowling's fans span a range of ages. Many Harry Potter enthusiasts are adults, although the books were intended for the younger set. Will J.K. Rowling net wizard profits from switch to crime? And of course, many readers who were children when the series appeared have come of age along with Rowling's narratives. The first book in the Harry Potter saga came out more than 10 years ago. Many who hopped on board the Hogwarts Express for the first time in the late 1990s are now old enough to drive -- and handle adult themes in the books they read. ""I think a lot of her audience has grown up,"" said Christina DiRusso, a 23-year-old from the New York area who reckons she first happened upon Harry Potter at the age of 9. She has read every book in the series and seen every movie. While she was growing up, she even shared them with her four younger siblings. DiRusso says she might read ""The Casual Vacancy"" because of Rowling's name: ""I'm a huge fan of hers."" Barnes & Noble is counting on that fan loyalty. Bookstores have been heralding the arrival of ""The Casual Vacancy"" for several months. Signs featuring Rowling's picture advertise the book's release date and offer pre-sales. Patricia Bostelman, vice president of marketing for Barnes and Noble, said, ""The book is being positioned in our stores as one of the major books through the fall and the holidays.""

"(CNN) -- Washington gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna looks to help Republicans cross an important threshold while expanding their power at the top of state government nationally. McKenna is locked in a competitive race in a state that hasn't had a Republican governor in nearly 30 years. It's just one example of how the party is leveraging trends and strengthening its hand in a number of ways in state races across the country. If projections bear out and they grab four seats in addition to retaining the three they are defending, Republicans could hold the governorships of 30 states after Election Day, the most for them in nearly half a century. Such an advantage would fortify their positions against Democratic policies, like ""Obamacare,"" tax increases and government spending and give them enormous influence in Washington -- even if Mitt Romney doesn't win the White House. ""It does help Republicans policy wise if one party controls the majority of governorships,"" said Cook Political Report Senior Editor Jennifer Duffy. 2012 ballot initiatives: Voter-run or special interest-hijacked? While the presidential campaign impacts state-wide candidates -- especially for increasing voter turnout -- races for governor can turn on more parochial issues. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Washington state. McKenna has deep roots in King County, the state's most populous. He is a former county councilman and has run and won statewide previously. His Democratic opponent, former U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, is mostly experienced in congressional races. But McKenna is tapping a sense of voter discontent with a string of Democrats, whose margin of support has been slim over the years. ""They've had Democratic governors since 1984 and there's a sense that voters are unhappy that despite promises, these governors haven't been able to change things,"" Duffy said, pointing out problems with education and the economy in the state. A recent Elway Poll of likely voters showed McKenna with a 47% to 45% lead over Inslee, which was within the survey's margin of error. While the fight remains tight in Washington state, Democrats might have to throw in the towel in North Carolina. The Tar Heel State elected its first woman governor in Democrat Beverly Perdue in 2008 but she is retiring amid a campaign finance investigation. Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory could become the first Republican governor since 1985 and only the third since 1901. He leads comfortably in the polls against Democrat Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton. ""More than the investigation,"" Duffy said of Perdue, ""you've got voters with buyer's remorse. The reason she isn't running again is she was behind in all the polls - there was no path to victory for her."" Key governor's races snapshots . Compiled by Adam Levy and Robert Yoon, CNN Political Research . Delaware . Gov. Jack Markell (D) vs. Jeff Cragg (R) Democratic Gov. Jack Markell appears headed for a second term this November. Markell's Republican opponent is Jeff Cragg, a small business owner from Wilmington. Delaware has become an increasingly reliable Democratic state and with the defeat of former Rep. Mike Castle in the 2010 U.S. Senate primary, the state now has no Republicans in statewide elected office. Cragg is unlikely to change the GOP's fortunes, especially in a presidential election year with Vice President Joe Biden, a Delaware native, on the Democratic ticket. Indiana . (Open seat) -- Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) is term-limited . Rep. Mike Pence (R) vs. John Gregg (D) vs. Rupert Boneham (Libertarian) Six-term GOP Rep. Mike Pence mulled a 2012 presidential bid but opted instead to run for governor to replace term-limited Republican incumbent Mitch Daniels. His Democratic opponent is John Gregg, the former Indiana House speaker. Pence's years in Congress and on the Sunday talk show circuit, as well as his brief foray in near-presidential politics, have given him a relatively high profile for a state candidate. That, plus Indiana's Republican-friendly state voting trends, gives him a leg up over Gregg. Republicans control the governorship, both U.S. Senate seats and a majority of U.S. House seats. Missouri . Gov. Jay Nixon (D) vs. Dave Spence (R) Democrat Jay Nixon hopes to become the first Missouri governor re-elected to a second term since the late Mel Carnahan in 1996. The Republican nominee is Dave Spence, a businessman who has been spending personal funds on the campaign. Nixon won the governorship in 2008 with a comfortable 58.4%, but Missouri voters have proven to be fickle at the ballot box, especially for state office. Since the 1970s, Republicans and Democrats have traded control of the governorship six times. Though a long-time swing state, Missouri has voted Republican in the last three presidential elections. The Democratic incumbent appears to have a leg up in the home stretch. Montana . (Open seat) -- Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D) is term-limited . Steve Bullock (D) vs. Fmr. Rep. Rick Hill (R) The race to replace outgoing Democratic incumbent and frequent CNN contributor Brian Schweitzer is extremely competitive, but it's been overshadowed by Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's equally competitive U.S. Senate re-election contest. The Democratic nominee is Steve Bullock, the state attorney general. He faces Republican Rick Hill, a former congressman. Schweitzer leaves office with fairly high marks. He began October with a 61 % approval rating, which helps Bullock. But the state leans Republican overall. New Hampshire . (Open seat) -- Gov. John Lynch (D) is retiring . Maggie Hassan (D) vs. Ovide Lamontagne (R) As is the case in Montana, the race in New Hampshire to replace a popular outgoing Democratic governor has become one of the most competitive races. The Democratic nominee is Maggie Hassan, a former state senator. She faces Republican Ovide Lamontagne, an attorney and conservative activist who was the tea party's choice over Kelly Ayotte in the 2010 GOP U.S. Senate primary. He also was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in 1996, receiving 39.5% of the vote against Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. John Lynch leaves office with high marks, which helps Hassan. But polling on the gubernatorial race itself has been mixed, with Lamontagne leading in two October polls and Hassan leading in one. Both candidates were well below the 50 % mark in each poll. Democrats have controlled the governorship for all but two years since Shaheen's win in 1996. North Dakota . Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) vs. Ryan Taylor (D) Incumbent Republican Jack Dalrymple seeks a full term in the office previously held by fellow Republican John Hoeven, who resigned in late 2010 after winning the U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democrat Byron Dorgan. The Democratic nominee is Ryan Taylor, the state senate minority leader. Although there's a tight U.S. Senate in the state this year, Dalrymple appears to have all the advantages heading into November. Republicans have had a lock on the governorship since 1992. Utah . Gov. Gary Herbert (R) vs. Peter Cooke (D) Utah has not had a Democratic governor in almost 28 years and incumbent Republican Gary Herbert looks likely to continue that trend. Herbert took office in August 2009 when then-Gov. Jon Huntsman resigned to become U.S. Ambassador to China. He won a 2010 special election to complete the rest of Huntsman's term and received 64% of the vote over Peter Corroon, the mayor of Salt Lake County. His Democratic opponent is Peter Cooke, a businessman and retired two-star major general with the U.S. Army Reserves. Utah is solid Republican country, and Herbert is a safe bet for re-election. Vermont . Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) vs. Randy Brock (R) Election Night 2012 should be much less suspenseful for Democratic incumbent Peter Shumlin than it was two years ago. That year, Shumlin narrowly edged his Republican opponent, Brian Dubie, 49% to 48%. Under Vermont law, the state legislature decides the gubernatorial election if no candidate receives a majority of the vote. Shumlin officially won the election in January 2011, though Dubie conceded the race shortly after Election Day. This year, Shumlin is expected to win re-election easily. His Republican opponent is Randy Brock, a state senator. West Virginia . Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin (D) vs. Bill Maloney (R) If it feels like just a year ago when Democratic incumbent Earl Ray Tomblin ran against Republican businessman Bill Maloney for the West Virginia governorship, that's because it was. Tomblin took office in late 2010 after his Democratic predecessor Joe Manchin resigned to take over the late Robert Byrd's U.S. Senate seat. A year later, Tomblin won a special election to complete the rest of Manchin's term. He beat Maloney, 50% to 47%. Now, the two face off again for a full term. The major difference now is that 2012 is a presidential election year, and the shadow of President Barck Obama looms even larger over the race than it did a year ago. Republicans, as they did in 2011, hope to link Tomblin with the president, who is unpopular in the Mountain State.","Republicans could gain four gubernatorial seats this year, crossing the 30-seat mark nationally .
Republican gains could help the GOP fight federal initiatives like health care reform .
Races in Washington and North Carolina could elect GOP governors for the first time since the 1980s ."
"(CNN) -- They will say this is about one person. It is not. They will attempt to distance themselves from the controversy. But they can't. They will even try to claim the whole conversation is a distraction from the ""real issues."" And yet they never shy away from using this same conversation to fire up their base, or hurl attack ads or raise funds. The truth is the ""legitimate rape"" comment made by U.S. Rep. Todd Akin -- as in pregnancy from ""legitimate rape"" is rare -- is not a GOP anomaly but rather another disturbing glimpse into the viewpoint too many social conservatives have about women's health and reproductive rights. And if abortion is not among the ""real issues,"" why is the GOP platform committee considering adding a ban, with no mention of exceptions, to this year's to-do list? Akin defies calls to withdraw from Senate race . Last March, in a discussion in the Kansas House about whether women purchase separate abortion-only policies, Republican state Rep. Pete DeGraaf suggested women should plan ahead for rape the way he keeps a spare tire. A few weeks later, Indiana state Rep. Eric Turner, a Republican, said some women might fake being raped in order to get free abortions. Former presidential hopeful Rick Santorum suggested doctors who perform an abortion on a woman who becomes pregnant from an attack should be thrown in jail and this year suggested rape victims who become pregnant from an attack should be forced to keep the baby and ""make the best out of a bad situation."" And we're to believe Akin is just a one-off. Please. More than 200 Republican members of Congress joined him in co-sponsoring House Resolution 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, when it contained language restricting the exception for federally funded abortions to ""an act of forcible rape or, if a minor, an act of incest."" Forcible rape. That's not too far from ""legitimate rape"" So vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan can try to backpedal away from Akin as fast as he can, but his name is still on the record in support of that bill, with that language. He can say he's in line with Mitt Romney and would not ban abortions in the case of rape, but it's his name attached to House Resolution 212: Sanctity of Human Life Act, which would have done just that. GOP platform committee approves tough anti-abortion stance . No wonder Romney chose Ryan as his running mate; he admires the speed with which the congressman from Wisconsin flip-flops. So yes, the current general election conversation may be largely about Medicare. The dialogue may eventually work its way back to the economy and jobs. But don't think for a second that social issues -- particularly abortion -- are not in the GOP's sights. Since the tea party helped pull the GOP back into power in 2010 -- under the guise of controlling government spending -- close to 1,000 anti-abortion bills have been introduced across the country. I can't think of anything approaching that number of bills with the goal of creating jobs in that same time span, can you? At a Personhood USA ""tele-town hall meeting"" in December, Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry all said they would work to outlaw all abortions, regardless of the circumstances. You can fully expect a Republican Congress to move quickly to ban all abortions, regardless of circumstances. And given that a would-be President Romney said, ""I will protect a woman's right to choose,"" when he was running for Massachusetts governor in 2002, only to become an anti-abortion advocate while running for president, there's no telling which side of the issue he will fall on, on any given day. Opinion: GOP policy is the scandal, not just Akin . Some social conservatives talk of protecting religious freedom, but what they are really seeking is a theocracy that places limits on freedom based on a version of Judeo-Christianity that fits their liking. That language is also being considered for the GOP's national platform. Some speak of fighting abortion because of their religious convictions and then belittle the trauma caused by rape. They think they can make this controversy all about Akin, as if Ryan's legislative history is just going to disappear. As if DeGraaf never suggested women should plan ahead for rape the way he keeps a spare tire. As if none of us are paying attention. But we are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Todd Akin's ""rape"" comment offers glimpse into some conservatives' views .

"(CNN) -- Police charged an 18-year-old with murder in the case of a University of Florida student last seen eight days ago, a police spokesman said Friday. Officer Ben Tobias announced that the Gainesville police department charged Pedro Bravo with the death of Christian Aguilar. He did not offer further details. Ron Kozlowski, one of Bravo's attorneys, told CNN on Friday night that he has ""not been presented with any new evidence thus far."" Bravo's family is distraught and worried about the murder charge, Kozlowski added. The 18-year-old Aguilar was last seen about 6 p.m. September 20, according to a police statement. His body still hasn't been recovered, said Tobias, who urged the public to reach out to authorities with any information on the case. ""We would ... encourage property owners, residential or business, who may have lime rock roads on their property, that were accessible to the general public, to search those properties for any suspicious areas of ground that appear to have been disturbed,"" Tobias said. ""We are also requesting information from anyone who may have seen a suspicious vehicle, likened to a Blue Chevy Blazer, in any remote areas on the night of Thursday, September 20."" Police told Aguilar's family about the murder charge -- and, with it, the presumption the college student was dead -- about an hour before the public announcement, Tobias said. ""Christian's family is heartbroken, as expected,"" the police spokesman told CNN by e-mail. Bravo told investigators that he'd gotten into ""an altercation with Aguilar"" on the night the college student went missing, police said. Bravo then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may be disoriented and/or seriously injured. Aguilar's father told CNN affiliate WCJB that his son disappeared after a fight over a girl. After talking with police September 21, Bravo was held for mental examination after threatening to harm or kill himself. He was later charged with depriving a victim of medical care, a third-degree felony, and was in custody at the time he was charged with murder, according to Tobias. Authorities have used helicopters and K-9 units to search for Aguilar, to no avail. The young man's family members, meanwhile, have plastered the area with fliers, taken to Twitter to generate leads and invited a nonprofit search group to help look for him alongside family members and police. Gainesville police posted a fresh plea Friday night, on the department's Facebook page, asking volunteers to report to the Florida Farm Bureau at 9 a.m. Saturday to resume the search for Aguilar. Bravo's family initially volunteered to help in the search, only to be politely turned down by Aguilar's family, Kozlowski said. The lawyer said his client will make his first court appearance Saturday morning. At that time, a judge will assess the case and set bail for Bravo or decline to, thus assuring that the suspect will remain in custody. CNN's Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The suspect's family is distraught and worried, one of his lawyers says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Tennessee are asking for the public's help to find two children presumed missing after a fire destroyed their home. The children -- identified as 9-year-old Chloie Leverette and 7-year-old Gage Daniel -- were last seen Sunday around 6:30 p.m., approximately three hours before their home burned down, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, or TBI. They lived with their grandparents in Unionville, Tennessee. ""After an extensive five day search, multiple fire experts have processed the scene and are unable to locate evidence that Chloie and Gage were victims of the fire. The location of Chloie and Gage are unknown at this time,"" the TBI said. Investigators recovered the bodies of the grandparents, according to Kristin Helm, a TBI spokeswoman, and feel fairly certain they would have found the children if they had been there. They have no theories as to the kids' whereabouts. The TBI concluded its search of the home Friday, Helm said. She said the biological parents of the children have been contacted and are cooperating. There was nothing to indicate Chloie and Gage were home at the time of the fire, the spokeswoman said. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear. When asked whether the TBI fears for the children's safety, Helm responded: ""Yes, because we have two children who are outside their personal zone of safety. ... We consider them endangered."" Meanwhile, the marquee outside Community Elementary School in Unionville has morphed into a makeshift vigil. Flowers and gifts are piled around a sign that reads: ""Pray for Chloie and Gage's family."" Tim Miller, the school's principal, told CNN affiliate WTVF that he feels he's on an ""emotional roller coaster."" ""We're like the family. At this point, we don't know, but we would like to see closure,"" he told WTVF. Chloie is 4 feet, 8 inches tall, weighs 75 pounds, has brown hair and blue eyes. Gage is described as 4 feet, 50 pounds, with brown hair and eyes. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Richard Davis contributed to this report.","NEW: A spokeswoman says she fears for their safety .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The cause of death for Sage Stallone, the 36-year-old son of actor Sylvester Stallone, won't be officially known for another two months, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said Sunday. The autopsy on Stallone, who was found dead in his Los Angeles home Friday, was completed Sunday, the coroner's spokesman said. It normally takes six weeks for toxicology tests to be completed by the coroner's lab. Sage Stallone's attorney, George Braunstein, told Los Angeles TV station KNBC that Sage Stallone was engaged to be married and was working on various film projects at the time of his death. ""Sylvester Stallone is devastated and grief-stricken over the sudden loss of his son Sage Stallone,"" his representative said in a statement. ""His compassion and thoughts are with Sage's mother, Sasha. Sage was a very talented and wonderful young man. His loss will be felt forever.""

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The release of a secretly recorded tape of Mitt Romney speaking to campaign donors highlights a risk facing the Republican Party -- of becoming perceived as the party of mean. After a vicious assault from Democrats that portrayed Romney as a vulture capitalist who cared little about saving middle-class jobs, his remarks to a group of campaign donors about the 47% of Americans who don't pay taxes being dependent on government handouts only intensified the perception that he represents a party that is uninterested in protecting average Americans. A New York Times editorial characterized Romney as a ""class warrior"" seeking to ""protect the rich by turning the working poor and middle class into the enemy."" Romney's problem is one that Republicans have been struggling with more broadly for years. Many in the party have forgotten an essential element of Ronald Reagan's legacy: his insistence that conservatism had to be packaged as a positive force, as an argument about how to expand the global rights of individuals and make all American families more secure. He was determined to appeal to middle- and working-class Americans who were not satisfied with the Democrats. Opinion: The true difference between Obama, Romney . Reagan was acutely aware of the need to present this kind of argument for conservatism, because he had vivid memories of the 1964 presidential campaign, when Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater was devastated by Lyndon Johnson's attacks on him as a radical extremist. On the campaign trail and in the White House, Ronald Reagan was always conscious of articulating a vision of conservatism that offered more than just an agenda of gutting social programs or only protecting the ""national interest"" through brute force. On foreign policy, Reagan spoke of a tough anti-communism that would protect the rights of those who lived under Soviet totalitarianism. He embraced the rhetoric of neoconservatism by championing a strong stand against the Soviet Union as a way to protect democracy around the world. He drew on the language that conservatives had used since the 1940s, focusing on the need to free oppressed people in places like Eastern Europe. Reagan also talked about the quest for abolishing nuclear arms, a cause that he had supported for much of his adult life. He emphasized ""peace through strength"" as a reason to resist what he considered reckless arms negotiations and building up America's defense arsenal so the United States could win the concessions that would be needed from the Soviets to draw down nuclear weapons. As Reagan said in his stirring, impromptu 1976 speech at the Republican convention, telling the delegates what people would be thinking a hundred years from then if they read a letter he put into a time capsule, ""Will they look back with appreciation and say, 'Thank God for those people in 1976 who headed off that loss of freedom, and kept us now 100 years later free, who kept our world from nuclear destruction?"" Reagan employed the same kind of rhetoric on domestic policy. His principal economic policy, supply-side economics, focused on cutting taxes on the wealthy with the promise that it would stimulate economic growth for everyone and bring more revenue into the federal government without raising taxes. ""This administration's objective,"" Reagan said in his inaugural address, ""will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work."" Reagan had his hard edges for sure. He railed against ""welfare queens,"" a vision of poor women cheating the system of government benefits. He supported steep cuts in many domestic programs such as food stamps that aided the neediest Americans. Moreover, many of his arguments about supply-side economics were discredited and his foreign policy was much less consistent than he stated when it came to protecting democracy. Opinion: Obama clueless on Mideast turmoil . But at least politically, Reagan understood that Republicans had to appeal to broad segments of the population, or they would lose. Early in his presidency, George W. Bush tried to bring back some of Reagan's spirit with his ideas about ""compassionate conservatism"" as well as his use of human rights as a guide for foreign policy. Yet many of his economic policies, including the tax cuts for the wealthy and effort to privatize Social Security, as well as the immense problems of the war in Iraq, undercut his ability to revive this vision of conservatism. Without a positive message, conservatism faces the risk of seeming primarily like a harsh creed, an ideology for those who are intent on disciplining people who have supposedly become dependent on government. Unfortunately for conservatives, that includes a huge array of Americans, from the elderly to defense contractors to young children in schools. If this rhetoric continues, the GOP is at risk of becoming the party that takes away government services, takes away immigration rights, takes away social rights, but doesn't offer anything back. The 47% speech played right into this theme. And the polls are all moving in the wrong direction for the GOP. There are fewer and fewer voices such as former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who recently, according to Politico, has been working hard to find bipartisan agreement on health care issues and who is publicly willing to acknowledge how the government is sometimes needed to alleviate problems. ""As a doctor,"" he wrote in The Week, ""I strongly believe that people without health insurance die sooner. ... State exchanges are the solution."" If the GOP ignores the kind of backlash it has encountered, it risks falling right back to 1964 or even 1932, when Democrats were able to paint Republicans as a ruthless party only intent on protecting the prosperous. ""Our Republican leaders tell us economic lawsâ€”sacred, inviolable, unchangeableâ€”cause panics which one could prevent,"" President Franklin D. Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1932, ""But while they prate of economic laws, men and women are starving. We must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are not made by nature. They are made by human beings."" If Republicans are not careful, Democrats will find it easy enough to revitalize FDR's rhetorical assault and to make it extraordinarily difficult for Republicans to regain control of Washington. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Romney's troubles reflect a problem GOP has been dealing with for years .
A conservatism that emphasizes cutting social benefits risks appearing harsh, he says .
Zelizer: Reagan insisted conservatism be packaged as a positive force for freedom .
He says Democratic presidents have gained by depicting GOP as the party of meanness ."
"Editor's Note: Wynn Westmoreland, a media coordinator for CNN, offers this personal remembrance of two victims from the weekend's severe weather. Bonnie Turner and her husband, Michael, on their farm. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I met Bonnie Turner seven years ago when I was looking for a puppy. There was just simply no one better to turn to than the eccentric grandmother who loved animals so much that her 86-acre North Georgia farm was home to donkeys, goats, high-priced show dogs and even a few wayward deer. On Saturday, nothing was left of that bucolic sanctuary after a 130-mph tornado ravaged it. Bonnie died, thrown 50 feet from her home as her husband, Michael, cried out her name, their neighbors Joe and Jamie Wheeler said. Her death has shaken me. Images of the animals that died -- at least 35 dogs and 100 still missing -- make my voice crack when I speak about her. But I want her to be remembered as more than a victim, as probably does the family of the tornado's second victim in Floyd County.  Watch destruction in Floyd County » . Bonnie -- whom everyone called Mrs. Bonnie -- was a retired veterinarian's assistant. Her husband, Michael, who now lies in a hospital in critical condition, built a home for them. Her ""Mikey"" was a man who knew that something beautiful takes time to build. He spent hours making ornate clocks that decorated their home, and many more helping his wife oblige the physical rigors of taking care of dozens of animals. A band of Chihuahuas and a few of her award-winning American hairless terriers nipped at her ankles as she performed her daily chores. On a cloudless day in April in 2001, I visited Bonnie with a friend. She told us to lie in the grass, and she went inside her house, unleashed about a dozen puppies and watched as they ran out the door toward us. They began licking our ears, noses and toes. I noticed that a small, black-and-brown Chihuahua was trying to get my attention. I had been looking for a white female one, but Mrs. Bonnie would have none of that. ""That's your dog, he likes you,"" she told me. I named the 4-pound Chihuahua Jesse James. During the years since, I often called Bonnie with questions about Jesse or dogs in general and she was always there to help. I wish everyone could have met her and experienced some of the happiness she evoked in so many. She is a soul who will be deeply missed.

"(CNN) -- Weather officials refer to Sandy as ""remnants,"" and by Thursday, these had stopped producing significant warnings. But as Sandy finally dies out, the tragedy has only begun for some. Under calmer, sunlit skies from Maryland to Rhode Island, politicians, rescuers and journalists in elevated vehicles, boats and copters surveyed the silent wreckage of houses and lives turned to ruin or wiped out completely by a tempest for the record books. While the leftovers of the superstorm flung its last gales across the Great Lakes on Wednesday, dumped rain on the nation's far northeast corner and sprinkled its last snowflakes below the Mason Dixon Line, Americans picked up the pieces, reconnected power lines and relied on help from authorities, neighbors and their faith. Dozens of families likely made funeral arrangements, as Sandy claimed at least 56 lives in the United States; 124 total died in all countries in its path. A running CNN tally reflects a steady restoration of power, but 4.8 million customers remained without electricity Wednesday night in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Here's a look at how Sandy has affected the United States: . CONNECTICUT . -- Some residents did not evacuate in Hartford/New Haven because they had never experience flooding in their neighborhoods, and had to call on rescuers to help them out of their homes, CNN affiliate WFSB reported. -- Gov. Daniel Mallory visited shoreline communities hit hardest Wednesday, beginning his tour with a stop at a church. -- On his Youtube channel, he released aerial video of storm damage.

MAINE . -- One last emergency shelter remains open at the fire station in the town of Alna until the last resident sees power restored, according to the emergency management agency. -- Only 2,296 customers still do not have power in the state. MARYLAND . -- The National Guard went door to door in the coastal city of Crisfield in Humvees to aid victims of flood damage. Shallow water stood in many streets up to doorsteps, and residents described the ground as ""soggy."" -- The death toll remains at two. Could huge plugs have spared subways? NEW JERSEY . -- Sandy wrought the worst destruction on the seaboard of two states. New Jersey was one, and miles of homes and businesses were devastated in a series of towns.

The neighboring state of New York had the highest death toll in the storm. -- The state got personal attention from the White House, as Obama toured storm-damaged areas Wednesday. New Jersey coastal town turned to ""devastation"" -- Sandy killed at least six people in the state, said Gov. Chris Christie, who warned people in low-lying areas to evacuate.
