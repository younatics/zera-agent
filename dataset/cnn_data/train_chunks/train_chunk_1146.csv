"A British tourist told yesterday of his flight of terror when he claims an emergency exit on a super jumbo blew open at 27,000ft. David Reid and his son Lewis feared a bomb had gone off after hearing a ‘massive explosion’ two hours into their flight on the brand new £250million Emirates Airbus A380. Freezing air blasted in and the cabin pressure plunged after the door in business class came an inch and a half ajar, leaving a gaping hole, said Mr Reid. Scroll down for video . Fear: Blankets are stuffed by the passenger exit door, pictured bottom left, to fill a gaping hole while the green indicator light, ringed in red, is a communication panel for crew . As passengers wept in terror, he said, a . petrified stewardess ran down the aisle and screamed ‘the door’s going . to go’ before cowering behind her seat. Astonishingly, . according to Mr Reid, instead of making an emergency landing, the crew . decided to stuff blankets and pillows stuck together with gaffer tape . into the hole and continue the flight despite a horrendous droning noise . and sub-zero temperatures. An open door on an aircraft is a serious emergency because it leads to a sudden loss of cabin pressure. Oxygen levels inside an aeroplane have to be carefully controlled because the air in the atmosphere gets ‘thinner’ – it contains less and less oxygen – the higher you climb. Cabins of planes cruising above 12,000ft are kept pressurised to mimic conditions at around 6,000ft and keep up the levels of oxygen. A sudden rush of ‘thin air’ from outside can cause passengers and crew to experience ear and stomach pain, or even black out due to lack of oxygen. Rob Hunter,  of the British Airline Pilots’ Association, said: ‘For a door to open or for a significant gap to appear is extremely rare.’ The drama happened on Monday as the two Britons flew from Bangkok to Hong Kong as part of what was planned as a ‘trip of a lifetime’. He said: ‘We were about two hours in when suddenly there was a huge blast. ‘It was a real shock, so loud that I thought a bomb might have gone off. Air was gushing into the cabin like a gale. 'The stewardess jumped up and stared at the door. Her face was drained white. 'She ran up the aisle, grabbed the intercom and started screaming, “The door’s going to go, the door’s going to go!” Then she hid under her chair. ‘Other passengers were crying and saying “We’re going to go down, we’re going to go down.” 'It was complete panic. The emergency . door was ajar and leaving a gaping hole. You could see straight out . into the atmosphere, 27,000ft up.’ Mr . Reid, who has a private pilot’s licence, said that after several . moments of confusion, the cabin crew started grabbing blankets and . pillows which they stuck together with duct tape to fill the gap. He . added: ‘This is a state-of-the-art plane but they were using the most . crude method you could imagine to try and plug the hole. ‘The conditions were terrible for the . rest of the flight. The door continued to make a horrendously loud . droning sound which made it impossible to speak to each other. Drama: Passengers heard a loud bang as their jet flew on Monday to Hong Kong from Bangkok . Ordeal: A relieved passenger checks his hand baggage on arrival in Hong Kong . 'Worst of all, it was absolutely freezing. It was an extremely nerve-wracking experience for everybody.’ He . said cabin crew closed the curtain between business class to stop those . in the economy cabin below discovering what was happening. Mr Reid claims he suffered a chest infection following the ordeal and the pair had to cut short their £4,500 trip. His 18-year-old son reported the incident to the Department of Transport’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch who have passed it on to air investigators at the United Arab Emirates General Authority for Civil Aviation. An Emirates spokesman said: ‘We can confirm there was a whistling noise emanating from one of the doors on the A380 upper deck on flight EK384 between Bangkok and Hong Kong on Monday, February 11. At no point was the safety of the flight in jeopardy.’ An Airbus spokesman said: ‘It is not possible for a cabin door to open on an A380 or on any aircraft whilst in flight, as doors open inwards and have locking mechanisms.’ An Emirates spokesman later updated the company's statement responding to Mr Reid's claims, saying : 'At no time during the flight did one of the upper deck doors open. There was also no loss in cabin pressurisation at any time during the flight. 'The noise from the door was caused by a small dimensional difference between the inflated door seal and the door lower frame striker plate, when the door is in the closed position. 'This is currently under investigation in conjunction with Airbus. Emirates have now fixed the problem. 'The blankets were placed around the door to abate the whistling sound emanating from the door, not to prevent the door from opening. 'There was no point during the incident where the safety of the flight was in jeopardy. 'In addition, the green light next to the door does not represent that the door is open. It is an Attendant Indication Panel and is used for communication information for the Cabin Crew.'","British tourist pictured drama on flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong .

"'Kind, innocent and friendly nature': Learning-disabled Faruk Ali was attacked as he helped binmen collect rubbish from his street in Luton, Bedfordshire . A police officer who allegedly punched an autistic man for helping to put out the bins is to face charges of racially aggravated assault. Faruk Ali, 33, who has had learning difficulties and severe autism since childhood, was helping binmen collect rubbish outside his home when his family say he was the victim of a ‘savage attack’. They claim a uniformed officer beat up the vulnerable victim, hurling him into wheelie bins and pinning him down before chasing him inside his home in Luton, Bedfordshire. According to his family, the alleged attack on Mr Ali continued inside, where one of the two officers present is accused of punching him. The officers from Bedfordshire Police are said to have claimed they thought he was a robber, even though Mr Ali was wearing a pair of slippers and a badge on his coat to alert people to his condition as he helped refuse collectors, which he has done for a number of years. Two constables are now facing charges over the alleged racially motivated attack. PC Christopher Thomas, 33, from Welwyn Garden City has been summonsed to court where he will be formally charged with racially aggravated assault as well as a second charge of assault, perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office. His colleague, PC Christopher Pitts, 39, from Bedford, has been summonsed in relation to charges of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office. The move comes after the force apologised to the family and ordered an independent investigation by Leicestershire Police, which is being supervised by the police watchdog. Bedfordshire Chief Constable Colette Paul wrote an open letter telling of her ‘sadness’ at the ‘considerable distress’ the incident had caused Mr Ali. It later emerged in a public meeting held by his family that Mr Ali had been the victim of a similar incident involving the police in 2011, again near his home. According to his family, Mr Ali likes routine and enjoys helps the binmen every Thursday. His sister Husna Begum, has described how she was awoken by banging noises and the sound of him screaming ‘no’ on the morning of February 20 this year. She said she jumped out of bed and saw a man dragging him across the floor and punching him. The alleged attack was also witnessed by neighbours. One witness, Musthafa Hussain recalled: ‘They dragged him, they punched him. They held him hard. ‘It was outrageous.’ Days later, the victim’s brother Kodor Ali told their local newspaper: ‘The police said they thought he was going to rob the house. That’s the only explanation given. ‘Every Thursday, Faruk would wake up early to take the bins out for collection and would help the bin man to bring them back to the neighbours’ doorstep. ‘He has been doing this for a number of years and all the neighbours are very well aware of his kind, innocent and friendly nature. ‘I don’t understand how this character could be mistaken for a person who is trying to rob a house.’ 'Traumatised': A photograph shows the bruising Mr Ali suffered to his neck as a result of the attack . His younger brother Dhobir, 31, added: ‘The family has been traumatised by the whole experience. Faruk hasn't actually recovered yet, he's still traumatised. ‘He is scared to leave the house, he has become more anxious and agitated and he is terrified every time he sees the police. ‘When he came in the house with the police behind him I saw the bruises and cuts and straight away knew what had happened to him. ‘Why did the police use such force? ‘They said he looked suspicious but he was wearing slippers at the time and he was wearing a big coat.’ Yesterday a spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said: ‘It has been announced today by the CPS that two officers from Bedfordshire Police are to be summonsed to appear in court in connection with the assault. ‘Christopher Thomas, who is 33 and from Welwyn Garden City, has been summonsed in relation to charges of racially aggravated assault; assault, perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office. ‘Christopher Pitts, who is 39 and from Bedford, has been summonsed in relation to charges of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office.’ Other injuries: Mr Ali's family say although he has physically recovered, he has been left traumatised by the experience. He is scared to leave the house, anxious and agitated and terrified every time he sees police . The investigation by Leicestershire Police remains ongoing. A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said both officers had been suspended, adding: ‘In direct response to family and community concerns Bedfordshire’s Chief Constable, Colette Paul, arranged for the investigation to be undertaken by Leicestershire Police, to ensure a transparent investigation by a team unconnected to Bedfordshire. ‘This was to ensure the community was reassured that the investigation was as thorough and as impartial as it possibly could be.’ The two constables will appear at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court on September 1 when they will be formally charged.

"It would be stretching things a bit to suggest that Liverpool ended 2014 with the same swagger they possessed 12 months ago. But after a year of two vastly contrasting halves - one might call it an annus hammer-horribilis given how regularly Liverpool battered their opponents to begin with - Brendan Rodgers will be relieved to see his side again displaying the predatory instincts that enabled them to mount that ‘unexpected title challenge’. More pleasing still for Liverpool’s manager will be the fact that they crushed Swansea City in the absence of Steven Gerrard as well as Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. Finally these players appeared capable of taking responsibility without their talismanic captain at their side, dominating their opponents in the way a Liverpool team should at Anfield.

Rodgers will take particular pleasure in the sight of Adam Lallana delivering his finest performance to date in a Liverpool shirt, one marked by two goals but also a demonstration of the ability that justifies the price tag. But Rodgers should also see enormous positives in the contributions of Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson, not to mention Alberto Moreno, who scored the opening goal as well as excelling in his wingback role. It remains fair to say that Liverpool would have completed this year rather less optimistic than they were when they entered it. But this was a second win in as many games, and secured thanks to that opening strike from Moreno, Lallana’s brace - one comically inadvertent, the other brilliant - and an own goal from Jonjo Shelvey that was not even the low point of his performance. For Shelvey, the nadir was an elbow in the face of Emre Can that escaped punishment but is sure to lead to retrospective FA action. Of course, Rodgers still has concerns. Simon Mignolet returned from an ‘indefinite’ spell on the sidelines - it actually lasted only four games because of the injury suffered by Brad Jones - without making a mistake but clearly there is a lack of confidence. Liverpool's Alberto Moreno finishes off a brilliant team move to put his side one goal to the good against Swansea . Moreno (left) looks on as his left-footed shot flies past Swans goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski . The 22-year-old jumps for joy after his 33rd minute finish as the Anfield faithful celebrate behind him . In addition, the continued deployment of Raheem Sterling as a centre forward does not reflect well on Rodgers when it means Mario Balotelli and Ricky Lambert are sitting on the bench. Considering how badly Sterling struggled against a physical Swansea defence, Sturridge cannot return soon enough. The England forward’s frustration showed through when he threw a slap at Federico Fernandez in the second half - an indiscretion which might also attract the attention of the FA’s discipline department. Liverpool were helped by the fact that Swansea showed neither defensive cohesion nor urgency, which was strange given their recent efforts. Their only contribution of note in a distinctly one-sided half was proof from Shelvey that he had not heeded the warning of Garry Monk, who told him to stop getting himself needlessly booked. Monk’s side had no answer to the work ethic Liverpool showed here last night. Moreno’s 33rd-minute opener proved what can come with a bit of hard graft, the fact that he continued his run from out wide after passing to Lallana being rewarded with a fine cross from Henderson. Lukasz Fabianski had made a number of saves by then but he could do nothing to deny Moreno from close range. Moreno now has two Premier League goals to his name since joining Liverpool from Sevilla in the summer . The Spanish defender points to the sky as he celebrates putting Liverpool into a 1-0 lead . Former Arsenal goalkeeper Fabianski hits the ball straight into the path of Lallana to put Liverpool into a 2-0 lead . Lallana and Fabianski watch as the goalkeeper's kick rebounds into the Swansea net in the 50th minute . Fabianski's attempted clearance cannons of the shoulder of Lallana before flying into the Swansea goal . Swansea’s only response was that moment of madness by Shelvey. In fact only after spending the interval with Monk did they show any signs of improvement. But a further setback would come in the 51st minute when Lallana’s reward for his endeavour was a goal, albeit one that came when Fabianski hit his clearance against the advancing Liverpool forward and then watched in despair as the ball spun back over his head and bounced into Swansea’s goal. In fairness to the Welsh side, they did then hit back when Mamadou Sakho, under pressure from the otherwise ineffective Wilfried Bony, diverted a Wayne Routledge cross into the path of Gylfi Sigurdsson. Lallana's fortunate goal came at a crucial time for Liverpool, putting the Reds into a 2-0 second half lead . Fabianski closes his eyes in disbelief after his mistake gifted Lallana his first goal of the night . Reds midfielder Lallana runs towards the Kop in celebration of his second half goal . The England international wheels away in celebration of his first goal of the night at Anfield . Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson pulled his side back into the game just moments after Lallana's first goal . But in a frantic 10-minute spell that saw Sterling send an effort against a post, Lallana struck again. His second goal came after he collected a delightful flick on from Coutinho, beat two players and guided a marvellous finish beyond the reach of Fabianski. Shelvey then won a near-post tussle with Lallana from a Henderson corner, only to send a glancing header over his own goalkeeper. Monk’s misery was indeed complete. But on a night when the master and apprentice were reunited on the touchline, even Monk might concede this was exactly what his former Swansea mentor needed. It has been a tough few months for Rodgers, leaving him under enormous pressure and proving how quickly fortunes, even for a manager who finished second in the league last season, can change. The year has certainly ended better than Rodgers perhaps feared it would. Jonjo Shelvey endured a torrid time back at Anfield and put the ball into his own net in the 69th minute .

"Nine months before filing a lawsuit claiming she was raped by Dr. Luke, Kesha reportedly reached out to fans in a series of letters revealing the alleged abuse at the hands of her producer. The pop star wrote the correspondence herself - which appear on the pages of a children's colouring book - while in rehab for an eating disorder back in January, reports BuzzFeed after claiming to have confirmed the authenticity of three of the letters. The singer specifically identifies the 41-year-old music mogul as her abuser by writing: 'Dr. Luke has tortured me & my family… he did do what people know about + SO much more terrible s***.' Correspondence: Kesha reportedly reached out to fans in a series of letters revealing the alleged abuse at the hands of producer Dr. Luke while in rehab in January . The duo are currently embroiled in a nasty legal battle after Kesha claimed in a lawsuit that she was 'sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abused' by the prolific producer over a period of 10 years. She continues to pinpoint the producer in the letters by adding: 'These music business a**holes (well, Dr Luke) had almost successfully crushed my magic.' In another message, the 27-year-old opens up about her pain but refrains from naming anyone specifically. Explosive claims: The singer specifically identifies the 41-year-old music mogul as her abuser by writing: 'Dr. Luke has tortured me & my family' Reaching out: She continues to pinpoint the producer by adding: 'These music business a**holes (well, Dr Luke) had almost successfully crushed my magic' Treatment: The Tik Tok singer sent the letters as she was dealing with her eating disorder in rehab . Name-calling: And while she was in the middle of seeking treatment for her eating disorder she goes on to say: 'Someone who I work with called me a f****** refrigerator' 'Someone I work with has literally driven me into this disease, tortured me and f***ed with me and my family,' wrote the singer. And while she was in the middle of seeking treatment for her eating disorder she goes on to say: 'Someone who I work with called me a f****** refrigerator.' One of the teenage recipient's of the letters revealed her utter shock after actually getting a response from the pop star. 'I wasn’t even expecting a reply or anything,' said Kelly Mullin to BuzzFeed News. 'I just wanted to show her how much we loved her and about two weeks later I got a letter back.' Fan groups circulated the singer's correspondence back in February, but the letters have garnered new urgency after news of Kesha's explosive lawsuit against the mega producer surfaced last week. Close: Kesha - real name Kesha Rose Serbert - claims that the alleged abuse started early on when she signed her deal with Dr Luke in 2005 . New twist: It has been claimed that Kesha's songwriter mother Pebe Sebert sent an email to Dr. Luke's lawyer last year insisting she would go public with claims he raped her famous daughter if he didn't release her from her contract and hand back publishing rights . The latest revelation follows on the heels of Kesha's mother allegedly having fired off an email threatening to go public with allegations her daughter was raped by Luke if he didn't revoke her contract. Now it has been claimed that the singer's mum, songwriter Pebe Sebert, contacted Dr. Luke's lawyer last year, demanding that the 27-year-old was released from her contract or she would publicly speak about allegations he assaulted her. Amid these allegations sources connected to Kesha's lawsuit, according to TMZ, claim that the troubled star told doctors while she was in rehab earlier this year that she had been abused and assaulted by Dr. Luke, which will likely become evidence in the suit. Harsh words: She told a fan: 'Someone who I work with called me a f****** refrigerator' Meanwhile, in an email obtained by TMZ, Kesha's mother allegedly writes: 'We, me and Kesha and her friends... like Lady Gaga, are going to make all of this Really PUBLIC, in the next few days. Luke date raped Kesha when she was 18... 'Luke gave Kesha pills. She ended up naked in his hotel room 2 days later. No longer a virgin? 'Do we all want this to come out? Either Luke releases Kesha from all legal contracts, and gives me back all my publishing, or we, Kesha and I, tell the truth.' Dr. Luke - whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald - is responsible for all of Kesha's music and gave the singer her first record deal in 2005 when she was just 18-years-old. Abuse: Kesha - seen here this month in Venice - claims Dr. Luke called her 'fat' in a new lawsuit against the music producer, also claiming she suffered years of abuse, including one sexual incident . After Kesha's legal team filed their suit, Dr. Luke filed his own documents against the singer claiming she is 'lying to get out of her legally binding contract'. His lawsuit claims the star's suit has been 'engineered' by her mother and Kesha's new management company. He also appeared to detail the email, accusing her team of trying to extort him by threatening to 'spread lies about him' unless he released her from her contract. Kesha claims that the alleged abuse started early on when she signed her deal with the hitmaker, who is known for producing some of the biggest hits in pop music for the likes of Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Claims: In a lawsuit obtained by TMZ, Kesha claims she was 'verbally, emotionally, sexually, and physically abused' by music producer Dr. Luke . Dr. Luke allegedly made 'repeated sexual advances' towards her and 'would use drugs and alcohol to remove her defences'. UsWeekly report that Kesha claims Dr. Luke allegedly gave her 'sober pills' and the following day she woke up naked in his bed 'sore and sick with no memory of how she got there'. Kesha claims that Dr. Luke reportedly 'threatened that if she ever mentioned the rape to anyone, he would shut her career down, take away all her publishing and recording rights, and otherwise destroy not only her life but her entire family’s lives as well'. The lawsuit also alleges that he also 'threatened her and her family’s physical safety'. MailOnline has reached out to representative for both Kesha and Dr. Luke who have so far been unavailable for comment. Kesha and Dr. Luke are seen (far right) alongside Adam Lambert and producer Max Martin at the 28th Annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards at the Grand Ballroom at Hollywood & Highland Center in 2011 . The news comes after Kesha was sent to rehab earlier this year for a reported eating disorder, which the lawsuit claims was caused by the abuse. Since U Been Gone - Kelly Clarkson . Wrecking Ball - Miley Cyrus . Tik Tok - Kesha . I Kissed A Girl - Katy Perry . Roar - Katy Perry . California Gurls - Katy Perry . Who Knew - Pink . Hold It Against Me - Britney Spears . Domino - Jessie J . Where Have You Been - Rihanna . About You Now - Sugababes . In April this year, TMZ reported that Dr. Luke was behind Kesha's eating disorder, after he had called her 'fat'. A source told the publication that he had told her she 'looks like a f***ing refrigerator' and Kesha was understandably affected by it. Kesha has hinted at a fall out with the producer before when she told her Twitter followers that she never wanted to record or release their hit song Die Young, which was pulled from radio stations after the devastating Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. In September last year, one of Kesha's fans set up a petition 'Free Kesha' to help release the singer from Dr. Luke's management. It followed reports that Kesha had hardly any creative control of her second album Warrior. Meanwhile, Kesha's lawyer, Mark Geragos, told TMZ in a statement: 'This lawsuit is a wholehearted effort by Kesha to regain control of her music career and her personal freedom after suffering for ten years as a victim of mental manipulation, emotional abuse and an instance of sexual assault at the hands of Dr. Luke.' Geragos added: 'The facts presented in our lawsuit paint a picture of a man who is controlling and willing to commit horrible acts of abuse in an attempt to intimidate an impressionable, talented, young female artist into submission for his personal gain. Kesha is focused on moving her life and her career beyond this terrible time.' Long-term mentor: Dr. Luke (far left), Kesha (center) and her mother Pebe (second right) in 2010, after her hit first single TiK ToK had been released . Dr. Luke has produced all of Kesha's big hits including, TiK ToK, We R Who We R and Your Love Is My Drug. He has also produced hundreds of hits for other artists, including Roar, California Gurls and Teenage Dream by Katy Perry, as well as Till The World Ends and Hold It Against Me by Britney Spears. He's also worked with Taio Cruz, B.o.B, Jessie J, Flo Rida, Miley Cyrus,T.I., Nicki Minaj, Juicy J, Rihanna and Shakira. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards for his work on Katy Perry's Teenage Dream album.

"A skateboard park has become a laughing stock in south Wales after satellite images revealed it had a rather unfortunate design. Pictures from Google Earth were posted online this week showing that from above the facility in Porthcawl is distinctly phallic. Google user Gareth Bishop noticed it and posted the picture asking: 'Anyone else notice the unfortunate design of the skate park?' It led to a flood of responses with others pitching in with predictably wry comments. This picture from Google Earth shows a distinctly phallic-shaped skate park in Porthcawl, south Wales . Sean Bingham noted: 'Only in Porthcawl would you get a tarmac beach and a c***-shaped skate park.' It is the latest example of unintentionally suggestive designs being spotted on sites like Google Maps and Google Earth. But makers Maverick insist there was no mistake in the construction and the shape is one commonly used in the world of skate park design. Designer Ian Jennings said: 'The 'c*** and balls' design is a highly functional favourite of skateboarders worldwide and Porthcawl is certainly not unique in having its own piece of phallic skate architecture. 'The fact Porthcawl has a version of this classic design is largely due to the input of some extremely well-travelled and experienced skaters in the area.' He added: 'I remember the kink in the Porthcawl skate park plan was actually introduced to the design at a late stage to try to make it look less phallic. The discovery of the skate park follows reports of this unfortunately-shaped housing estate in Merseyside . This Christian Science church in Illinois has also hit the headlines for the same reason . 'We get these sort of comments a lot, unfortunately certain people seem to get really excited by a giant phallus. My response is usually that if yours is that shape you should probably have a chat with your GP!' Porthcawl resident Ally Barr, 53, was a professional skateboarder in the 1970s and helped draw up the design which he claimed helped 'assist a smoother ride'. 'Most people don't actually notice the phallic likeness unless it's viewed from above,' he added. 'It consists of four separate entities that all come together in to what's known as a combi bowl, giving maximum satisfaction to the rider.' Porthcawl Town Council described it as a 'great facility'. A spokeswoman said: 'The town council, together with local people and organisations work to ensure that provisions are provided within the town for the residents and visitors in the area. 'The skate park is an example of the people in Porthcawl working together to produce a great facility for both the youth and adults within the town. 'The town council is extremely proud of this achievement and is delighted that it is still receiving so much interest nearly three years after its completion.' The stir comes just months after residents in Merseyside were said to be worried about the value of their homes after it emerged their estate resembles a giant phallus when seen from above. And in the U.S. a Christian Science church in Illinois hit the headlines for the same reason.","Images show that from above facility in Porthcawl is distinctly phallic .

"A trip to the big city turned into a disaster for a Chinese man and his family after he was persuaded to take part in a game of mahjong, and was thrown out of an 11th floor window when he was unable to pay a £6,000 debt. Terrified Guo Xu, 35, went hurtling through the air and fell several stories before he hit a chimney and an air vent several stories below where he was wedged tight and had to be cut free by firemen. He told police they had come from their home in southwest Henan province in central China to the provincial capital Zhengzhou to take a holiday and that his wife had decided to take their son, aged 5, to the zoo. Pushed: Guo Xu fell several storeys before he hit a chimney and an air vent, where he was wedged tight and had to be cut free by firemen . Miraculous: Mr Xu fell to the third floor, but managed to survive . He had then gone to the hotel's card room to play chess and cards, and had then been persuaded to play a game of mahjong. But although he had been a good player back in his village he was no match for the city players, and his dreams of big winnings ended up with big losses of £6,000, an amount he simply did not have. After the demand got more heated, he was grabbed by the angry players and lobbed out of the window. Escape: Mr Xu had to be cut free by firefighters and carefully lowered down to the ground on a stretcher . Extreme reaction: He was thrown out of the window as he could not pay a £6000 debt he racked up playing mahjong . Injured: Doctors have said that Mr Xu may need to have his legs amputated . Mr Xu was on holiday with his wife and son when the horrific incident took place . Hospitalised: Medics said that Mr Xu appeared to be paralysed from the waist down . Police said that it had been a difficult operation to free him from the 3rd floor spot where he had been trapped and that he appeared to have been paralysed from the waist down. What’s more, doctors said that they may have to amputate his legs, which suffered from loss of blood after he was wedged in by the chimney. His wife said. ‘Our lives have been ruined by this, he is the money earner for our family, we have no savings for medical bills and nothing to pay our bills, how will I look after him without any money?’ Intrigued: A crowd of onlookers watch as Mr Xu is rescued .","Mr Guo Xu was thrown from a hotel in China as he couldn't pay a £6k debt .

Hospitals must offer free or cut-price parking to the seriously ill, the Health Secretary will announce today. Setting out strict new rules, Jeremy Hunt will say cowboy parking operators can no longer be allowed to impose huge fines for trivial infringements. His intervention is a major victory for the Daily Mail’s campaign to protect vulnerable patients. The outrageous behaviour of some parking bullies has sparked a mass of complaints. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment has over-run are among those who have been ripped off. ‘Patients and families shouldn’t have to deal with the added stress of unfair parking charges,’ Mr Hunt will say. ‘These clear ground rules set out our expectations, and will help the public hold the NHS to account for unfair charges or practices.’ The guidance to health trusts makes clear they will be responsible for the actions of the private firms that run more than three quarters of hospital car parks. They will have to act against rogue contractors and not sign contracts ‘on any basis that incentivises fines’. The guidance says hospitals should offer free or reduced cost parking to the relatives of all patients considered to be gravely ill. Concessions should also be offered to the disabled and to people needing frequent outpatient appointments, such as those receiving chemotherapy. Nurses, doctors and other staff working shifts and unable to use public transport should also be offered discounted rates. Discretion must be used to ensure patients are not issued with swingeing fines if their appointment over-runs. Hospitals will be urged to axe camera networks that fine drivers even if they are just a few seconds late. Scroll down for video . They will be told to install pay-on-exit systems that charge for the precise time. Operators will be forced to publish details of their charges and penalties prominently. A Whitehall source said Mr Hunt was concerned that many patients were being tricked by unscrupulous operators. The package of measures was broadly welcomed by campaigners last night, although they warned Mr Hunt must ensure the guidance is followed. Duleep Allirajah, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Hospitals must not ignore this government guidance and should commit to implementing the guidelines as a matter of urgency so that cancer patients do not continue to pay unfair hospital parking charges. Ripped off: Patients whose treatment over-ran were left with hefty fines from complex parking systems . Our campaign: The announcement marks a victory for the Mail after our campaign to protect patients . ‘Cancer patients receiving vital treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy will often need to make frequent trips to hospital and unaffordable charges are leaving many out of pocket.’ Anna Bradley, of Healthwatch England, said complaints about parking charges were by far the most common concern raised by patients and their families. She added: ‘The new rules will hopefully offer much-needed support for those that have to visit hospitals regularly, either for treatment or in support of a loved one receiving care. ‘The key will be making sure the public are aware of the changes so that they can challenge the system when they feel they are facing unfair charges.’ Hospitals should ensure charges are ‘reasonable for the area’ and rates are clearly displayed, along with details of penalties. Free or reduced parking should be offered to the relatives of the ‘gravely ill’, the disabled, patients needing regular appointments and staff working antisocial shifts. Fines should only be imposed ‘where reasonable’ and should be waived when a patient has had to stay for reasons beyond their control, such as late-running treatment. Hospitals should consider phasing out CCTV-based parking systems that allow operators to levy penalties on people who overstay by even a few seconds. Instead they should shift to pay-on-exit. Hospitals are to be made responsible for the actions of private parking operators and are urged to ‘act against rogue contractors’. Health sources acknowledge that the guidance is not mandatory. But they believe making hospitals responsible for their car parks will shame them into forcing private operators to clean up their act. Last month, the Daily Mail highlighted claims by whistle-blower Tony Taylor, who says he was ordered to focus on cancer wards because patients were often late returning to their cars after gruelling treatment. Mr Taylor says he was ordered to ‘give tickets, no matter what, regardless of any illness’. Wardens were offered bonuses to give cancer wards ‘a good banging’. Some parking firms were also accused of using bully-boy tactics to intimidate people into paying outrageous fines. Victims say they are handed parking tickets that look almost identical to official local authority tickets, even though they do not carry the same legal force. These supposed penalty notices are then followed up by menacing letters warning drivers to pay up or face prosecution. The majority of hospitals have handed control of their car parks to private firms. Often, no payment is involved when the contracts are signed. Instead, the hospital will take the parking revenue, leaving the private firm to fund its operations and make a profit from any fines it can levy for infringements. Ricky Gater, of the Parking Ticket Appeals Service, said: ‘The incentive for these companies is not to make sure people come on time and park correctly, the incentive is to earn money.’","Jeremy Hunt to set out new strict rules blocking huge fines in car parks .

"Revealed: Brigitte Höss has been living in anonymity in the U.S. since fleeing Germany after her father's fall . These are the never-before-seen pictures of the Auschwitz commandant's daughter as a young fashion model before she moved to the U.S. where she succeeded in keeping her dark family secret for 40 years. Brigitte Höss, whose father Rudolf was in charge of the deadliest of the Nazi regime's concentration camps, smiles for the camera during what is thought to have been the early days of her Balenciaga modelling career. Now aged 80 and dying of cancer, she has revealed the full extent of what is a remarkable story in her first ever interview. Living in anonymous retirement in Northern Virginia, Höss, who gave an interview to the Washington Post, fears for her life should her identity ever be revealed. Indeed, . Brigitte was so shamed by her father's integral role in the Holocaust . that she was stunned when the Jewish boss of the boutique she worked in . forgave her when she drunkenly confessed her family tree, understanding . that she not to blame. All . the more stunning is the fact the unnamed fashion store manager - whose . store served the wives of Congressmen and Senators - had fled Nazi . Germany in 1938. Conflicted . by the memories of her father, who was responsible for the deaths of . 1.1 million Jews and tens of thousands of gypsies and political . prisoners, Brigitte maintains to this day that her fathers 'was the . nicest man in the world'. One of the stipulations of the Post . interview was that her married name not be used, not any details that . could potentially lead to her unveiling. 'There . are crazy people out there. They might burn my house down or shoot . somebody,”' she said in a thick German accent to interviewer, Thomas . Harding. Rudolf . Höss, was hanged in 1947 after the end of the war and Brigitte, . together with her mother Hedwig and two brother and two sisters, was . thrown into abject poverty. Aged . 80 and recently diagnosed with cancer, she has spent much of the past . 40 years working in a fashion boutique serving prominent Washingtonians, . including the wives of senators and congressmen. Pretty face: The young Brigitte fled to Spain where she began modelling for fashion house Balenciaga, keeping her past to herself . Unique childhood: Brigitte, pictured laughing on the left, grew up in a villa next to the notorious death camp Auschwitz . Rudolf Höss, right, was the infamous Kommandant of notorious Nazi death camp Auschwitz, before he was caught in 1946, left, and hanged . Sentenced to death: Rudolf Hoss was hanged for his crimes in April 1947, poignantly using gallows built on his old terror camp Auschwitz . Arriving in Washington with her Irish . American husband in 1972, Brigitte's husband busied himself with a . senior job at a transportation company. Unable . to speak excellent English, Brigitte told the Washington Post how she . found a small part-time job in a fashion boutique where she met her . future boss, a short Jewish lady. The two hit it off and she asked Brigitte to come and work for her fashion salon in Washington D.C. One . night over drinks, Brigitte confessed her father was Rudolf Höss. Her . Jewish boss said this did not matter to her, despite having had to flee . Nazi Germany in the aftermath of the Kristallnacht attacks of 1938. Throughout . her life if people asked about her father she would tell them . matter-of-factly that he died during World War 2, reports The Washington Post. Brigitte Höss, now 80, is pictured to the far left of this family photo taken she was a young girl and her father was the Kommandant of Auschwitz. The photo is held by her nephew Rainer Hoess, who is the one family member to go public with his distaste for the crimes his grandfather committed . More than 1.1 million Jews, along with 20,000 gypsies and tens of thousands of Polish and Russian political prisoners were killed at Auschwitz . Born Inge-Brigitt Höss on Aug. 18, 1933, her early years were spent moving from one concentration camp to another as her father moved up the ranks of Hitler's SS. From the age of seven until 11 she lived in a villa beside Auschwitz, where her family resided in fine style. They were waited upon by staff – many of them prisoners – and their home was decorated with furniture and artwork stolen from prisoners as they were selected for the gas chambers. They could even see the prisoner blocks and old crematorium from an upstairs window, but Brigitte more fondly recalls visiting the horses and German shepherds at the camp. In April 1945, with the war clearly lost, the family fled north. They waited for the right moment to escape to South America, but in March 1946 Hanns Alexander, Harding’s great-uncle, caught up with them. After testifying at Nuremberg, Höss was hanged at the gallows next to the Auschwitz crematorium. From the age of seven until 11, Brigitte Höss lived in a villa beside Auschwitz, where her family lived in fine style, their home decorated with furniture and artwork stolen from prisoners as they were selected for the gas chambers . Shunned because of their connection to the Nazi regime, Brigitte and her family spent the following years in extreme poverty. During the 1950s she left Germany to make a new life in Spain where she worked as a model for three years with the up-and-coming Balenciaga fashion house. In 1961 she married an Irish American engineer working in Madrid. When she confessed to him about her background he was understanding and believed she was ‘as much a victim as anybody else.’ They agreed upon an ‘unspoken and unwritten agreement’ not to talk about her family background. His work took them to Liberia, Greece, Iran and Vietnam before they moved – together with a young daughter and son – to Washington in 1972. Initially Brigitte struggled to adapt to her new life, but it helped the she had found a part-time job in a fashion boutique. Two women model 'Ballet' dresses by Balenciaga: In Spain in the 1950s Brigitte Höss worked as a model for three years with the up-and-coming fashion house . Not long after she was hired, she confessed her family background to her boss. Fortunately for Brigitte, the owner told her that she understood that she had not committed any crime herself and she ended up working at the same boutique for the next 35 years. Brigitte and her husband divorced in 1983 and her daughter is dead, but her son lives with her. She sees her grandchildren often but as yet has not been able to bring herself to discuss her dark secret because she doesn't want to upset them. She tells The Washington Post that her mother used to visit her in Washington from the 1960s up until the late 1980s when she died while staying with her and as a result she is buried somewhere in Northern Virginia. Her other siblings live in Germany, although one brother is dead. One family member who has made public that he is related to Höss, is her nephew Rainer, who once told Harding: 'If I knew where my grandfather was buried, I would piss on his grave.' Brigitte has spent much of her life afraid to talk about her father and even though she knows what he did was terribly wrong, she does remember him fondly. 'He was the nicest man in the world,' she says. 'He was very good to us.' In Washington DC Brigitte Höss worked in a fashion fashion boutique serving prominent Washingtonians, including the wives of senators and congressmen (stock image) She also tells Harding that her father was 'sad inside.' She maintains that he was forced to do a lot of things and didn't have a choice. 'He had to do it. His family was . threatened. We were threatened if he didn’t. And he was one of many in . the SS. There were others as well who would do it if he didn’t.' Brigitte doesn't deny the atrocities at Auschwitz and other camps took place, but she questions the numbers that were killed. 'How can there be so many survivors if so many had been killed?' she asks. When it is pointed out that her father confessed to being responsible for the death of more than a million Jews, she says the British 'took it out of him with torture.'","Brigitte Höss, now 80, has kept family secret for most of her life .

"Tyson Fury put tape over his mouth to ensure that he gave the first silent press conference in the loud mouthed history of boxing. So determined was the giant 26-year-old not to cause further offence in the build-up to his heavwyeight battle of Britain with Dereck Chisora that he uttered not one word as the two came face to face in London. Fury has been fined £15,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control for the four-letter outburst at their previous head-to-head confrontation. Tyson Fury taped up his mouth and wouldn't speak to the press ahead of his fight with Dereck Chiso . Tyson Fury promised to maintain his silence until the Chisora fight is over . Peter Fury, his uncle and trainer, did have something to say: 'The Board wanted us to tone it down a bit so here's Tyson... the Board dummy.' Fury was prepared to respond to questions with gestures and indicated that he will knockout Chisora in one or two rounds at the ExCeL arena in London's Docklands on November 29. That is the rescheduled date for a world title eliminator which was postponed when Chisora cracked his hand in sparring. Fury, who had the initial letters BBBC written on his mouth tape, stripped off his shirt to reveal a torso well-honed with the fight still two months away. When asked if he would maintain his vow of silence throughout those eight weeks he nodded in the affirmative. Muhammad Ali – not only the greatest but the most voluble of all boxers - famously taped over his mouth after being pilloried for speaking too much. He ripped away the gag after a few minutes, unable to contain himself any longer. Promoter Mick Hennessy made it clear how seriously the Board viewed Fury's previous rant when he said: 'This fight could be in jeopardy. If anything else happened, we could be looking at a year's ban.' Frank Warren, the lead promoter, made his own apology for the outrageous uproar which went before when he said: 'I should have controlled that press conference better. I hold my hands up. I share some of the blame for what went on. Fortunately there was nothing physical.' Peter Fury and Hennessy revealed that they were upset at being excluded from the Board of Control hearing. Hennessy said: 'We need characters in boxing. Sometimes Tyson is the gentleman but on other occasions he gets rubbed up the wrong way and he should be allowed to express himself.' The irony, of course, is that this impersonation of Marcel Marceau will generate as much publicity as his wild misconduct has done hitherto. Muhammad Ali once taped his mouth shut but only kept up the appearance for a matter of minutes . Dereck Chisora will take on Fury in six weeks and promised to knock the silent fighter out . Fury was fined £15,000 for his four-letter outburst when the pair last came face to face this year . Chisora was in a mellow mood but when it was drawn to his attention that Fury was indicating with his fingers a first or second round stoppage, he said simply: 'I will knock him out.' Boxing now holds its breath, waiting to see if Tyson will be able to hold his peace until the end of November. Tyson Fury v Dereck Chisora will be live on BoxNation on Saturday 29 November. Smith in with a sniff of world title against Abraham . Paul Smith, at 31 the eldest of the four boxing brothers from Liverpool, becomes the first of the family to fight for a world title when he challenges Arthur Abraham for the WBO super-middleweight belt in Germany on Saturday night. He will have the support of 2,000 travelling fans on what will be a tough assignment. But he believes the veteran Abraham has slipped into decline since his Super Six loss to Carl Froch four years ago. Paul, Stephen and Liam Smith have all won British titles. Their youngest brother Callum is unbeaten and widely predicted to become the most successful. Paul Smith celebrates victory against David Sarabia in Cardiff in May . While Paul realises that the odds are against him, he expects all his siblings to become world champions. Smith, having been stopped by both Carl Froch and George Groves, has been selected for this fight as a warm-up for bigger things for Abraham. But if he is at his very best it might not be beyond him to spring the upset. Wilson showing signs of recovery . Sheffield boxer Jerome Wilson is showing signs of recovery from brain surgery following a devastating knock-out in his home town.

"They lay forgotten in a dank cellar for almost a century. But these remarkable photos, published for the first time, give  a rare and uncensored view of the horrors of the First World War from behind enemy lines. They were taken by Walter Kleinfeldt who joined a German gun crew in 1915 and fought at the Somme aged just 16. As his haunting pictures, taken with a Contessa camera, make all too clear, life in the  trenches was a harrowing experience. The images provide an insight into the epic machinery of war – and capture the darkest moments of battle, with bodies strewn among the rubble. Returning home in 1918, Walter set up a photography shop in the town of Tubingen, where he worked until his death in 1945. Walter’s son Volkmar discovered the pictures three years ago. They are now the focus of a new BBC documentary. Director Nick Maddocks said: ‘It is rare to find such good-quality, honest and often beautiful  photos that show us war through the eyes of the soldier, particularly from one so young.’ Hidden Histories: WW1’s Forgotten Photographs is on BBC4 on Thursday at 9pm. Carnage: Amid the appalling devastation and bodies of dead soldiers, a crucifix stands tall - miraculously preserved from the shell fire. The powerful image was captured after a bloody skirmish in 1917 - and Walter's son Volkmar says: 'This photograph is like an accusation - an accusation against war' Final moments: Walter was just 16 when he fought at the Somme but his photos soon took on dark tone.

"Young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life, the employment minister has said. Esther McVey said jobseekers need reminding that they have to start at the bottom and work their way up, rather than expecting to walk into their dream job. In an interview with the Mail, she admitted that young Britons are less prepared for the world of work than foreign migrants and need to learn the basics, such as turning up on time. Realistic: Esther McVey said the young should remember they must start at the bottom and work their way up . But she insisted that those who want to work hard can succeed if they are prepared to learn the ropes and ‘be realistic’ about their abilities. The most recent figures revealed  that 941,000 people aged between 16 and 24 are out of work, while 282,000 under-25s have been jobless for a year or more, the highest level since 1993. Miss McVey, 46, vowed that tackling youth unemployment will be her ‘top priority’ but said that those looking for work have to be prepared to get a foot on the ladder before expanding their horizons. Asked if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she said: ‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to run a hotel in Dubai.’ Last year, more than 1,700 people applied for eight jobs at a new Costa Coffee shop in Nottingham, which paid between £6.10 and £10 an hour. But the minister said many young . people have unrealistic expectations about what jobs entail, and it is . only when they start do they realise it can take years to become . proficient. She said: . ‘Everybody says, “That’s what I want to do,” but I think you’ve got to . realise the hours, the years [needed] to be able to do that job. When . you see your first piece of work and compare it with who you want to be, . all of a sudden you realise what skills you don’t have.’ Preparation: Miss McVey, 46, claims it is her mission to better prepare school leavers for the work place . Employment ministers often court controversy with their instructions to the jobless to make more effort to find work. Most famously Norman Tebbit has long been associated with the phrase 'Get on your bike and find a job'. But the man nicknamed the 'Chingford Skinhead' did not quite say that. The actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like Handsworth in Birmingham and Brixton in south London in 1981. A young Conservative had asked whether rioting was a 'natural reaction to unemployment'. The then-Employment Secretary told the Tory Party conference: 'I grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it.' The remarks sparked a political storm, with Mr Tebbit accused of being insensitive to the difficulties of looking for work. In 2010, Tory Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith sparked a similar furore when he suggested the unemployed ought to 'get on the bus'. He cited Merthyr Tydfil in Wales as somewhere where people had become ‘static’ and ‘didn’t know if they got on the bus an hour’s journey they’d be in Cardiff and they could look for the job there’. The Government plans to expand its ‘sector based work academies’ in the retail and entertainment industries – a scheme where young jobless people get six weeks training, a work-experience placement and a guaranteed job interview. Miss McVey spoke out after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith released figures earlier this week showing that the number of Britons in jobs plunged by 413,000 between 2005 and 2010, under Labour, while the number of working foreigners soared by 736,000. The Employment Minister insisted that ‘nine out of ten jobs’ are now going to Britons, but she conceded that school leavers in the UK are underprepared for work and less qualified than many migrants. Chris Grayling, her predecessor as employment minister, hit the headlines in 2011 when he branded it ‘unacceptable’ that high street chain Pret a Manger had shops staffed entirely by foreigners. Asked whether young Britons can compete with foreign workers, Miss McVey said: ‘For a long time people have left school without the right qualifications even in English and maths, therefore they are at a huge disadvantage. ‘We have got to get our kids up to the right standard and aptitude so that everyone wants to take them on.’ The minister started her own working life  with a family firm on Merseyside after university and then made her name in television before setting up a business forum to help women start companies. She added: 'You are dealt the cards you are dealt and you have to make the best of that. That is life. ‘It is about keeping going. It is about working hard. You can achieve wherever you come from, so long as you work hard and are prepared to give it a go. ‘People might say, “Where are the opportunities?” But at the same time you could say, never have there been more opportunities when you look at the internet, where you can have a global reach with whatever you do. You can start a business in your bedroom and have clients right around the world. ‘In the 18 to 24 year olds, more people are setting up businesses than ever before.’","Esther McVey tells young they must to start at bottom and work way up .

"Caught: Retired school principal and 911 dispatcher Dennis Blake, 64, of Delray Beach, went to a teen boy's Lantana home for sex after they met online, federal prosecutors say . A retired school principal from Indiana is facing federal sex and child porn charges after he was arrested in Boynton Beach, Florida for soliciting sex from an officer posing as a 15-year-old boy. Dennis Blake, 64, of Delray Beach was arrested after he drove from Indiana to South Florida to have sex with what he thought was a teenage boy. The officer posing as the teen had been exchanging messages with Blake since October and arranged to meet him in January at the Boynton Beach Mall. The person he was meeting was an undercover city police officer who posed as a minor on the online Grindr service. During their messaging, Blake sent the officer sexually explicit pictures of himself, police said. Blake went to the boy's Lantana home within two hours of starting to chat online. When investigators later conducted a detailed forensic search of his cell phone, they found evidence Blake had also gone to meet a real teen whom he thought was 16. He is charged with soliciting a child for unlawful sexual conduct, traveling to meet a minor to commit an unlawful sex act and transmission of harmful material to a minor. Blake moved to Delray Beach in August after retiring from his jobs in southern Indiana. His online perversion began when he began using the online service Growlr, and they discussed meeting for sex. Blake asked for, and received, sexually explicit photos of the boy. The boy first told Blake that he was 18, then said he was 16 in online messages. The former school head was well aware he was playing with fire. Undercover: Blake showed up to meet what he thought was a 15-year-old boy at a Boynton Beach Mall restaurant. The person he was meeting was an undercover city police officer who posed as a minor on Grindr . In one online message 'Blake responded, 'I can't come to your house since you're underage. But you can come here,' 'Too much danger in getting caught. And I can't risk that,'' Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Schiller wrote in court records. The boy sent Blake his home address and Blake sent the boy a photo of his penis. Soon after the encounter, Blake began communicating with what he thought was another underage teen, only this time it was a police officer on the other end of his texts. Blake pleaded not guilty to four federal charges Wednesday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale. He is charged with two counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity and one count each of receiving and possession child pornography. Three of the charges involve the real teen; one enticement charge involves the undercover officer. The most serious charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years to life in federal prison.","Retired Indiana teacher arrested in Florida for soliciting sex from teen .

"David Cameron has admitted he does not know how much a supermarket loaf costs – because he bakes his own using a bread-making machine. The Prime Minister was asked the price of a ‘value’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living. He guessed it was more than £1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘the value stuff’. Scroll down for audio . Hardworking: David Cameron used a series of TV interviews to reject claims he is out of touch, before plugging artisan flour and breadmakers . Instead he uses a £100 breadmaker and a brand of Cotswolds artisan flour which costs around £4.40 a bag. In comparison a 1.5kg bag of Tesco’s own brand flour costs only 65p. Mr Cameron has often highlighted his credentials as a domesticated husband and father, being filmed doing the washing up and boasting of making pancakes on a Sunday morning in his constituency home in Oxfordshire. Yesterday on LBC radio he was asked to name the price of a ‘value sliced white bread loaf at Tesco or Sainsbury’s’. Mr Cameron replied: ‘It’s going to cost you north of £1.’ Kitchen cabinet: Mr Cameron has often boasted of his culinary skills, including being pictured making a fruit salad in the kitchen of his constituency home near when leader of the opposition . Tour: Mr Cameron pictured outside the main conference hall with his aide, Tory MP Sam Gyimah . Scrum: Mr Cameron is in the media spotlight ahead of his keynote speech to the Conservative conference tomorrow . To the real baker, the idea of using a breadmaker is worse than cheating, it is an insult to the craft of creating a loaf from scratch. Great British Bake-Off's Paul Hollywood teases those who rely on a machine, saying: 'Not really baking, is it?' But David Cameron insists his Panasonic applicance does the job, turning his expensive local flour into delicious granary loaves for his children. The most popular model which the Camerons are believed to have starts at £100, able to create nine different bread types including wholemeal, Rye bread and pizza dough. Reminded that he was being asked about a value sliced loaf, he said: ‘I don’t buy the value stuff... I’ve got a breadmaker which I delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways.’ He rejected suggestions that making bread at home takes too long, saying: ‘You think ahead. A little plug for the flour made in my constituency: The Cotswold Crunch. 'You get some of that – beautifully milled in the Cotswolds – you pop that in your breadmaker. ‘You can set the timer overnight so when you wake up there’s this wonderful smell wafting through your kitchen. It takes 30 seconds to put your ingredients in.’ It is understood the Camerons have the cheapest Panasonic model of breadmaker, which starts at £100. Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘When he said, “I have a breadmaker” most people will have assumed he had his own personal baker.’ Rebellious Tory MP Nadine Dorries once described Mr Cameron and George Osborne as ‘posh boys who don’t know the price of milk’. On Monday Boris Johnson admitted he did not know the price of a pint of milk. Yesterday, asked about value bread, he joked: ‘I can tell you the price of a bottle of champagne, how about that?’ Crumbs: Mr Cameron laughed off the exchange with LBC presenter Nick Ferrari . London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted he did not know the price of a pint of milk . Boris Johnson was forced to admit on TV that he did not know how much a pint of milk cost - but he did not seem to care. The London Mayor told BBC's Newsnight how the cost of living was going to be a big political issue at the next election. He was asked by presenter Jeremy Paxman: 'Do you even know the cost of  pint of milk?' But Mr Johnson replied: 'About 80p or something like that...' Told it was actually half that at 40p, he conceded: 'Well there you go, I don't know how much a pint of milk costs. So what?' You could almost hear his aides choking on their croissants as they feared a PR disaster. By boasting that he ‘delights’ in using his own bread-making machine, David Cameron made a lifestyle statement that risked alienating the millions who haven’t the time or inclination to make their own loaves. There’s no doubting the appeal of the smell of a baked loaf in the morning or of the fact it lacks the additives found in the supermarket loaves the Prime Minister says he eschews. The trouble is, though, that the economics don’t quite stack up. I know this, because I own a Panasonic SD-255 – perhaps the very model Mr Cameron owns. Dough: The Prime Minister recommended a . Panasonic breadmaker and the Cotswold Crunch flour made near his . Oxfordshire constituency . It clutters up our kitchen with myriad . other gadgets. Although my wife loves it, I wish I could just throw the . damn thing away. Moneywise, they are a rip-off. A Panasonic . breadmaker will cost up to £150 – about 320 ‘value’ loaves of bread. And . that’s before you include the price of the ingredients. Mr Cameron says he buys a brand of flour called Cotswold Crunch, that sells for a whopping £4.38 per 1.5kg bag. David Cameron does not use any ordinary flour from a budget supermarket. The . Cotswold Crunch variety he hailed on the radio is produced by millers . FWP Matthews, which traces its roots back to Oxfordshire in the 1860s. The . dark variety is described as 'the connoisseur's blend of strong white . flour, malt flour, malted wheat flakes and rye flour for bread and . rolls'. It costs £21.40 for five 1.5kg bags, working out at £4.38 per bag. By contrast, a bag of strong white bread flour in Tesco costs just 80p. To . make a basic sandwich loaf in a Panasonic breadmaker, you need 400g of . flour. That’s £1.17 worth of lovely Cotswold Crunch. Then you’ll need . 15g of butter (about 7p), about 5p worth of yeast and about 2p of sugar . and salt. (The 280 ml of water is a negligible cost – 0.03p.) This . brings the grand total to just over £1.30. At first, that doesn’t seem too much. But wait, we’ve forgotten something – the cost of the electricity! Breadmakers . use, on average 550 watts, and it takes five hours to make a sandwich . loaf. That means, at a rate of 14.5p per  kilowatt hour, that will cost . 40p  a loaf. So, adding the original price of the machine (and . assuming it lasts long enough to make 1,000 loaves), the total cost per . Cameron loaf will be £1.85, or the equivalent of nearly four ‘value’ loaves. Of course Mr Cameron could use normal flour at 80p per 1.5kg, . which would reduce the cost of a loaf to 95p. But that is still the . cost of two ‘value’ loaves. And then there’s the fact that . breadmakers are hardly the easiest of gadgets to look after. (Mr Cameron . himself admits that while busy running the country, dealing with Syria . and liaising with foreign leaders, using his Panasonic breadmaker means . having to regularly set it up several hours in advance.) Then, if my . experience is anything to go by, the kneading blade often gets left . inside the loaf,  and the bits of burned bread  are difficult to clean . off the baking tin. Also, because the bread doesn’t have factory-added preservatives, it tends to go stale quickly. Another problem is that my Panasonic loaves are smaller than the average 800g loaf bought in a shop. Unlike . the Prime Minister, I think breadmakers are a con, and by recommending . their use, he reveals that he is more out of touch than simply not . knowing the price of bread. The next time he is interviewed about such things, he’d be better advised to use his loaf.","Prime Minister struggles to name price of a budget supermarket loaf .

"One British holidaymaker is arrested every two hours as they travel abroad in search of cheap drink and sun. More than 5,400 were detained by police overseas last year, including 653 held in connection with drug offences. Ministers issued a stark warning to Brits that they risk ‘throwing years of your life away in a foreign prison’ as they released a map of the parts of the world where Brits are most likely to get into trouble. Interactive map . Trouble: Alcohol was a 'major factor' in emergency cases involving young people visiting Ibiza, Turkey and Greek islands, the Foreign Office said. Brits are pictured on the Punta Ballena strip, the notorious bar and club area of Magaluf on the Spanish island of Mallorca . Too many people fail to respect ‘local laws and customs’ when jetting off to countries like India and United Arab Emirates, the Foreign Office warned. Serious punishments can be handed down for offences that seem ‘trivial’ back home. Alcohol continues to be a ‘major factor’ in cases involving young people visiting the Balearics, Turkey and Greek islands. More than 19,200 Brits abroad needed emergency help from embassies around the world  in 2012-13, new figures show. It included 3,600 who ended up in hospital, with a sharp increase in Thailand blamed on young tourists having accidents on mopeds. There were also dramatic rises in the number of Brits raped or sexually assaulted in some of the most popular resorts, including Spain, Portugal and Cyprus. Travellers were urged to take precautions to avoid being attacked, including avoiding lifts from strangers or leaving drinks attended which could be spiked. Drunken British students rampaged through the popular resort of Salou in Spain in fancy dress during an annual festival in March . Danger: The number of people hospitalised in Thailand rose 31 per cent, with officials warning many were caused by young Brits riding mopeds without helmets . The three countries in which the largest number of sex attacks reported were Spain, Turkey and Greece – ‘destinations popular with young Brits for their busy nightlife’, the Foreign Office said. As British holidaymakers travelled further afield, embassies in India, United Arab Emirates and the Philippines saw increases in serious cases including arrests and hospitalisations. Thailand saw a 31 per cent increase in both hospitalisations and deaths, despite falls worldwide. The increase was in part blamed on a rise in road accidents involving young people on mopeds after the number of people admitted to hospital hit 285. Bikers were warned that they should always wear a helmet and most insurers will not pay out for treatment if they have been drinking alcohol. In 2012-13 there were 5,435 British citizens arrested overseas, down around 10 per cent on a year earlier. But the number of arrests was up in United Arab Emirates, Canada, Netherlands and New Zealand, and there was an increase in drug-related arrests in USA, Greece, Portugal and China. The Foreign Office issued a blunt warning to anyone planning to holiday abroad this summer:  ‘Don’t take risks with the law abroad – or you could end up throwing years of your life away in a foreign prison. ‘Think about what you are doing at all times and trust your instincts – do not take risks that you would not at home. ‘Many countries have a zero-tolerance approach to offences involving drugs and alcohol and sentences can be long. ‘It is a good idea to research the local laws and customs of the country you are visiting - there may be serious penalties for breaking a law that might seem trivial at home.’ A total of 6,193 Brits died abroad last year, down around 100 in 2011-12. Most were ex-pats and holidaymakers in Spain, followed by France and Germany. Overall 28,783 people’s passports were lost or stolen, the highest number since 2008. Foreign office minister Mark Simmonds said: ‘I encourage all British travellers to do everything they can to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip by taking some basic steps to prepare themselves before departure, including taking out comprehensive travel insurance and researching their destination.’","Increase in arrests in United Arab Emirates, Canada and Netherlands .

"The morning after the night before, and Captain Fantastic had turned into Captain Recall. No hazy memories for Paul McGinley about what went on following Europe’s marvellous Ryder Cup victory on Sunday. ‘My wife gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever had in my life after sinking the winning putt in 2002,’ said the Dubliner. ‘Don’t drink too much or you’ll forget about it. Have a few drinks, of course, but remember these moments, they’re special. And last night was special.’ And so he told us about the moment Sir Alex Ferguson came into the room and thanked the whole team for making him feel young again. ‘He said it had been like being back in the boiler room again and he thanked us for the pleasure,’ said McGinley, beaming. Rory McIlroy took to Twitter to show off his new Scottish-themed outfit with Scotland's Stephen Gallagher . Lee and Laurae Westwood pose with the Ryder Cup alongside Ian and Katie Poulter . Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Miguel Angel Jimenez enjoy a karaoke session after the victory . Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson in red tartan kilts and wigs after USA's loss against Europe in Ryder Cup . He told of the conversation he was having with Sergio Garcia and the fateful moment when, for the only time all night, he looked at the screen of his permanently buzzing smartphone. It was a text from Luke Donald, friend of Sergio and the man McGinley had reluctantly left on the sidelines. ‘I don’t want to break too many confidences but it was just very respectful to me, very respectful to the team and very regretful that he wasn’t part of it,’ he said. ‘It was just nice. It was a big, long text, and it meant a lot.’ Europe has been blessed with some wonderful captains over the years but McGinley might just have been the best since Tony Jacklin. The respect his players had for him can be summed up by a lovely anecdote concerning Ian Poulter. Imagine what it must have been like for him when he was left out of the Saturday afternoon foursomes matches, having just chipped in at the 15th during the morning, meaning he would play only three times? ‘It was a really tough call, but I just decided at the 11th hour to play Martin Kaymer and break up that dynamic of Poulter and Justin Rose in the foursomes,’ said McGinley. ‘The way Ian accepted that decision... I mean he came out on the golf course in the afternoon, he put his arm around my shoulder and said: ‘‘You’re the captain, you make the calls and I’ll be ready tomorrow’’. That told me more about Ian Poulter than the banging on the heart or what he did at Medinah.’ The party began with just the team, caddies, Sir Alex and other friends and wives. ‘It wasn’t too packed and it was just nice with no one looking for selfies or autographs,’ said McGinley. ‘A lot of the players then joined the Americans in their team room where we got our asses truly whipped at table tennis. I’m certainly glad the Ryder Cup is not a table tennis championship! Then we went out into the bar and public areas. So we moved around, but we started out initially just being together, which was great. A little moment to savour.’ Paul McGinley, the victorious European Ryder Cup team captain, reads the Daily Mail on Monday morning . Europe celebrate their Ryder Cup triumph over USA which came to an end after singles matches on Sunday . Paul McGinley clutches the Ryder Cup trophy on Monday morning after beating USA on Sunday . McGinley’s attention to detail didn’t just extend to having the two European team room areas redecorated in blue and gold. He even had a fish tank put in, complete with blue and gold fish. ‘I just wanted everything in the team room to be the European colours and symbolise our coming together, and everyone bought into it,’ he said. ‘That’s what we do. We come from such diverse cultures and backgrounds but we stand together as one, from the bottom of Italy to the top of Sweden, from the West Coast of Ireland right across to Turkey. And as for the fish, yeah, that was my idea. They’re still swimming away happily although they might have hangovers as some of the wine might have been spilled over them.’ Whoever takes over from McGinley is going to have enormous shoes to fill but he confirmed he would not be standing again in any capacity, either as captain or vice-captain. ‘I feel like I made the natural progression from player to vice-captain to captain — and that will be it for me,’ he said. McGinley will, however, be part of the new selection process that will decide on his successor, who will be announced early in the new year. The new five-man committee comprises the last three captains, George O’Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, plus an as yet undetermined member of the Tournament Players’ Committee. The choice is likely to come down between Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez. Europe's Paul McGinley  is sprayed with champagne as he holds the Ryder Cup trophy after beating USA . Europe's Lee Westwood put this photograph on Instagram with the message: 'I have felt better!' Europe's Lee Westwood put this photograph on Instagram with the message: 'I have felt better!' As for the future of the Ryder Cup, McGinley has no fears people will lose interest with Europe winning so often. ‘Everything is going in an upwards direction, from the viewing figures around the world to commercial revenue to general media interest,’ he said. ‘Then you’ve got American pride. They will galvanise themselves. And then you’ve got the fans. Weren’t they amazing? ‘I feel such pride about this Ryder Cup, not on the inside but being able to look around and see people bursting with joy, the spectators high- fiving each other in the stands and everyone with a smile on their face. Everyone is so wrapped up in it and loves it so much, I can’t see a single valid reason why it would decline.’ As for his own future, McGinley is looking forward to playing free of distractions after two years when he has put his heart and soul into the captaincy. He might even play in the Dunhill Links at St Andrews this week. ‘Goodness knows what my swing would be like,’ he said. But his Ryder Cup race is now run, and what a journey it was. Three times a player, twice a vice-captain and finally a captain, with six victories to show from those six Ryder Cups. McGinley leaned forward and placed his hand against Sam Ryder’s precious trophy. ‘Wow. I’ve been a lucky man,’ he said.

"Man of the match Angel di Maria said his award should have gone to Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea after his side recorded back-to-back wins for the first time under Louis van Gaal with a 2-1 win over Everton. Di Maria put United ahead midway through the first half as he fired home from Juan Mata's cross for his third goal of the season. But the Toffees had the chance to level matters at the break after Tony Hibbert was brought down by Luke Shaw on the stroke of half-time. Leighton Baines stepped up to take the resulting penalty and aimed for the bottom left but was thwarted by De Gea, who made a big one-handed save. Manchester United players pose for a happy snap after recording thei first back-to-back wins under Louis van Gaal. From left: Marcos Rojo, Antonio Valencia, Angel di Maria, Juan Mata, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera .

David de Gea raises his hands in joy after the final whistle in the win his immense saves has a big role in . Di Maria (right) and Rafael (left) celebrate Di Maria's goal in the first half of their win against Everton . Baines made up for his mistake 10 minutes into the second half as he picked out Steven Naismith with a pinpoint cross in the centre of the penalty box and the Scot headed home from close range with the equaliser. The hosts were back in front just after the hour mark as Di Maria turned provider for fellow summer recruit Radamel Falcao, who slotted the ball past Tim Howard from six yards out to make it 2-1 with his first United goal. De Gea did well to keep out a two late Leon Osman strikes, one from Gareth Barry and one fantastic effort from Bryan Oviedo as the hosts held on for the three points. Di Maria told BT Sport 1: 'I think David is the guy the who deserves this reward rather than myself he saved us throughout the game and particularly towards the end and the penalty as well so not only him but the rest of the side deserve this.' He also reserved praise for fellow newcomer Falcao and hopes the win is the start of things to come at Old Trafford, adding: 'Yes, it's great for him. 'He's been looking for that first goal for a while now and he's it's very, very important for him now. 'I think not only him but ourselves are on the right road now and the main thing is we're fighting for victories and fighting for points. 'We've got the three points for the day and hopefully we can now move further up the table.' While De Gea was delighted with the result and praised the United defence, saying: 'I think we played a very good game.

De Gea makes a save from Everton's Bryan Oviedo in the dying minutes at Old Trafford . Steven Naismith gets on the end of Leighton Baines' cross to score the equaliser with a diving header . 'I think in the first half we had the possession and we scored a goal and I think in the last 10 minutes they pressed a lot and they had many chances, but I saved their chances and I'm happy for that, for the win. 'I think the back four defenders for the team played very well and of course it was a great match a good three points.' Red Devils boss Van Gaal was pleased with the three points that saw his side move up three places to fourth in the Barclays Premier League table. He was full of praise for De Gea and Di Maria, and said: 'When you hold the penalty out in the dying seconds you hold three magnificent saves, then you are great because you win the game because of that.

After a sensational match, De Gea (centre left) celebrate after the final whistle with Marcos Rojo (right) 'But of course we have to improve in a lot of things and also Di Maria has to improve. When you do that every week - and he does that every week - then we have to be very pleased with him.' Van Gaal hopes his side can continue to play their game into the second half, stressing that his men usually play better over the first 45 minutes. He added: 'It's a little bit strange that every time the first half is very good, we start very good. We have created a lot of chances and I think in the first half we could have (been) 3-0 at half-time and Everton didn't create any chance - maybe the one off (Romelu) Lukaku but I don't think so. 'And the the second half is so different, also with 11 players so I have changed to maintain the organisation and in spite of that, we were not in our organisation any more and that's a pity because normally you can create a lot of chances because Everton want to score and then the space for our attack is very big but we don't take profit of it.' Meanwhile Everton boss Roberto Martinez was disappointed with the referee's decision not to stop the match when midfielder Steve Pienaar was injured, and United went on to score the winner. Everton manager Roberto Martinez gestures to his players during the loss to Man United . On his return from a thigh injury which has sidelined him for the past month, Pienaar left the field after 64 minutes to another problem, two minutes after Falcao's strike which won the match for the home side. Martinez, whose side travelled to Old Trafford after a long trip to southern Russia in the Europa League in midweek where they recorded a 1-1 draw at FK Krasnodar, said: 'We're just disappointed with the second goal really. 'Steven Pienaar was on the ground, we made it clear to the referee to stop the game and he allowed it to play on and it was very, very disappointing. It should have never happened it was a game full of fair play, with both sets of players playing in the right manner and I thought the referee made a major, major error there.' Martinez, whose side did the double against United last season, rued his Eveeton's missed chances towards the end and added: 'It was a very good game and a few chances appeared to open. 'I just felt that David de Gea made two world-class saves that probably stopped us getting a positive result. But even then, I thought that the time we were going forward we were creating and the second-half performance deserved a lot more than what we got.'","Manchester United beat Everton 2-1 with Radamel Falcao scoring the winner .

"John Brown, the brother of Eurovision winner Dana Scallon, is in court charged with five counts of indecent assault . Former Eurovision winner turned politician Dana broke down in tears today as she dismissed allegations of sexual abuse made against her brother as 'lies'. The former Irish presidential candidate took to the witness box for the defence at Harrow Crown Court in Middlesex at the start of the third week of her brother John Brown’s trial. Dana, 62, told the jury she was 'shocked' when she first heard of the claims in 2008 and said the 'completely ridiculous' allegations were made up following a business dispute with one of the alleged victim’s parents. Brown, 60, is charged with five counts of indecent assault against two girls under the ages of 13 and 16 at various times and locations in the 1970s. He denies all the charges. The prosecution allege Dana knew of the alleged abuse of the first victim for more than 30 years but covered it up to protect her celebrity status and family name. Appearing at court for the first time this morning in a black skirt and light brown patterned jacket, the  singer denied ever having been told about the claims, ever speaking to anyone about them or being involved in any form of cover up. Speaking softly and at times becoming emotional, she said she was first made aware of the claims of the first victim, now 47, during a US court battle over the ownership of a shared business interest between herself, Brown and the girl’s mother and father. The allegations were put to Brown during a pre-court deposition in 2008, at which Dana was present. Who knew?:  Dana (left, arriving at Harrow Crown Court today) broke down in tears in courtclaiming that the accusations against her brother John Brown's (right) were all lies . Dana, who was born in Islington, north London in the summer of 1951 as Rosemary Brown, said: 'I was shocked, especially as it was brought up in a case that was completely unrelated. 'It was completely ridiculous.' The court previously heard how family members became aware of the allegations, Brown sought help from a priest named Father Brown, and had to 'eat well, sleep well and watch for the signs' to control his sexual urges towards children.Dana explained to the court the priest had died ten years earlier. She said she had very little contact in the 1970s with the first victim, who is currently suing her for defamation after she said the allegations were 'vile and malicious lies' during a 2011 television interview. Allegations: The court heard that child abuse by John Brown (pictured right, with his sister Dana, centre, and brother Gerald, left) was covered up to preserve the 'honour of the family name' Dana told the court: 'I was particularly careful about what I said…but I said it was vile and untrue lies against a member of my family. It was me being targeted, John was just collateral damage.' The first victim alleges she was abused by Brown when she visited the singer on a summer season in, she believed from her memory, Torquay. But, Dana told the court, she was never visited by the girl at any of her summer seasons in the 1970s and only performed in Torquay in 1980, when she claimed the girl was also not present. During cross-examination Dana said the story was leaked to the Irish media by the girl’s family after they 'decided on the story together' in 2011 to destroy her presidential election bid following a bitter row over the business interest. Dana claims she spoke to her brother about the allegations after they came out at the US court case. Asked if there had been any truth in them and whether she asked him any more about them, she said: 'Absolutely not. I didn’t have to ask him anything else. I knew it wasn’t true.' The trial continues. Those were the days: Dana (pictured left alongside singer Mary Hopkin) won the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest .

The Reverend Andy Kelso, 64, ditched his dog collar to wear a high collar and jewelled white jump suit after saying he had a calling from God. Now, the father of five has been dubbed 'Elvis Priestly' after he stopped preaching from the pulpit to belt out The King’s classics to other churches, packed-out pubs, clubs and old folks homes near his former vicarage. Heart-pray Hotel: The Rev Andy Kelso has quit his job as a vicar to become an Elvis Presley impersonator . And despite his amazing career switch, the Rev Kelso’s Elvis Gospel Tribute Act has become a heavenly hit with his former congregation at Christ Church in Matchborough, near Redditch, Worcestershire. The Rev Kelso - married to hospice nurse Charmian, 62 - said: 'I think people don’t realise that Elvis loved his gospel songs so much. 'My whole desire is to build bridges with people and Elvis, I believe, is a fantastic link. 'I see it as a form of reaching out to people, using the king of rock ‘n’ roll to introduce people to Jesus, hopefully in a way that will be fun.' The Rev Kelso, a grandfather of six whose children are in their 20s and 30s, decided on his career path as an Elvis impersonator last year. He said: 'One day I was out walking the dogs in between church services and I felt God say to me very strongly: 'Take Elvis to the Church. 'It was a shock but after one concert there was a lot of interest from churches who wanted to connect with their communities and my tribute act seems to connect. 'When I play, the venues are packed out and I’ve not looked back since.' He has had some colourful experiences since making his unorthodox career switch. After a recent gig in Worcester he missed a turning and was stopped by police when he did a U-turn. He said: 'The traffic cops asked what I’d been doing and I told them I’d been doing an Elvis tribute act in the church - but they asked if I’d been drinking and I said, ""Hardly - It’s a Methodist church!"" Aisle shook up:  The Rev Andy Kelso said: 'My whole desire is to build bridges with people and Elvis, I believe, is a fantastic link'. He is pictured left outside his church. Right is the real Elvis in Las Vegas, 1973 . 'Eventually they let me go.' His new job is a far cry from his role as vicar, but he admitted that he was an unlikely candidate for the church when he was recruited in the 1970s. He said: 'Let’s just say God has a sense of humour. 'I spent 25 years doing the one thing I vowed I never would - being a vicar. 'Now people who wouldn’t normally come to church are coming to a great evening out with some food for thought.' Love me Amen-der: The priest says he decided on a career as an Elvis impersonator after God told him: 'Take Elvis to the Church' The Rev Kelso’s typical two-hour set showcases the best of Elvis’s career, including his rock, pop and gospel hits. The Scarborough-born preacher has been asked to perform at the Pershore Plum Festival in Worcestershire on August Bank Holiday Monday. He sometimes sings at wedding receptions and opens fetes - often arriving in style in a vintage Rolls-Royce or on the back of a Honda 1500cc Goldwing motorcycle. The Rev Kelso said: 'I sing the songs, then I tell a little about Elvis’s spiritual journey and link it in with mine. People listen and really take it on board. I go wherever I am asked. Rev-turn to Sender: Andy Kelso, in Elvis mode, pictured with wife Charmian . 'I recently went to a care home where most of the patients had dementia. 'I was wondering how I would go down, but as soon as I appeared as Elvis and started singing the residents came alive and started singing and dancing. It was amazing and very humbling.' He added: 'When you listen to Elvis’ gospel songs, they’re just so from the heart and they really seem to speak to people. 'It’s true that for many years he went far away from his Christian roots but he never stopped believing the basics of Christianity. Crying in the Chapel: The Rev Andy Kelso admits he was an unlikely candidate for the church when he was recruited in the 1970s . 'The break-up of his marriage affected him deeply and led to his slide into prescription drugs and junk food but these troubled years also led him to sing more gospel songs.' The Rev Kelso tuned in to the church after he had a near-fatal 75mph motorcycle accident at 19 which caused him to pray for the first time in his life. He intially studied drama before joining the Christian Arts Project, launched by Cliff Richard, where he formed his own theatre company that toured the country. He joined the Church of England as a vicar in 1985 and is now chaplain to Worcester Warriors Rugby Club.

"Artificially created blood could one day replace donations as the norm for blood transfusions. That's according to researchers at the University of Edinburgh who have been using stem cells to create red blood cells. And in 2016 they are planning to conduct a groundbreaking trial that, for the first time, will test artificial blood made from stem cells in patients. A breakthrough in red blood cell production from stem cells could lead to a future where artificial blood is used more regularly than donated blood . The £5 million project is being pioneered by the University of Edinburgh and comes after years of research into growing red blood cells. The process involves using adult skin . or blood cells that have been genetically modified into stem cells, . known as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These . iPS cells are then cultured in biologic conditions that mimic the human . body, eventually leading to their transition into mature red blood . cells. The trick so far has been increasing the . efficiency of this transition process, as not all the cells are capable . of becoming red blood cells. The red blood cells are then separated from the rest of the cells in a centrifuge. Their next step will be to trial the blood in patients in 2016. The process involves using adult skin or blood cells that have been genetically modified into stem cells, known as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These iPS cells are then cultured in biologic conditions that mimic the human body, eventually leading to their transition into mature red blood cells. The trick so far has been increasing the efficiency of this transition process, as not all the cells are capable of becoming red blood cells. The team at the University of Edinburgh has got this efficiency to approaching 50% in a process that takes about a month. The red blood cells are then separated from the rest of the cells in a centrifuge. Their next step will be to trial the blood in patients in 2016. This will most likely be three patients who need regular transfusions due to a red blood cell disorder known as thalassaemia. This graphic shows how the artificial red blood cells are made from stem cells in the team's research . According to Professor Marc Turner, artificial blood could replace donated blood as the norm for transfusions in the next 20 years . Ideally, artificial blood would be made from a person of the rare universal blood type 'O' as this can be transfused into other patients of any blood type. 'Producing a cellular therapy which is of the scale, quality and safety required for human clinical trials is a very significant challenge,' says Professor Marc Turner, medical director at Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) who is leading the study for the University of Edinburgh. 'But if we can achieve success with this first-in-man clinical study it will be an important step forward to enable populations all over the world to benefit from blood transfusions. 'These developments will also provide information of value to other researchers working on the development of cellular therapies.' It was stressed, however, that it will be at least 20 years until artificial blood overtakes donated blood as the source for blood transfusions and that people should not stop donating any time soon. If artificial blood does one day become the norm, however, it is hoped the cost of blood per unit could drop from the current price of £120. Artificial blood may also carry with it health advantages due to blood regeneartion. Blood cells last around 100 days but not all cells are born at the same moment, so donated blood is a mixture of old and new cells. Artifical blood, on the other hand, would be entirely new blood cells. The major problem at the moment is scaling up production from a trial to industrial levels. Nonetheless if the trial proves to be a success, it would be a big step in the right direction towards making blood transfusions more widely available at a reasonable cost. Artificial blood that could one day be used in humans without side-effects was created by scientists in Romania towards the end of last year. The blood contained water and salts along with a protein known as hemerythrin that is extracted from sea worms. Researchers from Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, hope it could help end blood supply shortages and prevent infections through donations. Dr Radu Silaghi-Dumitrescu added that it may even lead to the creation of ‘instant blood’ that can be transported and turns into artificial blood when water is added. So far the artificial blood has been tested on laboratory mice who didn't experience any adverse side effects.","A team at the University of Edinburgh is undertaking a £5million project .

"Lost? This coyote was caught in Manhattan earlier this month. A second one (not pictured) was found in Stuyvesant Town this weekend and taken to the Bronx . Officers from New York's Park's Department captured a coyote in a Manhattan apartment complex. Tranquilizer darts were used to sedate the coyote which was found in Stuyvesant Town on Sunday. Parks officials say the coyote was delivered to Animal Care and Control where she was examined and fed by veterinary staff and released in an 'appropriate wilderness area in the Bronx' Sunday night. Park rangers began efforts to track the coyote after numerous sightings of the critter were made by the public. It is unclear where the Eastern Coyote was from or how it got to one of the densest neighborhoods in the city. Another coyote was caught and released in the Bronx two weeks ago after being found in a Manhattan park. Most coyotes pose no danger to people but the Parks Department advises New Yorkers to never feed or approach one, especially if it shows signs of aggression. 'Although it's often called the concrete jungle, New York City has over 5,000 acres of forest land and is home to an abundance of wildlife,' said city Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver.","Another coyote made its way into Manhattan early Sunday .

"Convicted: Fong Kong Meng, 58, front right, and his wife . Teoh Ching Yen, 56, back centre, at the Shah Alam High Court outside . Kuala Lumpur . A Malaysian couple has been sentenced to death by hanging for starving their maid while she worked at their Kuala Lumpur house. Shah Alam High Court Judge Noor Azian Shaari gave the guilty verdicts to the couple, 58-year old electrician Fong Kong Meng and his 56-year old wife Teoh Ching Yen on Thursday. The New Straits Times reported the couple took the maid to a hospital in June 2011 but doctors declared her dead on arrival. Judge Noor Azian ruled the 26-year old . victim died of starvation because of the couple's failure to provide her . with food or medical treatment. The victim Isti Komariyah, reportedly from East Java, worked for the couple since 2008. At her death, she weighed just 26 kilos, after dropping from 22 kilos. The Judge said the couple's defence did not refute the prosecution's submission regarding the cause of the victim's physical condition and death. The judge added that the couple's submission relied simply on a denial of the charge. The trial started on July 30, 2012, with 16 prosecution witnesses called and six defence witnesses testified. A court official said the convicted couple would appeal the ruling. The BBC reported the case went to court after Malaysia and Indonesia signed an agreement to improve the condition of Indonesian maids in the country. The agreement ensured maids were allowed to keep their own passports and were given at least one day off a week. Indonesia had previously banned citizens from domestic work in Malaysia because of abuse allegations. Guilty: The couple was sentenced to be hanged for murdering Isti Komariyah, an Indonesian maid, by starving her to death. When she died, she weighed just 26 kilos.

"It is the dream of any sci-fi fans and this video shows the hoverbike finally taking off - thanks to a kickstarter campaign and a forward-thinking inventor. The futuristic mode of transport is set to go on sale in Britain soon and this video shows how we could soon all be zipping through the skies. But unfortunately, it's not full-size yet. This hoverbike is only built to a third of the size needed and is actually controlled used a remote. Chris Malloy, the inventor behind the unique design is hoping that he can sell the small prototypes as drones in a bid to fund his dream of creating a version for people to fly. But first he will need to secure an aviation certificate for a manned model. Mr Malloy explained: 'This . drone was originally built as a proof of concept for our latest . full-sized Hoverbike prototype,' said Chris Malloy, the drone's . inventor. 'After . testing the 1/3rd Hoverbike, we realised that it had lots of features . that made it a fantastic drone, not only this - selling this scale .

'The . objective of this campaign is to kick-start sales of our beautiful . 1/3rd scale Hoverbike drone and accessories via your pledges, and to . help create a long term income stream that we can use to continue . development of the manned Hoverbike.' The drone can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, but the full-size model is still under construction. Mr Malloy, of Malloy Aeronautics, . explained: 'When I first got my helicopter licence I realised the . helicopter as a design needs a lot of improvements to be made.' Wanting . to increase reliability and safety, he added: 'Where we strip away . complexity and increase safety, that's where the hoverbike comes from.' The full sized design uses a motorcycle engine and controls. However, the smaller version uses electric motors, and can be controlled using a standard RC helicopter controller.

"Chelsea continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season with a confident 2-0 win over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. A penalty from Eden Hazard, followed by a deft lob from Diego Costa secured the three points in a game that didn't truly trouble the title favourites. Find out how the players rated at Stamford Bridge below: . CHELSEA . THIBAUT COURTOIS - Concussed when he collided with Alexis Sanchez. Never recovered, substituted after 24 minutes and replaced by Petr Cech. 7 . Thibaut Courtois was only able to play 24 minutes of the match, after a clash with Alexis Sanchez . BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - Thrived in the combat. Inevitably made his way into the book for tripping Sanchez. 7 . GARY CAHILL - Classy first half dummy left Sanchez in no-man’s land. Rock solid alongside his captain. 7.5 . JOHN TERRY - Chants about Terry’s off-field indiscretions inspire him. This was a colossal performance by Chelsea’s captain. 8 . John Terry put in a colossal performance at the heart of Chelsea's defence on Sunday afternoon . CESAR AZPILICUETA - Disciplined and focused in a team that loves to keep clean sheets. This was another and he deserved to be part of it. 6.5 . NEMANJA MATIC - Neat and tidy in the centre of midfield, settling in front of Chelsea’s back four whenever they needed him. 6.5 . CESC FABREGAS - Didn’t react, at times under huge provocation from Arsenal fans. Those who applauded him yesterday deserve much credit. Lovely chip for Costa’s goal. 7 . It was a big day for ex-Gunner Cesc Fabregas, playing against his former side in the blue of Chelsea . ANDRE SCHURRLE - Always a threat when he’s on the ball, but the nagging doubt over the winger is that he’s better when he comes on as a substitute. 6 . OSCAR - His movement was top class, eluding defenders and making space for himself. The trouble is that Chelsea didn’t get him on the ball anywhere near enough. 6.5 . EDEN HAZARD - Lovely first half, earning Chelsea’s penalty and then putting the ahead from the penalty spot. Sometimes he operates at another level. 7 . Eden Hazard opened the scoring with a first-half penalty after he was brought down in the box . DIEGO COSTA - The guy is different class when he has a run on goal. His chest down and finish on the run was first class. Chelsea wanted a goal muncher. They have one. 7.5 . SUBSTITUTES: . CECH (Courtois 24) - Composed and calm, he played as though he had never been away. Instant presence in Chelsea’s defence. 7.5 . MIKEL (Schurrle 68) - Brought on to help see the game out for Chelsea, did just that. 6 . WILLIAN (Oscar 87) - Oscar had just been booked, Mourinho wanted to avoid a potential second yellow card. 6 . Subs: Luis, Zouma, Salah, Remy . Booked: Cahill 20, Ivanovic 53, Schurrle 66, Oscar 86 . Scorers: Hazard 27, Costa 78 . ARSENAL . WOJCIECH SZCZESNY: Beaten by Hazard’s penalty, but didn’t have a great deal to do beyond that. 6.5 . CALUM CHAMBERS - Not a great game. Booked early for a foul on Hazard, could easily have been sent off for tripping Schurrle before half time. 5 . PER MERTESACKER - Couple of decent interceptions on an afternoon when the Arsenal defender couldn’t take his eyes off Diego Costa. 6.5. LAURENT KOSCIELNY - Dreadful. Hazard’s mazy run took him past two Arsenal players and then Koscielny chopped him inside the area. Daft, daft, challenge. 4 . Laurent Koscielny had a terrible game, pictured lagging behind Diego Costa as he puts Chelsea 2-0 up . KIERAN GIBBS -  Desperate to get forward, but he had Andre Schurrle for company down Arsenal’s left. Still, rarely beaten. 6.5 . MATHIEU FLAMINI - Never quite sure whether he was supposed to be tracking Oscar’s runs or leaving it to someone else. Decent enough, without making an impact. 6.5 . MESUT OZIL - Improved in the second half with a couple of slinky runs, but this was a long way from his performance at Aston Villa. 6 . Mesut Ozil's performance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday was far from his impressive game at Aston Villa . JACK WILSHERE - Superb lob wedge into Alexis Sanchez that sadly led to Courtois’ injury. To his credit, tried to drive his team on. 7 . SANTI CAZORLA -Limited impact on the game, he couldn’t keep up with the pace and Arsenal couldn’t get him on the ball enough. Substituted. 5.5 . ALEXIS SANCHEZ - Frustrated whenever he sprinted forward, looked round to find to his surprise that he had noone in support. This isn’t how they play at Barcelona. 6.5 . DANNY WELBECK - Barely had a kick against two of the toughest central defenders in the Premier League. The very best strikers fined a way whoever their opponents are. Booked for naughty challenge on Fabregas. 5 . Danny Welbeck struggled to get into the game, and capped it off with a late, naughty challenge on Fabregas . SUBSTITUTES . OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN (Cazorla 69) - Sprightly, energetic performance but didn’t get a decent chance. 6 . ROSICKY (Wilshere 83) - Nowhere near enough time to get into the game. 6.5 . PODOLSKI (Sanchez 79) - Little time to make any impact. 6 . Subs: Martinez, Monreal, Campbell, Coquelin. Booked: Chambers 22, Koscielny 27, Welbeck 90+1 . Star man: John Terry - 8 . Referee: Martin Atkinson - 7 . Jose Mourinho: 7.5 . Arsene Wenger: 5 .","Eden Hazard opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the first half .

Clever: Mr and Mrs Henderson said they could see straight away how intelligent Arbor was . 'Neither one of us are artists so we had to learn about the craft as Arbor became interested in it.'We were just looking for a companion and had no idea how much Arbor would change our lives. 'We saw right away how intelligent Arbor was, picking up tricks with ease and mastering them. My wife decided to try something a little more challenging, painting. 'With lots of positive reinforcement she learned to take the brush in her mouth, walk to the canvas and brush back and forth at just the right distance to make beautiful strokes. 'Since then she has only improved, becoming more creative with her strokes and picking up the brush on her own.' Arbor has since performed live on television and before audiences at fundraising events. She even painted in front of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.

"Teachers should work words like ‘gay’ into their lessons to fight homophobic bullying, an official report suggests. Schools can make a ‘positive impact’ by incorporating lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the curriculum from reception class up. The study, commissioned by the Government Equalities Office and supported by the Department for Education, also highlights how staff can improve the ‘visibility’ of LGBT people in schools by discussing topics such as diver Tom Daley ‘coming out’ as gay. Scroll down for video . Staff can improve the 'visibility' of gay people in schools by talking about topics such as Tom Daley coming out . The report’s authors suggest that children as young as four or five should be taught about LGBT issues. The report was published yesterday as Education Secretary Nicky Morgan unveiled a £2million drive to tackle homophobic bullying. The cash will pay for charities and volunteer groups to run training projects aimed at stamping out this kind of abuse in schools. The DfE press release announcing the scheme admits that ‘reports of homophobic bullying are in decline, but there is still work to do’. It promotes the NatCen Social Research study, saying initiatives shown to work include a ‘whole-school approach to homophobic bullying’. Making lesbian, gay and transgender people ‘more visible’ within school by discussing ‘popular culture events’ helped make such pupils ‘feel less isolated and alone’, the report says, adding: ‘The diver Tom Daley’s “coming out” was given as an example of this, which promoted prolonged and memorable discussions in one secondary school.’ Mrs Morgan the Education Secretary launched the £2million fund to help tackle homophobic bullying in schools . Mrs Morgan said: ‘This funding will help schools take on the challenge of making sure bullies do not stand in the way of our young people achieving their full potential.’ But Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said it was a thinly veiled campaign to promote homosexuality. He added: ‘Parents will be disturbed to see the education system being used to advance what is a highly politicised agenda and even more alarmed at the prospect of LGBT issues being introduced in all lessons from as early as reception.’","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan launched a £2m fund to help tackle homophobic bullying in schools .

"Five years ago Peggielene Bartels was working as a secretary just outside Washington D.C. She lived in a humble one-bedroom apartment and when she was not typing letters and answering phone calls, she spent her time cooking and completing household chores.

Reigning monarch: The new king is lifted high in a royal palanquin so all the people can see her. A royal red umbrella is lifted above her head to protect her from the sun . On the other end of the line was her cousin, from Otuam, a small fishing village on the coast of . Ghana. And in that brief conversation on a warm summer's night, the 55-year-old was congratulated on being the new king of Otuam. 'I said, ""listen, it's 4 o'clock . in the morning in the U.S., I am very tired, let me sleep,"" remembers . Bartels. 'I thought he was trying to really play games with me.' The previous king of the African village, who was Bartel's uncle, has just passed away. The village elders, who remembered Bartles from the times she had visited with her mother, had taken a liking to her and decided to anoint her as their new ruler. Bartels took it as her calling and decided to accept the kingship, becoming the first female king of Otuam, reigning over approximately 7,000 people.

The king of Otuam wears an unusual headdress and African dress after being told she has been appointed ruler . King Peggy was no longer the same ordinary administrative assistant who had worked for nearly three decades at the Ghanian Embassy in the United States. Bartels, who was interviewed by CNN, said: 'It never ever occurred to me [that I'd be Otuam's king]. 'I realized that on this earth, we all . have a calling. We have to be ready to accept it because helping my . people has really helped me a lot to know that I can really touch their . lives.'

But after inheriting the throne, Bartels still works at the Ghanian Embassy in the U.S. And for a month every year, she uses all her holiday to spend a month in Otuam. For 11 months of the year she types letters, answers phone calls and books appointments. In her small apartment she cooks, does the laundry, makes her own bed and drives herself. For the one remaining month of the year she is called king (the traditional title of Otuam's ruler), and stands outs as a gold crown-wearing scepter-holding king who lives in a grand palace. Villagers bow to her when they see her and she is often addressed to as 'Nana' - an honorary title given to royalty and women with grandchildren.

Sometimes I say to them ""please, don't bow."" Bartels says life in the African fishing village is not all about luxury, especially in an impoverished community like Otuam. King Peggy writes: 'Here I am with the pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church, Be Louis Colleton, at the Covenant Ceremony in May 2010. Happy Day!' When she is there - and even when she is not - she works to improve the lives of her people. She adds: 'To be a king in an African village or some places like this, it's not like European queens where everything is on a silver platter for them. 'I have to really work hard to help my people. I have to give myself to people to better their lives.' Her successes so far include helping poor families pay school fees and installing computers in classrooms.

"A top technology guru at the Department of Health and Human Services told Congress on Tuesday that the government is nowhere near ready to close the deal on new Obamacare signups, with just '60 to 70 per cent' of the website's internal engine built so far. HHS has promised that the website will be full functional by November 30, although White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the Obama administration would consider the effort successful if four out of five consumers could successfully enroll in insurance plans. Testimony from Henry Chao, the Deputy Chief Information Officer at HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, indicates that this is because the government's tech gurus still can't process payments. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testified that more than half of the Obamacare website's back-end computer processing systems are still unfinished . Inquisitor: Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardner was shocked to learn how little of the Obamacare website's back-end was ready for launch . 'We still need to build the payments systems to make the payments to [insurance policy] issuers in January,' Chao told members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Under questioning by Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, he said more than half of the tech systems that operate behind the scenes when consumers shop for insurance at healthcare.gov still aren't completed. 'How much do we have to build today, still?' Gardner asked. 'I mean, what do we need to build? 50 per cent? 40 per cent? 30 per cent?' 'I think it's – uh, just an approximation,' Chao answered, 'we're probably sitting somewhere about 60 and 70 percent.' 'Unbelievable': Gardner was incredulous to learn how much of the Obamacare system still lacks the computer support to process payments and keep the books . An incredulous Gardner asked him to confirm that the '60 to 70 per cent' number represented the incomplete sections of the website. Chao didn't dispute the number, but the Department of Health and Human Services did later in the day, telling Buzzfeed that the numbers were reversed. Chao also clarified that the consumer portion – what Americans see when they visit the website – is '100 per cent there.' Those functions include the capacity for consumers to complete a basic enrollment in the Obamacare system, compare health care plans and determine their eligibility for government subsidies. But 'the back office systems, the accounting systems [and] the payment systems,' he conceded, are not ready for prime time. Those systems include one that makes government subsidy payments directly to insurance companies on behalf of consumers who qualify. When the federal government released statistics on November 13 showing the number of Americans who had selected health insurance plans through healthcare.gov, it omitted any mention of how many had made actual purchases.","Accounting and other 'back office' systems are nowhere near ready, said a top HHS tech guru .

"Girls will be boys and boys will be girls, but a little-known Brazilian insect takes role reversal to a whole new level. The cave-dwelling Neotrogla female sports an impressive ‘penis’, which she uses to mate with her male partner. And bizarrely he is blessed with what the researchers describe as a ‘much-reduced, vagina-like opening.' A little-known Brazilian insect takes role reversal to a whole new level, scientists have learned. The cave-dwelling Neotrogla female sports an impressive penis, which she uses to 'mate' with her male partner . As if that . does not make the Brazilian insect's sex life interesting enough, . copulation between the two sexes can last up to 70 hours. 'Although sex-role reversal has been identified in several different animals, Neotrogla is the only example in which the intromittent organ is also reversed,' said lead scientist Dr Kazunori Yoshizawa, from Hokkaido University in Japan. A study of four species of the Neotrogla genus showed that the penis-like structure of the female, called a gynosome, is inserted into males and used to receive capsules of nutrient and sperm. Once within a male, part of the gynosome inflates and projects spines which anchor the two insects together. The scientists found it impossible to pull coupling males and females apart without causing injury. Their description of Neotrogla's strange mating habits is published in the journal Current Biology. Scientists described four insect species that dwell in extremely dry caves in Brazil, feed on bat guano and possess what the researchers called an 'evolutionary novelty.' The females have an elaborate, penis-like organ while the males have a vagina-like opening into which females insert their organ during mating sessions that last 40 to 70 hours. The researchers said these attributes make the four species of the insect genus Neotrogla unique in the world. 'Evolution of novelties like a female penis is exceptionally rare. That's why I was really surprised to see the structure,' Yoshizawa said. These are Neotrogla curvata insects in copula, which can last for up to 70 hours. The Neotrogla insects are small - 0.1 to 0.15 inches long (2.5 to 3.8 mm) - and superficially look like flies . Yoshizawa said that although sex-role reversal has been documented in several different types of animals, these insects are the sole example in which the 'intromittent organ' - the male sex organ - is reversed. The Neotrogla insects are small - 0.1 to 0.15 inches long (2.5 to 3.8 millimetres) - and superficially look like flies, with nothing particularly unusual about their appearance aside from their genital structures. In other penis-related news, a man from Bristol announced he needs money to save his pet tortoise. Four-year-old tortoise Cedric has a prolapsed penis. The condition can be caused by mating injuries or constant arousal. Owner . Miles Jelfs says he can't afford the operation - which could involve a . tuck or complete amputation - and is hoping well-wishers will donate. Yoshizawa said the females of Neotrogla can hold male mates coercively using their gynosome. 'Because the female anchoring force is very strong, a male's strong resistance may cause damage to his genitalia,' Yoshizawa said. 'Therefore, it is very likely that entire mating processes are controlled actively by females, whereas males are rather passive.' A Brazilian researcher who was studying cave ecosystems first came across the insects, then enlisted an insect expert to examine the previously unknown bugs. It was at that point that the unique attributes of the female Neotrogla were discovered, leading to the current study. Yoshizawa cited other unusual examples of sex organs among animals, including female seahorses that use an organ to deposit eggs within a male's brood pouch and a kind of mite whose females have a long genital tube. By the definition of female - an organism that produces egg cells that are larger than the sperm cells produced by males - 'even with the penis-like intromittent organ, females of Neotrogla are still female,' Yoshizawa said. But Yoshizawa added: 'Females of Neotrogla likely represent the most ""macho"" females among animals discovered to date.'","Scientists have discovered a cave-dwelling insect that has roles reversed .

"Paul Smith's bid to become the WBO super middleweight champion ended in misery after he was outpointed by Arthur Abraham and then disrespected by the judges all in one night. It was always going to be a big ask for Smith, in his first world title fight, getting a decision in Germany against a champion like Abraham, fighting for the world crown for the 19th time. But he started like a train and then ended like one, giving him, his team, the 1,000 Brits in the Sparkassen Arena and the many supporting back in England hope that he may have scraped a draw, maybe even nicked a sensational win with a stirring late surge. Arthur Abraham beat Paul Smith on points to retain his WBO Super-Middleweight title . Smith was unable to get the better of Abraham and was behind on all of the judges scorecards . Smith looks distraught during the post-fight press conference following his defeat by Abraham . Wayne Rooney: Why have judges if they don't judge correctly. Robbing people of their dreams. The boxing board has to act. Gary Lockett: Absolute nonsense, there has to be something done about these type of decisions. Paul Smith should be WBO champion tonight. Plain cheating. Tony Bellew: Once again the officiating is being spoken about! Disgraceful scoring! Hold your head high mate. Poor poor judging! Frankie Gavin: I had Paul by a round. Wouldn't of moaned at a draw but no way he lost. Haroon Khan: Feel for Paul Smith, thought he won that. Chin up champ you boxed well and done everyone proud mate. Deserved to be champion of the world. However, all three judges gave it to Abraham, two by six rounds and a score of 117-111 and the third a frankly ridiculous 119-109 by Spanish judge Fernando Laguna. It was a bitter end to such an absorbing spectacle as Smith, who had said in the build-up that the 'stars aligned' for him this time, set about the fading yet dangerous champion. Abraham punched hard but not all that often, although he seemed to hurt Smith at times and arguably did enough to win the fight and retain his WBO belt. But the way in which the judges scored the bout, so thrilling and competitive at times, is another serious blow to the credibility of the sport. Smith, incredulous, said: 'What can you do? It's disgusting. It's the main thing I hate about boxing. Most of them have never fought and they're robbing kids of life changing opportunities. Smith put in a good performance in Germany, but it was not reflected in the judges scorecards . Smith lost on all three scorecards, 117-111, 117-111 and 119-109 . 'I proved I'm not British level. I did some things wrong but I did a lot of it right. I was outworking him every round for me. I was shading a lot of the rounds. It's Germany, I well and truly got my fingers burnt.' Matthew Macklin and Martin Murray have both been on the end of wrong decisions in Germany and Smith¹s trainer here, Joe Gallagher, was in the corner for the Macklin fight, which took place in Cologne a little over three years ago. He knows what happens here. But he had watched hours and hours of footage of the champion in action, both his more devastating middleweight days but also some of his less impressive victories at the 168lb super-middleweight limit. In watching Abraham at his best and worst, Gallagher had formulated a game plan which he and Smith were confident would be enough to dethrone 'King Arthur'. Abraham and Smith's fight was a lot closer than the judges scorecards suggested . And it worked early on with Smith setting a frenetic pace against Abraham, who, as is his trademark, threw punches only occasionally. There was an argument that the challenger won the first two rounds but then the champion found his stride. The message from Gallagher throughout the week had been to 'stay with' Abraham, once considered one of the planet's most ferocious punchers. It meant that the Liverpudlian was absorbing an awful lot of punishment and also losing the middle rounds. But much of the build-up had been dominated by the accusation that Abraham had not taken this fight seriously and he struggled to boil down to the 168lb super-middleweight limit. As revealed by Sportsmail this week, the Berlin-Based Armenian had been regularly spotted running in a sweat suit along the Baltic coast here in Kiel - an old-school method of draining out the final few pounds. And, whether it was a question of conditioning or just his usual style, Abraham certainly faded towards the end, giving Smith and his team renewed hope. However, all of that was crushed when the scores were announced and Smith's fate sealed. Smith looks devastated as the scores are read out after his defeat to Abraham . Abraham held onto his WBO Super-Middleweight with a points win over Smith in Germany . But the 31-year-old, once considered the forgotten man of the British super-middleweight scene after knock-out defeats to younger pair George Groves and James DeGale, proved here in Kiel that he belongs at world level. Earlier, Matthew Macklin got his career back on track by outpointing Spaniard Jose Yebes over eight rounds in his first fight under the banner of Matchroom. Macklin signed with Eddie Hearn back in July and was supposed to headline a big homecoming show in Dublin on August 31. However when his trainer, Jamie Moore, was shot in Marbella less than a month before the fight, the whole card was cancelled. But he finally made his bow here in the opening bout of the evening, and his first fight for 10 months. There were some definite signs of rust against the tough 35-year-old. Macklin¹s was the more eye-catching work but there was no denying that he got tagged more than he would have wanted but did enough to claim the victory. The third Brit in action in Kiel was Swindon cruiserweight Luke Watkins, managed by George Groves and trained by Paddy Fitzpatrick, who was boxing for the second time in a week after making his debut at Wembley last Saturday. He moved to 2-0 with a points victory over four threes, against a late stand-in Martin Horak.","Arthur Abraham beats Paul Smith on points to retain WBO Super-middleweight title .

"Eurocrats are about to demand an ‘outrageous’ budget increase of up to 12 per cent – three times the rate of inflation. This means Britain’s contribution to running the EU – already £15.3billion a year – will rise by another £2billion. The budget, being finalised by the European Commission, is a clear rebuff to David Cameron’s calls for belt-tightening in Brussels. It will leave every family here handing over a total of nearly £700 a year to Europe just as they face an income squeeze. Discussion: Prime Minister David Cameron greets President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso outside 10 Downing Street, London, this week . Armed with a gas mask and a big wooden stick this protester challenges the police in Athens yesterday . Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso also wants to raid Britain’s budget rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, which saves taxpayers £3billion a year. The Prime Minister had called for the EU budget to rise by no more than inflation. But under proposals to be published this week, the Commission wants it to go up from £113.5bn by between £9billion and £14billion in the seven years between 2014 and 2020. ‘That’s the range that’s being looked at,’ an EU source said. ‘It won’t be far off a 10 per cent increase one way or the other.’ Extravagant: David Cameron recently expressed his frustration about the huge amount of money being spent to develop a new EU building . If Mr Barroso opts for the higher . number, it will mean the amount paid to Brussels by every family in . Britain will increase from £612 a year to £688 annually. Over the seven year period of the budget, the total extra cost to British households will be £532. The Commission plans are still being . thrashed out, but even the lower figures that are under consideration . will be fiercely opposed by the Government. It marks the start of a year of . horse-trading. Britain cannot veto the plans without support of other EU . nations, though France and Germany have joined Mr Cameron in calling . for a real terms freeze. A Treasury source said: ‘This would be an outrageous demand. ‘It is far too large when we need to see . restraint. The rebate is not up for negotiation. The case for the . rebate is as strong as ever. The Prime Minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Mr Barroso last week and warned him that Britain will not accept a high budget demand at a time when voters are having to ensure a period of austerity at home. The Commission President made clear that he has to listen to all 27 member states and many want to see spending increase because they receive massive subsidies from rich countries such as the UK. Christine Lagarde answers reporters questions yesterday after she was chosen to lead the IMF . Since the bailouts paid to Portugal and Ireland are in part underwritten by the EU budget, the prospect of one of them defaulting could lead to further demands for cash. Mats Persson, director of think-tank Open Europe which wants reform of the EU, said: ‘Any increase above the rate of inflation would clearly be unacceptable, given the continuous austerity around Europe and the exceptionally poor value for taxpayers’ money the EU budget provides. ‘If the increase is anywhere close to the figures being suggested, that would be politically explosive and a major own goal for the Commission.’ Eurosceptics said that on the budget, the EU was running rings around the Government. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘These grotesque demands show not just how out of touch the European Commission are, but how they feel they can lord it over us. ‘The Commission can demand ever larger sums of money and, whoever is in government, we don’t seem to have any clout to rein them in. ‘This will fuel the debate about whether we should stay in the EU at all.’ However, there was some good news for the Government when French finance minister Christine Lagarde was named head of the International Monetary Fund. The Chancellor George Osborne was the first to publicly back her. ‘I am deeply honoured by the trust placed in me,’ said Miss Lagarde, whose five-year term begins on July 5. Chancellor George Osborne said Miss Lagarde’s appointment was ‘good news for the global economy and for Britain’. While not a trained economist, she has made her mark as the first woman finance minister of a major world economy by surrounding herself with strong advisers and by using her impeccable English and media savvy to get her message out.","EU demand is three times the rate of inflation .

"A Christian school which claims it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies has urged the government to revise controversial ‘British values’ rules. Trinity Christian School has been told by Ofsted it is not adequately meeting the ‘spiritual, moral, social and cultural development’ of pupils. This is because it is not ‘actively’ promoting other faiths in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal in Birmingham, by asking different religious representatives to lead lessons and assemblies. John Charles, chairman of governors at the small, co-educational independent school in Reading, has now written to Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, appealing for the new regulations to be reviewed. Trinity Christian School claims it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies  (picture posed by models) He claims that the school’s aims are being undermined and it will be prevented in future from ‘teaching in accordance with our Christian foundation’. The school is backed by the national religious liberty charity, the Christian Institute. It has already warned that the new rules intended to combat extremism are having ‘disturbing consequences’ for religious schools and forcing Ofsted inspectors to act in a way which undermines their ethos. In November, Ofsted inspectors described the school’s provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development as ‘excellent’. They said pupils were ‘well prepared for life in modern, multicultural, democratic British society through the teaching of the Christian principle to 'love thy neighbour'’. This summer, the school, which has fees of £11,880-a-year, applied to the Department for Education to extend its age range to include pupils from nine to 11. As a result, it was re-inspected by Ofsted in October. In his letter, Mr Charles claimed the inspection focused predominantly on revised Independent School Standards regarding spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. This included whether the school could demonstrate evidence of actively promoting ‘the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs’. He said: ‘We understand that the revised standards only came into force on 29 September and are held out as the Government’s response to radicalism and extremism.’ This issue ‘dominated’ the inspector’s questions and ‘at no point were any questions asked about other aspects of the curriculum or the quality of teaching assessed through lesson observations’. Mr Charles continued: ‘In expressing doubt over the school’s continued existence, the inspector stated: that representatives of other faiths should be invited to lead assemblies and lessons in order for the school to demonstrate compliance with the Standards.’ The school was also told, that in order to comply with the new regulations, it should ‘actively’ promote other faiths, and the principles of the Equality Act 2010. This meant not stating ‘certain lifestyles are wrong’ or promoting a ‘particular lifestyle’. Mr Charles said: ‘From November 2013 to October 2014 the school has continued the same provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development which Ofsted adjudged excellent in November 2013. ‘Yet, immediately following the introduction of the revised school standards, the school is threatened with the prospect of closure. We cannot understand how such a change in thinking can take place within a year. ‘It is an explicit aim of ours to encourage pupils to serve and respect other people, appreciate different cultures and ideas and equip them for life in society. ‘But the comments made by Ofsted, as a result of the new regulations, undermine our aims and would prevent us from teaching in accordance with our Christian foundation.’ Mr Charles added: ‘We are therefore extremely concerned about where the new school standards leave the protections afforded by the Equality Act and our school’s charitable objects as established in the deed trust.’ The school has been told by Ofsted it is not adequately meeting the ‘spiritual development’ of pupils. Pictured, Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw . The school, which aims to ‘provide each pupil with a Biblical understanding’ has received an ‘advice note’ from Ofsted, confirming it ‘does not meet the new requirements’. But Simon Calvert, deputy director of The Christian Institute, said the law ‘has long respected the ability of religious schools to prioritise the teaching of their own faith’. He said: ‘In this case, a Christian school, with Christian teachers and a Christian ethos - paid for by Christian parents - is being told they should have other religious leaders come in and lead collective worship. ‘Many Christian families would simply not want to subject their children to that.’ He added ‘What we need, is to go back to the drawing board to actually talk to stakeholders, talk to faith schools, find out where they’re coming from and come up with a set of proposals which don’t require them to promote beliefs which profoundly go against their own.’ In June, the government launched a consultation on proposed new Independent School Standards. This stated that schools ‘most actively promote’ fundamental British values, ‘including furthering tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions and encouraging respect for democracy. It added: ‘A minimum approach, for example putting up posters on a notice board and organising an occasional visit to places of worship would fall short of ‘actively promoting’. ‘Schools will be expected to focus on, and be able to show how their work with pupils is effective in embedding fundamental British values.’ An Ofsted spokeswoman said last night: ‘The independent school standards are set by the Department for Education. ‘Inspectors must check that independent schools follow these. The standards have been strengthened since this school was previously inspected in November 2013. ‘One of Her Majesty’s Inspectors to visited the school at the request of the Department for Education and found it had further work to do to prepare pupils for life in modern Britain. ‘Ofsted did not threaten the school with closure and has no powers to close schools.’ ‘If the school is concerned about the conduct of an inspector or that an inspection is faulty, it should follow Ofsted's formal machinery for raising those concerns. The department will consider the Ofsted report when we receive it.’","Trinity Christian School said to be failing new 'Trojan Horse' requirements .

At a Veteran’s Day parade, military service member Andy Wallace told Charlotte 14 News: ‘That’s a tough pill to swallow, not only for the military, but for America.’ Indiscretions aside, Broadwell has a series of accomplishments under her belt. A graduate of West Point Academy, she went on to travel to Afghanistan and conduct research at Harvard. 'I'm proud to have her as a neighbor. She is a very smart and accomplished woman. Life . will go on. Sometimes people make mistakes that pain their lives.' -Neighbor Ed Williams . She first met fellow West Point graduate David Petraeus in the spring of 2006, when she was a graduate student at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He was a lieutenant general working on a counterinsurgency manual that would be tested during his command in Iraq. The university had invited him to give a speech. Broadwell was in the Army Reserve after being recalled three times to active duty since the Sept. 11 attacks to work on counterterrorism issues and intended to return to active duty or get into the policy world, according to the preface of the Petraeus biography she would later write with a Washington Post editor. Petraeus, who held much-praised military commands in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned Friday after admitting he had an extramarital affair, a disclosure that ended the retired four-star general's civilian career as director of the CIA. He carried on the affair with Broadwell, now 40, according to several U.S. officials with knowledge of the situation. Husband and wife: Paula Broadwell pictured with her husband and father of her children, Scott, a radiologist . Publicity tour: Broadwell appeared on C-SPAN2 in February to discuss her biography . The FBI discovered the relationship by monitoring Petraeus' emails, after investigators were alerted that Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account, two of the officials said. Broadwell wrote in the preface to 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,' published by Penguin in January, that while at Harvard, Petraeus passed along his card and offered to help her academic work on leadership. The book's ranking on Amazon.com jumped from 76,792 on Friday to 111 by midday Saturday. 'I later discovered that he was famous for this type of mentoring and networking, especially with aspiring soldier-scholars,' Broadwell wrote, adding that 'I took full advantage of his open-door policy to seek insight and share perspectives.' Broadwell is a research associate at Harvard's Center for Public Leadership and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, according to her biography on Penguin's website. According to The Bismarck Tribune, she grew up in North Dakota and moved to Charlotte, more than three years ago with her husband and their two young sons. 'Claws In': Paula Broadwell and David Petraeus, pictured, reportedly had an affair that led to his resignation . Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . The book began as research for her dissertation, a case study of Petraeus' leadership. It evolved into an authorized biography written with Washington Post editor Vernon Loeb after President Barack Obama put Petraeus in charge of Afghanistan in 2010. Two years earlier, she wrote in the book's preface, while visiting Washington he had invited her to join him and his team for a run along the Potomac River. 'I'd earned varsity letters in cross-country and indoor and outdoor track and finished at the top of my class for athletics at West Point; I wanted to see if he could keep stride during an interview. Instead it became a test for me,' she wrote. He eventually increased the pace 'until the talk turned to heavy breathing, and we reached a six-minute-per-mile pace. 'It was a signature Petraeus move. I think I passed the test, but I didn't bother to transcribe the interview.' In the Army Reserve, she specialized in military intelligence, spending time at the U.S. Special Operations Command and the FBI Counterterrorism Task Forces before pursuing an academic career, according to her Penguin bio. She 'lived, worked, or traveled in more than 60 countries during more than 15 years of military service and work in geopolitical analysis and counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations,' her bio states. Embedded: Broadwell, pictured in Afghanistan, has more than a decade of U.S. military service . Broadwell made multiple trips to Afghanistan, with unprecedented access to Petraeus, and also spent time with his commanders across the country. When Petraeus left the military and took the job at the CIA, Broadwell kept in contact with him and sometimes was invited to his office for events such as his meeting with actress Angelina Jolie. 'History has yet to fully judge Petraeus' service in Iraq and Afghanistan, his impact on the U.S. military and his rank among America's wartime leaders,' Broadwell wrote in the preface. 'But there is no denying that he achieved a great deal during his 37-year Army career, not the least of which was regaining the strategic initiative in both wars' after September 11, 2001. 'His critics fault him for ambition and self-promotion. I will note in the pages that follow that he is driven and goal-oriented, but his energy, optimism and will to win stand out more for me than the qualities seized on by his critics.' In an interview with The Bismarck Tribune shortly after the biography was published, Broadwell said Petraeus was a motivational force not only for organizations but individuals as well. 'He inspires people of all ages to improve themselves. On that note, I would conclude that his sheer energy whether applied to soldiering, scholarly pursuits, public outreach or mentoring can be equally empowering for an organization or an individual subordinate,' Broadwell said. With the book done, Broadwell told friends she was returning to her dissertation, using part of her research on Petraeus to complete her doctorate.","On Saturday, the upscale brick home of the Broadwells was empty .

"Sam Burgess ensured he'll leave the South Sydney Rabbitohs with an indelible place in the club's folklore after playing almost the entire NRL Grand Final with a fractured cheek bone. The England forward, playing in his final NRL match before moving to Bath in the Aviva Premiership, clashed heads with countryman James Graham in the opening minute after taking the first hit-up of the match against Canterbury-Bankstown. His heroics were made all the more sweet as the Rabbitohs went on to claim their first title in 43 years with a dominant 30-6 victory over the Bulldogs. It was later confirmed Burgess is to undergo surgery. Sam Burgess (left)  played on with a suspected broken cheekbone for South Sydney in the NRL Grand Final .

Burgess got up from that initial contest spitting blood but played on in a move reminiscent of Rabbitohs great John Sattler, who famously broke his jaw in the third minute of the 1970  final. Straight away Burgess appeared to inform trainers that his cheekbone or jaw had been damaged. And he confirmed the case on his way off the field at half-time when asked by Channel Nine commentator Brad Fittler how his cheek was. Burgess replied: 'It's f---ed. It's gone.' After the drought-breaking win, he added: 'I knew I'd broke it straight away. The side of my face just felt numb. My head was a little bit dizzy and I had a bit of blurred vision. But we just covered for each other and there were a lot of guys out there helping me through it. There was not a chance I was missing out.'

Julie Burgess poses with her Rabbitohs sons (from left) Sam, Luke, George and Tom . Burgess takes a big hit during the NRL Grand Final at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney . Despite obvious discomfort Burgess was immense in the first stanza, making 113 metres, two offloads, a tackle break, 18 tackles without missing a single one and 13 runs, the most of the half. The Rabbitohs' job was far from done at the break with a slender 6-0 lead courtesy of an Adam Johnston try and a penalty from Adam Reynolds, and Burgess returned to continue bossing the forwards battle in the second period. The Bulldogs hit back with a try to Tony Williams, converted by Trent Hodkinson, but the Bunnies were back in the lead after a bulldozing run and try from Sam's brother George.

Another conversion and then a penalty for Reynolds took the score to 14-6, before tries from Kirisome Auva'a, Reynolds and finally Inglis in the closing 10 minutes saw the scoreline blow out. Burgess broke down in tears even before the final whistle blew with the Rabbitohs locking up the title 30-6 with a late flurry of tries. When Greg Inglis crossed in the last play of the game 'Slammin' Sam' was offered the conversion attempt from the sideline and only narrowly missed his kicked to the left of the upright. Asked if he'll be missing out on the Rabbitohs' Mad Monday victory celebrations, Burgess said: 'I'd imagine so. The doc seems to be thinking surgery ... We'll see how it goes, but I'd imagine I'll be getting it fixed in the next 24 hours. I guess the joy is overriding the pain at the moment.' 'I wasn't really listening to what (the doctor) was saying. The teammates really helped me through the process. I'm just really happy for the team ... it's been a great effort all year.' There was no animosity between Burgess and Graham, who in the aftermath of the match has been painted the villain to his opposite number's hero. 'James is a great competitor and I've got a lot of respect for him as a guy and a competitor. I just told him [at fulltime] I'm going to miss him. He's a friend I'll have forever, but that's all that was said.'","Sam Burgess clashed with James Graham in first minute of Grand Final .

'Please do not leave your homes this morning. Go to the strongest part of your house, which is usually the bathroom area. Take clothes and mattresses. Make sure your children are safe. Your safety now is paramount,' she said. 'Over the next few hours, many Queenslanders are going to go through a harrowing and terrifying experience. We will be standing by your side.

"Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Jamie Donaldson played starring, stirring roles as Europe’s golfers romped to an eighth Ryder Cup victory in the last 10 contests. The USA, by contrast, were publicly melting down as recriminations began to fly over the reasons for their latest dismal failure. Europe’s overnight lead of 10-6 was extended to a final tally of 16½-11½, with McIlroy thrashing Rickie Fowler to put Europe’s first point of the day on the board and McDowell coming from three down against Jordan Spieth for the second. Tom Watson has seen his leadership of the US team at the Ryder Cup criticised by one of his players . Phil Mickelson (centre) is a veteran of 10 Ryder Cups and laid into the way his captain ran things . VIDEO Donaldson hits Ryder Cup winner . It was Welshman Jamie Donaldson who delivered the winning point, and he did so in sensational fashion by hitting his approach to the 15th within a foot of the hole. 'I can’t really put words to it. It is unbelievable' said the 38-year-old, moments after his clincher had prompted a handshake on the fairway between Europe’s captain Paul McGinley and his opposite number Tom Watson. While McGinley was quickly at the heart of ecstatic European celebrations and receiving lavish praise from his players, Watson was being derided by senior members of his own team. In one of the more extraordinary sporting press conferences, Phil Mickelson outlined in detail how the USA had failed to prepare for any Ryder Cup in a suitable fashion since they last won, at Valhalla in 2008. The captain then was Paul Azinger, who Mickelson said had got his team 'invested in the process' and 'had a game plan'. The implication was Watson had done neither. Watson gestures to the crowd at the closing ceremony as Paul McGinley watches on from the sidelines . Watson was criticised by not reverting to the successful formula used in 2008's victory . Unconfirmed reports suggested another member of the USA staff had been overheard talking about Watson in derogatory terms and questioning his selections. Both Mickelson and Keegan Bradley were dropped for the entirety of Saturday and Bradley admitted: ‘It was a bummer.’ Mickelson: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger did: one was he got everybody invested in the process. 'He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their pod, when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. 'We hung out together and we were all invested in each other's play. We were invested in picking Hunter (Mahan) that week, we were invested in the process. 'The other thing that Paul did really well was he had a great game plan for us; how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well - we had a real game plan. 'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well. Mickelson wanted the tactics to be more along the lines of Paul Azinger's pod system . Tom Watson, Keegan Bradley, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk and Zack Johnson line up during the presentations . e strayed from a winning formula in 2008 for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.' Mickelson was asked whether he thought his comments were disloyal to Watson. 'Oh, I'm sorry you're taking it that way. I'm just talking about what Paul Azinger did to help us play our best,' was his response. 'You asked me what I thought we should do to bring our best golf out and I'd go back to when we played our best golf and try to replicate that formula.' As the USA were in disarray, a European party at Gleneagles was getting under way. ‘I was just so up for it, more so than I was in the two majors I won this year,’ McIlroy said. ‘There was no option other than to win. I played my best golf.’ It was a big contrast in reception at the end of the weekend as Watson took flak and Paul McGinley celebrated .","Phil Mickelson felt Tom Watson should have replicated the tactics of 2008 .

"Bob Suter, one of the heroes of the USA's 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team . Bob Suter, one of the heroes of the USA's 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team that won gold in the 1980 Winter Olympics, has died of a massive heart attack aged 57. The feisty defenseman, who played a key part in Herb Brooks' famous side, was at the ice rink he owned in Middleton, Wisconsin, when he collapsed on Tuesday. Suter suffered a broken ankle two months before the games at Lake Placid, New York, but recovered in time to take part in all seven matches at the tournament. Suter will go down in history as a member of the team that defied all the odds to beat strong favorites the Soviet Union - before going on to win gold. His son Ryan, himself an NHL standout, said in a statement: 'The sudden loss of my father has been difficult for myself and our family — my dad was my hero and he taught me about life, hockey and what was truly important — family. 'He will be missed greatly and his legacy and spirit will be with us every day. He lived with the motto, ""It’s all about the kids,"" and forever he will be remembered by this. 'My family and I also want to say thank you for the tremendous outpouring of support we have received from the hockey community around the world. It means a lot to us to know how much he was loved and will be missed.' Gary Suter, 50, a former NHL All-Star who played in two Olympics of his own, once described his older brother's playing style as 'abrasive', the New York Daily News reports. He said: 'He always had people chasing him around the ice. He was the sort of guy you hated playing against and loved having him your team.' Scroll down for video . Suter is the first player from the fabled U.S. Olympic ice hockey team to pass away - with coach Herb Brooks dying in a car accident 11 years ago. After a brief career in minor-league hockey, Bob Suter opened a sporting goods store and the rink, Capitol Ice Arena, spending years working as a youth coach.

Bob Suter, pictured here at an exhibition match in 1995, was 'the sort of guy you hated playing against and loved having in your team', his brother Gary, a former NHL All-Star said . Mark Johnson, the gifted center and top scorer on the 1980 team, was not only Suter's teammate, but also his close friend. The 'Miracle on Ice' is the name given to a men's ice hockey game during the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York. The United States national team, made up of amateur and collegiate players and led by coach Herb Brooks, defeated the Soviet Union, which had won the gold medal in six of the seven previous Olympic games. After trailing for much of the match, they scored with ten minutes left to go 4-3 ahead and then held on to seal the historic win in a nail-biting finish. Team USA went on to win the gold medal after winning their last match over Finland. The Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden in its final game. In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the 'Miracle on Ice' the Top Sports Moment of the 20th Century. As part of its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation chose the 'Miracle on Ice' as the century's number-one international ice hockey story. He said: 'He had a huge impact on hockey everywhere.' USA Hockey issued a statement in the wake of Suter's death on Tuesday, calling it a 'tough day for our sport.' 'Bob Suter will always be remembered for his role as a member of the 1980 Miracle on Ice Team that captivated our country and whose impact is impossible to measure. 'His legacy, however, is far beyond that as he dedicated his life to advancing hockey and helping young people achieve their dreams. 'Bob's positive impact on our sport will be felt for generations to come. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Suter family at this difficult time.' Minnesota Wild, who Suter's son, plays for, said he was 'a great hockey ambassador, he was a terrific person off the ice who will be greatly missed.' Bob Suter's funeral will be held at Alliant Energy Center on Saturday at 11am and it is believed that fellow 'Miracle on Ice teammate, Mark Johnson, will read a eulogy. The whole of the Wild team will fly out to the funeral, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

But after USA midfielder Michael Bradley — who had played brilliantly — lost possession in the centre circle in the 95th minute, Ronaldo broke down the right to deliver a sensational cross that allowed substitute Silvestre Varela to head powerfully past Tim Howard at the far post. In an instant American hearts broke wide open. Now, instead of going to Recife to scrap with Germany for top spot on Thursday, they know this group is once again wide open. Portugal will have to improve against Ghana but at least they remain alive. VIDEO Scroll down for USA fans sing their national anthem before Portugal clash .

Referee: Nestor Pittana (Argentina) *Match ratings by Ian Ladyman . When Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey scored deserved second-half goals to wipe out an advantage given to Portugal by Nani after just five minutes, there seemed no way back on a night when even Ronaldo, for the large part, failed to lift a bunch of rather average players. Great players only need a few seconds to change things, though, and Portugal move forwards now knowing that with Ronaldo in their team just about anything really is possible. Given the traumatic nature of their opening defeat by Germany, the night couldn’t have started any better for Portugal. The USA were still finding their feet in the opening moments when their Stoke City defender Geoff Cameron got himself in a muddle as he attempted to clear what was a pretty routine cross from Miguel Veloso on the left. When he failed to deal with the threat and presented the ball straight to Nani at the far post, the Manchester United winger had time to control it, steady himself and plant the ball high above Howard, who had gone to ground early, from only six or seven yards. The Portuguese — needing a victory so badly — could hardly believe their luck but it was peculiar how poorly they went on to play for the rest of the half. Certainly the United States could have equalised and probably should have done. Stunner: USA midfielder Jermaine Jones unleashes a curling effort to get his country back on level terms .

Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo saw plenty of the ball on the left of midfield, as his heat map below shows - click here for more in our Match Zone . Right-back Fabian Johnson was finding it easy to get forward and he had a shot blocked after cutting inside soon after Nani’s goal. Then Dempsey curled a free-kick over before the former Fulham forward was played in by Michael Bradley only to see Portugal keeper Beto save with his legs. Bradley, Johnson and Dempsey were all to threaten again before the half hour from various distances as Portugal found themselves unable to keep possession for any length of time. Ronaldo did present Nani with a chance with a pass to his right in the 42nd minute only for Howard to save the low drive from the edge of the penalty area. Then Howard somehow fumbled another Nani shot on to his lefthand post before saving Eder’s follow-up superbly with a scoop of his left hand. It was at the other end where the greatest talking point lay, though, as America came within a whisker of equalising. Johnson was continuing to terrorise Portugal with his raids down the right and moments after Beto saved his cross shot at the near post he raced to the byline again to pull the ball back perfectly in to  Bradley’s stride. The USA midfielder looked certain to score but somehow Portugal defender Ricardo Costa managed to deflect the close-range shot over the bar with his knee cap.

Pure joy: Manchester United midfielder Nani celebrates his fifth-minute goal at the Arena da Amazonia . Centre of attention: Nani hugs team-mate Miguel Veloso as Cristiano Ronaldo (third from left) looks on . One wondered if Klinsmann’s team would live to regret that miss but with 25 minutes left they were back in the game. Moments after Ronaldo had broken to slash a shot wildly off target, America forced a corner and when it was cleared to the edge of the box, Nani could only nod the ball in to the path of Jones 20 yards or so out. The Besiktas midfielder took one touch to control it, another to shift it out of his feet and one more to curl a powerful shot into the corner with his right foot. It was a superb shot and USA had the parity their football deserved at that point. VIDEO Ronaldo in sensational form .

Safe hands: Everton goalkeeper Howard keeps the score at 1-0 with a fine save late in the first half . Heads up: Substitute Eder rises highest to connect with the ball after replacing Helder Postiga . Briefly Portugal — aware that their cause was desperate — tried to rally and Nani curled a good shot from 18 yards. But the plain truth was that USA were better and they broke to take the lead with nine minutes left. Again Johnson supplied the cross from the right and when Portugal couldn’t clear, Bradley’s scuffed effort screwed wide to Graham Zusi and his cross shot was nudged in by Dempsey with his midriff.

"'Super honey': A new type of honey has produced amazing results treating wounds and infections . A new honey has been produced that has had ‘amazing’ results treating wounds and infections. The bio-engineered product Surgihoney was tested on babies, new mothers, cancer patients and the elderly for over a year in Hampshire hospitals. Wounds and ulcers, including those infected with the superbug MRSA, healed within days, while the number of women who suffered infections after giving birth by caesarean section has halved. It has also healed the wounds of soldiers returning from Afghanistan, and been used to treat acne and to protect the skin of cancer patients fitted with a catheter for chemotherapy. Dr Matthew Dryden, consultant microbiologist at the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘It will revolutionise wound care around the world.’ Honey has been used for its healing powers for thousands of years, although doctors favour penicillin and antibiotics. However, Surgihoney, which is stored in 10g sachets, can kill bacteria, parasites and fungal infections while also encouraging wounds to heal. Dr Dryden said: ‘I have conducted numerous laboratory tests and compared it with honeys from around the world. ‘I found Surgihoney better for treating every type of bug. So for the past year I have been using it on patients and the results have been amazing. 'There are plenty of products that can kill bacteria but they often don’t help heal tissue. ‘Honey is a fantastic natural medicine. The important extra is that it kills the bugs but doesn’t damage the tissue.’ Effective: The honey has helped patients suffering from MRSA . Surgihoney is being developed by Ian Staples, a businessman who once owned the Halfords motor accessories chain. He bought an organic farm in southern Chile, set up beehives then funded scientific researchers in Ireland to identify the unique health elements. The honey has been licensed  by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority in the UK but is not yet commercially available.","Surgihoney has been tested in Hampshire hospitals for a year .

"Rush-hour Underground commuters can sometimes resemble a herd of sheep - but that is usually where the association with agricultural ends. However, travellers on Thursday were left bemused after two goats and an alpaca  walked brazenly and unchecked through a ticket barrier at Vauxhall Underground Station. There was no need for any Oyster cards as the plucky visitors Fred, Barney and Ben navigated the London station seemingly unaware of the hysteria around them. Commuters could scarcely believe their eyes as they uploaded photos to social media websites. One Twitter user commented: 'Vauxhall Tube always has some weird characters running around. But this one looks friendlier than most.' The animals from Vauxhall City Farm appeared happy and content as they waded through a multitude of onrushing passengers - all caught on camera. You've got to be kidding me! A goat wanders through the ticket barrier at Vauxhall Tube in London . Coming through! The animals went on the Tube as part of an initiative to get Londoners to visit attractions . The campaign named Transport for London's Without Leaving London was devised with the aim of encouraging Londoners to visit attractions in their home city.

"Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic has announced his recovery from a broken nose by posting a Twitter image of himself wearing a protective face mask, accompanied by the caption 'I'm back!!!'. The Croatia centre forward had his nose bent out of shape during Atletico's surprise 3-2 Champions League defeat by Olympiacos on Tuesday, after catching a stray elbow from former Fulham star Pajtim Kasami. There were fears the 28-year-old could be ruled out for a lengthy spell after requiring surgery, but he has now returned to training - albeit dressed like some futuristic Zoro. Atletico Madrid forward Mario Mandzukic will wear a protective mask after surgery on a broken nose . Croatia striker suffered the injury during his side's 3-2 loss to Olympiacos in the Champions League . The former Bayern Munich striker's customised mask, which even features his No 9 on the side, means he will be able to return to action sooner than expected. 'Normally he would be available to play in 15 days but with a mask he could do so in 10,' Atletico doctor Pedro Luis Llopis said. Mandzukic has scored two goals in four competitive games since signing for the La Liga champions  for an undisclosed fee in July. He is expected to miss Saturday's league game at home to Celta Vigo as well as Wednesday's trip to Almeria - but could be back for the Champions League group match against Italian champions Juventus on October 1.

"Practice makes perfect, but only if you go about it the right way, research claims. The way a person practices is as important as how often they try to improve - with those who do not cram in sessions but go away and reflect on their mistakes performing better. And those willing to experiment and learn from their mistakes at the beginning tend to perform better in the long-run. If at first you don't succeed...:The way a person practices is as important as how often they try to improve - with those who don't cram in sessions but go away and reflect on their mistakes performing better . Researchers followed 854,064 online gamers playing a game called Axon, in which players guide a neuron from connection to connection by clicking on potential targets. The software was developed by game designer Preloaded to challenge people's perception and decision-making skills while allowing researchers to analyse how practice affects performance. They found that some gamers scored higher than others despite practising for the same amount of time. Game play data revealed that players who seemed to learn more quickly had either spaced out their practice or had more varying early performances, before going on to perform better. The study could also help researchers find new ways of understanding how the brain retains information . This suggests, the researchers believe, that they were exploring how the game worked and taking the time to practice more methodically and 'efficiently' than the lower scoring gamers. Dr Tom Stafford, from the University of Sheffield said: 'The study suggests that learning can be improved - you can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level. 'As we live longer, and as more of our lives become based around acquiring complex skills, optimal learning becomes increasingly relevant to everyone. 'The study confirms that more practice is better but if you space it out instead of doing it all at once then you improve. 'Also people who are most variable in their performance at the beginning perform better at the end. 'The reason is that people who are experimenting at the beginning have to make some mistakes in order to achieve success.' The study could also help researchers find new ways of understanding the ways in which people learn, as gaming is something that people enjoy and data is easily collected. Dr Stafford said: 'This kind of data affords us to look in an unprecedented way at the shape of the learning curve, allowing us to explore how the way we practice helps or hinders learning.' The study was published in Psychological Science.","Researchers looked at 854,064 online gamers playing a game called Axon .

"Three students at a suburban New York City high school have been suspended for allegedly posting racial tweets following a tense basketball playoff game against a rival school. Officials say it happened after Mount Vernon defeated Mahopac on February 27. Students and school officials say scuffles erupted between the fans in the stands and the racial slurs were posted afterward. Among the posts, which have since been removed, was one that stated: 'That's why you shouldn't let monkeys out of their cages #mtvernonzoo' Scroll down for videos . Tense game: Last Thursday, Mt Vernon faced off against their rival, Mahopac, in a playoff game . Tough crowd: Some fans who came to support Mt Vernon were overheard taunting Mahopac cheerleaders and threatening them with violence . Mount Vernon Mayor Ernest Davis condemned the incident. He says the district planned to meet with state education officials to prevent such incidents in the future. Mahopac School Superintendent Thomas Manko says three students whose tweets were verified have been suspended. He says students will be given sensitivity training so they understand why they can't use such words. According to Manko, tensions ran high during the game last Thursday, which ended with Mount Vernon's victory over Mahopac 43-40, CBS New York reported. The top-seeded Mount Vernon team is made up mostly of black players. Messages of hate: Following the tense game, some Mahopac students took to Twitter, putting up racist posts aimed at their rivals from Mt Vernon . Loaded image: One student posted a picture of a Confederate flag . According to Manko, some of the blame for the ugly incident rests in part with Mount Vernon fans, who were heard taunting Mahopac cheerleaders and threatening them with violence, MyFox New York reported. A grainy YouTube video posted by user iGr8Dane shows a scuffle that broke out in the stands between warring fans. The animosity between the two rival schools boiled over on Twitter that night when a number of Mahopac students unleashed a torrent of racially charged posts. 'Tough loss boys but at least we can talk to our dads about it #mountvernon,' one of the tweets read. Another user wrote: ‘One of the few biological Mount Vernon fathers just tried to sell me crack outside the county center.’ One student allegedly posted a picture of a Confederate flag. ‘It just reminded us once again that racial intolerance is still on the agenda,' Mount Vernon Interim Schools Superintendent Judith Johnson said. 'It’s often the elephant in the room.' Mahopac's head coach Kevin Downes, who is black, later admonished students from his school on Twitter, saying that it 'makes it hard to coach there #disappointed.' Ninety-five per cent of students at Mount Vernon High School are minorities, compared to only 11 per cent at Mahopac, according to U.S. News & World Report. Disciplined: Three students from Mahopac High School have been suspended . Superintendent Manko told News 12 Westchester the trio of Mahopac students who have been suspended in the aftermath of the incident will be banned from taking part in school activities as punishment for their online outburst. Mahopac officials are also investigating whether players from their team made racist comments to Mount Vernon students as the two teams shook hands at the end of the game.

"A mother who died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage has left a lasting legacy after her organs saved the lives of six people. Fitness instructor Lisa Bratt, 40, collapsed when she suffered a bleed on the brain and a stroke after years of unexplained headaches. Hospital tests revealed her brain was unresponsive so her husband Paul, 38, made the decision to allow doctors to remove her organs. Lisa Bratt (pictured on her wedding day with her husband, Paul) died after collapsing suddenly with a brain haemorrhage and a stroke after suffering from headaches . Part of her liver was donated to a three-year-old boy - allowing him home for the Christmas - and her heart saved the life of a 40-year-old woman from Glasgow. Her lungs, kidneys and the other half of her liver went to save the lives of four more people in Newcastle, Leeds and Liverpool. Mr Bratt, from Hartlepool, said: ‘When I got there she had already gone. I knew that. ‘I had a little bit of hope, but doctors warned me even if she had come through she wouldn't have remembered her life. Mr Bratt agreed to allow his wife's organs to be donated and they have saved six people's lives. The couple are pictured with their sons Michael, 10, and Joshua, nine . ‘I never left her bedside, it was horrible. I'm extremely proud Lisa was able to help others - it's a good thing. ‘Lisa was kind, loving, happy-go-lucky and would do anything for anybody. A brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain. It can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm. Symptoms include a sudden, very severe headache, vomiting, fits, loss of consciousness and sudden death. A brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment. The two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding, and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding. Haemorrhages most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel's wall. People who smoke, drink heavily, have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk. About 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating. About 9,000 people in the UK have a brain haemorrhage every year. Four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65. They are more common in women than men. Source: NHS Choices . ‘When we found out she had helped that . little boy go home for Christmas it was overwhelming - I'm tearing up . just thinking about it. ‘She will be there looking down over us . knowing she has helped all these people.

November 18 last year. Screaming in pain, she ran to a nearby friend's house where she collapsed, suffering a bleed on her brain at the same time as a stroke. An ambulance took her to the University Hospital of North Tees, in Stockton, but medics could not bring her back. She was kept clinically alive while doctors took her organs, before pronouncing her dead on November 19. Mr Bratt faced the task of breaking the news to their children - Natasha, 21, Michael, 10, and nine-year-old Joshua. The off-shore platform inspector said: ‘The hardest part was when the boys came in from school on the Tuesday and having to tell them. ‘The boys have taken it all okay and Natasha is doing well at the moment. ‘I have loads of family support and people I work with out in Africa have also come to see me - I've been overwhelmed. ‘She was the best mum the kids could ever wish for, she was the best wife, and she doted on her nephews.’ Mr Bratt will get more details of who his wife helped - and maybe even thank you letters - in the coming year. He also hopes to find out more about why she suddenly collapsed. Part of Mrs Bratt's liver was used to save the life of a three-year-old boy and receiving it enabled him to go home from hospital for Christmas . ‘She was so fit,’ he said. ‘She had just qualified as a fitness instructor, went to the gym every other day and even had a six-pack - she had never been fitter.’ Mrs Bratt’s mother Denise Novak, 60, paid tribute to her eldest child.

"Music blared from the purple bus, and Baltimore Ravens fan Racquel Bailey stood with drink in hand amid her usual tailgate buddies while making a bold fashion statement: a black, rhinestone-decorated jersey with the white No 27. A Ray Rice jersey. 'There's two sides to every story,' said Bailey, a 23-year-old waitress from Baltimore. 'I saw the video. That's their personal business, and it shouldn't have affected his career. I don't agree with domestic violence, but she's still with him, so obviously it wasn't that big of a deal. Everyone should just drop it.' Ravens fans male and female, young and old, arrived for Thursday night's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers debating the events that have affected their team over the last few days. Their once beloved running back has been kicked off the team and indefinitely banned by the NFL after a video surfaced that showed him punching his then-fiancee - and now wife - inside an Atlantic City hotel elevator. Racquel Bailey wears a Ray Rice jersey before the Baltimore Ravens' game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . All condemned Rice's actions, but there was little consensus as to what his punishment should be. The NFL did the right thing by suspending him, some said, but the Ravens shouldn't have terminated his contract as well. Or maybe the suspension should have remained at two games, where it stood before the latest video became public. Meanwhile, those who wore Rice jerseys were getting heckles and high-fives. 'You support a wife-beater!' one female fan yelled at male fan wearing a No. 27 about 90 minutes before kickoff. Outside of at least one entrance, a memo explained the Ray Rice Jersey Exchange policy, aimed at ""particularly families, women and children"" who wish to exchange a Rice jersey for that of another Ravens player. The Ravens are no longer selling Rice jerseys, but at least one independent vendor had some Rice action figurines on sale next to his collection of vintage Baltimore Colts wares. Karla Owens wears a Baltimore Ravens' Ray Rice jersey as she tailgates before the game . Paul Kilduff, 65, put two pieces of duct tape over the letters 'Ray R' on the back of his faded shirt so that it read 'Be Nice' instead of ""Ray Rice."" But the tape kept falling off, so he took off the jersey, then put it back on without the tape while uttering, 'Ah, I might as well.' 'Everybody deserves a second chance,' he said, a refrain heard often in the parking lot. This, after all, is the franchise of Ray Lewis, who was charged in a murder case in 2000 but now has a statue outside the stadium. His No 52 remains arguably the most visible jersey among tailgaters. But there were plenty of No. 27s, and many of them said they were deliberately making a statement. 'I took the bus here, so people were, like, ""Good, I'm glad to see to someone out here showing support,' said Gage Friend, 18, as he learned against the barrier by the players' entrance. Ray Rice has been indefinitely banned by the NFL after the shocking footage was released by TMZ on Monday . 'But I've also seen a lot of people giving me dirty looks and people saying stuff to me like, `I can't believe you'd wear that. Don't you know what he did?' 'Yeah, I'm pretty aware of what he did. And, yes, it was awful and it was definitely a mistake on his part, but he deserves a second chance. ... People have done so much worse in this league.'","Ravens fans - men and women - wore the now vacant No 27 shirt .

"Felipe Massa said he was ‘screaming’ for the Japanese Grand Prix to be stopped in the laps leading up to Jules Bianchi’s crash. Bianchi is undergoing surgery after sustaining a serious head injury in a collision with a recovery vehicle sent out to retrieve Adrian Sutil’s  Sauber. Sutil lost control of his car as the rain intensified during the closing stages of Sunday’s incident-fuelled race. Medical staff attend the scene of Jules Bianchi's crash during Sunday's rain-hit Japanese Grand Prix . Felipe Massa, pictured before the race, said the conditions in the build-up to Bianchi's crash were 'dangerous' On lap 42, Adrian Sutil lost control of his car, spun and hit the tyre barrier on the outside of Turn 7. The marshals displayed double waved yellow flags before the corner to warn drivers of the incident. A recovery vehicle was despatched in order to lift the car and take it to a place of safety behind the guardrail. While this was being done the driver of car 17, Jules Bianchi, lost control of his car, travelled across the run-off area and hit the back of the tractor. Once the marshals reported that the driver was injured, medical teams were despatched and the Safety Car was deployed. These were followed by an extrication team and an ambulance. The driver was removed from the car, taken to the circuit medical centre and then by ambulance to Mie General Hospital. The CT scan shows that he has suffered a severe head injury and he is currently undergoing surgery. Following this he will be moved to intensive care where he will be monitored. Mie General Hospital will issue an update as soon as further information becomes available. Bianchi then hit the recovery truck despatched to collect his stricken Sauber on the following lap. The race was red-flagged on lap 46 with Lewis Hamilton claiming his third consecutive win to extend his lead in the championship over Nico Rosberg, who finished second, to 10 points. ‘I’m very worried,’ said Massa, who was running in seventh when the race was stopped with seven laps remaining. ‘I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous.’ Bianchi, 25, was taken to Mie University Hospital, 10 miles from the Suzuka circuit, under a police escort. He will be taken to intensive care after his emergency surgery. 'It's been an interesting weekend,' said race-winner Hamilton, who claimed his third successive victory. 'Our first thoughts go to Jules - it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him. Next to this, the race result doesn't seem significant at all.

"Authorities say two dogs that fatally mauled a Michigan jogger last month have been euthanized. Lapeer County assistant prosecutor Michael Hodges says the two cane corsos involved in the July 23 attack on 46-year-old Craig Sytsma of Livonia in Metamora Township were euthanized on Monday. Hodges says another adult cane corso that wasn't involved in the attack about 45 miles northwest of Detroit was euthanized on Friday. Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata were charged last week with second-degree murder in the attack. Prosecutors say Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata might try to flee if they're released on bond. Lucaj, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, of Italy, are undocumented immigrants . A neighbor witnessed the vicious attack, and shot at the animals several times until he hit one and scared them off . On Friday, the same day they were in court, they agreed to give up ownership of the animals and have them euthanized. Eight puppies will be offered to an animal rescue group. Murder charges against dog owners are rare. Lucaj and Quagliata return to court on Friday of this week. The . couple, who are both undocumented immigrants, are being held on . $500,000 bond  each, as court officials worry they might try to flee the . country if released. Lapeer . County prosecutors wanted $1 million, saying Valbona Lucaj and husband . Sebastiano Quagliata, both charged with second-degree murder, might try . to escape. Lucaj . and Quagliat have been charged with second degree murder. Mr Sytsma, of . Livonia, was attacked by their cane corsos while he jogged along a . rural road. Sytsma, 46, was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital, where . he died of his injuries, police said. 'It's a horrible tragedy,' assistant prosecutor Michael Hodges said. 'But animal cases get a lot of attention.' Victim: Craig Sytsma, 46, was mauled by two massive cane corsos while jogging along a rural Michigan road . The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said. 'He . was jogging, doing what everybody else does out there, running and . riding bikes,' Metamora Township police Officer Sean Leathers said. According to police, a man mowing his lawn nearby saw the attack, got a gun and tried to shoot at the animals to chase them off. Sytsma was a 'a divorced father of three' and 'had apparently decided to jog after leaving work,' the newspaper reported. Raitanen . said he jogged, played hockey, and golfed, as well as regularly riding . his mountain bike and playing beach volley ball. A . huge music fan who was partial to Santana, the Allman Brothers, and . Gov't Mule, he went to several shows a year but still listened to . cassette tapes. The two cane corsos that mauled Sytsma were euthanized on Aug. 4 . Scene: Sytsma was running on this road when he was mauled by the two dogs . But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28. 'He was a dad, he was a family man,' Raitanen said. Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it. 'I’d . say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan . Sytsma said. In May 2012, there was a report of a . dog bite where the animal returned to the same property, Metamora . Township Police Chief David Mallett told The Flint Journal. And in November 2013, a man was taken to a hospital after being bitten by a dog that returned to the address. Victim: April Smith, pictured, was attacked by one of the dogs in April 2012 . The dogs 'get loose kind of regularly,' Geoffrey Petz told the Flint Journal. 'I've had interactions where I was walking out of my grandma's pole barn and there was a dog standing there with its hair standing up, growling at you,' he told the newspaper. ' When you get that feeling, you can see it in an animal if it's scared or aggressive and you just back right back into the door.' Oxford resident April Smith said that one of the dogs involved had attacked her in May 2012. Smith said she and her sister were walking two dogs when she was bitten. She said she was horrified that the owner still had the dogs. 'Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.'","Valbona Lucaj, 44, and husband Sebastiano Quagliata, 45, are charged with second-degree murder .

"Roy Keane, unusually for a top sports personality, has acted for himself throughout the negotiations and writing of his autobiography The Second Half, to be published by Orion next week. The process has gone remarkably smoothly according to the publishers, despite Keane never having met acclaimed author Roddy Doyle before their collaboration on the book. Keane used to be represented by London-based solicitor Michael Kennedy, who is known as a tough negotiator. Kennedy said: ‘Roy doesn’t need an agent. He’s more than capable of looking after himself.’ Roy Keane (right), next to Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert, has acted as his own agent for his book deal . A line has now been drawn under England’s woeful World Cup performance after manager Roy Hodgson explained what went wrong to the FA board last week. Hodgson, accompanied by Club England managing director Adrian Bevington, made an hour-long presentation about events in Brazil to the FA directors at a Wembley hotel. The board concluded that Hodgson, his backroom staff and the FA administrators had done all they could to provide the right platform for the players to perform at their best — but to everyone’s great disappointment, this hadn’t happened. Roy Hodgson was given a chance to explain Englad's 2014 World Cup failings to the FA . However, it was felt there was no sign of any Phil Mickelson-style discord in the England camp and that the players still had every faith in the manager. Hodgson was fortunate to have his debriefing meeting scheduled so long after the disastrous tournament and with the bonus of making a winning start in Euro 2016 qualifying. Although the usefulness of all members of the 88-strong World Cup party will continue to be examined, Hodgson can now concentrate on reaching France with his Brazil inquiry closed.

KP book alert for ECB . England outcast Kevin Pietersen believes he is free from any confidentiality clause to say what he likes in his autobiography to be published next week. But there is a different view at the England Cricket Board because a clause in the players’ central contracts, signed by Pietersen, forbids players divulging private dressing-room information ‘during or after your central contract’. The ECB have not been given advance copies of the book by publishers Little, Brown, who feared it would have leaked. So the Lord’s lawyers will be looking closely for breaches of that contract when they eventually gain sight of the contents. Simon Halliday, the former England rugby international who has been linked with top jobs at Twickenham, has been lined up for a leading role with European Professional Club Rugby, based in Neuchatel, Switzerland, from where the organisation will run the new European Rugby Champions Cup.

It is hard to take the FA’s anti-discrimination stance seriously when referee grandee David Elleray received his MBE for services to football at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.

"A missing New Jersey teenager who falsely tweeted that someone was in her house was found unharmed and has been reunited with her family. Clark Police Chief Alan Scherb said state troopers spotted 16-year-old Kara Alongi walking along the New Jersey Turnpike near Interchange 1 in Carneys Point around 4.30pm Tuesday. She was taken to a hospital for evaluation and returned home early Wednesday. Found: Kara Alongi, 16, was picked up by officials on a highway after being caught on CCTV at the NJ Transit Station in Rahway . Suspicious claim: Kara Alongi, 16, posted this message to Twitter around 6.20om on Sunday night while her family was out watching her younger brother's sporting game . Alongi gained hundreds of followers . after asking people on Twitter to call 911 Sunday. However, the evidence . has pointed toward the teen being an apparent runaway. Surveillance video showed her at the . Rahway train station purchasing a ticket to New York City on Sunday . after the tweet was sent. The police chief says detectives are trying to determine the girl's whereabouts over the past two days. The high school student posted . a misspelled message to her Twitter page around 6.20pm Sunday night . that gave the impression that she was in a panic, stating: 'There is . someone in my hour ecall 911'. Her Twitter followers did not call the . authorities, but her parents did once they returned to the family home . in Clark, New Jersey, and realized that the girl was missing. But . the teenager has now been spotted on CCTV holding a backpack and a . large purse while waiting for a train at the NJ Transit station in . Rahway. Disappeared: Police traced a phone call placed from her house to a local cab company around the same time as the Tweet, and the cab driver identified her as the girl he picked up . The 16-year-old's lone tweet that . appeared to be a desperate plea for help went viral with hundreds of . Twitter messages posted hoping for a her safe return. Clark police confirmed Sunday night . that the girl's initial tweet was a hoax and there were no signs of foul . play in Alongi's home. At the time of her disappearance, her family were watching her younger brother's sporting event. Police . brought a canine unit to the home and, according to their press . release, the dogs 'tracked Kara's scent from the back door of the house, . through a neighbor's yard and then to the sidewalk and around the . corner back onto her block where the scent goes cold.' After initially believing the Tweet, police became suspicious because there were no signs of foul play or abduction. The biggest sign, however, that something was amiss came from phone records that showed someone in the Alongi's home called a local taxi company and ordered a pick up at their address right around the time that Kara posted the intruder claim to Twitter. Gone: The taxi driver took her to the nearby Rahway train station which has regular services to Manhattan . 'The investigation quickly revealed a number of inconsistencies in the teen's statement,' the police statement reveals. The local Patch site . reports that police got in touch with the taxi driver who picked up the . request, and the man identified Kara as the girl he drove to the nearby . Rahway train station. The train station serves the Northeast Corridor line and the North Jersey Coast line, both of which have their northern-most stop in Manhattan. 'Kara might feel that she will be in trouble if she comes home after this scare and causing a panic. At this point all everyone cares about is seeing her safe and at her house where she belongs,' the police statement concluded.","Kara Alongi, 16, was found walking along New Jersey Turnpike in Carneys Point .

"The 2014 Ryder Cup celebrations got into full swing on Sunday night after Europe emerged 16½-11½ winners against USA. Rory McIlroy, donning a red tartan kilt and a wig, was snapped topless looking a little worse for wear as the Northern Irishman took to Instagram to show how he bid Gleneagles farewell. McIlroy, asked on Monday morning about USA's Phil Mickelson after the American openly criticised captain Tom Watson, said it was 'unfortunate' that neither stayed to see off the Ryder Cup in style. Rory McIlroy took to Twitter to show off his new Scottish-themed outfit with Scotland's Stephen Gallagher . Rory McIlroy took to Twitter to praise Europe captain Paul McGinley after they won the 2014 Ryder Cup . 'We had a great time with the American team last night, they seemed in good spirits,' McIlroy told Sky Sports. 'Tom wasn't there, he didn't really hang around too much. 'It was unfortunate. We don't know what the dynamic was in the team room. All we know if we had a great captain and we did the things we needed to do to be able to win the Ryder Cup. 'I'm sure the Americans will go back now and think about what didn't go right.' McIlroy put his earlier mishap behind him when the 25-year-old accidentally popped a champagne bottle too early on the green by getting 'into the Scottish swing of things' on Sunday night. Likewise, USA's Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson went about dealing with the loss in their own way by wearing the same Scottish-themed costumes as both teams had a blowout. Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson in red tartan kilts and wigs after USA's loss against Europe in Ryder Cup . CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's report as Europe win the Ryder Cup against USA . A noticeable absentee from USA's send off was  Mickelson, who didn't hang around to celebrate the Ryder Cup coming to an end after his damning analysis of captain Watson. Watson, in response to Mickelson's criticism, said: 'The issue between Phil and myself is basically a difference of opinion. He has a difference of opinion where he would like to manage the team and I certainly had my own opinion on how I'd manage the team. 'That's the controversy and that's the issue but I have to say that I'm very proud of my team's efforts. One thing I asked them to do from the beginning was to give absolutely everything they have and they did. They just ran up against a buzz saw. 'The European team was very strong and had four of the top five players in the world. When you play against them, you better be firing on all cylinders and frankly, we weren't so that's it.' European captain Paul McGinley, holding a copy of the Daily Mail, couldn't be further from criticism after being hailed  as 'phenomenal' by McIlroy and Co for commanding the win over USA.

Sunday night was about seeing off the Ryder Cup in good spirits and, when USA won at table tennis against Europe, McIlroy quipped: 'That's one thing they beat us at this week.' Europe's Lee Westwood certainly got his priorities right, putting his 3&2 loss against Jimmy Walker in Sunday's singles behind to celebrate the overall win as soon as possible. The 41-year-old momentarily looked in a world of his own  during a press conference on Sunday evening, only for the cork to fly off a champagne bottle before pouring himself a well-earned drink. It's the least those on Team Europe deserve, and it was topped off by a hearty breakfast and a friendly lift home from the police, too.

When asked if the enormity of clinching the winning point had sunk in, the Welshman replied: 'No, because I'm still drunk.' Donaldson took dead aim and played the stroke that will follow him for the rest of his days as it never left the flag and came to rest six inches from the 15th hole. From the sidelines, jubilant winning captain McGinley emerged and jumped on his back. Jamie Donaldson sticks his tongue out as he celebrates with his Team Europe teammates at the Ryder Cup .

Ian Poulter was very much a part of the Sunday night celebrations, too, admitting he felt 'a little worse for wear' on Monday morning as he made his way to the airport after staying up until 4am. Still, Fowler and Watson's way of dealing with the defeat may be more harmless than what USA teammate Mickelson did in the aftermath. Mickelson, asked about USA captain Watson, said: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger (the 2008 captain) did. 'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their ""pod"", when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod.

'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well. 'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well. 'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.' Asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to Watson, he replied: 'I'm sorry you're taking it that way. I'm just talking about what Paul Azinger did to help us play our best.'

"This is the moment a pensioner hurled his next-door neighbour over a garden fence and tried to gouge out his eyes - after a row over a parking space. Highways inspector Harry Ferris, 65, even head-butted his neighbour's 64-year-old wife because she threw a hose near a connecting fence whilst showing her friend a rockery. Victims Tilly and Philip Hellawell have today revealed they were terrified of Ferris from the moment he moved into the farmhouse next-door which overlooks the Pennines in the scenic town of Bacup, Lancashire. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: CCTV captures the moment Harry Ferris, left, approaches his neighbour Philip Hellawell near a fence between the two properties in Bacup, Lancashire . The footage then shows 65-year-old Ferris, left, grabbing his neighbour Philip Hellawell, right, and pushing him backwards . Philip Hellawell's feet are raised off the ground as he is hurled backwards over the fence by 18-stone Harry Ferris . Burnley Magistrates Court heard the chaos started just days after 18-stone Ferris and his wife arrived in April 2012. The court heard that the Hellawells were regularly on the end of four-letter tirades concerning parking, their shared garden gate and alleged dog mess. Events reached their climax on Christmas Eve last year after several months of incidents when Ferris, a director of a highways construction firm, lunged at retired company director Mr Hellawell, 67, as he was repairing a gate between the two properties. On CCTV played in court Ferris could be heard to shout, 'you put your hands on me once more and you'll be dead - and I mean dead', in between a torrent of foul language. Mr Hellawell - who has lived in his  property with his wife since 1986 - was then punched and hurled over the fence where he was left battered and bloody. All he can be heard doing in retaliation is asking for mercy in 'the season of pleasantries'. After being convicted of two counts of assault following a trial, Ferris escaped with just a fine, which included having to pay £200 in compensation to the Hellawells. He was also fined £480 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £48 as well as prosecution costs of £200 - a total of £928 - which he will pay in two installments over two months. Chair of the bench Alan Ravenscroft said that a restraining order would be inappropriate as it would be impossible to implement with the complainants being next-door neighbours. Harry Ferris, pictured, was convicted of two counts of assault following a trial and was handed a fine at Burnley Magistrates' Court - which included having to pay £200 in compensation . Philp Hellawell, pictured, was left battered and bloody after being thrown over a garden fence by his neighbour Harry Ferris . Victims Tilly and Philip Hellawell have revealed they were terrified of Harry Ferris from the moment he moved into the spacious farmhouse next-door which overlooks the Pennines in the scenic town of Bacup, Lancashire. Ferris' house is pictured left, and the Hellawells' right . He said: 'With Mr Hellawell it was an ongoing assault where he was picked up and put over a fence. The main purpose of this sentence today is one of punishment. 'Mrs Hellawell received very minor injuries and some distress. Mr Hellawell received cuts, bruises, a torn shirt and distress.' Outside court Ferris attempted to intimidate photographers and remained defiant that the events were tit-for-tat, insisting that he was the one being harassed by neighbours. During his earlier trial, CCTV footage was played which showed Ferris exploding at 4ft 7ins Mrs Hellawell when she accidentally threw a hosepipe over their connecting gate on August 26 last year. He then unleashed a string of four-letter obscenities and thrust his head towards her face. She escaped with minor injury. Mrs Hellawell, who also used to breed greyhounds, said the problems started when Ferris began parking his car in their yard. She said: 'The car park or yard is quite large but it was not when we first moved in. So after a considerable cost to us, in the tens of thousands, we made it bigger so we had room for our cars and the cars of our staff at the time. 'When we arrived it was just a narrow rutted lane and no two vehicles could pass each other. It is now considerably bigger than it was. So a week in I went to see him about it. I have before allowed neighbours to park in it. Flash point: CCTV footage played in court also showed the moment Harry Ferris, right, attacked his neighbout Tilly Hellawell, left, because she threw a hose near a connecting fence whilst showing her friend a rockery . The court heard that Tilly and Philip Hellawell (pictured) were regularly on the end of four-letter tirades concerning parking, their shared garden gate and alleged dog mess . 'I saw his car and thought ""hang on, he has his own car on there."" There were also his contractor's vehicles there everyday - two or three at any given time. 'They were having work and construction done all the time. I thought, ""well he hasn't even asked to use the yard"". That is where it all started.' The couple also claim that before events reached a climax on Christmas Eve, the Ferris' took exception to their two dogs - Bob and Ellie - and tried to open the shared gates so the dogs would run out into the road. At his sentencing hearing, Ferris' solicitor Brian Koffman said the defendant felt he was constantly provoked but now knew 'not to rise to it'. Earlier, Ferris, who has no previous convictions, said Mr Hellawell had an 'obsessional' interest in his own security - with CCTV cameras fitted around his property and audio capture equipment installed at different locations. He was also said to carry around a dictation machine wherever he went. But the surveillance technology captured the moment Ferris set upon Mrs Hellawell, which her husband described as 'disturbing'. He said: 'My wife had had a friend over and was showing her the rockery. She saw that they the plants needed watering and went to get the hose. He came storming out, apparently because my wife had shut his gate so the dogs didn't run through. Burnley Magistrates Court heard that the chaos started just days after 18-stone Harry Ferris and his wife arrived at the property in April 2012 . 'My wife is tiny and he just towered over her. He was shouting at her and then walked away and came back and head butted her. I feel so helpless as her husband that I wasn't there and couldn't have protected her. 'I kept thinking if I was any sort of a man I would go and punch his lights out but then reality set in. 'He is so much bigger than me, I mean he used to be a builder and combating violence with violence would not have done anyone favours. 'My wife had a headache the next day. She went into a bit of a white mist. She didn't even dial 999 - that's how out of sorts she was.' Defending Ferris - who wore dark prescription sunglasses throughout his sentencing - Mr Koffman said he was a courteous and civil person, except when he gets upset about these 'particular issues'. 'He and his wife are in their 60s and are looking forward to retirement. This is a very unfortunate blemish on his character. He is a man who has never done anything wrong in his life. 'If he feels provoked he shouldn't rise to it. It boils down to a man and a lady who wanted to live their lives and don't feel they can because they are being harassed. 'The house is very attractive and it was supposed to be peaceful but it hasn't turned out like that.'","Footage captures Harry Ferris hurling his neighbour over a garden fence .

"This campaign is set to tackle  the barriers that stop women being more active . A bold new campaign set to tackle head on the barriers that stop millions of women being more active has been launched today. Led by Sport England, the This Girl Can campaign is the first of its kind to feature women of all shapes, sizes and sporting abilities that sweat and jiggle as they exercise. It seeks to tell the real story of women who exercise and play sport by using images that are the complete opposite of the idealised and stylised images of women we are now used to seeing. The campaign doesn't hold back in trying to encourage women to defeat any fears surrounding activity. 'Sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox' and 'I kick balls, deal with it' are among the hard hitting lines used in the campaign to prompt a change in attitudes and help boost women's confidence. This Girl Can will use prime time TV advertising, billboards and cinema and shopping centre screens to put images of real women exercising on the national stage and use social media to start a debate about attitudes to female sport. It comes as research, carried out by Sport England, reveals that by every measure, fewer women than men play sport regularly - two million fewer 14 to 40 year olds in total. Despite this, 75 per cent say they want to be more active. In some other European countries, this disparity doesn't exist. Further research into what's stopping women turning their ambitions into reality found that a fear of judgment - of their appearance, ability or how they choose to spend time on themselves - puts women of all ages off exercising. The findings were the driving force behind the campaign's creation, which aims to empower women and encourage more to get active. In particular, it celebrates women who have found their own ways of breaking down their barriers. Grace Monksfield Hammond, 22, from London, features in a print advert with the slogan 'I'm slow but I'm lapping everyone on the couch'. The full-time theatre arts student says: 'I have always been active, and now I incorporate exercise into my everyday life by cycling all over London whether that's to get to work, to go out in the evening, or wherever. 'I'm not an athlete, and I wouldn't describe myself as super fit - nor am I fast on my bike. 'When I first started cycling I didn't want to be taken seriously as I'm not an athlete, far from it, so I put flowers on my bike. 'I get energy from cycling and it makes me feel free and confident. 'I think that comes from exercise generally, not just cycling, and because it's just part of my life, i don't even think of it as exercise any more. 'I feely admits that I might not be the fastest rider in the saddle, but I don't let that bother me. 'I hope This Girl Can encourages women not to worry about whether they're the fast enough or good enough - I don't let it worry me, and nor should they.' Scroll down for video . Grace Monksfield Hammond, 22,  freely admits that she might not be the fastest rider in the saddle, but she doesn't let that bother her . Slogans like 'I kick balls. Deal with it.' aim to tackle the exercise gender gap, with two million men being more active than women . Sport England CEO Jennie Price said: 'The figures on participation are crystal clear. There is a significant gender gap, with two million more men than women exercising or playing sport regularly. 'I believe we can tackle this gap, because our research shows that 75 per cent of women would like to do more. 'Before we began this campaign, we looked very carefully at what women were saying about why they felt sport and exercise was not for them. Some of the issues, like time and cost, were familiar, but one of the strongest themes was a fear of judgment. 'Worries about being judged for being the wrong size, not fit enough and not skilled enough came up time and again. Every single woman I have talked to about this campaign - and that is now hundreds - has identified with this, and it is that fear of not being 'good enough' in some way, and the fear that you are the only one who feels like that, that we want to address. 'In This Girl Can we want to tell the real story of women who exercise and play sport. They come in all shapes and sizes and all levels of ability. They have a myriad of reasons for doing what they do. 'If you are wondering if you should join them - or carry on - this campaign says it really doesn't matter if you are a bit rubbish or completely brilliant, the main thing is that you are a woman and you are doing something, and that deserves to be celebrated.' The women featuring in the video campaign include Victoria, a 29-year-old paediatric nurse in A&E, from East London. While a lot of girls say that getting sweaty isn't feminine, Victoria isn't one of them. In fact, she is proud of getting hot, red faced and sweaty. She said: 'At first sweating may seem gross, but getting sweaty and red-faced shows your body's working hard and that's something to be proud of, not worry about. 'You have to put your shoulders back and hold your head high when you leave the gym or finish a run because having a sweaty face shows you've achieved something. 'It gives me more energy as well - I have to fit exercise around shift work because I'm a nurse and I often do a spin class before a night shift because it sets me up for what's ahead.'

Meanwhile Kelly, 31, is a single working mother  of three from Bury, near Manchester. She has found a distinct way to fit exercise into her life since she had her third child - by working out at home, with her children. Kelly said: 'After I had my third child I just felt sluggish, I didn't have any energy. I was due to go back to work and didn't feel good about myself and that gave me the kick-start I needed to find a way to prioritise getting active. I make exercise a family affair. My kids are part of the workout routine - we put on music or a DVD and just go for it together. 'It doesn't feel like a pain to do it because it's fun, and part of our life, and I really hope it has a positive effect on how my children view exercise as they grow up, so being active won't feel like a chore, but just something they naturally do.'

"My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been called a 'deadbeat dad' by his ex-wife in an explosive interview which also revealed the former tennis pro  is friends with show judge Pete Evans. Cindy Anderson, Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that her ex owes her tens of thousands of dollars in child support for their five children, aged between eight and 15 years of age. Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married to Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began. Cindy also claimed that Adam used to coach My Kitchen Rules judge Pete on the tennis court and that the pair worked together at his Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after she split with him. 'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. Scroll down for video . Owing child support? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson's ex-wife, Cindy, told A Current Affair on Monday night that he owes their five children approximately twelve months worth of child support, amassing tens of thousands of dollars . 'Deadbeat dad'? The former tennis professional is alleged to be providing his children with 'no financial support at all' according to his former wife . 'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady. Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.' 'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.' 'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said. Happier times: The couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together . Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age . Adam's ex also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children', with the blonde single mother saying she's speaking on A Current Affair instead of dealing with the matter privately because 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'. Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules. 'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules. 'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said. Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters . Making money? Cindy said she was most upset because her ex speaks of coaching at private schools but is allegedly unable to pay monies to his children . Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.' 'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added. While Cindy claims she wrote to producers of the show to find out if he was being paid for his appearances to garnish money from his wages, she was left without a response. A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.' Channel Seven also refuted the claim, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'. On TV: Cindy says there is no bitterness that Adam has moved on and  re-married recently, to his MKR partner Carol Molloy (pictured) Friends in high place?

"A teenager who threatened a shopkeeper and her young daughter with a sawn-off shotgun during a terrifying armed robbery has walked free from court - because he is 'young and impressionable'. Jack Phillips, 18, from Middlesbrough, burst into the shop in Stafford and waved the 2ft-long loaded weapon at Ranvir Bassi, 35,and her seven-year-old daughter Sattreet. Dramatic CCTV from the incident in November last year shows the robber pointing the single barrel gun directly at Mrs Bassi’s head while Sattreet hid at her feet. Scroll down for video . Jack Phillips, 18, from Middlesbrough, burst into Ranvir Bassi's shop in . Stafford in November last year and pointed a 2ft loaded gun at her and . her seven-year-old daughter - but has not been jailed . Mrs Bassi, 35, was shutting up the family-run shop when the . masked robber charged in - but Recorder Michael Elsom said someone else had possibly forced Phillips to commit the crime . Mrs Bassi - who was awarded £500 for her bravery - is then seen shoving the weapon away before bravely chasing the teenager out of the shop. But Phillips has now been spared jail because the recorder believes he committed the crime 'under pressure'. Mrs Bassi - who said her daughter still suffers with nightmares from the incident - has hit out at the 'ridiculous' decision and said she feels as though justice has not been done. She said: 'I’m shocked, it is a ridiculous decision not to send him to jail. 'He . terrified me and my family and my daughter still has nightmares about . it. I can’t believe he is still walking the streets and free to do this . to again. 'I just want to . put it all behind me and move on now, and just forget about it. I don’t . feel like justice has been served at all.' Mrs Bassi - who said her daughter still suffers with nightmares from . the incident - grabbed the gun barrel and shoved the intruder away . The shopkeeper was then seen chasing Phillips - who was 17 at the time - out of the shop before calling the police. In court, she was praised for her brave actions . After the incident, CCTV from the footage, which showed Mrs Bassi defending herself against the raider, went viral. She screamed 'get out of my shop' before pushing the gunman back towards the door and chasing him away. Under the Firearms Act, anyone who uses a . gun with intent should receive a custodial sentence - unless there are 'exceptional circumstances'. During the hearing at Stafford Crown Court, the court heard how the teen - who was 17 at the time of the offence - was later caught bragging to his friends about the video being on YouTube. Mrs Bassi, who runs Bassi & Son, said she was 'shocked' at the court's decision not to send the robber to jail . But Recorder Michael Elsom said Phillips' age - and the fact others had told him to carry out the offence when he was 'young and impressionable' - meant the . three-year mandatory jail-term should not be imposed. Defence solicitor Michael Anning had argued his client did not carry out his threats and the raid was over quickly. He said the teenager had been under pressure in relation to a debt he . allegedly owed and the gun was given to him by others to commit the . offence. The mother-of-two was awarded £500 by the court after what was described as a 'thoroughly frightening incident' Sentencing, Mr Elsom said: 'The prosecution can’t exclude the possibility that what you did . on November 4 was done under the direction of others more criminally . experienced than yourself, or under pressure. 'I have reports which suggest you are a person particularly susceptible to pressure. 'There . must be absolutely no doubt that what you did was a very dangerous . thing indeed, should anyone think I have forgotten the undoubted bravery . of Mrs Bassi. 'If they had . the advantage, as I have, of seeing the recording of what occurred, . no-one who saw that can think it was anything other than a thoroughly . frightening incident. 'Mrs Bassi behaved with extreme bravery, she didn’t know the gun you had in your hand was quite incapable of being fired.' The court heard how police found trainers belonging to Phillips near Mrs Bassi’s shop. They then discovered the shotgun discarded among old bike frames. The force’s armorer told the court it was an old weapon in a poor state that could have been put into working condition amd was loaded with a live 12-bore round. Phillips admitted robbery, possessing a firearm with intent to commit robbery and . possessing a prohibited weapon. He was sentenced to two years detention, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid community work and given a six-month curfew. After the hearing, Chief Inspector Jane Hewett, from Staffordshire Police, said: 'I would like to commend Mrs Bassi on her bravery. She showed tremendous courage.' The incident took place at Bassi & Son newsagent in Stafford, which the family has run for 19 years . Speaking at the time, Mrs Bassi told how her 'mother’s instinct' took over as she grabbed the barrel of the gun to force the thug away. She said: 'It was just horrific. I was shutting down the shop and he just burst in waving the gun around. 'I really don’t know why I did it, but I guess my mother’s instinct took over, my daughter Sattreet was hiding and I just grabbed the gun. 'He had shouted at me to give him the money and I just shouted ‘no, get out of my shop’ and started shoving him. 'I must have startled him because he turned and ran out of the shop. 'He just picked the wrong day to mess with me - I wasn’t having him take my hard earned cash.'","Jack Phillips, 18, waved 2ft loaded weapon at shopkeeper and daughter, 7 .

"The reputation of China’s new £400million Shijiazhuang Railway Station has been washed away by multiple leaks during a rainstorm that turned the inside of the building into a giant waterfall. Torrential rain hit Shijiazhuang city, Hebei province, on Thursday night, but its railway station, which is served by China’s high-speed trains, was not up to the job of sheltering passengers. Water passed through the ceiling of the station, built in 2012, soaking passengers waiting inside. Water catastrophe: Shijiazhuang Railway Station suffered huge leaks on Thursday . Soaked: A drenched passenger walks through the station with his luggage . The downpour led to the suspension of dozens of services. Some passengers who uploaded pictures of the cascading water to the internet said the problem was exacerbated by the station’s design, which incorporates lots of windows in the roof. Many of these were open when the rain started, they claimed. It comes after the roof of a Sydney Opera House replica building in China was  taken off due to severe leaks. Drip, drip effect: Some passengers who uploaded pictures of the cascading water to the internet said the problem was exacerbated by the station’s design . The knock-off building, in Liaoning province's Fuxin county near Inner Mongolia, came under the spotlight four years ago when the local government forked out 1.1 million yuan (£100,000 ) to construct it. The building, which was used as a waterside restaurant, was one of China's many 'grand projects' to re-brand regional cities as cultural hubs to attract tourists and investment. The roof structures were removed after a two-day-long process. One staff member told the Shanghaiist that the restaurant had been shut down last year as part of leader Xi Jinping's anti-extravagance campaign, and that local authorities had ordered the roof to be taken down. A spokesman with the county's housing construction bureau said the structural leakage was the reason for the roof's removal. 'Maybe the style is not satisfying,' said another staff commenter.

"World No 1 Rory McIlroy was struggling to reproduce his Ryder Cup form on the opening day of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Thursday. McIlroy was an approximate eight under par in beating Rickie Fowler 5&4 in the singles at Gleneagles as Europe defeated the United States for the eighth time in the last 10 events. But the 25-year-old failed to register a single birdie in the first 12 holes of his first round in the pro-am event which is played over the Old Course at St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. McIlroy did attract a new fan in the form of a three-year-old black Labrador named Duncan who took a great interest in the Northern Irishman's headcover on the 18th tee - much to the amusement of spectators.

McIlroy had recorded one bogey on the sixth and 11 pars to place in jeopardy his ambition to win a fifth tournament this year and also make the cut in the team event, thereby allowing his amateur partner - his father Gerry - to play the Old Course at St Andrews on his 55th birthday on Sunday.

"A man battling a rare form of cancer has had part of his face removed in a bid to save his life. Raymond Martin, 63, has facial angiosarcoma, a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels. The great-grandfather of two has endured a series of operations, the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face. Raymond Martin, 63, from Scotswood, Newcastle, has facial angiosarcoma, a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels. Here he is pictured before surgery . He first noticed a spot on his cheek but never expected it would lead to a serious cancer diagnosis, which would change his appearance so dramatically. ‘It all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so I didn’t worry about it,’ Mr Martin said. ‘But the spot started to spread so I went to see a GP and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and I was given a course of antibiotics.’ However, the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse, he was sent to hospital for tests. ‘Never in a hundred years, could I have imagined that I would be told I had cancer,’ Mr  Martin said. Medics at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary took a skin biopsy from Mr Martin and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face. There was no other option than to perform . life-saving surgery to remove the tumour in a 12 hour operation, with . skin taken from Mr Martin’s thigh, grafted onto his face. The great grandfather of two has endured a series of operations, the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face, where skin from his thigh was used as a graft . It took a number of weeks before Mr Martin plucked up the courage to look at himself in a mirror. ‘I knew that the operation had to be done, so I just had to get on with it, said the father-of-four. ‘I was in hospital for a few weeks and I did feel a bit dubious about how I’d look after the operation as I didn’t know what to expect. ‘When I was going home from hospital I thought “I don’t want to look in the mirror”. ‘It was a few weeks before I had a proper look at myself and I did get frightened as it looked like I had a bandage on my face. ‘I was shocked and worried to go out of the house as I didn’t know what reaction I’d get from people. ‘It took a few months before I left my home and I would spend a lot of time in my bedroom watching TV.’ Mr Martin first noticed a spot on his cheek, which spread (pictured) but never expected it would lead to a serious cancer diagnosis, which would change his appearance so dramatically . Angiosarcoma is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour. It usually occurs in the head, neck, and especially in the scalp of elderly people. Its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules. The treatment depends on the extent of the disease, but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue. SOURCE: National Centre for Biotechnology Information . Following the operation, doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and Mr Martin underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells. But, just six months later, the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region’s Northern Centre for Cancer Care. Mr Martin has had a total of six operations, including one to reconstruct his nose, which did not work and will require further facial surgery in the future. Experts have told Mr Martin that it is fortunate the cancer was growing outside his body and was therefore detected in time, as angiosarcoma tumours often grow internally. He said: ‘I feel I’m one of the lucky ones as my cancer was picked up quick enough for treatment. Mr Martin has had a total of six operations, including one to reconstruct his nose, which did not work and will require further facial surgery in the future . ‘I just take things each day at a time, what else can I do? I have to live my life and be happy.’ It is unlikely that Mr Martin’s cancer will be cured and he continues to get chemotherapy once a week with the aim of slowing down the progression of the disease. It is feared he will lose his right eye as the cancer has spread to that area. Mr Martin, his wife Alice, 62, and their family, have received help from Macmillan Cancer Support.","Raymond Martin, 63, from Scotswood, Newcastle, has facial angiosarcoma, a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels .

"Aga has announced a £4 million increase in profits over the past 12 months due to its popularity . The were once the preserve of middle-class housewives across rural Britain. But the Aga - the quintessentially British oven - has become a sought-after status symbol among China’s burgeoning middle-classes. As their maker, Aga Rangemaster, prepares to sell its first cookers in China this autumn, analysts said they had become akin to owning ‘a BMW or a Mercedes’ in the far-east. It comes as the firm, which was badly-affected by the financial crisis, announced sales were up 3.3 per cent for the first half of the year, with a 10 per cent rise in the UK. The cast-iron cooker maker recorded revenues of £124million this year, compared to £120million in 2013. Helal Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: ‘There are more and more middle-class consumers in China and, just like they want BMWs and Mercedes, they are also looking for other prestigious consumer items – and the Aga is one of them.’ The Aga for the Chinese market will include a hob on the top which can be used to cook food in a wok. A spokeswoman for the firm said: ‘We noticed that cooking trends in China were really changing. ‘It used to be that most cooking was traditionally done in a wok, but baking is now becoming more and more popular over there. ‘The radiant heat you get from an Aga rather than a fan oven gives a more even result when baking and the consumers have responded to that.’ Currently, Chinese customers must order the cooker from Aga in the UK or from a number of other overseas suppliers. But from the autumn, Chinese customers will be able to buy their cookers through a local firm supplied by Aga. The Leamington Spa-based group said the appetite for the kitchen appliance was growing, despite uncertainties around interest rates and the mortgage market. Analysts attributed the bumper sales to the strong housing market in the UK in recent months. The latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders found 171,000 loans for house purchases were approved in the second quarter of 2014, up by 17 per cent on a year ago. Mr Miah said: ‘Agas are back in the kitchen. ‘When we look at the results, we have seen a huge improvement, especially in the UK, where the housing market is continuing to do well. ‘I know salaries are not up, but consumer confidence is good. If people are feeling confident that they will hold on to their jobs, it helps when it comes to forking out quite a bit of money on a high-end cooker. ‘Aga was fairly battered by the housing crisis but things are looking up.’ The company still reported a loss of £300,000 during the first half of the year, although this was an improvement on £2.4million in 2013.

"Andy Murray's winning run in China came to an end on Saturday as he fell to world No 1 Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals of the China Open. Murray won in Shenzhen last week as he seeks to force his way into the top eight in the rankings and make the ATP World Tour Finals and his run to the last-four in Beijing will have done that bid no harm. But he could not produce the goods to overcome Djokovic who claimed a 6-3 6-4 win in an hour and 36 minutes. Andy Murray smashes his racket during his defeat to Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals of the China Open . Murray lost to world No 1 Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 as the Scot's winning run in China came to an end . The first set was going with serve with the minimum of fuss until an epic eighth game which lasted nine minutes. Murray saw off two break points and then got on game point but ballooned a forehand long and was clearly irritated with himself as he walked back to the baseline. Djokovic earned himself another break point and this time he took it as Murray put the ball into the net to hand the Serb a 5-3 lead. The world number one then closed out the first set to leave Murray, who has never beaten him when losing the first set, with a mountain to climb. Djokovic celebrates his victory over Murray having made it to the final of the China Open . Murray screams out in anger - the Scot has never beaten Djokovic having lost the first set . And the Scot's task became greater at the start of the second as a couple of unforced errors allowed Djokovic to break him to love in the opening game and then keep Murray off the board in the second to storm into a 2-0 lead. Murray held serve in the third game and had two break points in a 10-minute battle in the fourth but Djokovic held his nerve to make it 3-1. He had a break point to make it 4-1 but Murray fought back and Djokovic was made to pay as Murray broke at the third time of asking to level things up. Both men then held their serve but Djokovic broke again to make it 5-4 and served out the final game to love to advance to the final. Djokovic, who served out the last game to advance to the final of the China open, stretches to make a shot .","Andy Murray loses to Novak Djokovic 6-3,6-4 in semi-final of China Open .

"Kingman has galloped into retirement with trainer John Gosden describing him as the best colt he has ever trained. Plans for the four-time group one winner to have one final run in either the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on October 18 or in the Breeders’ Cup Mile on November 1 have been shelved because of ongoing treatment for a throat infection. It scuppers of a possible dream showdown between Kingman and dual Derby winner Australia in the QE II Stakes. Kingman ridden by James Doyle breaks away to win the St James's Palace Stakes on day one of Royal Ascot . John Gosden, who trained Kingman, has described the colt as the best he has ever worked with . Gosden, who had previously insisted his champion miler had the gears to dominate the sprint division, said: ‘He had a turbo charge that no other horse I've trained has possessed. He's the most exciting horse I've trained. ‘I trained Royal Heroine to win at the Breeders' Cup in a record time, and she was very good, but this boy would be in a different league.’ Kingman’s absence from the QE II Stakes could also have a significant bearing on the trainer’s title race. Gosden leads Richard Hannon by over £250,000 and would have hoped to collect around £600,000 from a first place at Ascot with Kingman. In the absence of the Khaled Abdullah-owned colt, Hannon will have the prize in his sights, perming his attack from a squad of Night Of Thunder, Olympic Glory and Toronado. It was Night of Thunder who inflicted the only defeat on Kingman in six races this year when beating him half a length in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May.

Gosden couldn’t hide his frustration at the unsatisfactory result of a Classic turned into a tactical nightmare when the field split into two packs racing on either side of the Rowley Mile. If anyone doubted whether James Doyle-ridden Kingman, who won seven of his eight career starts and £970,834, was the best miler of his generation, they were handed emphatic evidence when he romped to a five-length win in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and then avenged his Newmarket reverse by beating Night of Thunder two-and-a-quarter lengths in the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. But arguably he was at his most visually impressive when leaving 2013 winner Toronado for dead in a slowly-run Sussex Stakes which turned into a two-furlong burn-up. Kingman will stand at his owner’s Banstead Manor Stud alongside Frankel.","Kingman was planned to have one final run in either the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on October 18 or in the Breeders’ Cup Mile .

Londoner Harry Jacobs suffers from Alopecia totalis, the same condition that the Swansea midfielder has, causing both to lose their hair from a young age. And, when Harry wrote to the 22-year-old midfielder, Shelvey immediately wanted to help. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Jonjo Shelvey talking about helping Harry .

'It was quite tough for me with people calling me names and things.' The boy from Muswell Hill had written to Shelvey inviting him to his school in north London and asking the Premier League star what he thought of the condition. 'You are amazing and scored a goal from 47 yards into the top corner,' wrote Harry. 'So, so, so good. 'I know you play for Swansea. My name is Harry and I have Alopecia like you. Do you like it? I think it is medium because I can't get nits and don't have to go to the hairdressers – which is good. I don't really like it though.

'I felt for Harry when I got the letter,' he said. 'It was nice for me to share some of my experiences with him and to try and guide him along the right lines. 'The best bit though was seeing the look on his face walking out with the team. He said he had a great time – and that's so special.'

"Believe the hype and they’re the natural solution for everything from cancer, heart disease and dementia to ageing skin, poor eyesight and insomnia. No wonder ‘superfruits’ pop up in cereals, desserts, snack bars, juice, face cream — even designer gin. But though it is claimed that goji berries, acai juice, pomegranates and cranberries are rooted in  ancient medicine, the explosion in their use is, in fact, a modern phenomenon. Sugarfruit: 'Superfruit' cranberry is often coated in sugar to be made palatable and it is also added to cranberry juice . Two out of three juices launched last year claimed to contain superfruit. A major launch in 2011 was Cherrygood — a fruit juice made in part from an imported American cherry supposedly very high in antioxidants. One glass will give ‘the equivalent health benefits of around 20 portions of fruit and vegetables’. Though the company offers no proof of that claim, Cherrygood has been a hit, with all supermarkets and health stores stocking it. But anti-obesity campaigners point out it has as much sugar as cola — about 5 tsp in a 250ml serving. Cherrygood Plus has 9 tsp sugar. Despite doubts around the science, superfruits and their spin-offs keep coming. Last year saw the launch of a ‘supertree’ — the powder of the bark of the African baobab, which you mix into yoghurt or water to get ‘six times more vitamin C than oranges’. Meanwhile, Waitrose is busy pushing yuzu lemonade, from a Japanese citrus fruit that has ‘three times as much vitamin C as lemons’. Some kind of super: Pomegranate juice has been found to help hospital patients with poor bloodflow . Sales are soaring of fibre and potassium-rich goldenberries, a dried version of the South American cape gooseberry. Predicted for success in 2014 is the gac fruit from Vietnam, a spiky orange with flesh that looks like raw meat. It contains lycopene — an antioxidant also found in tomatoes — which is said to combat prostate cancer. Also coming up is the Chilean wineberry, a miniature blueberry from Patagonia, with ‘three to four times more antioxidants than goji berries’. Most of these fruits are sold dried or as juice — transporting fresh fruit raises costs. The nutrients will not be damaged if the drying is done carefully, but some, such as cranberries, are sprayed with sugar as part of the process. ACAI JUICE£1.96 for 100mlTHE CLAIMS: The acai berry from the Amazon contains twice the antioxidants as blueberries. THE REALITY:  Regulators have asked firms to stop claiming antioxidants prevent cancer. POMEGRANATE JUICE £1.50 for 100mlTHE CLAIMS: The Middle Eastern fruit has almost three times the antioxidants of green tea.THE REALITY:  In a trial, 45 patients with poor blood flow were given 240ml of pomegranate juice. After three months they were doing better than those on a placebo. CRANBERRIES£1.59 for 100gTHE CLAIMS: Good at fighting urinary tract infections.THE REALITY:  Cranberries need sugar to make them palatable — one glass of Ocean Spray cranberry juice contains 7 tsp. Some say the acid in juice may make cystitis symptoms more painful. GOLDENBERRY £2.99 for 100gTHE CLAIMS: Grown in the Andes, the goldenberry is high in fibre and contains B vitamins, more iron than spinach, more fibre than prunes and more potassium than three bananas.THE REALITY: Good nutritional offering for the price. GOJI BERRIES  £3.20 for 100gTHE CLAIMS: Used by herbalists to protect liver, improve sexual function and promote longevity.THE REALITY: Very high in antioxidants, but benefits are disputed. Sex and age claims have no scientific backing. Most juice versions of superfruits contain extra sugar in the form of concentrated apple or grape juice, which still allows them to claim ‘no added sugar’. Still it seems that if eaten or drunk in moderation, none of the superfruits will do you any harm. But will they do you any good? All the superfruits claim they contain a big dose of vitamin C, but the simple fact is that there are no diseases prevalent in Britain that have anything to do with vitamin C deficiency. Many foods have vitamin C, including bread and jam, because acids containing it are often used as a preservative. The skin of a medium-sized potato will give you 45 per cent of the daily recommended dose. Taking extra vitamin C is not believed to do much good, despite the popular belief that it fends off colds and flu. A review of 30 studies in 2007 concluded that the benefits of taking vitamin C supplements for such illnesses were not worth the expense. Sioned Quirke, a senior dietitian for the NHS in Wales, says: ‘We often find that people who can afford to buy these products are following a healthy, balanced diet and do not need additions. And they are painfully expensive.’ She believes the poor and unhealthy are being taken advantage of, citing one patient spending £75 or more on food supplements in a health shop. These included dried superfruits and juices, which can cost as much as £20 a litre. ‘People are gullible, especially when they are desperate for a miracle cure. These shops prey on them. Some people will be living on crisps for the next week because they can’t afford a proper diet.’ So, is there anything in the superfruit claims? The most interesting evidence is around polyphenols and bioflavonoids, found in large amounts in superfruits. These are forms of antioxidants, as is vitamin C. Oxidation produces harmful agents called free radicals that are blamed for a host of problems, from the formation of cancers to ageing. Half of all Americans are said to take antioxidant supplements. But though millions have been spent over two decades researching antioxidants, the science is still far from convincing. Cancer experiments have shown positive results, but only in lab animals. The most impressive study of berries and disease — carried out by Harvard University on 93,000 women for 18 years — did find that those who ate three portions of strawberries and blueberries a week had 34 per cent less  chance of having a heart attack than those who had one portion a month. Researchers speculated antioxidants in the berries might play a role, but so might lifestyle. Women who rarely eat fruit are also less likely to take exercise. One of Britain’s top toxicologists, Professor David Colquhoun, of University College, London, says that in the case of the antioxidant beta-carotene and vitamin E supplements, studies show these are more likely to raise your risk of dying early. A major review of studies in 2012 concluded there was not enough evidence to support people taking antioxidant supplements. Professor Colquhoun told me he has never read any science on nutrition that has persuaded him to alter his already healthy diet. His stark verdict is: ‘Antioxidants are useless, and some are dangerous.’ Government regulators agree their beneficial effects have not been proved. In Europe and the U.S., food safety agencies have moved to try to limit manufacturers’ claims — though with little effect, as any health food website will show. Shops are more careful — Holland & Barrett, Britain’s largest health chain, stocks 114 products that contain antioxidants. But the store only says these ‘may help’ rather than claiming specific benefits. Some say the best effect of superfruits may take place a long way from the bodies of those who buy them. The fashion for goldenberries, a high-potassium, high-fibre fruit sold in Marks & Spencer, Whole Foods and Holland & Barrett, is bringing employment to poor farmers in the Andes. Growing coca for cocaine is the only other valuable crop. ‘All fruits are superfruits in their own way,’ says Sioned Quirke. ‘None is going to guide you to the Promised Land, but try to meet the five-a-day fruit and veg aim by eating a variety of whole fruits — not just juices, which often are just sugar and flavour — and you’ll begin to optimise your health.’","Superfruits such as acai and pomegranates boast a big dose of vitamin C .

"On first sight the Lego construction could be any family picnic, but look closer and you might see some clues to a very Royal connection. This unusual display is actually a miniature Buckingham Palace, complete with garden party to celebrate Prince George's first birthday yesterday. The attraction ties in with the Prince's birthday party and the gilded guest list that included most of the Royal Family - and it has gone on display at Legoland Windsor. Ah isn't he sweet! The Royal one-year-old flanked by his parents si recreated sitting in his highchair ready for a Lego cake . Spot one's Royal party goers? Can you guess which family members are created here? As the Queen joined Kate and William to celebrate the toddler's birthday with Prince Harry, the Middleton clan and others at Kensington Palace, visitors to Legoland will be treated to a brick by brick Lego version of the event. The first birthday party features a recreation of Buckingham Palace, a tiny Prince George, traditional birthday bunting and balloons, tiny jellies and ice cream, and even a tiny Lego birthday cake. The miniature Lego birthday cake has one candle marking his age and those clever people at Legoland also made some miniature party food creations at the tea party complete with red white and blue balloons. Cute: George as created by Legoland Windsor model maker Marco Mirano, left. Even the corgis make an appearance, right, in the overall attraction. Woof!

"A teenage girl who led a plot to trick taxi drivers into picking up masked gunmen who would rob them has been jailed. Lucy Gardner, 19, would call taxi firms under a false name and order journeys around Birmingham. But when the drivers arrived, Gardner, who referred to herself as Katie in the false bookings, would either be nowhere to be seen, or accompanied by men wielding handguns. Baby-faced decoy: Lucy Gardner, pictured, booked taxis under a false . name, tricking drivers into picking up masked gunmen who tried to take . their money. She has been jailed for two-and-a-half years . After making their way inside the taxis, the masked men would beat the drivers, hold them at gunpoint and demand their money and mobile phones. She made two attempts to fleece drivers using this scheme, but both times the men managed to drive off and leave their attackers empty-handed. Gardener, of Redditch, Worcestershire, admitted two counts of attempted robbery in Birmingham Crown Court last week, and was jailed for two-and-a-half years. The court heard how the first attempt was made on July 10 last year, when Gardner ordered a taxi but did not turn up to meet it. Instead, a man climbed into the passenger seat when the car pulled up - and was soon followed by a second man with a handgun, which was pointed at the driver's face along with demands for cash. But the taxi driver managed to escape by speeding from the scene with his car doors still open. However, the gang made a second attempt just two days later when Gardner ordered a taxi from Beechcroft Road in Birmingham. This time the teenager got into the passenger seat but the driver became suspicious when a masked man got into the back carrying 'something in his hand'. He drove off causing the man to fall out of the cab and Gardner screamed until she was let out further down the road. Police were able to trace her via her mobile phone, which contained the fake name Katie as well as potential taxi pick-up and drop-off points. Judge Sybil Thomas told her: 'You played an integral part in two very serious offences. Lured: One taxi driver was told to come to Beechcroft Road in Birmingham, pictured, where masked men threatened him with guns and in one incident a Beretta-style hand-gun was wielded . 'They required a young woman to be the person who lured the taxi drivers to the scene. 'You knew there was a firearm going to be produced, that it was a replica gun. It must have been simply terrifying.' Telling the court about the first robbery, prosecutor Jason Pegg said: 'Stood outside was not Katie but a male who sat in the passenger seat. 'Both men started shouting, ""Give us your money, give us your phone"", the driver was punched and the passenger pulled out a Beretta-style hand-gun and pointed it at his face. 'He [the driver] was shouting, ""Don’t do this"" to try to raise the alarm, but the males persisted. He says they were relentless.' The court heard Gardner had fallen into 'bad company' after leaving the care of the local authority and was a 'victim of exploitation'. Defending the teenager, Samantha Forsyth said: 'She has acknowledged the seriousness and gravity of her position and also expressed considerable remorse and regret for her actions.' Two other men arrested over the attempted robberies were later released without charge.","Lucy Gardner booked taxi journeys in Birmingham using the name Katie .

"It is still early in the season but already serious questions are being asked of Arsenal. The biggest one, I feel, is this: what is changing? Watching them crumble against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night, it was impossible to escape the conclusion that they aren’t learning. For a decade now, Arsenal have been unable to contain opponents who go with a fast, physical gameplan. Everyone knows how to play against them. Arsenal were defeated 2-0 in Dortmund on Tuesday, but it could have been much more for the Germans . Danny Welbeck has been brought in from Manchester United, but is yet to score after a host of chances . Dortmund could have comfortably run up a score similar to the ones posted by Liverpool (5-1 in February) and Chelsea (6-0 in March), but the aspect I found most alarming was the fact they have only kept three clean sheets in their past 29 Champions League away games. That, frankly, is an awful record. When I watch Arsenal now, I get frustrated. They play the same way wherever they go — with their full-backs pushed up high and wide — and get caught on the counter-attack. They are the away team! They should be doing that to the home team when they go travelling. Why don’t they learn? It is unforgivable that this keeps happening. The penny needs to drop. When I played in Europe with Liverpool, the first objective was always to get a clean sheet: make yourself difficult to break down then, if a chance arose, pounce and pick up whatever you could. If the home fans didn’t like it, so what? Yet Arsenal feel they can beat anyone. Anywhere. Playing their own game. It’s naive. The only team able to get away with such a philosophy in recent years was Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona — one of the greatest sides of all time — but even he wasn’t afraid to concoct different tactical plans. Look at how last year’s champions, Real Madrid, secured their place in the final by playing on the counter-attack against Bayern Munich — and that was in the first leg at the Bernabeu. It was the best tactic for them to use. Doing things differently is vital. Jose Mourinho, for one, always has a surprise up his sleeve. Sir Alex Ferguson, remember, sometimes used Park Ji-sung in man-marking roles in Europe and would have Cristiano Ronaldo up front on his own, as he knew he would not track the opposition full-back. With Arsenal, though, it seems there is one way only and you can’t help but wonder where it is all heading. Wenger is a legendary figure in our game; his achievements will stand the test of time but you sometimes question whether there is a negative to him being so secure in his job. Arsene Wenger must go back to the drawing board if he is to take Arsenal to the next level . Arsenal stars Alexis Sanchez (left) and Jack Wilshere (right) look dejected on Tuesday night . Last season, Chelsea finished three points ahead of Arsenal in third place. But Wenger had the better campaign, as he finished it with the FA Cup. Mourinho knows there is going to be scrutiny on him and his position this season if he does not succeed, so he has strengthened his squad impressively. In came proven winners — headed by Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Didier Drogba — and the results, bar an unexpected stutter against Schalke in midweek, are there for all to see. Chelsea are favourites to lift the Barclays Premier League after four straight victories. Wenger, by contrast, buys players with the future in mind. Take Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers. Both are fine prospects, but there isn’t the same scrutiny on Wenger from the boardroom as there is with Mourinho. It’s like he’s always looking to tomorrow, not addressing today. Why wasn’t Wenger in the market for Costa when everyone knew Arsenal needed a proven striker? Why not try to sign Petr Cech, the best goalkeeper in the Premier League last year? Yes, Alexis Sanchez has quality but was he really what Arsenal required? Chelsea, who finished just ahead of Arsenal, went out and signed Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid . Why didn't Arsene Wenger try to sign Chelsea's Petr Cech, or rival them for defender Filipe Luis? I’ve said before that Arsenal’s spine is not strong enough. With questions hanging over Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs, they needed a left back, so why didn’t they rival Chelsea for Filipe Luis? Go back 10 years and Arsenal had a template for winning the title. I can only stress, again, that between 2002 and 2004, they were the best team I ever faced. They had pace and power, skill and top ability from goalkeeper to centre forward. I understand that it’s difficult to keep finding players such as Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira but there were others — Lauren, Edu, Sylvain Wiltord and Freddie Ljungberg — who were not the biggest names but all had class and all could handle the physical demands of the English football. Now when you look at Arsenal, you see very few who look capable of enduring the rigours of a Premier League campaign. Arsenal look weak and they are screaming out for someone with presence to help hold their midfield together. Welbeck (left) and Calum Chambers are prospects, but Arsenal are always looking to tomorrow and not today . They do, of course, remain capable of playing fine football but memories of the days when they did it in the biggest games are fading. They are entering a period now that could prove crucial in defining the shape of their season. After Saturday's meeting with Aston Villa, they have the small matter of the north London derby, then a trip to Stamford Bridge; there is also a Champions League tussle with Galatasaray. The biggest concern is their performance in the big contests. Even when they went 2-1 up against Manchester City last Saturday, I never felt Arsenal would win. They should have lost the game in the end and you always expect them to concede in the pressure moments. If that doesn’t change, nothing in the bigger picture will change, either. They won’t challenge for the biggest prizes and they will continue to be picked off in the crucial fixtures. It is up to Wenger to find the answers. Of course, replacing the likes of Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp was always going to be a tough task . Euro stars Everton eye route to the elite . If results were mixed for English sides in the Champions League, it was good to see Everton strike a blow with their thumping 4-1 win against Wolfsburg. Roberto Martinez selected his strongest team and was rewarded with an excellent result and performance against quality opposition. It was good to see him take that approach, particularly when some Premier League teams in the past have played as if they don’t want to be in Europe. Steven Naismith celebrates with Leighton Baines after the defender scored a penalty in the 48th minute . The question now facing Everton, though, is how do they cope with the rhythm of playing Thursday-Sunday football? Can they keep producing results in the Premier League after they have been in Russia, France and Germany? Should they be able to do that, they will be in for another successful season and it might just be that the Europa League offers Martinez the best opportunity to fulfil the ambition that he promised Bill Kenwright when he arrived in June 2013. Goodison Park looked a picture under the floodlights on Thursday evening against Wolfsburg . Martinez said he would ‘get Everton into the Champions League’ and the Europa League gives him a chance to get there. Everton got 72 points in the Premier League last season yet still couldn’t finish in the top four and competition for those places will only be harder again this time around. Everton, however, have shown they are going to take the Europa League seriously and that might open up a bigger avenue to them further down the line. This week I’m looking forward to... Watching Diego Costa and Vincent Kompany go to war. If Manchester City’s clash with Chelsea is the game of the season so far, the subplot of Sunday's clash between Kompany and Costa is fascinating. I watched Kompany last week against Arsenal and he was outstanding. He is the number one defender in the Barclays Premier League and playing at the top of his game, but the challenge he will face from Costa is going to be different than anything he has had this season. Kompany puts his body on the line against Bayern Munich in an attempt to stop Robert Lewandowski . Similar sentiments apply to Costa. He was deservedly Player of the Month for August and seven goals in his first four matches make him the most feared striker in the division, but he has not tackled a defender of Kompany’s calibre. I have been in Kompany’s position before and when you know you are going to face one of the best attackers in the game, it is only natural that you spend time thinking about your private battle, not just the outcome of the game in general. The way it looks at the moment, City and Chelsea are going to be the teams slugging it out for the title and even at this early stage, getting an advantage could be significant. Much will depend on who emerges on top between Kompany and Costa. One thing is for sure and that is that it will be compelling viewing.

"Not even watching football hooligan film Green Street could dissuade Enner Valencia from moving to West Ham. The 2005 film, starring Elijah Wood of Lord of the Rings fame, was the 24-year-old striker’s only reference point before signing for £12million from Mexican side Pachuca. But despite seeing the film about East End hooligans on the rampage, Valencia was very relaxed about arriving at Upton Park. Enner Valancia (L) is loving life in the East End following his £12million summer move to West Ham . Valencia's only point of reference before arriving was football hooligan film Green Street . This is a man, after all, who knows that football in this country cannot be any crazier than in his native South America. Valencia, who had an excellent World Cup with Ecuador, has been barricaded inside stadiums after losing games and says it is a continent where you do not dare show your face after defeat. ‘I was not scared,’ he says when asked about watching Green Street. ‘I respected the fact that they are very passionate but when I found out I was coming here I didn’t know what to expect. ‘But as soon as I arrived I was told that was all back in the day, in the old days, and it has all changed now. Stewart Downing congratulates Valencia after his outstanding goal against Hull City . West Ham fans have taken the Ecuador striker to their hearts at Upton Park . Valancia, playing here against France,  starred for Ecuador at the 2014 World Cup . ‘When I was playing for my previous club Emelec — it was a derby, the Clasico, and our main rivals (Barcelona SC) were top of the league (in 2012). ‘We had to beat them in order to move on to the same points and we couldn’t get the win. It was very difficult to get everyone out of the stadium. ‘In South America if you lose a match you can’t even go out in the street. At West Ham after we lost the opening game (at home to Tottenham Hotspur) people stayed in the stadium and showed their support. That’s something I really liked.’ It has not taken West Ham fans long to warm to Valencia after his stunning strike from a standing start away at Hull and a good display in the surprise win against Liverpool last week. In his first few games he has done enough to suggest that boss Sam Allardyce has found his missing link. Valencia has the sort of firepower that should make him a success, and Allardyce hopes he will bring added entertainment to the club alongside Diafra Sakho up front. Valencia remembers not being able to leave the stadium after losing derby between Emelec and Barcelona SC . Valencia admits he expected to beat the big teams following West Ham's victory over Liverpool . West Ham showed off the newly-decorated Olympic Stadium on their official website on Tuesday . An outdoor view released on Tuesday of the West Ham's all-new megastore in  the Olympic Stadium . West Ham fans may get a super view out of the East Stand 'Kop' window from the Arnold Hills . West Ham's gallery included this photograph of the new Reservation Centre at Stratford . Valencia said: ‘I come from a very poor background. ‘I had to go and work with my dad on the farm milking cows. I had to sell the milk and stuff in order to afford to buy my first boots.’ Valencia — who spoke via a translator — is having daily English lessons in a bid to immerse himself in this country’s culture. ‘I can say that it has been a good start, the way that I have adapted to the Premier League. ‘It has been a very good start,’ he said. ‘I was expecting to be able to beat the top teams.’ First Liverpool, then Manchester United. Valencia wouldn’t mind being locked inside Old Trafford if he nets a winner. Valencia was talking at the launch of West Ham's new members' club - 'Club London' - which offers fans the chance to experience what Brady labelled as an 'unrivalled hospitality experience'. Season ticket holders and members will soon be able to visit the new Reservation Centre at Westfield Stratford City to hand-pick their new seats at the Olympic Stadium.","Enner Valencia arrived at West Ham from Pachuca in a £12m deal .

"Mario Balotelli needs to score more goals, according to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. The Italian forward joined the club from AC Milan this summer in a £16million deal but has so far failed to live up to his billing. While Rodgers admits Balotelli is working hard and trying to build his fitness, the former Swansea boss says the 24-year-old will ultimately be judged on his scoring record. Mario Balotelli started on the bench for Liverpool's recent Premier League match against West Brom . Former Manchester City star Balotelli poses with his PumaxBape range of clothes, boots and bags . Rodgers said: 'I think in terms of his behaviour since he's come into here, into the training, he's consciously trying to work hard at the aspects of the game of which we would demand here at Liverpool in terms of his intensity and that work rate. 'I think in terms of goals he needs to improve. It's as simple as that. 'As a striker, not just him but any striker or attacking player, you're judged on your goals and your games and the number of assists that you make. 'Of course at this moment he hasn't probably hit the numbers that he would want to.' The former Manchester City star posted a string of photos on his Instagram account of himself modelling the new PumaxBape range. Rodgers admitted that, as a striker, Balotelli will always be judged on the number of goals he scores .

"Fastfood giant KFC has suspended a member of staff who claimed an order was laced with pubic hair. The worker at the restaurant in Gabalfa, Cardiff, said the alleged move was an act of revenge after customers told her friend to 'smile more'. However, bosses claim it could not have happened because there were four other people in the kitchen - 'which is pretty cosy'. A worker at KFC in Gabalfa, Cardiff has been suspended after claiming order was laced with pubic hair . Details of the alleged incident were published in an anonymous post on the 'Spotted Cardiff' Facebook page, designed as an outlet for 'rants' about the Welsh capital. The staff member wrote that the victims of the prank, a group of girls, drove through KFC between 1pm and 1.30pm yesterday. The post said: 'Karma's a **** girls, hope you enjoyed your food I made for you after overhearing the way you spoke to my girl on the head set be picking pubes out your teeth for a week' (sic). It was then signed off with 'mwah', a word used to express the sound of a kiss. However, a spokesman for KFC said the worker - who is suspended indefinitely - has now admitted it didn't happen after being interviewed by the 'area coach'. The spokesman conceded that there was an 'altercation' at the drive-thru but maintain that no food was contaminated - adding that two other workers have since been interviewed and insist it could not be true. 'We were already pretty confident that it didn't happen. The post was put up and then everyone that was there was interviewed by the area coach,' she said. 'It takes a few people to make a meal and the other workers say there is no way she could have done it. 'Two other people are pretty confident that it didn't happen. The message, which was posted on Facebook page Spotted Cardiff, . suggested the worker had carried out the alleged act in an apparent . revenge attack for rudeness - but KFC now claims she made it up . 'She has admitted it was a spur of the moment prank to draw attention to the people that were being rude.' The . chain said in a statement: 'We have thoroughly investigated this . incident and can confirm that the content of the post is untrue and that . the food was not contaminated in any way. 'It . was a badly misjudged and regrettable social media prank and we'd like . to reassure customers that the incident did not happen.' Earlier today the spokesman said: 'We have investigated this incident and although there was an altercation in the drive-thru between the customers and a member of our team, we do not believe the food was contaminated in any way. 'We have the highest standards of food hygiene and do not tolerate even the suggestion of this kind of behaviour, and therefore the employee was suspended as soon as the matter came to our attention.'

"Pepsi flavored Cheetos exist. That’s right, you read correctly. Pepsi-flavored Cheetos are a thing. But they are only on-sale in Japan. Officially named ‘Pepsi Shuwa Shuwa,’ the snacks will not be sold in the US, according to a Frito-Lay spokesperson. Reactions online have ranged from amusement and disgust to one person professing their love for the strange snack. Pepsi Shuwa Shuwa: these strange snacks are named after the sound of carbonation . In a country known for having strange food, the cola flavored snacks named after the sound of carbonation are getting mixed reviews. The nouveau Cheetos actually smell like Pepsi, according to multiple online reviews, and reveal what a naked Cheeto would like if stripped of all its cheese. If pictures are worth a thousand words, the look on the face of one taste-tester on YouTube was priceless. ‘Oh, that’s so weird,’ the reviewer immediately said with a confused look on his face as he reached back into the bag for a second helping, almost in disbelief of what he was eating. Not convinced: This reviewer wasn't a fan, calling the snacks strange and weird . Explaining the texture is ‘basically a Cheeto,’ the disappointed snack enthusiast said ‘I’m not gonna say it tastes good.’ Laughing incredulously, he described a carbonation sensation on the tongue similar to Pop-Rocks ‘you can feel the carbonation as you’re eating the corn snacks, it’s really weird.’ Calling the Frito Lay-Pepsi collaboration ‘interesting,’ the reviewer says that soda-flavored Cheetos are considered ‘crazy’ even by most of his colleagues. The original: It appears most people would rather just stick to plain old Cheetos . Retailing for only a few hundred yen in Japan, the snacks can be bought on eBay for varying prices ranging all the way up to almost $50, as part of an assortment of other weird snacks. ‘Amazing Pepsi flavored Cheetos… they’re yummy,’ tweeted one person, complete with a picture of her new favorite snack. 'I think I just threw up in my mouth,' tweeted another person. Despite early reports the snacks might make their way to the US, a Frito –Lay spokesperson immediately shot down the idea. ‘The answer is no,’ the spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times.

"NFL fans flocked to Regent Street in their thousands on the eve of the Wembley game between the Oakland Raiders and Miami Dolphins. A jersey from every franchise was on show along the half-mile stretch, as fans took part in a range of gridiron-themed events. And with members of both teams, Hall of Famers and the Raiderettes on show, there was something for everyone. Regent Street attracted NFL fans in their hundreds of thousands with a raft of activities and events for all ages .

Menelik Watson, Derek Carr and Khalil Mack snap pictures on their phones as the Oakland Raiders took to the stage to address The Raider Nation . The Raiderettes' performance unsurprisingly brought Regent Street to a standstill . The NFL stage took pride of place, with the likes of Rod Woodson, Bob Griese and Fred Biletnikoff on show, and also a very special guest in the shape of Dan Marino, who received the largest roar of the day. As many fans sported his legendary No 13 jersey, Marino harked back to playing in London in 1988 for a pre-season game with the 49ers. 'I played here in 1988, and it has grown and grown here since then. It is an incredible sight to see. It goes to show the level of support there is here, not only for the Dolphins and the Raiders, but for the whole NFL. We thank you for that.' Marino was snapped behind the scenes talking to current Miami quarterback, Ryan Tanehill, who has endured the toughest week of his three-year NFL career. After being undermined by head coach Joe Philbin following his display during the woeful 34-15 loss to the Chiefs, Tannehill has been named starter for Wembley.

'We are excited to go out and play in front of the fans here,' he said. 'This is our home game and we want it to be loud.' 600,000 fans flocked to the award-winning event last year and it looked as though that number may have been exceeded this time round.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this week, including a sense of deja vu at Stamford Bridge. Click here to follow @ralphellis56 . 1) Calum Chambers had never been booked in 25 senior appearances for Southampton before his £16million move to Arsenal this summer. Maybe he is trying too hard at his new club, because the yellow card the 19-year-old collected from referee Michael Oliver for fouling Aaron Lennon five minutes from the end of the north London derby was his FIFTH in 11 games this year. Not that Tottenham were angels. The 16 fouls that Mauricio Pochettino’s team committed was only one less than were made by both sides put together in the Merseyside derby. Calum Chambers (right) picked up his fifth booking since arriving at Arsenal for a foul on Aaron Lennon . 2) Ronald Koeman proved that having a go in the Capital One Cup needn’t harm your Premier League chances with the team that beat QPR 2-1 to keep Southampton in second place in the early table. In a week when most clubs changed their entire team in midweek, Koeman used nine of the players who had started in the win at Arsenal in his opening line-up. Ryan Bertrand, who got the opening goal against Rangers, had also been on the pitch at the Emirates, where he came on as a late sub. Ronald Koeman stuck with largely the same team that played in the Capital One Cup to win against QPR . 3) Chelsea’s blistering start to the season has seen the bookies install them as odds-on favourites to regain the Barclays Premier League title – and sparked discussion on whether Jose Mourinho’s side can stay top from start to finish as Arsenal did the last time they won the competition in 2004. A word of caution before the blue bunting is being set out and the open top bus booked for the King's Road, though. Only once since then have the side who topped the table at the end of September gone on to be crowned champions. Who did that? A certain Mr Mourinho with Chelsea in 2006. We shall see if he can do it again. Jose Mourinho could repeat the feat of winning the title after leading the league from end of September . 4) Keith Stroud was considered one of the country’s brightest refereeing prospects when he was promoted to the Premier League list back in 2007, but struggled to handle top flight games and got knocked back down to the Football League list after barely a year. The 45-year-old is back in the big time this season, though, and had his first Premier League game since 2008 when he took charge of Crystal Palace’s clash with Leicester. It was a good choice of game for him, coming through without any major controversy as Palace won 2-0. Referee Keith Stroud (third left) speaks to Kasper Schmeichel after his first game back in the Premier League . 5) There are signs that Louis van Gaal isn’t afraid to go down the Sir Alex Ferguson route of applying pressure on referees at Old Trafford. His Match of the Day moan to Gary Lineker about a mythical foul on David de Gea in the build-up to West Ham’s goal was rather peculiar. More worrying was the way United’s players chased referee Lee Mason trying to get Diafra Sakho in trouble for a foul on Rafael when the home team were already down to 10 men. Not as bad as the infamous time Roy Keane led a charge on Andy D’Urso, but not pretty either. Manchester United players argue that Diafra Sakho should have received a yellow card . 6) West Brom’s five midfield players – Graham Dorrans, James Morrison, Stephane Sessegnon, Craig Gardner and Chris Brunt - are all fairly similar in style and stature, and in theory the combination shouldn’t have enough balance to work. But they combined brilliantly against Burnley to keep the ball for long periods and help Alan Irvine’s side dominate the game. Collectively the five played 312 passes and found their own man with 283 of them – a success rate of nearly 91 per cent. Graham Dorrans (left) is one of five similar sized players striking the right balance at West Brom . 7) Albert Adomah suffered a miserable end to a bad week after missing the Anfield penalty that meant Liverpool survived that epic 14-13 shoot-out in the Capital One Cup. The former Bristol City striker was possibly still dwelling on the disappointment when he picked up two silly yellow cards and the inevitable red as Middlesbrough battled out a goalless draw at Charlton. It’s the first time the 26-year-old has ever been sent off in 311 senior games since he made his League debut for Barnet in January 2008. Albert Adomah (right) was sent off in the same week he missed a decisive penalty in the Capital One Cup . 8) Bryan Ruiz spent the last part of the summer trying to get away from Fulham as one of several experienced players who fell out with Felix Magath. For different reasons moves to PSV Eindhoven, Besiktas and Werder Bremen all fell through – which turns out to be good news for whoever gets the job to follow Magath as Craven Cottage boss. Caretaker Kit Symons has put the 29-year-old star of Costa Rica’s World Cup campaign straight back into his starting team, and Ruiz played a major role in the 2-1 win at Birmingham. Bryan Ruiz has his confidence back after being handed back his place by Kit Symons at Fulham . 9) Coventry are getting back to reality all too quickly, just three weeks after 27,306 packed the Ricoh Arena to the rafters to celebrate the club’s return to the city. Just 11,085 were at the next game to see them beat Yeovil, and that had fallen again to 10,006 for Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by Preston. Coventry concede a goal to Preston North End's Joe Garner in front of empty seats at the Ricoh Stadium . 10) Young Charlton striker Joe Pigott is using a loan spell at Newport to help get his head together after being involved in a car crash while on holiday in South Africa during the summer in which his close friend, goalkeeper George Howard, was critically injured. Howard, who played with 20-year-old Pigott at Gillingham, is recovering slowly from what were life threatening injuries and gets MailOnline’s best wishes. Pigott, meanwhile, has made a strong impression at the start of a three-month loan in South Wales and his two goals against AFC Wimbledon lifted Justin Edinburgh’s team to within two points of the play-off zone.

"Manchester United held on to record a 2-1 win over Everton in their Premier League clash at Old Trafford on Sunday. Angel di Maria gave the home side a half-time lead before Steven Naismith headed in a Leighton Baines cross early in the second half to bring Everton level. Radamel Falcao then scored the winner with his first goal for Manchester United, but Louis van Gaal's side needed a string of world-class saves from their goalkeeper David de Gea. Find out how the players rated at Old Trafford here. MANCHESTER UNITED . DAVID DE GEA - 8 . Guessed correctly to save Baines’ penalty, the first Premier League keeper to do so, and then made two outstanding late saves. David de Gea denies Everton an equaliser in the final minute, one of his many important saves on the day . RAFAEL - 7 . Made several vital interceptions and clearances, and also got forward well for the first goal. PADDY McNAIR - 6.5 . Couldn’t have had a tougher physical test than facing Romelu Lukaku but contained the Belgian’s threat in the main. MARCOS ROJO - 6 . Still feeling his way into the Premier League and looks a little uncomfortable, particularly on his right foot. LUKE SHAW - 5.5 . Had better days. Guilty of fouling Tony Hibbert for the penalty and then lost Steven Naismith for Everton’s goal. Went off injured. Luke Shaw brought down Tony Hibbert in the penalty area to concede a first-half penalty . ANTONIO VALENCIA - 5 . Did little to show that he can make the transition from traditional winger to playing on the right side of United’s midfield diamond. JUAN MATA - 5.5 . Back in the line-up for the suspended Wayne Rooney but will be disappointed he didn’t make more of his opportunity. Juan Mata was largely disappointing in an advanced midfield role for Manchester United . DALEY BLIND - 7 . Another assured and tenacious display as United’s midfield anchor. Booked for second of two poor challenges on Naismith. ANGEL DI MARIA - 7.5 . Fantastic finish for United’s first goal, had a hand in the second and shone throughout with some exquisite touches. Angel di Maria gave Manchester United the lead midway through the first half at Old Trafford . RADAMEL FALCAO - 6 . Will be mightily relieved that he has his first goal for United because he wasted enough chances before that. ROBIN VAN PERSIE - 5.5 . Still looks some way short of his best and has yet to strike up a proper partnership with Falcao. Radamel Falcao restored Manchester United's lead with his first goal for the club . Subs: Januzaj, Lindegaard, Fletcher, Fellaini (for Valencia 79, 5.5), Thorpe, Blackett (for Shaw 71, 7), Wilson (for Falcao 73, 6). Scorers: Di Maria 27, Falcao 62. Booked: Van Persie, Blind, Valencia, Wilson. EVERTON . TIM HOWARD - 6 . Former United keeper couldn’t be faulted for either goal and made a fine save to deny Di Maria a second. TONY HIBBERT - 6.5 . Had his hands full with Di Maria but got forward well to win the penalty in first-half injury-time. JOHN STONES - 7 . Another accomplished performance from the young England centre-back and his late injury will be a concern for Roy Hodgson. John Stones looked assured and comfortable once again in Everton's central defence . PHIL JAGIELKA - 6 . Unlucky that his fine clearance led to the first goal but lost track of Falcao for the second. LEIGHTON BAINES - 6.5 . Bound to be disappointed that he missed his first penalty in 15 attempts but wonderful cross for the goal. Leighton Baines saw his first-half penalty saved by Manchester United goalkeeper De Gea . MUHAMED BESIC - 6 . Did what he could to hold United’s forward at bay and booked for cynical foul on Falcao. GARETH BARRY - 6 . Had a hand in the goal but missed out on a great chance to snatch an equaliser at the death. AIDEN McGEADY - 5.5 . Struggled to make an impression down the Everton right. Replaced towards the end. STEVEN NAISMITH - 7 . Took his goal brilliantly and a constant handful for United arriving late on crosses. Steven Naismith (right) headed in Everton's equaliser from a Leighton Baines cross early in the second half . STEVEN PIENAAR - 6 . Neat backheel that led to the penalty but went off injured having been booked for tripping Rafael. ROMELU LUKAKU - 6 . Difficult task on his own up front. Created one chance with great takedown but blazed over. Subs: Robles, Gibson, Eto’o, Oviedo (for Pienaar 63, 6), Osman (for McGeady 77, 6), Browning (for Hibbert 78, 6), Alcaraz . Scorer: Naismith 55. Booked: Besic, Pienaar, Howard. Star man: David de Gea . Referee: Kevin Friend - 6.5 . Louis van Gaal – 7 . Roberto Martinez – 6.5 .","David de Gea saves a penalty from Leighton Baines and denies Everton with two more stops right at the death at Old Trafford .

"A Norwegian teenager who had a McDonald’s receipt tattooed onto his arm has done it again - and this time he has had the bill for his first inking permanently etched on to his other forearm. Stian Ytterdahl, 18, from Lørenskog, southwest Norway, got the first tattoo 'as a punishment' after his friends told him that he had been 'too active on the ladies front'. Despite news of his first piece of 'body art' reportedly 'giving his mother a breakdown' the student has done it again, and had the receipt for his tattoo etched on to his other forearm. A Norwegian teenager who had a McDonald's receipt tattooed onto his arm has done it again - and this time he has had the bill for his first inking permanently etched on his forearm . 'Punishment': Stian Ytterdahl, 18, had been a little too successful with the ladies for his friends' liking and was ordered to tattoo the receipt from his trip to McDonald's . Mr Ytterdahl revealed the new body art on Wednesday morning on his Facebook page under the post 'new tat!'. It . appears he decided to plump for the second unusual inking, after . Sabelink Tattoo offered to inscribe the receipt for the tattoo on to his other arm for free. After his first tattoo, the teenager said: ‘Some of my mates thought I had been a bit too active on the ladies front recently and wanted to punish me. 'When we were in the restaurant on Monday, they said I had to tattoo a Barbie doll on my bum, or the receipt on my arm,’ Mr Ytterdahl told Romerikes Blad. The student’s first tattoo covers most of his lower right arm. ‘I got an email from my dad that wasn’t entirely positive, saying “What on earth have you done?! Do you think you are coming home with that!? Your mother has had a break down”,’ Mr Ytterdahl told Expressen. Eternal memory: The teenager's tattoo shows time and date of his visit on Monday night, as well as the franchise's address and phone number . McFan: Although his friends have applauded his new tattoo, his parents are less than pleased and his mother 'broke down' when she saw the tattoo in the local newspaper . Burger or Barbie: The receipt for three cheeseburgers, a happy meal, a coke and a McFlurry was the lesser of two evils, Mr Ytterdahl says, as the alternative was tattooing a Barbie doll on his bum . The artist at Sabelink Tattoo raised an eyebrow, but carried out the task, posting the result on Facebook captioned ‘my strangest tattoo so far’. ‘It’s funny to think that I have a tattoo which no one else even has the likes of. Even the date and time is on it,’ he says. The VG newspaper filmed the 18-year-old receiving his newest artwork at the Sabel Ink studio in Lillestrøm on Tuesday. Hooked: The 18-year-old from Lorenskog says this first tattoo will not be his last, after the studio that did it offered to ink their own receipt on to his left arm for no extra cost . Mr Ytterdahl's dinner on Monday night, now forever etched onto his skin: . 1 x 0.5litre Coke3 x Cheeseburgers1 x Cheeseburger Happy Meal1 x McFlurry NonStop, with three extra toppings1 x Extra Happy Meal toy . Mr Ytterdahl said: ‘I might not find it as funny when I am 50 or 60 years old, but it’s my choice.’ McDonald’s Norway has denied that it is a PR stunt, saying they have never heard anything like it before. ‘This is clearly a loyal customer,’ McDonald’s Norway told Romerikes Blad. Mr Ytterdahl says he has no problem being seen as a walking advertising board. 'I might even get a job at McDonald's now,' he joked.","Stian Ytterdahl tattooed the receipt from his McDonald's visit .

"After what happened at Medinah last time, perhaps it wasn’t surprising that Rory McIlroy was among the first batch of players to show up at Gleneagles on Sunday for the Ryder Cup. Two years ago, it was only because a Chicago policeman went beyond the call of duty that he made it to the first tee at all. The story of Rory mixing up his time zones and arriving on the premises in a blaze of police sirens before walking out to play Keegan Bradley in a vital singles match without so much as barely a practice swing has, of course, become part of Ryder Cup lore. Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy cannot wait to participate at this year's Ryder Cup . McIlroy of Europe practices on the range ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles Hotel on Sunday . What does he think, looking back? Does he still break out in a cold sweat? ‘I think I would have relived it a lot more if I hadn’t gone on to win my match,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘Can you imagine how bad I would have felt if I’d had to forfeit my game? Honestly, even now I don’t want to think about it. ‘It’s one of those scenarios where you’re just thankful everything worked out the way it did. I still would have felt really bad if I’d made the tee-time and lost. I was one of the guys at the front, with the team relying on me to get a point and establish some momentum. ‘What’s funny is that it was the best I played all week. I kept telling myself, ‘‘Stay in the match while I get warmed up and calm down’’, and yet after six holes I was two up.’ Given the horrific build-up, how proud was he of the round he played?

Thursday . 6.30am: Gates open for practice rounds . 2.30pm: Opening ceremony . Friday . 7.35am: 4 x Fourballs matches . 1.15pm: 4 x Foursomes matches .

Sunday . 11.36am: 12 x Singles matches (at 12-minute intervals) ‘Oh, not that proud,’ he said. ‘I guess I’m proud of the way I regrouped and stayed composed, but there’s not much else to be proud about. There are quite a few rounds I’ll recall with a lot more pride than that one.’ And the sheriff — has he kept in touch with him? ‘No, we’ve had no contact since. But I’ll certainly be for ever grateful for what he did for me that day.’ Five years ago, McIlroy’s ambivalence towards the Ryder Cup was documented in one of those fateful expressions that follow a player around. An ‘exhibition’ he called it, with the innocence of a man who had grown up thinking only about majors as the hallmark of a player’s greatness. When did he change his mind? ‘Oh, when I arrived at Celtic Manor for my first one in 2010 and walked into the team room,’ he said, smiling. ‘Then there was the first tee on the first morning with the songs and the atmosphere. ‘I couldn’t understand why people made such a big deal of it, or got so excited. I mean, we’re individuals, not team players, and we play for ourselves for the most part. But once you’ve been part of it, you know it’s the ultimate buzz. ‘I’ve been lucky enough to finish on the winning side in two really close ones now and it is fantastic to celebrate as a team on that Sunday night.’ McIlroy was right there when everything changed at Medinah, partnering Ian Poulter in that unforgettable fourballs match on Saturday where they birdied the last six holes between them to narrow the deficit to four points (10-6) heading into the singles. ‘I think that’s the only time on a golf course where I’ve watched someone and been in awe,’ said McIlroy. ‘Up until those last six holes we had been flat but we kept encouraging each other. Make a putt somewhere, just quieten the crowd. I guess when I birdied the 13th it was the spark — and then I stepped aside and he did his thing with his five birdies. ‘I remember the putts going in clearly at 15 and 16 but the one at 18 . . . I thought he’d pushed it, to be honest. Then it curls back into the hole and he gives it those eyes. I was thinking, “This guy is unbelievable”.’ McIlroy was pictured with Arsenal footballer Mesut Ozil on Saturday night as the pair watched George Groves' fight against Christopher Rebrasse at Wembley Arena . Just as he did back then, McIlroy goes into this Ryder Cup as the best player in the world. This time, though, the stakes are higher. He’s on home soil with everyone of European hue counting on him to build on his wondrous summer filled with majors and other successes, and lead from the front. Happily, the man himself is excited at the prospect. ‘I’m ready to be the talisman and drive this team forward,’ he said. ‘I realise I have that responsibility and I am comfortable with it. In my first two I felt out of place offering an opinion, but I appreciate I have a place in the game now that warrants that. I know I can lead this team.’ In his two Ryder Cup appearances to date, McIlroy has played nine matches, with four wins, three losses and two halves. Not bad, by any means, but he agrees we haven’t seen the best of him. ‘The best I’ve played was when I turned up 11 minutes before my tee-time,’ he joked. ‘No, I feel like I’ve done OK over the two matches. I got three points out of five at Medinah, so I contributed well enough. But it’s fair to say I haven’t been firing on all cylinders at a Ryder Cup. ‘The first one, I was trying not to make mistakes and let the team down, which really isn’t the way I play. Now I know what to expect and hopefully I can kick it back into top gear this week.’ There’s also one additional incentive for replicating his major-winning form. McIlroy is happy to be playing under European captain Paul McGinley after giving the Irishman his backing . Eighteen months ago, McIlroy went into bat for Paul McGinley to get the captain’s job over Rory’s fellow Northern Irishman, Darren Clarke. In so doing, he swayed opinion decisively. Now he is determined that McGinley will see out his illustrious Ryder Cup career — three wins from three appearances as a player, two wins from two stints as vice-captain — in fitting fashion. ‘I’d played under Paul at the Seve Trophy, and knew he’d make a great Ryder Cup captain,’ said McIlroy. ‘He holed the winning putt in 2002, so he knows how that feels. That’s why I was so supportive. ‘I’m going to be trying particularly hard for the team, but also for Paul because I’m a huge fan of him both as a golfer and a man. ‘Nowadays the captain only gets one chance at this, and it wouldn’t be right if he didn’t end up as a winning captain. The Ryder Cup has meant so much to him, so it would be a bitter-sweet ending if it wasn’t to work out for us.’ When it’s over, McIlroy will stay in Scotland to play in the Dunhill Links Championship with his father Gerry, who will celebrate his 55th birthday during the tournament. Manchester United fan McIlroy, pictured posing with the Claret Jug, cannot wait to return to Old Trafford over the Christmas period . Thereafter, he is off to China and the Middle East to complete the formalities of finishing the season as Europe’s No 1, before wrapping up at the end of November with the defence of the Australian Open title he won so memorably against Adam Scott. ‘It’s the simple things I’m looking forward to after that,’ said the 25-year-old, who has just bought a house back in his hometown of Holywood, near Belfast. ‘Watching a few Ulster rugby games and going to Old Trafford. Having about 10 turkey dinners before Christmas.’ Eleven minutes away from being a prize turkey himself at Medinah, he is emphatic there will be no such drama at Gleneagles. ‘We’re staying in the hotel on site, so I could fall out of bed and still make it to the first tee on time,’ he said, laughing. As the summer of his life fades into blissful memory, McIlroy is primed and ready for an autumn awakening.","The Northern Irishman is hoping to win his third Ryder Cup .

"A wonderful opportunity is opening up for Danny Welbeck over the next few weeks. At last, he can play where he has always wanted. It’s very unfortunate that Olivier Giroud is injured for Arsenal and Daniel Sturridge is out for England. For Welbeck, though, these circumstances have presented him with the chance to establish his credentials. For both club and country, it is all finally coming together for the 23-year-old striker. VIDEO Scroll down to find out who is playing a big role in settling Welbeck in at Arsenal . Danny Welbeck celebrates after scoring his hat trick against Galatasaray on Wednesday night . English trio Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere walk together in training . Welbeck slots home against Galatasaray as Arsenal returned to winning ways in Europe . Welbeck became the third Arsenal player to score a hat-trick in Europe last week . And now he really is a striker: a centre forward, not a wide player and his hat-trick against Galatasaray showed that he is absolutely making the most of the chance given to him. He also did well down the centre for England against Switzerland last month by scoring twice and now he has two games coming up against San Marino and Estonia, when you would expect him to score more goals. By the time he comes back from international duty, his confidence should be sky-high. There is a parallel to be drawn between Welbeck’s development and Sturridge, who also always craved the central position but was confined to wide roles at Manchester City and Chelsea. Only when Brendan Rodgers gave him his head in the centre at Liverpool did we really see how good he is. Roy Hodgson must be as delighted as Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. Now the England manager has a growing number of attacking options. When Sturridge is back, maybe he will consider pairing him with Welbeck and playing Wayne Rooney behind them, as Rooney has been doing for Manchester United. With Raheem Sterling as well, England look strong going forward. Welbeck celebrates with Rickie Lambert after scoring twice for England against Switzerland . He could use it as an opportunity to usurp Daniel Sturridge for his country . It is probably right that Sturridge is not part of this international squad. If he wasn’t fit enough to be on the bench for Liverpool on Saturday, then he probably is not fit to play a significant part against San Marino and Estonia. Had he been on the bench in the 2-1 win over West Brom, I would have probably taken a different view. When it’s international week, the clubs have to abide by that. But communication between the FA and clubs over injured players is much better than when I was England manager and brought in Gary Lewin, who is now a full-time physio with the national team. I understand medical staff went to Liverpool to discuss Sturridge’s fitness and he is a week or so away from returning. Welbeck’s performance on Wednesday was very different from the past. Then, when he had time to linger on a chance, he seemed to struggle. An example that stands out was at Old Trafford against Bayern Munich last season when he tried to lift the ball over keeper Manuel Neuer at 0-0. It was a wonderful chance to take control of the tie and yet Neuer simply plucked the ball from the air. Even last month against Manchester City, he hit a good early chance wide. But on Wednesday, he was clinical even when he had time to think. Part of that is clearly his confidence. He has a manager who believes in him and he is responding. But it’s also because he’s playing in better areas that are suited to his game. I love the way he runs off the back of defenders and stretches teams with his pace. He couldn’t do that on the flanks. Wide players do so much work they are almost like full-backs and because he is so hard-working and disciplined, he covered miles in that shift. Arsenal's other senior striker Olivier Giroud remains absent for the foreseeable future . Welbeck was criticised at Manchester United for not being clinical enough in front of goal at times . The downside of such honesty is that he is not in the areas where he is most dangerous. Now he’s making darting runs in areas of the pitch that hurt the opposition. But I also think that he is the right player in the right team, by which I mean he suits Arsenal’s style. They will create chances through the middle, they don’t go down the wings that often and send in crosses. Though I like Giroud, he thrives more off crosses, while Welbeck seems more suited to their natural game. He appears to be a missing link for them and gives them another dimension. Now, if you’re playing Arsenal and you want to squeeze up the pitch, maybe to protect a lead, you certainly have to be careful because he can get in behind you with his pace. Of course, Sunday’s match comes a real test against what looks to be the best defence in the Premier League. Chelsea have the meanest and most solid back four. But if Welbeck can stretch Gary Cahill and John Terry and find some weaknesses, then he really will go into international week feeling he really is in the best form of his life. Arsene Wenger was a hugely important manager in my career at Monaco but there is one thing that has puzzled me about his Arsenal teams in recent years. At Monaco he was very clear about how we would play. We had two strong midfielders in Marcel Dib and Jean Philippe Rohr: solid players who were fierce in the tackle. They were good players but they also made sure our back four were protected. When he went to Arsenal, he did exactly the same with Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, and then Gilberto Silva. Arsene Wenger watches on during an Arsenal training session on Saturday . Wenger used to prefer players in the mould of former stars Patrick Vieira (left) and Emmanuel Petit . Which is why I’m scratching my head a little when I see the players Arsene selects in midfield these days. Last March, in that infamous 6-0 loss to Chelsea, he played Mikel Arteta, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. They’re all fine players but none of them is quite like those midfielders he used to favour. When I played, the full-backs didn’t bomb on as much as they do now, so now there is even more reason to have a shield in front of your back four. There are different kinds of holding midfielders, those who can play the ball out and those who will scrap for you. Mikel Arteta is more of the former, and Mathieu Flamini more of the latter. Maybe when Wenger brought Flamini back to the club last season, there was recognition that they he had got the balance wrong. Flamini will play today because Arteta is injured, and it will be fascinating to see whether he can make a difference to Arsenal’s vulnerability against Chelsea. Cesc Fabregas will be the centre of attention on Sunday against his former club. He has been outstanding since he came back but there is another player who has been just as good and is not as lauded. That’s Nemanja Matic. He brings balance and solidity to Chelsea and their improvement is as much to do with his arrival in January as the more celebrated signings, such as Fabregas and Diego Costa. Cesc Fabregas will be the centre of attention when Chelsea face Arsenal . Nemanja Matic (centre) in action for Chelsea against Sporting Lisb on plaers Cedric (left) and Joao Mario . When you talk about a midfielder in the mould of Vieira and Petit, then Matic is your man. He has that same rangy ability to tackle, the height to give you some presence and an ability to pass well. Perhaps Arsene Wenger will feel a little wistful watching him at Stamford Bridge.","Welbeck has a wonderful opportunity opening up over the next few weeks .

"When the two top teams in Serie A met on Sunday night, it was always going to be a feisty encounter. That it was settled by a piece of brilliance, rather than a refereeing howler, was reassuring, but not entirely fitting. Not only do these two teams not like each other, but there was also a huge amount at stake - neither side had dropped a point yet in the league this season. But few could have predicted just how much controversy would be crammed into  this clash, during which referee Gianluca Rocchi awarded three penalties in the first half and showed two red cards in the closing stages, nor the source of the stunning winner. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Juventus 3-2 Roma: Pictorial highlights . Roma's Konstantinos Manolas is shown a red card by referee Gianluca Rocchi in the closing stages .

Juventus players jump up and celebrate a narrow 3-2 win over Roma in Serie A on Sunday night . Bonucci unleashes his late volley from just outside the box to win the game for Juventus . Carlos Tevez scores his first of two penalties to put Juventus into the lead after a controversial decision . Roma coach Rudi Garcia was sent to the stands by the referee for his reaction to the first penalty . With just four minutes remaining, centre half Leonardo Bonucci unleashed an unstoppable volley from the edge of the box to win the game, connecting beautifully with a cleared corner. It was a goal worthy of winning any game, but this match will be remembered for so much more. The controversy began with a Juventus freekick in the 26th minute. Pirlo struck it, and it struck defender Maicon on the arm, seemingly just outside the box. Rocchi awarded a freekick, but, once the Juventus players had pointed to his magic spray line, clearly inside the area, changed his mind. Carlos Tevez dispatched the penalty, Rudi Garcia was sent to the stands for his reaction, apparently immitating playing a violin. The referee brandishes a yellow card as Roma are awarded a penalty for a clear foul by Lichsteiner . Juventus had still not conceded in their five league games this season, and would have been confident that Tevez's penalty was a significant advantage. But Roma are a different prospect, and this game had much more drama to come. Just five minutes after going ahead, Juventus shot themselves in the foot, Swiss defender Stephan Lichsteiner inexplicably wrestling Francesco Totti to the floor inside the box. If Rocchi was looking for an opportunity to level things up, he could not have asked for a more blatant one. Totti, like Tevez, made no mistake from twelve yards. Francesco Totti, who had been wrestled to the ground, picked himself up to level the scores from the spot . Juan Iturbe celebrates his goal which put Roma in the lead shortly before half time, after Gervinho's pass . Now it was Roma who had a spring their step, and a minute before half time they were ahead. Gervinho, the danger-man so often since his move from Arsenal, drove at the defence before slipping in Juan Iturbe, who finished nicely. The home support were getting restless - they are not used to being behind - but Mr Rocchi was on hand to level things up again just a minute later. Paul Pogba cut in from the left hand side, and as he passed Seydou Keita, the French midfielder went to ground. Contact, if there was any, was minimal. Where it occured, if anywhere, was the subject of much debate, but Rocchi decided it was just inside, rather than just outside, the box. Cue Tevez again. Same corner. Same result. Two goals each at half time. Iturbe's goal was the stand-out moment of quality in a first half packed with controversy . The Roma players can't believe it as Rocchi awards Juventus a second controversial penalty before half-time . Carlos Tevez made no mistake, converting for the second time into the same corner to make it 2-2 . In truth, the second half looked like it might not be living up to the drama of the first. Both sides pushed for the win, but neither looked particularly likely to get it before Bonucci stepped up. However, it was only right, in a game like this, that the last word should go to the referee. Kostas Manolas, superb until this moment of madness, squared up to Alvaro Morata. The two clashed heads, but, in truth, neither needed more than a yellow card for what was more handbags than a true fight. Rocchi decided otherwise though. Both players were dismissed.

"Stoke striker Peter Crouch is perhaps most famous for his robot dance in 2006, but Monday night saw him coin a new trademark celebration - the birdie. Eight years on from his memorable dance after scoring for England against Jamaica, Crouch beat Newcastle's Fabricio Coloccini in the air to head home for Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, and what followed next certainly caught the eye of many. The 33-year-old striker, who is married to Abbey Clancy, wheeled away from goal after putting the home side 1-0 up, and pulled out a new celebration to rival the robot. Peter Crouch's new celebration, caught by Sky Sports cameras, is one to rival the robot . The celebration was well-received by Stoke supporters celebrating the goal . Crouch rises above Fabricio Coloccini to open the scoring on Monday night at the Britannia Stadium . Lifting both arms in the air, Crouch mimicked a bird, much to the delight of his team-mates, and a large television and Twitter audience. When questioned after the match about the celebration, Crouch responded: 'My mate is a Geordie and that's one of his moves. He said I was allowed to do it if I scored, so that one was for him.' Crouch has made 459 professional appearances in a career spanning 14 years, but it is fair to say that he may be remembered more fondly for his celebrations than his goals. He joined Stoke in 2011 for £10 million, and his opener on Monday night was his third goal of the 14/15 season.

"Eric Cantona's latest role sees the former Manchester United forward play a character called The Stallion in a film based around an orgy. The 48-year-old, whipped in one scene by a dominatrix played by actress Beatrice Dalle, returns to the big screen in You And The Night, a French film loaded with sexual content. Cantona, who took to acting 17 years ago after a career in football, sees no risk in his latest movie, though, and the former France international says he relishes playing 'very, very bad' characters.

Former Manchester United forward  Cantona, or The Stallion in You And The Night, gets blindfolded in the film . The Liverpool striker has admitted he may become an actor after football, too! 'I loved drama class at school,' says Sturridge. 'I never took it seriously as I was playing football. But maybe when I retire, I'll have a dabble.' 'I don't see risks. It's a risk for why? I don't do cinema to play Nero every time... I like acting,' Cantona told Metro. 'I like cinema because we can play any kind of character. I don't want to play only the good ones. I like to play the bad ones sometimes. Very, very bad ones! 'For this one, yes, it's very special but it's so wonderful, so it's not risky for me. It's a great opportunity for me.' The trailer for You And The Night ends with Cantona, once nicknamed 'King Eric' at Old Trafford but 'The Stud' on the film's poster, undoing his belt as the ex-footballer says in French: 'Be warned, it's in sleep mode.' Cantona played for Manchester United between 1992 and 1997 but became an actor at the age of 30 . Cantona infamously lunges at a Crystal Palace fan during Manchester United's Premier League match in 1995 .

It took off from there for the forward, whose latest role can be considered as controversial as his time on the pitch, where he once kung-fu kicked Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons in the crowd for berating him during a game. Perhaps Cantona's most famous quip arrived during a press conference after winning an appeal against a two-week prison sentence for sinking his studs into that very football supporter in 1995. 'When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea,' he said, as poetic as it was infamous. Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge is the latest to admit he fancies taking to acting  once his football career comes to an end, but Cantona insists it's a difficult skill to master. 'It takes a few times for people to accept that somebody who has come from one world can do something else,' admits Cantona.

Gary Neville and his brother Phil are prime examples of former United footballers that  traditionally joined the punditry team. Cantona, though, in his 60 seconds interview with Metro,  believes cracking Hollywood is more difficult than analysing football in a studio. 'It's easier to see a former footballer commentating, speaking about football,' he says. 'Everybody accepts it. But if you go in the opposite way...'

"They may look like adorable baby hedgehogs but these rare spiky puggles are the first echidnas to ever be bred from zoo-born parents. Two short-beaked baby echidnas - called puggles - Babbin and Nyingarn were born at Perth Zoo this August. Their parents Mila and Chinda are the first ever zoo-born echidnas in the world to breed. They also bred at four years of age despite experts previously believing they couldn't start breeding until they were five-years-old. Now watch the video . New addition: Babbin was born at Perth Zoo in August and is housed off display in the zoo's echidna breeding area . Record breaker: Short-beaked echidna Babbin is one of two echidna puggles to be the first bred by zoo-born parents . Australian environment minister Bill Marmion said the puggles represented the first successful breeding from zoo-born echidnas and had rewritten the previously accepted facts on the reproduction age of echidnas. He continued: 'The puggles were born to four-year-old first-time mothers Mila and Chindi both bred and born at Perth Zoo as part of its breeding program for Short-beaked Echidna. 'Until now, it was believed female echidnas did not breed until the age of five so these latest births have shed new light on echidna reproduction. World's first: Babbin, pictured, and Nyingarn were bred by first-time mothers zoo-born echidnas Mila and Chindi . Paws for thought: Zoologists hope information from Perth Zoo's breeding programme may help the short-beaked echidna's critically endangered cousin, the long-beaked schidna . 'This and other data gathered at Perth . Zoo through video surveillance cameras, research and detailed record . keeping is uncovering the secrets of echidna behaviour and reproduction. 'This in turn may help conserve the short-beaked echidna’s endangered cousin, the long-beaked echidna, which is facing extinction in the wild in New Guinea. 'Only 24 echidnas have been bred in captivity in Australia and Perth Zoo is proud to have produced eight of these.' Perth’s new additions are being housed off-display in the zoo’s echidna breeding area with their parents. Sizing him up: Puggle Babbin pictured next to a fully grown echidna at Perth Zoo . Lightweight: Five-month-old Babbin weighs just 390g - a little over half a stone . A prickly customer: Babbin's spines are currently small and harmless but they will get longer ans sharper as he grows . Just hanging out: Echidnas use their  long, sticky tongues to collect prey such as ants . Echidnas are small, solitary mammals covered with coarse hair and spines - closely resembling hedgehogs and porcupines. Belinda Turner, supervisor at Perth Zoo's Australian section, added: 'We are gathering a lot of information to help uncover more secrets of echidna breeding and reproduction.

"A judge is siding with a Chicago woman seeking to use frozen embryos to have a child over the objection of her former boyfriend. Karla Dunston was diagnosed with lymphoma four years ago. Knowing chemotherapy would make her infertile, she had embryos frozen before treatment. Her then-boyfriend, Jacob Szafranski, provided the sperm. They broke up a year later and Szafranski changed his mind, leading to a lengthy court battle. In court: Karla Dunston and Jacob Szafranski created frozen embryos with their egg and sperm after she was diagnosed with cancer. But they later broke up and he said he no longer wants her to use the embryos . A Cook County judge on Friday awarded custody of the embryos to Dunston. The . judge said Dunston's ""desire to have a biological child in the face of . the impossibility of having one without using the embryos outweighs"" Szafranski's privacy concerns. Szafranski says he will appeal. Dunston, . 42, maintains that she has the right to have her biological children . and should control the future of the embryos, while her ex-boyfriend . Jacob Szafranski, 32, argues that he never agreed to give up his say in . the matter. Dunston has since gone on to carry and give birth to a son - using a donor egg and donor sperm, Szafranski's . attorney confirmed. But he added that would not affect the outcome of . the case as the court distinguishes between a child that is biological . and 'essentially adopted'. The couple, who met through their work in a Chicago hospital, had been dating for just five months when Dunston received her diagnosis. After Szafranski agreed to provide his semen, he gave a sample at Northwestern Hospital's fertility clinic, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'It was a very emotional time and I was just trying to support Karla the best way I could,' the firefighter and former nurse told the newspaper. Dunston, in a court deposition, added: 'I thought about my different options, . of using a sperm donor or someone that I knew for many years and that . was a wonderful person. 'So I decided to go with someone that I thought . was a wonderful person and I trusted.' New life: She had a child through donors two years after they broke up but she is still fighting to use the embryos for another child. Lawyers said her baby would not affect the outcome of the case . Szafranski v. Dunston will set a new precedent in the state of Illinois, where lawmakers have never ruled in a similar case. But what decisions have been reached in other states, and what clues do they give to the outcome of the case? In Pennsylvania last year, an appeals court gave frozen embryos to a woman who wanted to give birth even though her ex-husband wanted to embryos destroyed. As in this Illinois case, the ex-wife was believed to be infertile following treatment for cancer. The court ruled that her wish to be a mother outweighed the man's desire not to parent children. But in Tennessee, a court has previously decided that parenthood could not be forced on someone who was not willing. The Supreme Court in 1992 ruled that fatherhood was going to be a greater burden for an ex-husband than destroying the embryos would be for his ex-wife, and she was not granted the embryos. Also similar to this case, a couple in New York who froze embryos signed an agreement saying they could only be used with consent from both parties. But the wife, who later became infertile, later requested sole custody of the embryos - which the husband opposed. The Court of Appeals ruled that the contract should stand and the embryos were donated to research. At the time, the couple also signed a document that stated 'no use can be made of these embryos without the consent of . both partners'. They met up with an attorney and a second agreement that gave Dunston sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. Two months after the hospital visit, Szafranski broke up with Dunston via text message. He said he had initially been honored to help out his girlfriend, but later had reservations. 'I have the right not to be a . father,' he said. 'It's something I take very seriously and feel very . strongly about.' But he later changed his mind and said that he would give Dunston control of the embryos if the child could never be traced back to him - but when he asked the hospital to destroy his records, they refused. He eventually concluded that the child would be traced back to him and that he did not want children at all, at any point. In June 2010, he wrote in an email that . he worried he would find someone he was ready to have a family with - . but that they would reject him based on the fact he had a child he did . not know with a women he did not love. But as had been predicted, Dunston was left infertile by her successful cancer treatment. Experts said that this infertility did not mean she was unable to carry the embryos and have a child. She wrote her ex-boyfriend an email in September 2010, reading: 'I had a chance to use a random . sperm donor and you took that away from me by agreeing to help. 'I . trusted you and now you are trying to take away my chance of having a . biological child... Those embryos mean everything to me, and I will . fight this to the bitter end.' Her right? Dunston said he agreed to have her children when he gave her his sperm for the embryo and cannot take away her right to have children. He argues he should not be forced to have them . After the fallout, a Cook County trial court awarded . Dunston rights to the embryos, but Szafranski appealed and a higher . court sent the case back, explaining that the case focuses on prior . agreements rather than the interests of either party. The battle now concerns whether the pact occurred when Szafranski gave the sample or when they signed the medical consent form requiring joint consent for the use of the embryos. His attorney, Brian Schroeder, argued that couples often change their minds about having children and the courts should not be involved. But Dunston's lawyer, Abram Moore, countered: 'At this point, that sperm no longer . exists. It has fertilized an egg and become something entirely . different: a pre-embryo. It is now too late for him to . back out of his promises.' Battle: The couple is now waiting for the Illinois Supreme Court to decide if they will hear the case . The case centers around a very modern problem - and an example of technology causing problems that far exceed the scope of the law. The need for a definitive ruling is needed now more than ever. In 1985, 260 babies were born through assisted reproductive technology; in 2010, the number topped 61,000, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 'This is a decision that really affects every person,' he told MailOnline. 'Hundreds of thousands of embryos are frozen in Illinois and this case affects what you do with these. 'It raises some very fundamental issues about creating human life and when your consent is required and it affects all of those cases in the future.'","Karla Dunston was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in March 2010 and asked then-boyfriend to give his sperm for frozen embryos .

"Shrien Dewani surfed a gay dating website two days after his wife's murder - as her grieving father arrived to collect her body, his trial heard today. The millionaire is accused of arranging to have his wife Anni killed in a staged carjacking as they travelled through a notorious South African township on their honeymoon. The court heard he had surfed gay dating website Gaydar  as Mrs Dewani's grieving father, Vinod Hindocha, waited at the Cape Grace Hotel to collect his daughter's body two days after it was found. He was signed into the website for nearly an hour and left his computer on and still connected when he joined Mr Hindocha in the hotel lounge. The court also heard that Dewani had declared himself gay, rather than bisexual, on the site. Dewani has admitted having sex with male prostitutes and men he has met online and in clubs, although he previously told the trial that he is also attracted to women and loved his wife. But Simon Johnson, a former digital product manager for Gaydar, said Dewani listed himself as 'gay' in a check box on his profile. Scroll down for video . Accused: Shrien Dewani, is accused of arranging to have new wife Anni killed in a staged carjacking as they travelled through a notorious South African township . The court heard that the bullet that killed his new bride did not indicate it was an 'execution' Dewani held a £60 a year account with Gaydar for six years before his marriage after joining in August 2004. Dewani used the name Asiansubguy when logging into the site. Sub refers to submissive. He also listed himself as 'passive, sub guy' on Gaydar and said he was looking for 'single gay man, gay couple, bi-couple, group'. The account was deactivated a week after Mrs Dewani's murder. Mr Johnson described Gaydar as a homosexual dating site which could also have a 'sexually charged environment.' There are fetish and specific sexual activity chat rooms for some members, he told the court. Prosecutor Adrian Mopp said there were 59 saved private messages on the profile in total, of which 16 were sent or received between May 2009 and October 2010. Anni Dewani's mother and sister, Nilam Hindocha and Ami Denborg leave the Western Cape High Court . Anni Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha arrives at Western Cape High Court earlier in the day . He also went through a table of log-ins and log-offs for the profile in question, confirming Dewani had visited the site on November 12, November 15 and November 16 in 2010. In his formal admissions, Dewani admitted his computer was logged onto Gaydar in the early hours of the morning on November 15 2010. His wife's body was found in their hijacked shuttle taxi early on November 14 2010. He also conceded his computer was logged onto the site on November 15 and November 16, and while waiting with Anni for their flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town on November 12 2010. Mr Johnson explained that the site allowed people to add users as friends or favourites to share messages and photos with. Mr Mopp said there were a number of photos uploaded onto Dewani's profile. Mr Johnson said that there were also a variety of chat rooms that 'were particularly sexually charged' but that these visits were not recorded by the website. Mr Johnson was first approached by United Kingdom detectives in January 2011 to assist them with Dewani's profile and he intermittently provided them with information. Tragic: Mrs Dewani, 28, died from single shot that went through her neck and severed her spine. She also had bruises on her leg suggesting a struggle . Dewani joined the Gaydar website in August 2004 and the last activity on his profile was on November 21 2010. 'On that day, the profile was removed by the customer,' Mr Johnson said. He said although the profile was removed from the site, it was still accessible to staff using a special application. Earlier, the court was told that Mrs Dewani was accidentally shot by a robber as he tried to drag her from a taxi to rape her, a court heard today. The court heard that the bullet that killed his new bride did not indicate it was an 'execution'. Mrs Dewani, 28, died from single shot that went through her neck and severed her spine. She also had bruises on her leg suggesting a struggle. Self-confessed hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, who is giving evidence for the prosecution, has told the court that his accomplice had fired the shot as had previously been arranged by Dewani. Evidence: Self confessed hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe has told the court that his accomplice had fired the shot as  arranged by Dewani . But defence barrister Francois Van Zyl accused him of misleading the court. The lawyer said: 'The gunshot is not what one would normally see in an execution-type killing. 'It's not what pathologists normally see when a person has been executed. It has all the hallmarks of a shot that went off when it wasn't supposed to go off.' The taxi where her body was found was dumped beside scrubland. Mr Van Zyl suggested he was trying pull her out of the car there to rape her rather than drive further into the Cape Town township. He said: 'If a person wanted to sexually molest a person by threatening her with a firearm, that is not something you would do in a residential area. 'You were trying to pull the deceased's lower legs. 'You threatened her, pulling her leg and shot her'. Care home tycoon Dewani had been thrown out of the cab minutes earlier after the gunmen flagged them down as they drove through the township. The 34-year-old from Bristol claims he was forced out at gunpoint and pleaded with the killers not to harm his wife. He has admitted being bi-sexual and using male prostitutes during his courtship of Mrs Dewani, but says he loved her. The Western Cape High Court has heard how a 'middleman' who recruited the hitmen to murder Mrs Dewani played a bigger role in the killing than previously alleged. Hotel receptionist Monde Mbolombo, who was granted immunity from prosecution for testifying against others in the plot, tried to arrange surgical gloves for the gunmen to conceal their fingerprints, it was alleged. Qwabe claimed that Mbolombo was merely a 'link man' who had put them in touch with Dewani's taxi driver who was helping him arrange the murder. But there were repeated phone calls between Mbolombo and the hitman on the evening of the murder, including one in which he told him: 'that thing we were talking about it must happen today', the court heard. The taxi: The taxi where her body was found was dumped beside scrubland . Mr Van Zyl suggested to Qwabe that showed Mbolombo was far more than just a 'link'. 'Monde Mbolombo spoke to you a number of times. Was that just to make idle conversation? 'He takes part in the planning, in arranging the bloodshed.' Qwabe is serving 25 years in jail for his role in the murder. Dewani denies murder, kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice. The trial continues.","Shrien Dewani accused of hiring hitmen to kill wife Anni on their honeymoon .

"A hapless motorist today admitted crashing her pink Vauxhall Corsa into an Aston Martin DBS worth £180,000. Natasha Gregory went online to respond to comments made about the bizarre accident on the ‘Shout Out Swindon’ Facebook page. The 24-year-old, from Swindon, claimed she clipped a kerb, lost control of the car and smashed into the 190mph DBS - a favourite of James Bond - as its owner stood filling it up, shunting it into a petrol pump. The luxury vehicle has now been taken to the scrapyard. Expensive mistake: Onlookers watched in horror as the little pink runabout crashed into the £100,000 Aston Martin in Swindon yesterday. Corsa driver Natasha Gregory says she feels like a 'total d*** head' Pink fan: Natasha Gregory from Swindon, the driver whose pink Vauxhall Corsa was involved in an accident that wrote off an Aston Martin . She wrote: 'Ummmm it was me and it was an accident. y the hell would I wonna go into aston martin (sic)!! 'I’m glad everyones fine, and I have u know I clipped a curb (I’m sure everyone has) and the steering went. S*** happens glad no one was hurt. 'I don’t really care what’s said, I feel like a total d*** head and am gutted and so sorry to the other driver was not his fault at all and he never tried to kill me. 'Yea cars at scrap yard, the only person I give a s*** bout is the other driver bless him thank good no one was hurt.' After the accident at Swindon's Kingshill Esso garage, the Aston Martin's owner, who asked not to be named, said the car was damaged beyond repair. Hitting the road sign might have been cheaper: The pink Corsa hit the well-polished DBS squarely on its side . He said: 'I was filling up and then I saw the car coming towards me. 'She drove out of the petrol station onto the roundabout, lost it and came over the kerb and straight into my car.  My car moved into the pump and bumped the pump off.' He told the Swindon Advertiser: 'My car will be a write-off. They won't fix that.' A passer-by, who saw the incident, said: 'She lost control on the roundabout and span around and into the petrol station. 'It all happened so fast in front of me.' Paramedics and police attended but . neither driver was hurt in the incident which happened just before 3pm. The petrol station was closed while staff worked to repair the damaged . pump. Shaken not stirred: Neither the owner of the Aston Martin nor the Corsa was injured in yesterday's accident . A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'We were called at 2.55pm to reports of two cars colliding on the forecourt of the Esso petrol station. 'One of the cars had gone into a pump. There was no fire but there was a strong smell of fumes.' The Aston Martin driver was incredibly unlucky to be involved in the collision. To crash into the Aston, Miss Gregory crossed a traffic island where she missed one large sign before avoiding any passing traffic. She then drove between two other road signs before hitting the stationary Aston as the driver attempted to fill it up with fuel. A spokesperson for Esso added: 'We are aware of a vehicle collision that occurred just before 3pm on Tuesday afternoon at Kingshill service station. 'The service station staff immediately called the emergency services, and assisted those involved. 'Apart from the damage to the vehicles involved, the collision caused only minor damage to two pump nozzles, and the site returned to normal working yesterday afternoon.' Licence to thrill: Actor Daniel Craig with the Aston Martin DBS in a promotional shot for Casino Royale . Aston Martin sportscars have been featured in several James Bond films, with the DBS appearing as 007's car in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. A spokesman for Aston Martin said: 'The DBS is not of the understated elegance of a DB9, nor the youthful agility of the V8 Vantage. 'It is explosive power in a black tie, and has its own unique character which will equal that of James Bond.' When the Aston Martin DBS went on sale in 2007, prices started from £180,000, but the model was discontinued last year. Powered by a 6-litre V12 engine, the 510bhp DBS is capable of 0-62mph in just 4.3 seconds, and boasts a top speed of 190mph. In real life, James Bond actor Daniel Craig, who drove the DBS in Casino Royale, is a fan, too.  Earlier this month the star, who turned 45 on March 2, was pictured taking delivery of a bright red £150,000 Vantage Roadster, leaving neighbours wondering if the convertible Aston Martin was a present to himself. Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson described the Aston Martin DBS as a model which is 'as close to perfect as a car can be'.","The sports car, a favourite of James Bond, was filling up at Swindon garage .

"Late night trickster Jimmy Kimmel was up to usual shenanigans on Thursday night's show turning his attention this time on a bunch of sucker fashionistas so desperate to appear on trend that they were willing to talk admiringly about labels they couldn’t possibly have heard off – because they simply don’t exist. New York Fashion Week took place this week at the Lincoln Center near Central Park and Kimmel sent along a young presenter to try and catch out some of the fashion forward attendees. Like lambs to the slaughter the hipsters spoke admiringly of their love for the work of George Costanza, Richardo Montalban and Joe Isuzu. It's called fashion look it up! These fashion forward hipsters were interviewed on Kimmel about made-up trends including wearing watermelons as headgear . An aspiring fashionista talks of her admiration for the supposed hot new designer - the Seinfeld character George Costanza . Surely they weren’t talking about the deeply unfashionable Seinfeld character, the Mexican actor famed for portraying Khan in Star Trek and the fictional spokesman for the Isuzu car and truck brand? The best of the bunch was the young man wearing everything black and too much foundation who spoke of his admiration for Eddie Munster. ‘Good aesthetic,’ said the goth of the werewolf boy from The Munsters, seemingly oblivious to just how much of a key influence the 60s TV character had been on his current image. Having humiliated one set of posers, Kimmel’s next trick was to ask his unwitting stooges if they had seen the runway show where model had worn watermelons on their heads.

"Catching sight of Nigel Pearson up in the stands next to assistants on laptops as his Leicester side dismantled Manchester United, you began to wonder why more managers don’t adopt this high-tech, high-vantage approach. It is a position Pearson came to by circumstance but has adopted to brilliant effect, with the 5-3 comeback victory over Louis van Gaal’s team the latest in a series of matches he has been able to influence from distance. Pearson was sent to the stands last August, receiving a one-game touchline ban for remonstrating with officials following defeat by Charlton. Leicester beat Wigan 2-0 the following game, with Pearson able to observe tactical shifts from his panoramic view and react. So he decided to stay. Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson watches his side beat Manchester United from high up in the stands . Assistant manager Kevin Phillips (left) and assistant first team coach Craig Shakespeare (right) direct operations from pitchside level . Pearson celebrates his side's remarkable 5-3 win against United with star striker Leonardo Ulloa . Ulloa wheels away after making it 5-3 from the penalty spot as United capitulated and Leicester capitalised . ‘I choose to do what I do because it is in the best interest of the team,’ he said recently. ‘There is no gimmick about it.’ He sits alongside assistant manager Steve Walsh, also head of recruitment, with performance analysts Peter Clark and Andy Blake next in line — three Apple MacBooks on the desk in front logging the action, offering replays. Pearson is in contact with the dugout via Kevin Phillips, who became first-team coach after retiring this summer, and the former England striker relays messages to Pearson’s other assistant manager Craig Shakespeare. Leicester right back Ritchie de Laet (left) exploited the space down United's left side on Sunday . He was the man at the edge of the technical area on Sunday. There is no direct link because it suits to have Shakepeare assessing the match from ground level without the Leicester manager constantly in his ear. Pearson heads down for the half time team-talk and is always pitchside at full time to shake the opposing manager’s hand. Much of the tactical work is done in the days leading up to the match, of course, and Leicester’s team are said to be one of the best in the business. Rob MacKenzie, head of technical scouting, ensures each player is sent a personalised video briefing on their direct opponent’s strengths and weaknesses, even on their days off. You can be sure Richie de Laet and Paul Konchesky knew about United full backs Rafael and Marcos Rojo’s preference for bombing forward, leaving space behind to exploit. Former England manager Steve McClaren prefers the vantage point up in the stands . Clive Woodward, who won  the 2003 Rugby World Cup managing England, advocates watching from higher up . ‘Generally I think it works pretty well,’ Pearson explained. ‘I can see things in a different way in the stand. Touchline-wise your perspective is limited. ‘I trust my staff implicitly. It is about preparing the team for the game and then helping players manage situations as they arise.’ Other managers have done it, notably Graham Taylor at Watford — where he would then watch the second half in the dugout — and Sam Allardyce at Bolton. He said he would sit in the stands at West Ham once the team was playing the way he wanted, but never has. Steve McClaren does it at Derby, only heading to the touchline in the latter stages of games, but Pearson is a Premier League maverick in this sense. In rugby coaches often watch from on high. Sir Clive Woodward was able to assess the 2003 World Cup final from the stands and make changes accordingly. He believes more football managers should try it. ‘If you’re on the touchline screaming at people, it can be a distraction,’ he says. ‘I used to have messages passed to me from people on all corners of the stadium so I as the head coach could make a proper decision. Sam Allardyce is another gaffer who has spent time in the stands, but he now prefers the being in the dugout . ‘You are far better higher up, in terms of being able to see the game but also being away from the action you have a clearer head. It is good to see Pearson having the foresight and bottle for going against what most people do.’ Woodward also suggests that when he would travel to the Twickenham touchline it carried greater impact for the players. ‘If a team sees you on the touchline then something big is going on.’ Pearson seems to agree and is reluctant to engage in the fashion for English managers to display their involvement to fans. ‘It becomes a theatre at times which I am not interested in,’ he says. ‘But I also feel at times managers should be visible. I’m not saying there is a right way or a wrong way, it just works for us.’ Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel is overjoyed at the astonishing turnaround against Manchester United .

"A war of words erupted yesterday as Ed Miliband declared himself ‘furious’ at the Daily Mail for a trenchant attack on his father’s Marxist beliefs. The Labour leader said he was ‘appalled’ at the newspaper’s refusal to retract its article about Ralph Miliband – headlined ‘The Man Who Hated Britain’ – and launched a petition to condemn it. But the newspaper said it stood by every word of its essay, which some commentators praised as a fair profile of a refugee to Britain who was a staunch supporter of what the Mail calls ‘one of the world’s most poisonous political doctrines’. Family: Ed Miliband and father Ralph Miliband, pictured in London in 1989 . David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Nick Clegg issued expressions of sympathy for the Labour leader, but others said this newspaper had been right to highlight the academic’s formative influences on his son as he vies to become prime minister. Cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt defended the right of newspapers to scrutinise politicians’ backgrounds. The critique of Ralph Miliband, who died in 1994, was published in Saturday’s edition of the Daily Mail. The newspaper quoted the 17-year-old Ralph writing during the Second World War that ‘the Englishman is a rabid nationalist’ and ‘you sometimes want them almost to lose (the war) to show them how things are’. War of words: Ed Miliband wrote a rebuttal to the Mail piece in yesterday's paper . Aged 45, he wrote of his disdain for the British Establishment, saying it included: ‘Eton and Harrow, Oxford and Cambridge, the great Clubs, the Times, the Church, the Army, the respectable Sunday papers ... the House of Lords ... social hierarchies, God save the Queen.’ In yesterday’s paper, Ed Miliband responded by writing an article, which the Mail published in full, in which he insisted his father had loved Britain. He told the BBC yesterday: ‘It’s perfectly legitimate for the Daily Mail to talk about my father’s politics but when they say that he hated Britain I was not willing to put up with that because my father loved Britain. ‘My father served in the Royal Navy, he was a refugee who came here and found security in this country. ‘He took great comfort from what this country offered him and I’m speaking out as a son. ‘I was appalled when I read the Daily Mail on Saturday and saw them saying that he hated Britain. It’s a lie.’ Mr Cameron admitted he had not read the original article but cautioned against politicians complaining about scrutiny of their families. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: ‘Politicians should not tell editors what to put in their papers. A raucous and robust press is a critical safeguard of freedom.’ Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott admitted to Channel 4 News that Mr Miliband’s father was no democrat. ‘I knew Ralph Miliband. He didn’t like Parliament, he didn’t like social democracy,’ he said. United: Ed's brother David Miliband, right, wrote on Twitter that his 'dad loved Britain' Support: Both Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Deputy PM Nick Clegg, right, sent messages sympathising with Mr Miliband . ‘But you can’t character assassinate Ed Miliband simply because of what the father did. Anybody with blood in their hearts would say “I’m going to defend my family”.’ Anne McElvoy, of The Economist, said: ‘Ed Miliband has often used his father, and talked about his father in speeches and in his self-presentation as his inspiration. ‘It is quite reasonable to look into what Ralph Miliband believes. 'While he may not have hated Britain, he certainly disapproved of many of the founding institutions of the state and was at odds with them.’ Many callers to London station LBC said Mr Miliband’s penchant for name-checking his late father in his own political speeches meant he should expect some scrutiny of his father’s Marxist beliefs. In an editorial published alongside Mr Miliband’s response yesterday, the Mail refused to apologise and asked how his father’s Marxist vision could possibly be declared out of bounds for public discussion. Views: Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott told Channel 4 that Ralph Miliband was 'no democrat' Last night a spokesman for the Mail said: ‘We ask fair-minded people to read our editorial today. For what this episode confirms is that you cannot allow politicians anywhere near regulating the Press. ‘While we respect Mr Miliband’s right to defend his father – and he has done so in the Daily Mail today – it is worth stressing that Ralph Miliband wasn’t an ordinary private individual but a prominent academic and author who devoted his life to promoting a Marxist dogma which caused so much misery in the world. ‘He hated such British institutions as the Queen, the Church and the Army, and wanted a workers’ revolution. Our readers have a right to know that. ‘Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, is the leading advocate of statutory controls on the Press in Britain under which politicians could ultimately decide what appears in newspapers. ‘His father – to whom he constantly refers in his speeches – was a proponent of one of the world’s most poisonous political doctrines under which freedom of expression was crushed and newspapers controlled by governments.’ The Press Complaints Commission said it had received more than 30 complaints about the Daily Mail article, although none was from Labour or the Miliband family. Former foreign secretary David Miliband wrote on Twitter ‘my dad loved Britain’ and said his younger brother was telling the truth.","Ed Miliband said he is 'appalled' that the Mail hasn't retracted its article about father Ralph .

He said Hong Kong's airport was light-years ahead and has the type of modern facility travelers would expect to see in the United States. His remarks came during an event in Philadelphia in which he stressed the need for infrastructure improvement.

"Muddy hell: Lance Bombardier Simpson will face 25 obstacles as part of the extreme endurance challenge . A soldier who lost both his legs in a explosion in Afghanistan has been described as an inspiration by the organisers of an extreme challenge dubbed 'the obstacle race from hell'. Lance Bombardier James Simpson, 27, is set to be the first double amputee to take part in a Spartan Race event. Spartan Race is an open country run punctuated with a range of punishing, surprise obstacles - from mud crawls and ice-pit plunges to cargo-net climbs and fire-log leaps. Organisers describe it as 'an event of pure, primitive craziness'. L/Bdr Simpson, from Rawdon, near Leeds, was serving with 5th Regiment, Royal Artillery when he stepped on an improvised explosive device as he returned from a foot patrol in Helmand. He lost both his legs above the knee and also damaged both his arms in the blast in November 2009. Now he is training for Spartan Race in woods close to his West Yorkshire home where he is trying to match his different prosthetics with the terrain and obstacles the event will throw at him. He has been using his running blades - shortened versions of those used by Paralympics track athletes - and what he calls his stubbies, which are small pads that fit on the bottom of what is left of his thighs. L/Bdr Simpson said he plans to carry both at the event next month and swap them when necessary using just an Allen key. 'It’s going to be a challenge,' he said. 'It’s not so much the run I’m really worried about, it’s getting over the obstacles. 'I’m going to be a lot shorter because of my blades. I’m going to have to rely on my arms and my legs.' Scroll down for video . Bravery: The soldier is being trained for the gruelling event by Spartan coach Micheal Cohen, left . Strength: The 27-year-old is determined to get over every obstacle . He said: 'I want every step to be my own. I don’t want to rely on my team to get me over obstacles. 'I want to get over an obstacle, if it takes 10 minutes or if it takes 30 seconds, I’m going to get over each obstacle by myself. 'Even if I change my feet and then, halfway through the obstacle, I have to change back, I’m going to get across every obstacle.' Running man: The stoic soldier has been using his running blades and what he calls his stubbies, which are small pads that fit on the bottom of what is left of his thighs . Almost as soon as L/Bdr Simpson arrived at the special military wing at Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital following his devastating injuries three years ago, he began to plan how he was going to walk again. But despite quickly mastering his prosthetic legs with the help of the Army’s rehabilitation centre at Headley Court, in Surrey, it was only earlier this year that he decided that he wanted to start running properly again. He said he took the decision after agreeing to run in a 1500m race at the Warrior Games for injured servicemen in the United States and surprising himself with how much he enjoyed it. 'My first challenge was to walk again, not run around an assault course with loads of mud,' he said. 'I gave myself a few months to do that and then, when I achieved that, I never really focused on running much. 'Running’s only something I’ve started doing seriously this year. 'Then I saw some pictures of some of my friends who did a Spartan Race in America and I was, like ""I want to give that a bash"".' He added: 'My family knows me really well and if I told them I was going to climb Everest, they’d be, like ""Well, don’t do it on Tuesday because we’re having a dinner"". 'Nothing shocks them now. Nothing really shocks them at all.' L/Bdr Simpson is starting with the Spartan York Sprint which is taking place on September 8 near Ripon, North Yorkshire, and features more than 25 obstacles over a 5km course. This is the shortest version of Spartan Race, which is held in various formats up to the 'obstacle race from hell' Spartan Beast. Head Spartan coach Michael Cohen has been helping him prepare for the obstacles he will face. Mr Cohen said: 'I’m over the moon to have the opportunity to work with him and give him the skills so he can actually complete a Spartan Race. He lost both his legs in a explosion in Afghanistan and has been described as an inspiration by the race organisers . Spartan Race is named after the fearless Ancient Greek warriors and is designed to push participants to the limit .

Almost as soon as L/Bdr Simpson arrived at the special military wing at Birmingham¿s Selly Oak Hospital following his devastating injuries three years ago, he began to plan how he was going to walk again . 'He’s coming to undulating terrain, he’s coming to muddy, wet, slippery slopes. He’s pushing his boundaries. It’s great. I feel inspired.' Race director of Spartan Race UK former Royal Marines Commando Richard Lee said: 'James’s inspirational example is very moving. 'By enrolling in his first Spartan Race, he is showing great courage and setting a new British record by becoming our first double amputee to run a UK Spartan Race. Endurance: Organisers call Spartan Race 'an event of pure, primitive craziness' A range of punishing, surprise obstacles - from mud crawls and ice-pit plunges to cargo-net climbs and fire-log leaps - await the soldier . 'He is a perfect example of what we stand for at Spartan Race. Overcoming obstacles is part of our everyday life. No one gives you a map, no one tells you what challenges lie ahead, but somehow we overcome them and grow stronger.' Spartan Race - named after the fearless Ancient Greek warriors - is organising seven races across the UK this summer with an expected 40,000 UK entrants. Obstacles are kept secret to surprise racers, but they can include 15-foot rope climbs, slippery 7ft ramps, sandbag carries, barbed-wire mud crawls, 25-foot-high cargo nets and clambers through semi-submerged drainage tunnels. L/Bdr Simpson, who is leaving the Army in September to become a student, is hoping his participation will raise money for the national armed forces charity SSAFA.

"It looks like the aftermath of a campsite tornado, or perhaps the first stages of a landfill site. But this was the scene the morning after the night before at Reading Festival, shortly after everyone had gone home. The music stopped... the party finished... and a 90,000-strong exodus from the hugely popular music event began. It may look  like the aftermath of a campsite tornado, or perhaps the first stages of a landfill site - but this is the scene as the crowds dispersed at Reading festival . The once bustling campsite was transformed into a sea of rubbish and deserted tents as the revellers left and the clean-up teams moved in . A massive sea of beer cans, cigarette butts, half-eaten food, discarded packaging, lost or unwanted belongings, grubby clothes, wellies, sleeping bags and abandoned tents now fill the vast fields . It’s just that many festival-goers appear to have left a few things behind when they went. Result: a massive sea of beer cans, cigarette butts, half-eaten food, discarded packaging, lost or unwanted belongings, grubby clothes, wellies, sleeping bags and abandoned tents. Especially tents. ‘Camping gear is so cheap these days that people seem to make it part of their festival package budget, and don’t bother to take it with them when they leave,’ a festival insider said. ‘If eight people are crammed into one tent it’s only going to cost them a few quid each. We do everything we can to encourage people to take their stuff with them when they leave but it’s a question of social responsibility. At the end of the day it’s down to the individual.’ A huge clear-up operation began within hours of the annual Bank Holiday event closing on Monday. Despite a 'Love Your Tent' campaign imploring people to pack up and remove their camping gear, thousands clearly did not . Tractors towing magnets are used to collect metal tent pegs and other potentially dangerous metal objects, and volunteers will work with specialised rubbish-clearance teams eventually to return the field to its original state . Last year more than 20 tons of re-useable equipment was salvaged - and this year the figure is expected to be even higher. Some will be offered to local charities but damaged or unplaced equipment will be destined for landfill sites . The spectacular sea of camping trash, just yards from upmarket homes on the opposite bank of the Thames at Caversham, is expected to take up to two weeks for festival organisers to clear completely .

Tractors towing magnets are used to collect metal tent pegs and other potentially dangerous metal objects, and volunteers will work with specialised rubbish-clearance teams eventually to return the field to its original state. Lack of rain over the weekend means the task will be significantly easier. High temperatures mean the garbage will be significantly smellier. Advertising company trainee Louise Miller, 17, took a day off work to travel from her home in mid-Wales to attend the festival with two friends. ‘We bought a stupid looking two-berth pop-up tent from Argos and we all squashed up inside,’ she told the Daily Mail. ‘We never intended to abandon it but although it popped up really easily, it was impossible to get it to fit back in the bag properly. Everyone else was leaving their stuff behind so we did too. 'I feel really bad now about dumping it, but I promise we did put all our other stuff in the recycle bags, and we were careful not to leave any litter.’","Aerial photographs show 'the morning after the night before' at Reading Festival, after everyone had gone home .

"It's the longest running feud in the Premier League... but where did it start? Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho's rivalry spilled over at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when the Arsenal manager shoved his counterpart and the pair failed to shake hands at the full-time whistle. Wenger was furious with Gary Cahill's rash tackle on Alexis Sanchez with 20 minutes gone which saw the Chelsea defender booked in a fiercely-contested encounter. The Frenchman came out of his technical area to gesticulate to referee Martin Atkinson before then raising his arms to the oncoming Mourinho.

Wenger and Mourinho continued to exchange verbal insults throughout the first half with Chelsea's assistant manager Rui Faria and Arsenal's No 2 Steve Bould also said to be involved. The pair didn't shake hands at full-time and Mourinho said: 'For me, it is over.

"Tony Blair was branded ‘disgraceful’ last night for advising a notorious dictator on how to ‘spin’ a massacre of civilians by his regime. The former prime minister is said to have earned millions of pounds advising Kazakhstan’s president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1989. Leaked documents yesterday revealed Mr Blair’s assistance included giving the autocratic ruler detailed advice on how to improve his international image following an incident in which police shot dead 14 unarmed civilians protesting against his rule. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev who he gave PR advice to over the massacre of civilians . There was international condemnation following the massacre in the oil town of Zhanaozen in 2011, in which another 64 protesters were wounded by the security services. A leaked letter now reveals the part Mr Blair played in helping the Kazakh leader rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the international community. Ahead of a speech Mr Nazarbayev was due to give at Cambridge University, Mr Blair offered detailed advice on how to address the massacre. Mr Blair told him that the deaths ‘tragic though they were, should not obscure the enormous progress’ his country had made. He forwarded a passage of about 500 words for Mr Nazarbayev’s speech. His suggestions were accepted with only minor alterations and were included in media reports of the speech. Campaign group Human Rights Watch, which has condemned Kazakhstan’s record, yesterday described Mr Blair as ‘shameless’. Hugh Williamson of the Human Rights Watch called Mr Blair 'disgraceful' Hugh Williamson, the director of the group’s Europe and Central Asia division, said: ‘It is disgraceful that Tony Blair has taken millions of pounds from this autocrat to write speeches for him without really tackling head on the huge human rights problems in Kazakhstan.’ The leaked letter, written on notepaper headed Office of Tony Blair, said: ‘Dear Mr President, here is a suggestion for a paragraph to include in the Cambridge speech. I think it best to meet head on the Zhanaozen issue. The fact is you have made changes following it; but in any event these events, tragic though they were, should not obscure the enormous progress that Kazakhstan has made. ‘Dealing with it [the massacre] in the way I suggest, is the best way for the western media. It will also serve as a quote that can be used in the future setting out the basic case for Kazakhstan.’ In his own handwriting, Mr Blair added at the bottom of the letter: ‘With very best wishes. I look forward to seeing you in London! Yours ever, Tony Blair.’ Mr Blair has been criticised since leaving office for advising a number of regimes with unsavoury human rights records. A spokesman said payments to Mr Blair from Kazakhstan were ‘not for PR advice but in respect of a full-time team of people who live and work in Kazakhstan working on the reform programme of the government in areas like de-centralisation and local Government reform’. The spokesman said Mr Blair did not personally profit from his organisation’s work with the regime. He said Mr Blair had always acknowledged Kazakhstan faced ‘real challenges’ over human rights, but said the country had made ‘huge progress’ under Mr Nazarbayev. ‘Tony Blair believes Kazakhstan is a strategically important country for the West and will continue to support it,’ the spokesman said. ‘The letter referred to was simply making these points, namely that the events of Zhanaozen were indeed tragic and they had to be confronted in any speech, not ignored.’","Tony Blair is said to have made millions advising Nursultan Nazarbayev .

"Did the cuckolded husband of Paula Broadwell send a letter to a New York Times advice column back in July that revealed he knew of her affair with David Petraeus? That intriguing possibility has been raised after canny observers dug out the July 13th edition of Chuck Klosterman's 'The Ethicist' and pointed to extraordinary coincidences between one readers letter and the now scandalous love tryst. Writing about a deepening relationship he knew his wife was having with a 'government executive' whose job 'is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership' the anonymous man offers up what could be considered in hindsight as striking information. Was the fact that Paula Broadwell (left) having an affair with David Petraeus known by her husband Scott (right) and did he write an anonymous letter to the New York Times advice column for help? The letter writer explains that 'exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort,' and asks 'The Ethicist' whether it is OK for him to 'suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project'. Indeed, he seems pained to make it clear he believes the mission 'must succeed' and wants to know if he should confront his wife in some way and 'finally force closure' or if he should 'suffer in silence for the next year or two.' The reader tells 'The Ethicist' that has 'watched the affair intensify over the last year' - which matches the timeline of the affair from August 2011 until around several months ago. However, some have questioned whether the coincidences are just that and if the letter really was penned by Scott Broadwell. 'Affair': Paula Broadwell and David Petraeus, pictured, reportedly had an affair that led to his resignation . Slate writer Allison Benedikt asked, 'What government executive is not having an affair with some guy's wife'. Another writer with the publication added, 'would anyone really repeatedly refer to heading the CIA as a 'project'? Doesn't sound quite right.' Those supporting the belief that the letter came from Scott Broadwell, point to Klosterman's insightful reply to the anonymous man's dilemma. He tells the letter writer that he should tell his wife he wanted to separate, 'just as you would if she were sleeping with the mailman.' 'Other woman': Paula Broadwell, left, is married . and has two children. Petraeus has been married to his wife Holly, . pictured right, for 37 years, and they also have two children . Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . He claims there is no reason to reveal the affair in a public fashion, but having offered this clear-cut advice he goes slightly further. 'The fact that you’re willing to accept your wife’s infidelity for some greater political good is beyond honorable,' replied Klosterman on July 13th to the letter. 'In fact, it’s so over-the-top honorable that I’m not sure I believe your motives are real. 'Part of me wonders why you’re even posing this question, particularly in a column that is printed in The New York Times. 'I halfway suspect you’re writing this letter because you want specific people to read this column and deduce who is involved and what’s really going on behind closed doors (without actually addressing the conflict in person). 'That’s not ethical, either.' 'My wife is having an affair with a government executive. His role is to manage a project whose progress is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership. (This might seem hyperbolic, but it is not an exaggeration.)'I have met with him on several occasions, and he has been gracious. (I doubt if he is aware of my knowledge.) I have watched the affair intensify over the last year, and I have also benefited from his generosity.'He is engaged in work that I am passionate about and is absolutely the right person for the job. I strongly feel that exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort.'My issue: Should I acknowledge this affair and finally force closure? Should I suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project I feel must succeed?'Should I be “true to my heart” and walk away from the entire miserable situation and put the episode behind me?' NAME WITHHELD . The resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus has brought a sudden and unexpected end to the public career of a four-star general who led U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and was thought to be a potential candidate for president. Petraeus admitted to an extramarital affair in tendering his resignation, which President Barack Obama accepted Friday. Petraeus carried on the affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, a reserve Army officer, according to several U.S. officials with knowledge of the situation. They spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss publicly the investigation that led to the resignation. The FBI discovered the relationship by monitoring Petraeus' emails, after being alerted Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account, two of the officials said. Confident: Paula Broadwell appeared on The Daily Show with John Stewart in January to promote her biography of David Petraeus . Comfortable: She lives with her husband and their two young sons in Charlotte, North Carolina, pictured . Lawmakers from both parties joined Obama in praising Petraeus. Obama said in a statement that Petraeus had provided 'extraordinary service to the United States for decades' and had given a lifetime of service that 'made our country safer and stronger.' CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell will serve as acting director, Obama said. Morell was the key CIA aide in the White House to President George W. Bush during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. 'I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,' Obama said. The resignation comes at a sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday. The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world. Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the assault on the consulate in Benghazi, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. Barack Obama's national security policy has been compromised  by the loss of one of David Petraeus . She was the daughter of the academy superintendent. They have two children, and their son led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. The retired general told his staffers in a statement that he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment' in engaging in the affair. 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.' He said he had offered his resignation to Obama on Thursday and the president accepted it Friday. Administration officials said the White House was first notified about the Petraeus affair on Wednesday, the day after the election. Obama, who returned to the White House that evening after spending Election Day in Chicago, wasn't informed until Thursday morning. Embedded: Broadwell, pictured here in Afghanistan, has more than a decade of U.S. military service . Broadwell, pictured with Lt Col. Steve Grenier in Gizab, writes opinion pieces on leadership . For the director of the CIA, being engaged in an extramarital affair is considered a serious breach of security and a counterintelligence threat. If a foreign government had learned of the affair, the reasoning goes, Petraeus or Broadwell could have been blackmailed or otherwise compromised. Military justice considers conduct such as an extramarital affair to be possible grounds for court-martial. Failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank and file that such behavior is acceptable. Petraeus, who became CIA director in September 2011, was known as a shrewd thinker and hard-charging competitor. His management style was recently lauded in a Newsweek article by Broadwell. The article listed Petraeus' 'rules for living.' No. 5 was: 'We all make mistakes. The key is to recognize them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear view mirrors—drive on and avoid making them again.' The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Petraeus' departure represented 'the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants. From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one's country.' Other CIA directors have resigned under unflattering circumstances. CIA Director Jim Woolsey left over the discovery of a KGB mole, and director John Deutch left after the revelation that he had kept classified information on his home computer.","Letter written by anonymous reader and printed on July 13th in the New York Times has been noted for its striking similarities to the David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell affair .

"Sophie, Countess of Wessex and Lord Rothermere, chairman of DMGT, pictured at the London Press Club Ball last night . Britain's 300-year-old free Press is under attack as never before, Viscount Rothermere, chairman of DMGT, publisher of the Daily Mail, warned last night. He said that a liberal democracy ‘cannot exist’ without the Press, now the target of criticism from ‘politicians and so-called celebrities who are the loudest in flaunting their liberal credentials’. Lord Rothermere, addressing the London Press Club Ball, raising money for the Journalists’ Charity in its 150th year, said the Leveson Inquiry into media standards had an ‘impossible remit’ from a Government that had still not published the Chilcot report into the Iraq War 11 years after the conflict began. Many journalists were being ‘crushed by the full weight of the law’, unlike ‘those in the City whose greed almost caused our entire banking system to collapse’. He told guests, including the Countess of Wessex and London Mayor Boris Johnson, that in the ‘current anti-Press climate’ there was ‘great danger of forgetting all the good work newspapers do and how vital their contribution is to the freedoms we enjoy in this country’. ‘So to our many critics I say this: Remember that those freedoms are protected by a small and determined army who sometimes literally put their lives on the line to shine a light in dark corners of the world. ‘And that army is under attack and undervalued as never before. ‘So for the sake of our industry and for our democracy, I ask for more understanding and appreciation of the demands placed on Britain’s journalists every day in their quest to establish the truth.’ Lord Rothermere expressed concern that ‘if we continue denigrating newspapers and undermining the work of the countless decent and honest journalists, not just in London but in every region, every town, we could end up destroying the very keystone upon which this country is built: Freedom of speech.’ Mr Johnson told guests at the Royal Courts of Justice in London that British journalists ‘risk their lives to tell us what’s happening’ in areas of conflict and strife around the world. He called for a change in the law to prevent police accessing journalists’ phone records without the approval of a judge. It has emerged in recent weeks that police have been using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to force telecoms companies to hand over information without customers’ knowledge. Detectives investigating disgraced MP Chris Huhne’s speeding points fraud secretly obtained a Mail on Sunday reporter’s phone records without his consent, despite laws protecting the confidentiality of journalistic sources. ‘It is absolutely vital for our country and for this city that we protect free speech – and if I can say something about one current controversy, it is of course right that the police should be able to investigate serious criminal matters,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘But it is also crucial that journalists should be able to protect their sources and to give whistleblowers the confidence to come forward. We will have to insist that in future the police will not be able to see a journalist’s phone records without some kind of judicial approval.’ Lord Rothermere is president of the Journalists’ Charity, of which the Queen is patron. It raises money for journalists in need because of ill health or hardship.

"A British scientist has claimed listening to songs by Miley Cyrus (pictured) while studying has a calming effect on the mind that aids logical thought . A British scientist has claimed that listening to songs by Miley Cyrus or Justin Timberlake while studying has a calming effect on the mind that aids logical thought. Despite not being perhaps the most obvious choice of relaxing tracks, the clinical psychologist believes pop songs with 50 to 80 beats per minute allow the brain to learn and remember new facts more easily. Dr Emma Gray, who specialises in cognitive behavioural therapy at The British CBT and Counselling Service in London, said emotive pop and rock songs including Katy Perry's 'Firework' song can produce a heightened state of excitement that is likely to enhance creative performance in subjects such as English, Drama and Art. She believes students who listen to classical music while they study, do better in maths exams, while listening to music while revising makes students smarter. Dr Gray's research, which was commissioned by music streaming service Spotify to investigate the effect music has on studying, found it is important to choose the right music for the topic a person is studying as it stimulates learning and can enhance concentration. She said students who listen to classical music with 60 to . 70 beats per minute while they study, score on average 12 per cent more . in their Maths exams - the equivalent of climbing a whole grade. This is because the melody and tone range in classical . music, such as Beethoven’s Fur Elise, help students to study for longer . and retain more information. Emma Gray said emotive pop and rock songs including Katy Perry's 'Firework' song can produce a heightened state of excitement that is likely to enhance creative performance in subjects such as English, Drama and Art, while students who listen to classical music like Beethoven while they study, do better in maths exams . Dr Gray explained the left side of the brain is used to . process factual information and solve problems, which are key skills in . Science, Humanities and Languages. The research found songs like 'We Can't Stop' by Miley Cyrus or 'Mirrors' by Justin Timberlake fostered logical thoughts and helped students to learn and recall new facts. Dr Gray said: 'Music has a positive effect on the mind and listening to the right type of music can actually improve studying and learning. 'Music can put you in a better frame of mind to learn - and indeed, students who listen to music can actually do better than those who don’t. Dr Gray said: 'Music has a positive effect on the mind and listening to the right type of music can actually improve studying and learning. Music can put you in a better frame of mind to learn - and indeed, students who listen to music can actually do better than those who don't' 'For logical subjects, like Maths, music should calm the mind and help concentration, whereas for creative subjects, the music should reflect the emotion that the student is trying to express.' Angela Watts, vice president of global communications at Spotify, said: 'With millions of students streaming music on Spotify, it’s great to see the positive effect it could have on their studies.' The music streaming service with the help of Dr Gray has created playlists to help students study effectively.","Clinical psychologist Dr Emma Gray found that songs with 50 to 80 beats per minute allowed brain to learn and remember new facts more easily .

"A British soldier's body was paraded like a trophy after his capture and execution by the Taliban, it was claimed last night. The Ministry of Defence was investigating reports from Afghan elders that enemy fighters displayed Scott McLaren's corpse before dumping it in a canal. A member of the 4th Battalion (The Highlanders) the Royal Regiment of Scotland, he was snatched by insurgents after inexplicably walking off from a remote base in southern Afghanistan. Highlander Scott McLaren was said by his commanding officer to be 'a man with a big heart and a true friend to many. He had a heart of gold' The colleagues of the Scottish soldier described him as a man of 'true grit' with a 'heart of gold'. Friends and relatives paid tribute to the soldier, from the Sighthill area of Edinburgh, whose death dealt a 'huge blow' to those serving alongside him. A statement released on behalf of his family - parents James and Ann, sister Kirsty and brothers James and Ross - read: 'We are deeply saddened by the news that our dear son Scott was killed in Afghanistan. We were extremely proud of Scott. 'He loved the Army and despite his short time in 4 SCOTS had made many friends. 'Scott was a beloved son to James and Ann and brother to Kirsty, James and Ross. His family and friends; Grandmother Evelyn, Uncle Graham, Aunty Heather and close friend Michael will miss him dreadfully. We will always be thinking of him.' The 20-year-old's body was found about three miles from Checkpoint . Salaang, in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand province. Hundreds of . troops, armoured vehicles and helicopters had searched for him. Abdul Ahad Helmandwal, a local elder, said Highlander McLaren was grabbed by insurgents near the village . of Kopak and killed a short distance away. He said: 'They took his body to show the other Taliban that they had . killed a British soldier. The other Taliban kicked the body and they . threw him in the canal.' But General Sayed Malook, commander of Afghan forces in Helmand, claimed . the soldier drowned going for a 2am swim in the nearby Nahr-e Bughra . canal. He said the abuse happened after locals pulled the body from the canal: . 'When they found the body the Taliban in the area started trampling on . him, stabbing him and even shot him.' But senior UK defence sources dismissed the claims. They said Highlander . McLaren had 'died of two gunshot wounds', including one to the back of . the head that indicated he was executed. One insider cast doubt on the suggestion he had gone swimming: 'Who'd go . for a dip in the middle of the night on their own in an area littered . with IEDs?' Yesterday officers from the Royal Military Police's special . investigations branch flew to Checkpoint Salaang to begin piecing . together the events leading to the soldier's death. Required by military . law to investigate all service deaths, the RMP will interview . colleagues of Highlander McLaren as well as his commanders. A senior Army officer who recently returned from Afghanistan suggested manpower and morale were problems at small bases. He added: 'They are very remote and on their own and because we have so . few soldiers on the ground commanders are being forced to deliver more . capability with insufficient resources. 'Some of these bases are run by one officer on his own and the senior . sergeants and corporals are pushed to their limits so they often cannot . watch everything that their men are doing. Training: David Cameron meets Afghan National Army troops during a visit to their training camp at Camp Bastion, outside Lashkar Gah . Talks: David Cameron and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai arrive for a joint press conference in Kabul . 'Most of these bases are in or around the green zone and have a small . stream or parts of the Helmand river running through their areas and the . blokes do try to cool down there when it is safe. 'But because some of these bases are quiet it is easy to become . complacent and take what you think are acceptable risks. The word is . this chap took a 9mm pistol and went for a swim after his duty ended.' Speaking in the Afghan capital Kabul, David Cameron said the slaying . showed the 'high price' Britain was paying to bring peace to . Afghanistan. But the Prime Minister insisted the campaign against the Taliban was . succeeding and plans to hand control of security to the Afghans were on . track. He will confirm to Parliament today that he has agreed to make only a . 'modest' cut of up to 500 soldiers by autumn next year, leaving a core . of around 9,500 troops.

Under guard: Flanked by soldiers and security staff, Mr Cameron undertakes a walkabout at Camp Bastion . The 375th UK serviceman to die in the ten-year conflict, Highlander . McLaren joined the army in August 2009, training at Catterick before . being posted to Germany. Within three days of arriving in Afghanistan he . was involved in capturing a Taliban commander and finding a huge haul . of IEDs. He was said to be one of the fittest soldiers in his platoon and a . 'shining star' who would get up 15 minutes before his colleagues. His . commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Aitken added: 'He was a . man with a big heart and a true friend to many. He was trusted by all . and had a heart of gold.' Major James Cross, Officer Commanding D Company, said: 'Highlander McLaren's death has come as a huge blow to all of us who have had the privilege of serving alongside him.' Lieutenant Colonel James de Labilliere, commanding officer of Combined Force Nahr-e-Saraj (South) and 1st Battalion, The Rifles, said the soldier had been tasked with 'some of the most demanding' work during his month-long attachment. Captain Callum MacLeod, Officer Commanding Fire Support Group and Multiple Commander, D Company, said Highlander McLaren was the perfect example of 'what makes a Scottish soldier great'. 'He was cool under pressure and unrelenting in the face of the enemy,' the senior officer said. 'The Multiple has been robbed of a friend, and the Battalion of a talent that was only just beginning to shine.' Major Justin Barry, Officer . Commanding B Company, echoed his praise for the young soldier who, he . said, would be remembered as a 'quiet, yet fiercely dedicated and loyal' member of the Company. Defence Secretary Liam Fox said he was 'deeply saddened' by news of Highlander McLaren's death. 'He was a brave and well liked soldier, praised by his seniors and admired by his colleagues,' he said. 'I understand from his commanders . that he was the most conscientious member of the platoon who could . always be relied on and who will be greatly missed. 'My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.'

"Not many artists could call producing their work a walk in the park - but for Omid Asadi it's just that. The 35-year-old, from Greater Manchester, has created a collection of intricate images by carving into fallen leaves with a scalpel and a needle. His portfolio, which is brimming with portraits of iconic celebrities and beautiful animals, was inspired by an idea he had while strolling in a park with his wife, Elham, 36, two years ago. Omid Asadi, from Greater Manchester, was inspired to create the designs on leaves while strolling through the park with his wife (pictured is his impression of Bob Marley) Mr Asadi's portfolio is brimming with portraits of iconic celebrities including Jimi Hendrix (above) He now spends up to three hours-a-day perfecting his methods with his artistic wife occasionally offering some direction.

Mr Asadi, originally from Iran, claims he has been approached by a website connected with the Saatchi Gallery and says he wants to show the world that art can be found anywhere. He said: 'Carving these leaves resonates to my childhood, I had no time for playing football outside. 'So I used to use a needle and make some simple drawings behind a leaf and on a leaf.

'Two years ago me and my wife were walking in the Sale area and we found some heavy and beautiful leaves and we put them in a book to press them . 'About that time I visited a gallery and saw an exhibition on paper cutting - it was then I decided to give these leaves we found another life. 'My wife is a professional artist and she does Persian miniature artwork so she taught me how to use the leaves - the first year I practiced for two or three hours every day. 'Too many people just see the beauty of this art but I am also trying to tell a story with each leaf. 'With my portraits I  I have also tried to give some people who are dead another life.' The process of carving each leaf can take anything from a few days up to a month (pictured left - an impression of Edvard Munch's famous painting The Scream) He added: 'The process of carving each leaf can take one or two days or up to one month, I use just two or three tools - a scalpel, a magnifying glass and sometimes a needle.

"With one hand on the wheel he leans to one of the country's most controversial comedians and asks 'What's the meaning of life Frankie?' This is the self styled 'Artist Taxi Driver' Mark McGowan and he is interviewing Frankie Boyle - a man perhaps better known for his tasteless jokes about the Queen and glamour model Jordan's disabled son than his spiritual views. Controversial 'performance artist' Mr McGowan - who once performed a 'piece' in which he keyed a succession of cars, ate a dead corgi, and danced a ballet dance while dressed as a pig outside New Scotland Yard -  has attracted a cult following on his own YouTube channel with some videos attracting more than 200,000 hits. Controversial 'performance artist' Mark McGowan has become a YouTube sensation after reinventing himself as the Artist Taxi Driver . His YouTube channel is filled iwth nearly 2,000 videos in which he can be seen ranting to the camera and interviewing controversial figures such as comedian Frankie Boyle . In them he can be seen interviewing high profile figures such as Boyle, Respect MP George Galloway, and the Oxford Cambridge boat race saboteur Trenton Oldfield, who happily tells the artist that the six months he spent in prison for his stunt were 'an amazing experience'. In the bizarre interview with Boyle, in which the comedian tells him that he believes the universe is 'conscious' and that creation is God just playing a 'game of hide and seek with himself', the taxi driver can be heard calling the  Queen a 'hairy f*****'. He said: 'Whats with the f****** queen? what's her gig? She's a hairy goat legged f*****' 'She's feeding off our pain.'

He claims the Government is 'pulling . off a huge scam' and a 'massive robbery' by moving 'public money into . private pockets', The Independent reports. Mr McGowan first rose to fame in 2005 with two public works which attracted public attention - and some anger. The first, ‘the running tap’, saw him leave a tap running in the kitchen of a London gallery, to protest against water company Thames Water, and the second was the keying of cars, which he claimed was part of a creative process. At the time Mr McGowan said: 'I  do feel guilty about keying people's cars but if I don't do it, someone else will. 'They should feel glad that they've been involved.' He also pushed a pig to the doors of Number 10 on his hands and knees in protest at NHS reforms, pulled a bus with his big toe and ate a corgi to protest at the Royal treatment of animals.

It is against the law to run non-skill games for . money without a gambling licence – raising the extraordinary prospect of . producers being jailed if they defy the warning. Last night, one legal expert . said that in order to comply with a licence, Deal Or No Deal could be forced to . move to a time slot after the 9pm watershed, it could also face tight . restrictions on the type of advertising allowed to be sold in the commercial . breaks and the amount of pre-broadcast publicity it could receive.

As boxes . are opened, contestants decide whether to accept a cash offer from the . mysterious Banker, or play on in the hope of increasing the offer, while . running the risk of receiving a much lower prize. However, a Government source . told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Gambling Commission does not seem to think that . there is any skill element to the show. ‘Even though at the beginning of the . show, contestants do not have to stake any of their own money, the argument is . that once they’ve picked a box, which could contain a lot of cash, in . subsequent rounds they are in effect gambling with their own money,’ Separately, the Commission is also understood to have raised issues over Red Or . Black?, where contestants win £1 million on the spin of a wheel. The Commission . has told the programme makers that the participants need to show more skill in . winning the top prize to escape the need for a gaming licence – which would . mean the end of the crucial roulette wheel. Regulators are also said to be . concerned about the way the show ‘glamorises’ gambling. ITV's Red Or Black?, the £1 million a-night game show presented by Ant and Dec, and developed by Simon Cowell, is also understood to have been hit by the investigation . The Mail on Sunday also . understands that ITV is shelving plans to bring back the popular Eighties quiz . show Play Your Cards Right, in which prizes are determined on the turn of a . card, for the same reason. Last night the move was met with bewilderment among . game show bosses, who argue that rules created to control casinos and illegal . betting should not be applied to entertainment programmes. ITV's Red Or Black? was developed by Simon Cowell . One senior . broadcasting source, who has been fighting the probe behind the scenes, said: . ‘This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs. ‘The Gambling Commission . has no right to be poking its nose into what are harmless television . programmes. 'How can anyone regard Deal Or No Deal as gambling? 'It is probably . the most innocent show on television. I think its very telling that this . programme is aired in 30 different countries but only in Britain has this . become an issue. ‘You also have to look it from the point of broadcaster. They . are already heavily regulated by Ofcom. Why on earth would they want to also . come under the control of the Gambling Commission as well? 'That means they . would be answerable to two different regulators who would be looking into its . affairs. The people who make Deal Or No Deal want to operate as a television . production company not a casino.’ Simon Cowell’s spokesman, Max Clifford, said: . ‘Simon wants to come up with the most exciting combination he can which remains . within the rules. His view is that it is a light entertainment programme with a . gambling element – not what the Commission is claiming.’ As well as . restrictions on scheduling, advertising and trailers, any TV company whose . shows fell under gambling rules would also need to prove to the Commission that . its executives had an understanding of the complex laws and regulations . surrounding the betting industry. This could force them to team up with a . gambling company in order to employ the relevant expertise. The expert said: . ‘The gambling industry is the most stringently regulated industry in the UK . because of the capacity for high level organised crime. ‘The Gambling . Commission wants to make sure these shows are not enticing people to go out and . gamble recklessly, and some programmes may fall into this category in their . current format. Red Or Black? was launched in a blaze of publicity by ITV and Simon Cowell’s SycoTV production company last September. With a £15million budget it was the most expensive game show ever devised – and producers assumed it would be a ratings smash. However, it struggled to find an audience and, five months on there are doubts whether the show will ever return to the screen. Producers are understood to be locked in talks with the Gambling Commission about whether the show can return in its existing format or whether it needs to be revamped. One suggestion is that the show’s roulette wheel, which decides whether contestants leave as millionaires, may not return. The row over gambling is the latest controversy to hit the show, which was devised by Cowell personally. Last year, it emerged that Nathan Hageman, the winner of the show’s first £1 million prize, had a conviction for assaulting a woman, sparking demands for the prize to be withdrawn. Three other contestants were subsequently pulled out of show and at least one of these had a criminal record. Cowell had hope the show would replicate the success of his other programmes including Britain’s Got Talent and the X Factor. Its opening night audience of almost seven million was respectable, but did not come close to the ten million which had been predicted. Subsequent episodes would attract less than four million viewers. The show also controversially provided a showcase for some of Cowell’s music acts, including X Factor winner Leona Lewis. ITV has still yet to announce a second series but the broadcaster and Syco are in talks. Last night, ITV insisted that its return had not been delayed by the Gambling Commission. A spokesman said: ‘A decision will be made on a second series of Red Or Black? in due course.’ ‘If a TV company was unwilling to change the format then they . could be forced into a range of moves which would effectively kill off the show . altogether. ‘The problem is this is an extremely complex area that is in danger . of encroaching on harmless family entertainment. It will undoubtedly be a case . of compromise for the shows in question, but if the Commission aren’t careful, . we could see the end of several popular family game shows.’ A spokesman for the . Gambling Commission refused to comment, saying it never talks about . ‘individual’ cases. However, he confirmed that the Commission was about to . publish new guidance for television game shows. He said: ‘In the first . instance, we would contact the operator to discuss the situation, as compliance . is always preferable over enforcement action.’ The Commission, which was set up . as the independent regulator under the Gambling Act 2005, is required to . keeping crime out of gambling, ensure gambling is conducted fairly and openly . and protect children and vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by . gambling. The spokesman declined to say how much a television company would . have to pay for a gambling operating licence. However, based on a formula . linked to company turnover and published on the Commission’s website, a permit . would probably cost about £60,000 to apply for, with annual renewals costing . about £30,000. Dr Mark Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham . Trent University, said that, in his opinion, Deal Or No Deal, did involve . gambling. He said: ‘The bottom line is, contestants in the show are effectively . gambling. The show producers will say that the people on it are not putting up . any of their own money. But once they are on it, they have been given money and . it’s their money they are gambling on.’ Dr Griffiths said that a TV show that . had to operate with a gaming licence should be moved to a later slot in the . television schedules. ‘Gambling is an adult activity so it should go out after . the 9pm watershed in my view.’ Dr Griffiths added that he had been urging the . Gambling Commission to look into television game shows for some time, saying: . ‘For some years, there’s been a blurring between gambling and gaming. I am very . pleased they’re looking into this.’ Last night, a Channel 4 spokesman said: . ‘Channel 4 has been contacted by the Gambling Commission about the popular long . running series Deal Or No Deal. It would not be appropriate to comment further . at this time.’ A source at the channel added: ‘People are very worried. The . producers don’t want to be tarred with the gambling brush’. ITV refused to . comment.","ITV'S Red or Black? presented by Ant and Dec also hit by investigation .

"Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson has been indicted for reckless or negligent injury to a child  for allegedly beating one of his sons as punishment, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The 2012 NFL MVP reportedly admitted to police that he did give his son a 'whooping' last May with a switch - a term he used to describe a leafless tree branch - while the boy was visiting him in Houston. Peterson, 29, who was in Minnesota training with his team ahead of a game this Sunday, was deactivated from the roster after his indictment by a Texas grand jury went public, ESPN reported. Scroll down for video . Indicted: Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson, smiling in this booking photo, reportedly told police he gave his son a 'whooping' A grand jury indicted Vikings running back Adrian Peterson for reckless or negligent injury to a child, and a warrant was issued for his arrest . These pictures show the cuts and bruises on the four-year-old's arm that Peterson is said to have caused by using a leafless tree branch . During the incident, Peterson’s son had pushed another one of his children off of a motorbike video game, according to new details from CBS Houston. As punishment, Peterson grabbed the branch, removed the leaves and struck the child repeatedly. According to doctors, the beating resulted in numerous injuries to the boy, including cuts and bruises on his back, buttocks, legs and scrotum. Peterson then allegedly texted the boy's mother about the incident, saying that one wound in particular would make her 'mad at me about his leg. I got kinda good wit the tail end of the switch,' according to CBS. Peterson and actor Hugh Jackman speak on stage during the NFL Honors award show in New York in February . In further text messages, the football star said he 'felt bad after the fact when I notice the switch was wrapping around hitting i (sic) thigh' and that he “got him in nuts once I noticed. But I felt so bad, n I’m all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!' He also texted the boy's mother: 'Never do I go overboard! But all my kids will know, hey daddy has the biggie heart but don’t play no games when it comes to acting right.' The child offered police a different version of events, telling them Peterson hit him on the face and that he feared further punishment for talking to the authorities about what happened. Tyrese Ruffin, pictured above, died last October in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Peterson, who is his biological father, only learned about him two months earlier . He said that he had been hit by a belt and that 'there are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.' The boy also said that Peterson put leaves in his mouth when he was being hit with the switch while his pants were down and told his mother that his dad 'likes belts and switches' and 'has a whooping room.' Peterson's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, confirmed the indictment to Fox 26 in Houston, which originally broke the story. Hardin said Peterson is cooperating fully with investigators.The Montgomery County Sheriff's Department also confirmed the indictment and said it issued a warrant for Peterson's arrest on Friday. 'Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son,' according to Hardin's statement. 'He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas. Adrian has never hidden from what happened. He has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours.' The statement adds that Peterson 'deeply regrets the unintentional injury'. In fact, Peterson didn't think there was anything wrong with his actions when he was interviewed by police, telling them he only used 'whoopings' or spankings as a last result. When asked if some of the marks on the boy's body were from an extension cord, he said 'Oh, no, I’d never hit my child with an extension cord. I remember how it feels to get whooped with an extension cord. I’d never do that', CBS reported. After Peterson's four-year-old boy returned home to Minnesota, his mother took him to a doctor, who found a number of lacerations on this thighs, bruise-like marks on his lower back and buttocks and cuts on his hand. Joseph Patterson, the boyfriend of Tyrese's mother at the time of his death, is accused of second-degree murder. His trial is set for October . A police report obtained by a radio affiliate of CBS said the boy told the doctor that Peterson had hit him with a branch from a tree. A doctor describes some of the marks as open wounds and called it 'child abuse'. Another agreed and called the cuts 'extensive'. Peterson told investigators when they questioned him that he regarded the incident as a normal spanking and not excessive. A grand jury held in the summer had declined to charge him. A new one was impaneled in Montgomery County, Texas, and decided to pursue the indictment. In a statement, the Vikings said it was deactivating Peterson for this Sunday's home game against the New England Patriots. Peterson had plenty of fans and detractors on Twitter. Some thought what he did was nothing out of the ordinary. Others were less than kind. Another fan noted on Twitter that Peterson's image is featured on the tickets for the game this weekend, even though he won't be playing in it. The incident comes just 11 months after another son of Peterson's, Tyrese Ruffin, died in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after allegedly being beaten by the boyfriend of the child's mother. Peterson only learned about the two-year-old's existence two months before his death. Joseph Patterson faces charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault, and the trial is scheduled to begin next month. In July, Patterson pleaded not guilty to a second charge of assaulting Tyrese's mother  and holding her against her will for more than an hour. Peterson reportedly has had seven children, including Tyrese and the four-year-old. Erica Syion, a former dancer from Dallas and mother of one Peterson's kids,  said in October that her son knows of 'four other brothers and sisters' but the total number of children remains unclear.","Peterson beat the boy with a leafless tree branch as punishment for pushing another of his children off a motorbike video game and told investigators he considered it a routine spanking .

"Four men were yesterday sentenced to death by hanging for the gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus. An Indian court ruled the men should go to the gallows for the attack which left the 23-year-old woman with such severe internal injuries she died two weeks later. The judge said the ultimate punishment was needed as a ‘strong deterrent’ after a case that ‘shocked the conscience’ of a nation. Scroll down for video . Brought to justice: Akshay Singh Thakur (left), 28, and Pawan Gupta (right), 19, are among four men handed the death penalty in India for the gang rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in Delhi . Guilty: Vinay Sharma (left), 20, and Mukesh Kumar, 26, have also been ordered to the gallows over the attack . Noose: An Indian woman protestor demands the death penalty outside the court yesterday . The horrific attack last December led to violent protests across India and forced the country to confront its culture of violence against women, including introducing new laws to combat rape. After the death penalty was announced, the wail of one of the four killers, 20-year-old Vinay Sharma, filled the tiny courtroom in Delhi. Sharma, an assistant at a gym, then broke down in sobs and was dragged out of . the court, where police with riot gear had formed a barricade to keep . crowds back. The sentences were welcomed by the victim’s family and scores of people outside the court building in Delhi, who chanted ‘Justice,  justice’, as news of the punishment was relayed to them. Even children were seen holding drawings and placards of the men being hung by a noose. But legal experts warned it could be years before the four men exhaust the appeal process and are hanged. Some even doubt whether the men will ever be executed, as the vast majority of death penalties are commuted to life in prison. India’s Supreme Court has ruled the death penalty should be used only in ‘the rarest of rare cases’. Although more than 100 people are sentenced to death in India in most years, only two people – both terrorists – have been executed in the country since 2004. India is thought to have carried out around 50 executions since independence in 1947, although  there are 477 people on death row. Supporters: Demonstrators hold a placard outside a court in New Delhi as her killers are sentenced to death . The sentencing was the climax of a seven-month trial, often held behind closed doors, that was punctuated dramatically by a fifth defendant, aged 33, hanging himself in his jail cell. A sixth, who was under 18 at the time of the attack, was earlier sentenced to three years detention, the maximum allowed under juvenile law. Prosecutors had called for the ‘harshest punishment’ to be given to Sharma, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and unemployed Mukesh Singh, in his early 20s, to signal that such attacks cannot be tolerated. The victim, who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus, became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country where a rape is reported on average every 21 minutes and cases of molestation are common. The . woman, who came from a lower-middle class family and worked in a call . centre while she studied, can not be named for legal reasons, but Indian . media have dubbed her Nirbhaya, a Hindi word meaning fearless. The defendants lived on the bottom rungs of India’s booming economy. Nearly all came from families that had moved to Delhi in recent years from desperately poor villages, hoping to find jobs in the capital. Judge Yogesh Khanna said: ‘These are the times when gruesome crimes against women have become rampant, and courts cannot turn a blind eye to the need to send a strong deterrent message to the perpetrators of such crimes.’ Demanding justice: Demonstrators have come out in force since the horrific fatal gang rape in December of a student on a bus. Four men have been sentenced to death, but their punishment has done little to act as a deterrence for the rapist of a four-year-old on a bus near Mumbai . The victim’s mother, who cannot be named under Indian laws guarding her daughter’s identity even after death, said: ‘Today we can breathe a little easier. I hope the conviction will deter people from committing such crimes in future.’ Defence lawyers had urged the court to ignore what they said was popular and political pressure for the harshest penalty. 'This . is not the victory of truth. But it is the defeat of justice,' defence . lawyer A.P. Singh shouted at the judge when the sentence was read out. 'The judge has taken the decision under political pressure without considering facts,' he told reporters later. Joyous: Cheers went up outside the Delhi court when lawyers rushed out to announce the death sentence . The . country's interior minister, Sushilkumar Shinde, denied that there had . been any political interference, telling a TV news channel: 'No judicial . authority can be influenced by the government.' The . sentencing capped a seven-month trial, often held behind closed doors, . that was punctuated dramatically by a fifth defendant hanging himself in . his jail cell. A . sixth, who was under 18 at the time of the attack, was earlier sentenced . to three years detention, the maximum allowed under juvenile law. In . November, India ended what many human rights groups had interpreted as . an undeclared moratorium on capital punishment when it executed a man . convicted for the 2008 militant attack on the city of Mumbai. Three months later, it hanged a Kashmiri separatist for a 2001 militant attack on parliament. 'In . the past year, India has made a full-scale retreat from its previous . principled rejection of the death penalty,' said Meenakshi Ganguly, . South Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Prosecutors . had called for the 'harshest punishment' to be given to Sharma, bus . cleaner Akshay Kumar Singh, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, and unemployed . Mukesh Singh for last December's murder to signal that such attacks . cannot be tolerated. The . four men were found guilty of luring the woman onto a bus, raping and . torturing her with a metal bar and then throwing her naked and bleeding . onto the road. She died two weeks later. Delighted: A prosecution lawyer displays a victory sign as he speaks to journalists after the sentencing . 'Everybody got the death penalty': Defense lawyer AP Singh (centre) speaks to the media after the case . Violent . protests exploded in several cities after the crime, a reaction . commentators and sociologists said reflected a deep well of frustration . that many urban Indians feel over what they see as weak governance and . poor leadership on social issues. The . government, seen as out of touch with the aspirations of the burgeoning . urban middle class, was caught off guard by the protests. The . case led to the introduction of tougher rape laws in March, and for the . first time open conversation about gender crime in television debates, . social media and even Bollywood. Still, . sex crimes remain commonplace in India, and social commentators say . patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a . decade of rapid economic growth. Awaiting their fate: Four men convicted of raping and murdering a female student on a Delhi bus are transported in a police vehicle to court, where they were each handed the death penalty . On death row: The men were ordered to the gallows over the brutal attack in December that triggered angry protests and widespread calls for the execution of her attackers . Comments . on social media websites and elsewhere ahead of the sentencing . suggested that popular opinion favoured executing the men, although a . survey by CNN-IBN-The Hindu newspaper in July showed Indians were . divided on the merits of capital punishment. Although . the Supreme Court ruled in the 1980s that the death penalty should be . imposed only in the 'rarest of rare' cases, opponents say the reality is . quite different. Indian courts sentenced 1,455 prisoners to death between 2001 and 2011, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. There . are 477 people on death row. Many have been there for years. Horrific: The woman, a 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist, and a male friend were lured onto a bus by five men and a teenager then repeatedly raped and tortured . No mercy: People stand in a queue for a security check outside the court, where the judge rejected pleas by the defendants for a lighter sentence . Human . rights groups have been alarmed, however, by the vigour with which . President Pranab Mukherjee, who took office in July 2012, has acted in . clearing the backlog of clemency pleas. He has rejected 11, confirming . the death penalty for 17 people. Some . women's rights groups and legal experts had opposed executing the Delhi . attackers. Others have invoked the Gandhian principle that 'an eye for . an eye makes the whole world blind'. 'Sending . these four men to the gallows will accomplish nothing except short-term . revenge,' Tara Rao, director of Amnesty International India said in a . statement. 'While the . widespread anger over this case is understandable, authorities must . avoid using the death penalty as a 'quick-fix' solution. There is no . evidence that the death penalty is a particular deterrent to crime, and . its use will not eradicate violence against women in India.'","Student, 23, died after being gang-raped by six men on bus in New Delhi .

"Adam Gemili lined up in the 100 metres final at the Commonwealth Games, shook his shoulders and threw the crowd his trademark beaming smile, in the middle of a row of bulging biceps and straining sinews. The camera panned to his right where the towering Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole, standing a head taller than Gemili at 6ft 4in, clapped his hands and pointed to the name on his stomach. Next along was Jason Livermore, another Jamaican with a chest like a Greek god. In a field of raw muscle — poised to create an explosion of power — the British sprinter looked, well, small at 5ft 11in. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Adam Gemili talks about what it takes to be a sprinter . Adam Gemili won two Commonwealth silver medals and two European Championship golds this summer . ‘No Abs Adam is one of my nicknames among the British athletes,’ Gemili jokes, as we discuss his successful summer which saw him win two Commonwealth sprint silver medals and two European Championship golds. ‘It was an in-house joke with my training group and then others started making comments. We started training in hot countries and everyone takes their tops off, or on the physio beds, you start to notice who has abs and who hasn’t. Some of the GB guys who sprint — Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Dwain Chambers, James Dasaolu, Richard Kilty — they’re ripped and I’m not, really.’ During the photoshoot preceding this interview, Gemili messes around by pulling the skin tight around his stomach. And in an Instagram account video that Gemili posted to show him taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association, he drew on abdominal muscles with a marker pen before pouring the freezing water over himself. Does it bother him that his fellow sprinters are often much bigger? ‘They are beasts,’ he admits. ‘For some people their size can matter a lot. I could very well get on the start line, look at the other guys and think, “Oh my god. They’re much bigger and more powerful than me”. But I’m able to move my body the speed that I move it being this size and I think as I get older I’ll get bigger and stronger — maybe not as big as these guys are naturally, but I’ll be able to run quicker. ‘Physically, I’m not a stereotypical sprinter. I’m not big with biceps bulging everywhere.’ Kemar Bailey-Cole of Jamaica (middle) wins 100m gold ahead of Adam Gemili at the Commonwealth Games . Adam Gemili stands alongside Usain Bolt on the medal podium for the 4x100m relay at Hampden Park . What Gemili does possess, however, is a glorious technique, one which he is still honing in the pursuit of sprint glory. He burst on to the sprinting scene just before London 2012 by winning the World Junior Championship 100m, but it is the 200m where he is now progressing at a faster rate. Gemili became only the second British sprinter to run under 20 seconds when he recorded 19.98 in the 2013 Moscow World Championships semi-finals and he now has in his sights John Regis’s 19.87, the British record set 20 years ago. Sprint legend Michael Johnson, the former 200m world record holder, described Gemili’s technique as ‘phenomenal’ and ‘almost perfect’ when he was just 18. Three years on and the Briton at times mirrors Johnson’s upright style, straight back and legs pumping rapidly. ‘As a sprinter there are a couple of different types of ways to run,’ Gemili explains. ‘My natural endurance comes from football. I’m not the biggest of guys and I haven’t got the biggest stride length, but my turnover is good so I can keep my legs moving and that’s how I run. ‘That’s how Michael Johnson ran. He was very relaxed and kept his legs turning over. He’s got a unique style. I try to get myself tall, it’s what you’re meant to do. If people are comparing me to Michael Johnson that’s not a bad comparison to have. I don’t mind that at all.’ Adam Gemili celebrates winning 200m gold at the European Athletics Championships . Britain's Adam Gemili crosses the finish line ahead of Germany's Lucas Jakubczyk in the 4x100m relay . Gemili still has a long way to go before surpassing the American’s previous world record of 19.32 and even further to get within touching distance of current champion Usain Bolt’s 19.19. Yet spectators often forget he is still only 21 and sprinters do not usually reach their peak until at least their mid-20s. The two European Championship golds in Zurich — in the 200m, where he matched his personal best, and 4x100m relay — and Commonwealth silvers in the 100m and 4x100m relay in Glasgow, are stepping stones on that path. Gemili adds: ‘When I ran 19.98 at the European Championships it was cold, 10 o’clock at night, into a minus 1.6 wind. All in all, if you flip that wind around and make it a nice sunny day, I can see that time being a tenth of a second or more quicker.’ That is still, in sprinting terms, light years away from Bolt’s world record but, although Gemili may lack the abs, he certainly does not lack the confidence to be a world-class sprinter. ‘If you never think you can reach those levels, you shouldn’t be a sprinter,’ he says. ‘If you come to the sport thinking you’ll never run near to those times, why are you bothering? You’ve got to have that belief. ‘Bolt is unique. There won’t be anyone like him for a long time, but he’s set the bar and it’s up to us to try to touch it. That’s what I’m doing, trying to stick to him as closely as I can, then maybe one day beat him. ‘He has been beaten. Justin Gatlin has beaten him, Tyson Gay has beaten him, Yohan Blake has beaten him. Everyone is human.’ But Gemili, who is funded partly by the National Lottery, will do it his way. In the sprint cauldron of muscle, tension, flexing, swaggering and testosterone, he is merely concentrating on himself. ‘In the off-season I’ve got to be more careful because if I even so much as look at a cake I put on a pound of fat,’ he says bursting into laughter. It is nice to know that some athletes suffer the same woes as the rest of us. As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week, National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities.

"Teenage heptathlon star Morgan Lake has pulled out of England’s team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, partly because her father is not allowed to stay in the athletes’ village. Lake’s father, Eldon, is also her coach and would therefore have been eligible for accreditation, but would have only been allowed day passes into the athletes’ village. Team England will provide chaperones for all athletes at the Games who are under 18 — including 13-year-old diver Victoria Vincent and weightlifter Rebekah Tiler, 15 — but there is no scope for parents or guardians to stay among the expected 6,500 athletes in the village. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Katarina Johnson-Thompson demonstrating her skills . Disgruntled: Teenage heptathlon star Morgan Lake has pulled out of England's team . Team: British heptathlon star Lake with her father and coach Eldon Lake . Lake, 17, has just finished her AS Level exams but has already broken Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s British junior heptathlon record. She is also second behind Johnson-Thompson on the Under 20s all-time list after scoring 6,081points in Gotzis, Austria last month. Lake’s preference this summer was to do the heptathlon at the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA and then the high jump in Glasgow, but British Athletics would not allow her to double up. She will now hope to be selected for Great Britain’s team at the World Juniors from July 22 to 27, — a single-sport, much smaller event than the Commonwealth Games. This would allow greater contact with her father and might also be a better option for her exciting long-term prospects. Star: Lake, 17, has already broken Katarina Johnson-Thompson's British junior heptathlon record . New home: The Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . But Lake cleared a high jump personal best of 1.93m in Loughborough in May, the second highest jump by a British athlete this year, and could yet earn her first senior international vest this year at the European Championships in Zurich next month. The reasons behind Lake’s withdrawal from the Commonwealths should enable England to call up another athlete to replace her and compete alongside Jessica Taylor and Johnson-Thompson, the favourite for gold, if required. Meanwhile, marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe has announced she will race competitively for the first time in more than two years as she targets one final attempt at the London Marathon on 2015. Foot surgery ruled Radcliffe, 40, out of the London Olympics, but she will run in the Worcester City 10k on September 21.

"The 'no makeup selfies' which have taken the internet by storm over the last two days are thought to have raised a staggering £2 million for charity. But while charities such as Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Cancer Research are delighted, some critics have slammed the campaign for making light of the deadly disease. On this morning's Today programme on Radio 4, student and blogger Yomi Adegoke, 22, said that while it was 'fantastic' that so much money had been raised, the campaign was flawed. Amy Willerton, left, and Yomi Adegoke, right, appeared on Radio 4's Today programme. Miss Willerton said it was a 'great way to promote awareness.' Miss Adeogoke said that while all the money raised was 'fantastic,' deeming barefaced selfies as courageous was wrong . 'I didn't agree with the campaign's original format, which was simply people writing, ""no makeup selfie"" without including donations or link to charities,' said Miss Adeogoke on the news and current affairs programme. 'I do think that in its current state, raising so much money, its been fantastic. 'But if women not wearing makeup is deemed as brave when held against cancer, it does say quite a bit about society today. 'I know the campaign was to normalise women not wearing makeup, but to suggest that by doing so is being exposing and leaving somebody vulnerable, that is problematic.' Anyone using social media over the last 48 hours can't fail to have noticed a flurry of snaps featuring women with no slap on. In fact the trend has taken Twitter and . Facebook by storm with thousands of females wiping off their makeup and . posting photos using the hash tag #NoMakeUpSelfie. Also speaking on the Today programme was model Amy Willerton, 21, who posted a barefaced selfie of herself in the bath. 'I didn't think twice about posting one of these pictures,' she told the programme. 'I just thought, ""Wow, what a great way to promote cancer awareness."" Amy Willerton's own barefaced selfie, taken in her bath. Miss Willerton defended the trend, saying that anything that promoted awareness and raised money for charity was a good idea . 'I took a selfie in the bath, posted it online and it got a lot of attention which is good. 'I don't feel I was particularly courageous doing it, but it's a good message to send out there. 'Women are exposing themselves and showing that more vulnerable side in the same way that we're all vulnerable to cancer.' Miss Adegoke, a law student at Warwick University, argued that promoting the act of not wearing makeup as courageous, was worrying. 'I . think that, in 2014, if its considered that ground-breaking that women . aren't wearing makeup, I don't really understand why,' she said. 'It's like you shave your head for cancer . or get in a tub of baked beans for cancer, you do something that's out of the . ordinary.' Everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on Twitter and Facebook. Dancer Felixy Splits says it's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can . Lisa Shepherd, left, posted her no makeup selfie to Facebook, as did Laura Peters on the right . Cancer Research UK, while not affiliated with the #nomakeupselfie hashtag, are supporting it . Deborah Ferguson (left) and Penny Stretton (right) posted no makeup selfies to raise awareness . Claire Louise Stanleick encourages friends on Facebook to donate with her makeup-free selfie . Though nobody seems to know where the idea came from, the rule seemed to be that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to do the same with all posting that the photos were to 'raise awareness of cancer'. After becoming aware of the flurry of selfies, Cancer Research sent out a tweet saying: 'We’re loving your #cancerawareness #nomakeupselfie pics! The campaign isn’t ours but every £ helps #beatcancersooner.' Cancer Research says so far it has raised £2million. Those posting the selfies or nominating others to do so are texting the word BEAT to 70099 TO DONATE £3. Carolan Davidge, director of communications at Cancer Research UK said, 'The #nomakeupselfie Twitter trend isn’t something Cancer Research UK started – but it’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family. Sisters Natalie Kirby, left and Joanne Kirby, far right, posed makeup free. Joanne's daughter Charlotte also put in her support. 'If people would like to choose to support our work to beat cancer sooner, they can visit www.cruk.org.' It's not known where or how the trend for using a no makeup selfie started this time around although last week author Laura Lippman caused an online storm with a similar campaign in support of actress Kim Novak and her appearance at the Oscars. Now, following this new viral selfie campaign the Facebook group No Make Up Selfie For Cancer Awareness has more than 153,690 likes and hundreds of photo uploads. Cancer . survivor Deborah Ferguson from Liverpool submitted her photo to the . Facebook group and agreed to have it published on MailOnline. She . said: 'Can I campaign on behalf of all neglected boobies please? Give . them a check,  I did that's why I have such a big smile as am a survivor.' Another participant., Abigail Spillman said: 'I think it is a fantastic way to raise awareness. Its only been going on since yesterday and already it is trending worldwide. 'Along with a #nomakeupselfie and a small donation (if you wish) is a massive help. Well done on using Facebook and Twitter for putting it to good use!' Sophie Williams, who works for a PR firm, told MailOnline she posted her #nomakeupselfie and promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK. Dancer Felixy Splits posted a fresh . faced pic, and told MailOnline: 'Everyone knows someone who has suffered . from this awful disease. 'It's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can. Make a difference and do something positive today.' Katie Weirwas nominated by her friend and by doing so she donated £5 to the charity . Katie Weir of Freya Lingerie also joined in. She told MailOnline: 'Through the recent nomination trend on Facebook it is easy to see the power of social media and how quickly posts can go viral. 'It is fantastic to see young women embracing their makeup free faces to raise awareness of breast cancer. 'I was nominated by my friend and by doing so I donated £5 to the charity which I wouldn't have done if I hadn't seen the status!' Sophie Williams promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK . Social media users have taken the internet by storm posting no-makeup selfies . And now the Fellas of Facebook and . Twitter have decided they too want to get their mugs in on the action . and a flurry of selfies featuring men in makeup have started appearing . online. Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her 12-year-old little brother Zach in full makeup. She . wrote: '[He] decided to put the makeup on as us girls are taking it of . all to help cancer awareness, so proud of him to do this at such a young . age! Bless him lots of likes for this young man people xxx' Sean Lawson Bisset from Dunbar, East Lothian glammed up in support of the ladies who have been stripping their make-up back for charity . Stuart Laurie puckers up in Lippy and eye makeup and Raymond Galea also flutters a girly eyelash . Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her . 12-year-old brother  Zach, while .

Some of the fellas seem to have gone girly and cute, while others were maybe inspired by Halloween outfits when they got out the slap, but their efforts were all commendable. Meanwhile the #NoMakeUpSelfie shows no signs of dieing down just yet as women continue to strip back their look in the name of charity. Kath Abrahams, Director of Engagement and Income generation at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'We are delighted to . see the success of the no makeup selfie viral campaign. It is great to . see the British public getting behind the campaign and helping to raise . awareness of breast cancer. John-Hunter went the whole way with make-up, wig and dress .

"Unseen FBI interviews have been released showing a newlywed confessing to pushing her husband of eight days off a cliff as they argued about her second thoughts about the marriage. Jordan Graham, from Montana, told an FBI agent what really happened on top of of a cliff in Glacier National Park after days of lying. She admitted second degree murder last week. 'He . went to grab my arm and my jacket and I said no, I said I'm not going . to let this happen this time, I'm going to defend myself. So I let go . and I pushed and he went over and then I took off and went home,' she . said in the FBI recording. Graham, . 22, said she decided to talk to Johnson, 25, about her unhappiness . eight days after their wedding. So on the evening of July 7, just about . sunset, the couple went to a popular spot in Glacier Park called The . Loop. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . First story: Two days after Cody Johnson went missing, his wife Jordan Graham told police that he went on a joyride with friends from out of town . New lead: The next day, she went to the police station with her mom and told them about a fake email from a person named 'Tony' that she received, when really she created the account herself . They went over a . retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky, . steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred . feet to a ravine. There, facing the void, she told . Johnson that she wasn't really happy and that she was not feeling like . she believed she ought to after being married, she said. They argued. It escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him. That's when she became angry, she said. 'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.' She . said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one . hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over. It wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an extreme disregard' for life. Hearing her words back: More than a week after her husband died, Jordan Graham was interviewed by FBI officers and she is heard on tape saying that she 'pushed him and took off' Afterward, she ran back to where the car was parked. She had the keys in her pocket. She . drove back home to Kalispell, about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to friends on the drive back - but told nobody . what had just happened. 'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said. On Thursday, Graham, 22, changed her . initial not guilty plea and admitted that she did push her husband to . his death, accepting a lesser second degree sentence. Before . tragedy: Graham is pictured with 25-year-old Cody Johnson, whom she . married in June. Johnson's mother testified in the trial that her son . had been excited to marry Graham . Cutting a deal: Graham and her attorneys surprised prosecutors by agreeing to the plea deal of second degree murder after just four days of the trial . The . prosecution was planning on showing the taped interviews with the court . room but since she accepted the plea, the jurors did not have to . consider the evidence. Graham had initially told police officers that her new husband had gone out of town. 'He . was going to go for a ride with some of his out of town buddies that . were visiting,' she told police while being interviewed wearing a bright . yellow dress. 'I don't know anything more.' That . really wasn't the case, as she came back to talk to police again the . next day after reportedly receiving an email from a mysterious man named . Tony telling her not to drop the investigation. Police later determined that the email address was created on her step father's computer. Before closing arguments were about to begin, the attorneys for both sides announced the surprise agreement: Graham would plead guilty to second-degree murder, and prosecutors would drop the first-degree murder charge and the false statement charge. Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. She is scheduled to be sentenced on March 27.

"Nicola Ann 'Nicky' Morgan completed her rapid rise to the Cabinet this morning, replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary just four years after entering Parliament. The  41-year-old mother of one became an MP in 2010 - representing Loughborough in the East Midlands - and has risen rapidly despite sparking controversy over her outspoken opposition to gay marriage. She began her government career as a junior whip before becoming a Treasury minister in October last year. David Cameron also handed her the job of women's minister, attending Cabinet - a position she will keep as Education Secretary. Scroll down for video . Nick Morgan has backed every education reform introduced by Michael Gove and is an ally of the Chancellor George Osborne . The new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan arrived in Downing Street today. The high-flying mother of one only entered Parliament in 2010 . Mrs Morgan is a trustee of the Conservative Christian Fellowship and voted against same-sex marriage because of her faith. This is widely seen as the the reason Mr Cameron split the women and equalities brief last year - leading to accusations that she was the 'minister for straight women'. Mr Cameron today handed the equalities brief back to Mrs Morgan - but has asked the new junior education minister Nick Boles to look after gay marriage. Mrs Morgan voted against gay marriage in 2013 claiming it should be between 'a man and a woman’. She said: 'This is a very big social change. There have been plenty of little changes down the years but what’s never been changed is that the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman. 'I think that was one of the issues people, especially those who asked me to vote against, found hardest to accept and it also tied in with my own Christian faith too. 'I totally support civil partnerships and that same-sex relationships are recognised in law. But marriage, to me, is between a man and a woman.' Teachers' unions were delighted that Mr Cameron had sacked Michael Gove as Education Secretary - but Mrs Morgan is unlikely to water down any of his reforms . Teachers' unions were today celebrating Mrs Morgan's appointment as Education Secretary - but may be left disappointed if her voting record is anything to go by. She has strongly backed every single education reform pushed through by Mr Gove - backing free schools, academies and tuition fee increases. Mrs Morgan has also never attended state school herself - attending the exclusive £4,701-a-year Surbiton High School in south west London. Mrs Morgan went on to study law at Oxford before becoming a high flying city lawyer in 1996. Following the announcement, Mrs Morgan said she was delighted with her new role and pledged to work alongside parents, teachers and schools as Michael Gove's departure from the post was welcomed by unions. In her first statement, Ms Morgan said that education can be 'the single greatest transformer of lives' and was a crucial part of the Government's plans. 'I am delighted to become Education Secretary and continue as minister for women and equalities,' she said. 'I know that education can be the single greatest transformer of lives. It is also a crucial part of this Government's long-term plan. 'I look forward immensely to working alongside parents, teachers and schools to ensure we have world class schools and the skills that will get our young people great jobs.'","Nicola Ann Morgan is an Oxford educated mother of one and former lawyer .

"The great thing for Roma fans is that their manager Rudi Garcia hasn’t just found Francesca Brienza — he has found Jesus! Brienza, the Serie A club’s in-house TV presenter, in theory, should be out of bounds. But Roma’s French manager isn’t a great man for boundaries. En route to coaching Italy’s capital club on Champions League duty at Manchester City this week, he has been a TV presenter, a physio, a scout and you can also see footage of him on television playing guitar and singing. He sets his own rules and compares himself to Jose Mourinho. Roma manager Rudi Garcia is preparing to face Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday . Roma manager Rudi Garcia is an eccentric boss who keeps himself busy and is in the Champions League . Rudi Garcia was spotted out with Roma's in-house TV presenter Francesca Brienza earlier in the week . Francesca Brienza is a beautiful 28-year-old Roma TV presenter who was spotted at a 'romantic' dinner . Francesca Brienza took a joint ‘selfie’ and published a unified message on Twitter with Rudi Garcia . No sooner was the 50-year-old in the door at Roma than he was causing ructions by banning those fans who turned up at the club’s Trigoria training ground. He got there, in summer 2013, to find that absolutely anyone who was at the training ground — media, youth prospects, parents, scouts, agents, ground staff and probably some of the club’s notorious Ultras — were milling around getting in the way of the 20-odd players who were supposed to be bringing back the glory days. If Roma’s strikers can hit the net with the same accuracy as Garcia used in booting their backsides out of what is now ‘his’ domain, then look out Serie A. So, to another part of his domain, Brienza. She is a beautiful 28-year-old Roma TV presenter. An Italian football newspaper thought they had a great splash when they snapped the coach and his club’s TV channel anchor at a romantic dinner together. But, by the morning the scoop was published, the wind was rather stylishly taken out of their sails by Garcia and Brienza taking a joint ‘selfie’ and publishing a unified message on Twitter. Francesca Brienza took to Twitter to explain how Rudi Garcia was very much a part of her 'private life' Roma coach Rudi Garcia walks on the field at the end of a Serie A soccer match between Roma and Cagliari . Roma coach Rudi Garcia calls out to his players during a Serie A soccer match between Roma and Cagliari . There was wit in taking the ‘we’re-a-couple-leave-us-alone’ photo at Rome’s world-famous Coliseum. When the Frenchman arrived at one of Europe’s great underachieving clubs, they had just lost the Coppa Italia a few weeks earlier to bitter city rivals Lazio. Such was the bucolic reaction that when he and his new squad were presented at the Stadio Olimpico, he was whistled and booed into office. ‘Rudi who?’ was the sentiment. But their rampaging 17-game unbeaten start to the Serie A season, the alluring football Roma played, the fact he convinced Daniele de Rossi not to join Manchester United and the fact that he and Roma icon Francesco Totti got on famously have all that led not only to acceptance, but reverence. However, Roma didn’t have the necessary strength in depth to cope with injuries and the rigours of a long chase after the Juventus machine. They finished second in the league and were knocked out of the cup by the winners, Rafa Benitez’s Napoli. Rudi Garcia, manager of Roma, gives instructions during a Serie A match on Friday in Italy . But Rudi has a dream and it involves Jesus — Jorge Jesus, that is, manager of Benfica. The Lisbon giants were second in the Portuguese league, beaten finalists in the Europa League and beaten in their national cup final two seasons ago. But they stormed back the next year to win the title, the cup and reached the Europa League Final once again. ‘Benfica has to be our model — we have a stronger squad now and we can also go one step further,’ declared Garcia. This was his message to fans, players and media alike at the beginning of this season. Also, presumably, to owner James Pallotta — net worth over €1bn and managing director of Boston fund managers Raptor Group — given that there were new contracts for Miralem Pjanic and the now prolific Gervinho, plus the acquisition of several new signings including Seydou Keita, Ashley Cole, Kostas Manolas and Juan Manuel Iturbe. Little wonder spirits are high after another thunderous winning start to the season, including going joint top of Serie A and that 5-1 thrashing of CSKA Moscow in the first Champions League group match. Keita, already a winner of this competition with Barcelona, reckons: ‘I’ve come into a great squad and a unified dressing room. Rudi Garcia reminds me of Pep Guardiola. He wants us to dominate via possession. They have the same credo — results need to stem from good football.’ Roma's head coach Rudi Garcia will be at the Etihad on Tuesday to face Manchester City . ‘Benfica (and their manager Jorge Jesus) has to be our model,' says Serie A's Roma boss Rudi Garcia .","This week, Rudi Garcia has been a TV presenter, a physio, a scout and you can also see footage of him on television playing guitar and singing .

"Britt Assombalonga has a list of 20-goal-a-season strikers from which he picks one at random and watches videos of them before every game. It includes Radamel Falcao, Jermain Defoe, Diego Costa, Thierry Henry and Fernando Torres. Viewing highlights of these stars on YouTube is clearly rubbing off on the 21-year-old Nottingham Forest forward who is setting the Championship alight this season, sitting top of the scoring charts with eight goals in eight games. ‘Before every game I watch videos of different strikers and try to pick up different things from all of them,’ says Assombalonga, who was born in Zaire but moved to London aged eight months. Britt Assombalonga has proven he is more than capable of scoring goals in the Championship . Forest striker Assombalonga, pictured scoring against Fulham at the City Ground, has been in fine form . Assombalonga has revealed he takes inspiration from the likes of Radamel Falcao and Thierry Henry . ‘I go on YouTube and pick a name at random and watch it. I’ve got quite a few on the list, strikers that score over 20 goals a season. Thierry Henry is probably one of my favourites with Jermain Defoe. Fernando Torres when he was at Liverpool.’ It is testament to Millwall’s defence that they kept the burly, bustling forward at bay for the whole of Saturday’s goalless draw. That was the first time Forest had failed to score in 10 games this season, although the point kept Stuart Pearce’s side unbeaten and top of the league. Chesterfield striker Eoin Doyle continued his scoring run but failed to net three consecutive hat-tricks for the first time since Liverpool’s Jack Balmer in 1946. Doyle could only manage one against Doncaster. Leeds continued their unbeaten run under caretaker manager Neil Redfearn with a 3-0 victory against Huddersfield. Redfearn, however, missed out on the top job. with Darko Milanic taking over. Accrington Stanley won 5-4 against Northampton in John Coleman’s first game in his second spell in charge at the club. They now have three victories in four games. Assombalonga, whose father Fedor was an international for Zaire (now DR Congo), gave centre back Alan Dunne a fierce shove in the fourth minute to let the Millwall captain know he was there. The pair were pulling and jostling each other all game and Dunne, 32, played the young hopeful well. Forest manager Pearce pointed out afterwards that Assombalonga still has much to learn. ‘With young players expectation goes through the roof very quickly and we have to make it clear he is a young man who’s learning the game,’ said Pearce. ‘I sat with him after the match and said, “Look, tactically you might have had to go and play on the other centre half.” Dunne, I think, played him very well. I use the example of Ian Wright, who was very clever when he played up front for Arsenal and Crystal Palace. He looked at the two central defenders and said, “Well, I might not play against you, Des Walker, because you can run as quick as me, but I’m coming over there to play against you because you’re a bit of a donkey.” Ian Holloway's Millwall managed to keep the Championship's top scorer at bay on Saturday . ‘Britt has got to learn those nuances of football, but he has such an attitude to want to learn, and want to work for the team, it’s fantastic.’ MK Dons 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli celebrated signing a new three-year deal by netting a hat-trick in his side’s 6-1 mauling of Crewe. Alli, who was subject of a £3.5million bid from Liverpool in the summer, is fast developing a reputation as one of brightest young English talents and has six goals in 10 games this season. A true test of that ability will come when he faces Tottenham in the League Cup third round on Wednesday. There is a hunger to Assombalonga’s style. He is constantly on the shoulder of the last man, or making forays out wide when space opens up. He charges down defenders on the ball, hassles and hustles for the full 90 minutes. As soon as there is a stoppage he is alert, on his toes, seeking space, moving a few yards clear of the nearest defender. It will not be a poor work ethic which stops Assombalonga reaching his target of the Premier League. Training-ground sources tell Sportsmail that he is always the first out and one of the last to leave. Assombalonga sealed a £5million move from Peterborough to Nottingham Forest in the summer . They explain that he is enjoying the attention, following his club-record £5million move from Peterborough in the summer, but he is still very grounded. That is partly down to his modest rise, only joining Watford’s academy at 17 and spending loan spells at non-League and lower-League sides. Even after drawing a blank against Millwall, it is Assombalonga’s name called out by a group of young fans as the Forest squad warm down. He jogs over to sign autographs and pose for photographs. No wonder, Assombalonga is fast developing an impressive highlights reel of his own.","The Forest striker has drawn up a list of 20-goal-a-season strikers who he chooses at random to study .

He would have to have some very strong motivation to leave the area.' Rusty hasn't been long at the zoo, having arrived from Lincoln, Nebraska, in late April. He has only been on exhibit for about three weeks. The zoo is planning to breed Rusty with its female red panda, Shama. Before he fled, the animal hadn't been seen at 6 p.m. Sunday. Staff thought he may have braved 'hot wires' to escape his enclosure and would be hiding somewhere inside the zoo. They feared, however, that he could be sick or may even have died somewhere . on the grounds his handlers said his appetite had waned in recent days. Officials were also looking into the possibility that the exotic animal was stolen. Missing: Rusty the red panda, pictured, disappeared from his enclosure at the Smithsonian National zoo overnight . Baker-Masson had insisted the animal wasn't dangerous to the public. 'This animal is not dangerous to any human,' Baker-Masson said. 'He is vaccinated.' But they said that while being friendly and mild-manners, Rusty, who has thick reddish fur and a long tail ringed with white circles, 'will bite if cornered or scared.'","Rusty the red panda disappeared from his enclosure at the Smithsonian National zoo overnight .

"Scott Quigg has responded to new IBF super-bantamweight champion Carl Frampton's challenge by insisting he would relish the chance to settle their rivalry. The unbeaten British pair have been constantly linked with a domestic dust-up as their professional careers have continued to soar in the last few years. Frampton (19-0, 13KOs) raised the stakes over the weekend by defeating Kiko Martinez in his home city of Belfast to take the Spaniard's world title before saying the 'only man' he wants to take on next is Quigg. Bring it on: Scott Quigg has called for an all-British showdown with Carl Frampton . Impressive: Quigg retained his WBA super-bantamweight title for the third time by beating Munyai . The WBA's regular champion will defend his title against late replacement Stephane Jamoye in Manchester on Saturday and should he come through that test as expected, Quigg is keen to take on Frampton in a unification bout, adding he would be happy to face the Northern Irishman in his own backyard if it is the best venue. 'I was pleased to see Carl win the title on Saturday and now it makes perfect sense for us to fight,' said the Bury fighter. 'I'll fight him in Belfast, no problem - but 9,000 in Belfast versus 20,000 in Manchester, it makes more sense to do it there. But if they can find somewhere in Belfast with 20,000 then I can go there, I don't care. I don't care! Quigg insists he will fight Frampton in his own back yard at Belfast if he has to . Fist things first: The reigning WBA champion must first fight challenger Stephane Jamoye on Saturday . 'It's one of the biggest fights in British boxing, it's that big, everyone has an opinion. 'We both think we can win so there's no reason why we shouldn't fight - and I know that I will come out with both belts.' One sticking point to the bout taking place in the next few months is Frampton has to face the IBF's mandatory challenger Chris Avalos next, meaning an all-British showdown may have to be put on the backburner for the time being. Quigg's immediate focus is Jamoye, who came in as a late replacement for Paulus Ambunda. Jamoye has lost two of his last three fights, which included a ninth-round stoppage defeat to Shinsuke Yamanaka for the WBC bantamweight title, but Quigg (28-0-2, 21KOs) is refusing to look past the Belgian with more lucrative fights in the pipeline. Impressive: Carl Frampton saw off world champion Kiko Martinez to secure the IBF super-bantamweight  title . Solid: Frampton lands an impressive punch on Martinez during the fight in Belfast . 'Jamoye is a very good fighter,' he said. 'He's only 24 but he's been around at a good level for a long time. 'He's boxed for a world title in Japan, he is prepared to travel and travels well, he comes forward and he's got some good names on his CV. He has fallen short at the top level but he would have gained experience from that and will have learned from it. 'To have a late change of opponent again is a shame. We approached nearly every fighter in the division so I give Jamoye plenty of respect for stepping up. 'Boxing always throws up surprises and you have to expect the unexpected, so as long as I am 100 per cent ready, focused and sharp, all I have to do is take care of the guy in the opposite corner, that's the only thing on my mind.'","Quigg admits he would love to fight against rival Carl Frampton .

"Floyd Mayweather has revealed that his rematch with Marcos Maidana could be one of the final times fans can see him in the ring - after announcing his plan to retire in 2015. The 37-year-old stated ahead of the bout that he sees himself fighting twice more - against 'exciting' opponents - next year before hanging up his gloves for good. With a split-decision victory in the original fight against Maidana in May, the American extended his undefeated professional record to 46 bouts.

Popular: Floyd Mayweather (centre) stands on stage and answers questions from the huge volume of press who crowded into the MGM Grand Hotel on Tuesday . And, in the press conference on Tuesday ahead of the rematch, Mayweather said: 'I only got two more fights left (after Maidana) and after the next two fights I just want to build the Mayweather Promotions brand. 'As of right now, my focus is on Maidana. I can't focus on the other two fights after that. I have to focus on Maidana. 'After that we can't say who the next two are going to be but I'm pretty sure the next two will be exciting fights.' Despite insisting he is planning two 'exciting' bouts for 2015, Mayweather refused to be drawn on speculation that the much-anticipated Manny Pacquiao-Mayweather superfight could happen. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum had suggested there were on-going talks between the camps but Mayweather watered down the speculation. He also suggested Arum was merely trying to promote Pacquiao's upcoming fight with Chris Algieri, which takes place on November 22.

When asked about the possibility, Mayweather responded: 'Not true. I can't say what the future holds. 'But Arum and Pacquiao are trying to sell tickets for the (bout with the) guy named Algieri. Trying to sell tickets for that fight.' In the short-term, however, Mayweather is focusing all his attention on beating his dangerous Argentinian opponent Maidana for a second time. The first bout saw Mayweather win on a split decision - with the judges scoring the fight 116-112, 117-111 and 114-114 - but Maidana has an impressive record himself. With 35 victories and just three losses in 38 professional match-ups, the 31-year-old poses a serious threat to Mayweather's unbeaten record and could scupper his plans for two final bouts before he signs off next year.

"Actress Emilia Clarke has been dragged into Russian politics after her picture was used to make a shock 'anti-rape' message by a Vladimir Putin mayoral candidate. The 26-year-old British star's image appears on a campaign advert in the industrial city of Yekaterinburg backing United Russia politician Yakov Silin. The sham online promotion identifies her as a local woman called Anya, 24, but the picture has been used without the permission of Game of Thrones actress. Misuse: British actress Emilia Clarke shot to fame from her role in HBO's hit series Game of Thrones . Politics: The sham online promotion identifies Emilia Clarke as a local woman called Anya, 24, but the picture has been used without the permission of Game of Thrones actress . 'Her' message on behalf of the Putin candidate states: 'I suddenly noticed that for the last couple of years I'm not afraid to walk at night in Yekaterinburg. 'I now have confidence that the city is safe, that no-one will attack me or rape me. 'It's so cool ... There are only few people on the streets, the streets have lights, the city is fresh and incredibly beautiful. Especially after it has been raining.' The makers of the advertisement admitted that the London-born actress - with credits including Triassic Attack, Spike Island, Shackled, Dom Hemingway, The Garden of Last Days, and Rosaline - had no knowledge of her photograph being used in the election campaign. Russian web users instantly noticed that the advertisement was a sham, and that Anya was the famous 'English rose' actress whose image was being used to promote a safe city message about the Urals industrial conurbation. They bombarded the site with sarcastic messages over the ploy in Russia's fourth largest city. Campaign: United Russia politician Yakov, 54, served in the Soviet army for 13 years. A Putin loyalist, he held in a number of positions in Sverdlovsk region - where he is now vice-governor - and the city of Yekaterinburg . One comment said: 'If you invent Anya, don't be so lazy and dig deeper in the photo-banks or Yandex (a Russian search engine) for some unknown actresses.' Star: Emilia Clarke is pictured here at a Game of Thrones premiere in Hollywood, California, in March . A blogger said: 'The fact is that in the first ten pages of Google picture search while looking for “beautiful young girl”, “beautiful girls” or “young beauties” certainly gives a lot of photos of Emilia Clarke and Selena Gomez. ‘But United Russia's PR people at least know who Selena Gomez is.' The unnamed authors of the campaign admitted of the stunt: 'We selected a famous and beautiful actress on purpose, to make it clear that this is a fantasy.' The administrator added: 'Next time we will write more clearly. Sorry.' They also claimed: 'Our internet post which was a fantasy with a photo of Emilia Clarke, famous for the TV series Game of Thrones, has caused a strange resonance.' And they insisted: 'We assure you, Daenerys Targaryen (a character played by Clarke), in this case is just a beautiful woman. ‘We don't claim that we have her support, even though we would not be ashamed to show her Yekaterinburg after implementation of the “Capital” programme.' This programme is the political campaign of would-be mayor Mr Silin, 54. His foe for mayor, Yevgeny Roizman, claims the 'black PR' of his rival shows his spin doctors think they are 'dealing with idiots' in the city. Mr Silin is not believed to have commented on the Clarke advertisement which appeared on a site backing his campaign. Mr Silin served in the Soviet army for 13 years.

"Many years ago, when major football clubs travelled by train, a London team set off on the long journey from Kings Cross to Newcastle. They observed the usual routine: they glanced at the back pages, played a few hands of cards and stared out of the window at the passing fields. A friend of mine, a new signing, tried to prompt a conversation with some of his colleagues. A General Election was imminent, and he wondered how they intended to vote. The answers were depressing. ‘Not so much “Don’t Know” as “Don’t Have A Bloody Clue”,’ he reported. ‘Not one of them had ever voted, or ever intended to vote. They didn’t know which party was standing, or what they stood for.’ Andy Murray, here after winning Olympic gold, came out in support of Scottish independence . In later years, he suspected that they had been telling him what he expected to hear, obeying the stereotype which insisted that sportsmen understand sport, but don’t trouble them with issues like life, death or politics. Yet he was taken in by the dim-witted image. And so was the rest of the country. That patronising attitude has softened over time, as sports people at large have become more confident, more articulate. But the cultural branding has never quite faded. As Andy Murray could testify. Murray had a view about Scottish independence. He was in favour. Now had he kept this view to himself, then all would have been well. But Murray, foolish fellow, tweeted his support for the Yes campaign. He went on to explain, in eminently reasonable terms: ‘It’s for the Scottish people to decide, and I trust them to make the right decision. I will support whatever the outcome is. Regardless of how it goes, I think it’s very important for everyone to come together and stick together afterwards.’ Too late; the damage had been done. For Murray had committed the prominent sportsman’s cardinal sin: he had expressed An Opinion. He had thereby defied that offensive orthodoxy which insists: ‘Stay safe, hold your tongue, keep your head down.’ Retribution was swift, fierce and furious. The standing army of online trolls erupted to order: ‘Traitor! … Ingrate! … Hypocrite!’ The abuse was raucous and predictably unoriginal. Then came the cheap derision, the ludicrous sneers: . Murray signs Scottish flags after returning to his hometown of Dunblane following his Olympic victory in 2012 . How could a man who lives in a £6 million Surrey mansion advocate Scotland leaving the United Kingdom? As if his view would have been more acceptable had the mansion been worth ‘only’ £3m? And how could somebody who has apparently earned £8m in the past year so lightly turn his back on the nation which nurtured his talent? Well, one imagines Murray is paying huge amounts of UK tax on those extraordinary earnings. And as for nurturing his talent, he is one of the most outstanding examples of a self-made athlete that modern sport has seen. He has given British tennis far more than he has ever received. No, the current, wholly artificial, uproar stems from the fact that Murray endorsed the Yes movement. Had he called for rejection of independence, then there would have been the merest minimum of fuss. But the fact that he thought the matter through, reached a conclusion, then made that conclusion public was deemed unforgiveable. He now realises that his views only count when they coincide with those of his betters. His candour has cost him dearly. In common with most people on this side of the border, I believe it was absolutely right that the Scots should have settled this matter for themselves. As it happens, I suspect that they reached the correct conclusion by their remarkable exercise in popular democracy. No matter. Murray disagrees, and his position was shared by 1,617,989 of his countrymen and women. Murray on court on the day he tweeted his support for Scottish independence. His countrymen voted 'No' We now hear that part of the price he must pay is that a section of the Wimbledon crowd may withhold its support for the first Briton — and British he remains — to win the men’s title since Fred Perry. One online sage, calling himself ‘Keith’, told the world: ‘I positively want the guy to be booed the minute he sets foot on court at Wimbledon.’ Cruel vengeance, thy name is Keith! And yet, daft as it sounds, there may well be some mutinous mumbling over the strawberries on Centre Court next summer. You see, being Scottish is a sin for which London SW19 has never quite forgiven the young man. I have no doubt he will cope with such disapproval, as he has coped with just about everything which has been thrown at him over the past decade and more. But the fear is that the fuss will make him cautious, that the next time he has something to say, prudent silence may win the day. We must hope not, because Andy Murray is a distinguished sportsman, with interesting things to say. We may not agree with his views, but they are honestly expressed and passionately held. And they deserve to be heard. Yorkshire's white rage misplaced . A week ago in this space, I commented on the contentious dismissal of Nottinghamshire’s Samit Patel by Jonny Bairstow of Yorkshire. Bairstow is a wonderfully enthusiastic, lavishly talented cricketer. But on this occasion, with Yorkshire working towards the victory which would deliver the County Championship, I felt that his action in waiting for Patel to lift his foot before whipping off the bails was within the laws yet outside the spirit of the game. The emails from Yorkshire have been pouring in all week: affronted, irate, indignant. ‘Clueless’, was the kindest comment. Others spoke of ‘a hidden agenda against the White Rose county’. One claimed: ‘We know you hate all things Yorkshire.’ A personal favourite was the chap who described himself as an umpire in ‘a Senior Premier League’ and declared, without a trace of self-awareness, that he had had ‘occasion to reprimand’ me in the past. Jonny Bairstow of Yorkshire stumps Nottingham's Samit Patel earlier this month . Now it should go without saying that I haven’t a scrap of anti-Yorkshire bias; indeed, after the dazzling experience of the Grand Depart of this year’s Tour de France, my admiration for the county is more fervent than ever. But I have watched, repeatedly, the tape of that dismissal and I still believe that Bairstow’s actions were misjudged and that he may come to regret them. Bairstow’s little fracas was followed by Andrew Gale, the Yorkshire captain, being charged with using racist and abusive language to Lancashire’s South African batsman Ashwell Prince in the Roses match on September 3. The allegation is under investigation and a hearing will take place on Tuesday. All in all, these events conspired to take the shine off Yorkshire’s achievement in becoming county champions. Those who really do ‘hate all things Yorkshire’ will rejoice in their misfortune. The rest of us will find it rather sad. Open and shut case for Troon to follow St Andrews . And so it came to pass that in the month of September, in the year of 2014, women were finally deemed worthy of membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. It was as if the members had drawn back the curtains, peered out of the window and remarked to their good lady: ‘Funny thing, m’dear. If I’m not mistaken, that looks remarkably like the 21st century.’ Naturally, the people running the R&A were at pains to promote the historic nature of the decision. And since a great many of their number have never really been reconciled to female suffrage, then so it was. Yet we must be fair; an endorsement of 85 per cent is a emphatic expression of intelligent values and the born-again radicals of St Andrews deserve credit. In fairness, the rest of the world will wonder why it took them 260 years to do something so blindingly obvious. Rory McIlroy had set out the enlightened view with the heartening clarity of youth. ‘It doesn’t matter if you are a man or woman, black or white, everyone should have equal opportunities to do anything they want; whether to join a golf club, or get a job,’ he said. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews voted to allow women to become members last week . And there can be no argument with his assertion. But things cannot end there. It is plainly unacceptable that St George’s, Muirfield and Troon — three courses on the rota for staging the Open Championship — persist in excluding women from membership. One of these, Troon, is scheduled to host the event in 2016. Quite clearly, after last week’s vote, such a prospect is inconceivable. If they cannot take the decent path — and they recently reiterated their opposition to civilised progress — then they must forfeit the prestige and financial benefits which The Open confers. It really isn’t a difficult decision. And in this momentous week for modern Scotland, they would be following an excellent example. P.S. By and large, football administrators do not care for footballers. They see them as greedy, grasping, grossly over-rewarded individuals. Privately, they complain that footballers earn such exorbitant sums that they have become hopelessly out of touch with ordinary people. Last week, it was revealed that the Brazilian FA distributed presents to 65 administrators during the World Cup. It was a discreet gesture, scarcely worth mentioning. So nobody did. For they knew that nothing’s too good for the ordinary people. Not even a £16,000 wrist watch.","Andy Murray came out in support of Scottish independence .

"A four-year-old boy has been filmed showing off his impressive snowboarding skills in the French Alps. Pint-sized boarder Garrik Arutyunov has been hitting the slopes for as long as he has been able to walk, first taking up the sport in his home town of Wenduine in Belgium. Encouraged by his Russian-born father Armen, who is himself an excellent snowboarder, Garrik now has the confidence to attempt jumps and tricks that even adult boarders would think twice about.

This weekend he was filmed snowboarding in the Alpine resort of Avoriaz . Joy: Garrik clearly loves snowboarding - giving his proud father high-fives whenever he performs a trick . Patience: Garrik began by learning the basics - standing on a board and building momentum. He later progressed to mastering speed control and the ability to make tight turns . The video footage shows Garrik snowboarding in the Alpine resort of Avoriaz on Sunday. Dressed in a ice blue helmet, with matching sunglasses and a lime green jacket, Garrik is seen racing down mountains, using rails to perform tricks, and even attempting jumps. Although Garrik isn't able to land every move he makes, it is not difficult to see he has the kind of raw talent that could easily turn him into a professional snowboarder one day. He doesn't even appear phased by the adults whizzing around him on the slopes, with one skier seeming to come perilously close to landing on Garrik after he takes a tumble on one of the ramps.

"Rising global temperatures, rather than human hunters, were the main reason woolly mammoths became extinct,  scientists claim. Thousands of years before modern humans left Africa, they say, climate change drove mammoths to the brink of extinction. Warmer weather caused their numbers to plummet as their grassy habitat was destroyed. The woolly mammoth was driven to extinction by warmer weather, according to new research. Genetic analyses reveals the iconic beast of the Ice Age was strongly affected by past changes in climate . British and Swedish scientists carried . out genetic analysis on scores of remains discovered across northern . Europe, Asia and America. They . found that global warming 120,000 years ago caused the mammoth . population to fall from several million to just tens of thousands, . living in small pockets around the world. The . following Ice Age allowed their numbers to recover, however, and in . Europe a distinct sub-group evolved from the survivors, flourishing for . millennia before dying out around 30,000 years ago. Then, . 10,000 years ago, the onset of the latest warm period – which is still . going on – spelled doom for the remaining populations of the giant . mammal, which was unable to adapt. ‘We . found that a previous warm period some 120,000 years ago caused . populations to decline and become fragmented, in line with what we would . expect for cold-adapted species such as the woolly mammoth,’ said lead . author Eleftheria Palkopoulou, from the Swedish Museum of Natural . History. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involved DNA sequencing of a large number of mammoth remains found across northern Eurasia and North America . The research, . published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, challenges . long-held views that mammoths were resilient and thrived in the warmer . climate. In fact, scientists . said, they were at risk whenever temperatures rose – and it is very . likely that climate change was the main reason they died out, with . hunting by humans a less important factor. By . looking at differences in DNA samples and tracing migration patterns, . scientists were able to establish that the mammoth population plummeted, . then recovered, before the species became extinct. The . findings suggest mammoths were isolated to small areas of good habitat . in a warm spell 120,000 years ago, before numbers bounced back during . the following Ice Age. But . the latest warm period finally signalled the end for the mammoth. Researchers said that as the Earth heated up again, mammoths were once . more confined to smaller and smaller areas suitable for them to graze. ‘This process culminated with a severe decline in population size that . started when temperatures began to increase at the end of the last Ice . Age,’ said Dr Jessica Thomas, a researcher from York University. ‘This . suggests that spells of warm climate made the mammoth more susceptible . to extinction,’ said Dr Love Dalen from the Swedish Museum of Natural . History. The study showed mammoth populations became highly dynamic during the second half of the last Ice Age where some expanded and others - such as the European variety - disappeared . To understand why . the species as a whole became extinct, scientists said they would have . to examine the last outposts where mammoths survived, such as remote St . Paul Island in Alaska and Wrangel Island off the coast of Siberia. The . study concluded: ‘It thus seems likely that environmental changes . played a significant role in shaping the woolly mammoth’s demographic . history, with warm periods restricting the amount of available habitat . and cold periods leading to population expansions, both owing to . increases in the amount of steppe–tundra and through sea level-driven . exposure of the Bering Land Bridge.’ Woolly mammoths could roam Earth again, according to one eminent scientist who believes frozen DNA from newly discovered frozen mammoths could be the key to the species' resurrection. Stem cell scientist Sir Ian Wilmut who is best known for cloning the world's first mammal, Dolly the sheep, thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal. The source of viable mammoth cells could come from a number of frozen bodies discovered in the Siberian permafrost in recent years. Here you can see frozen tissue and blood . The giant beasts lived in the late Pleistocene period, tens of thousands of years ago. Their numbers were thought to have fallen across North America and on mainland Eurasia around 10,000 years ago, probably as a result of hunting by our ancestors as well as a changing climate.","Tests were done on remains found in northern Eurasia and North America .

"Roberto Martinez accused referee Kevin Friend of costing Everton a point at Manchester United because of refereeing blunder at Old Trafford. United claimed back-to-back wins for the first time under Louis van Gaal thanks to Radamel Falcao's second-half winner.

"Lionel Messi edged closer to the all-time top league scorer record in Spain with a first half goal against Rayo Vallecano, but then missed a hatful of second half opportunities to go past it. The Argentine scored league goal No 249 of his career leaving him just two behind Telmo Zarra’s 251 haul. If he fails to score twice in Barcelona’s next game against Eibar then the Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu may well be the scene of him eclipsing all of Spanish league scorers and claiming the record. His second misses did not matter too much in this game as Barça brushed aside an over-adventurous Rayo whose case was not helped by being reduced to nine men. VIDEO Scroll down to see Messi and Neymar sign autographs as they land in Madrid . Neymar (left) and Lionel Messi (right) scored a goal apiece within two minutes of each other for Barcelona .

Goals: Messi 35, Neymar 36 . Bookings: Xavi 10, Pique 72 . Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz . Attendance: 14,070 . The Madrid-based minnows started brightly and former Real Madrid youngster Alberto Bueno could have put them ahead on eight minutes but his shot was saved by Claudio Bravo. The Chilean goalkeeper was back in the team having been left out of the midweek Champions League defeat to Paris Saint-Germain and when he passed the 20 minute mark without conceding it meant he broke Pedro Artola’s record from the 1977-78 season of going 560 minutes without being beaten at the start of the campaign. Soon Barcelona began to create openings and only a fine save from Toño kept out Leo Messi on 13 minutes. Rayo were showing the Argentine no respect and both centre-backs Abdoulaye and Morcillo were booked for late challenges from behind. Rayo were playing a very high line and a risky offside trap and it finally came unstuck on 35 minutes when a flighted ball from Gerard Pique put Messi through. He still had work to do but he headed the ball clear of defender Morcillo and lofted it over the out-rushing Toño to get his sixth league goal of the season.

Neymar had looked out of sorts in the opening exchanges mis-controlling one throw from Mathieu straight out of play, but after Messi’s strike he responded with a goal of his own inside the next minute. Again it was a long ball from the back, this time from Bartra and when Munir muscled off two Rayo defenders he played in the Brazilian who finished for his seventh league goal of this campaign. Bang, bang, Barça's deadly front two had killed the game inside 60 seconds. Munir should have been awarded a penalty when brought down by Toño so Rayo were lucky to go in at half time only 2-0 down. The aggregate score in this fixture form the two sides’ last three meetings was 16-0 coming into the match and they looked so open at the back, another drubbing looked on the cards.

In the second half Rayo had the first chance when Baptistao forced a save from Bravo but it was not long before the job became even harder. Morcillo went through the back of Neymar and was sent off for his second yellow card. Gung-ho boss Paco Jemez had already taken off one of his two centre-backs and now his other one had been sent off. Ivan Rakitic was on for Andres Iniesta and he had Barça’s next shot palmed away by Toño. Rakitic then set up Messi but Toño pushed the ball out for a corner. Messi had two more clear-cut chances from Xavi passes but against a weak side down to ten-men Barça had very much gone back down the gears with the clock ticking down and there was some uncharacteristically poor finishing from their talisman. He missed again this time from a Pique ball over the top of the defence. Rayo sub Aquino was sent off completing the home side’s dismal afternoon and Barça took the points and made it seven straight clean sheets in the league. Messi now goes away on international duty just two goals short of that all-time record… and one game away from the Bernabeu.","Lionel Messi opened the scoring for Barcelona in the 35th minute .

"It proved an emotional day for Menelik Watson, but the Oakland Raiders leave London feeling sorry for themselves after sinking to a tenth straight defeat. Thrust in to the action in the second half following a knee injury to starting tackle Khalif Barnes, Watson and the Raiders were routed 38-14 by the Miami Dolphins. 'It's not the result we wanted. We had a great week of practice. We were really prepared,' Watson said. Menelik Watson points to the crowd during his Wembley debut which ended in a tough defeat for the Raiders . Watson gets to grips with Miami Dolphins' dangerous pass-rusher Cameron Wake . 'The game of football is like that. I think there's things which we did and that I'm proud of and a lot of guys on the team are proud of that we kept fighting right to the end.' The 6ft 5in Mancunian led the Raiders out onto the field and with his mother and daughter watching him play for the first time, he admitted the moment was a special one. 'I think the best part was when the English anthem came on. That was such an emotional moment because usually it's just the American anthem. I always blow a kiss when I'm in America, because I always wish my dad and mum could see me play. They were there, so I just let them know that I found them in the crowd and let them know that I can see them and know that they're there. 'I try not to be caught in the moment a lot. It was a little emotional before the game. But as soon as we started and I was coming in the extra tackle package, I didn't notice the crowd, I was out there just trying to complete the assignments.' Watson makes a tackle as back-up quarterback Matt McGloin releases the ball . Watson met Channel 4 presenter  Vernon Kay in midweek and the pair were reunited at Wembley . With Watson being used sparingly this season, it was a case of next man up as he entered the fray. 'Unfortunately, Khalif went down and I was in. And I got a little second on the sidelines and it felt like, well, this is kind of historic to be at home and a guy goes down and I have to step up.' And Watson faced a familiar face in the shape of Cameron Wake - and the Dolphins' pass rusher kept him on his toes. 'He's a great player. I met Cam when we came out here for the media day. We got to chat it up a little bit. And I told him out on the field that there was a second where I kind of laughed at him. I said, yeah, I know what you're doing. And I said, well, guess what, adjustment. I just made some adjustments. But he's a great player, as you all know. 'I didn't give up a sack. Just a couple technical things I was a little sloppy at, which he capitalised on. He was bending the corner really well and I wasn't getting out of my stance. I wasn't using my length at first. Every once in a while, I got to use my length. And a couple times he got a hold of my shoulder.

"Jon Huntsman couldn't help but fire a parting shot at his Republican rivals, even as he withdrew from the presidential race and backed front-runner Mitt Romney Monday morning. 'This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people and not worthy of this critical time,' he said during an announcement in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Huntsman, a former Utah governor and the President Obama's ambassador to China, must now navigate the tricky waters of supporting a candidate he slammed as an unelectable, untrustworthy flip-flopper. Shortly after Huntsman told his staff . Sunday night he was planning to quit the presidential race, videos and . statements criticizing the former Massachusetts governor disappeared . from Huntsman's campaign website. Family affair: Four of Jon Huntsman's daughters, including his adopted Chinese daughter Gracie Mei, stood on stage with him and his wife Mary Kaye (in the purple) today . Exit: Jon Huntsman leaves the stage after his announcement this morning, flanked by his daughter Mary Anne (left) and his wife Mary Kaye (right) Bowing out: Huntsman's presidential bid never gained traction and floundered after a disappointing performance in New Hampshire . As an opponent, Huntsman was one of Romney's harshest critics, offering several devastating assessments of the front-runner in an attempt to win over Romney's moderate supporters. 'I will always put my country first. It . seems that Gov Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov Romney . enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he’s . slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America . right now, and that’s a dangerous place to be,' he told reporters right . before the New Hampshire primary. Lest anyone forget Huntsman's harsh words, the Democratic National Committee produced a greatest hits list of the most cutting remarks by the former candidate. Big gains: Hours after the announcement, Mitt Romney thanked Huntsman for his support and praised his campaign . Plea for unity: Flanked by his family, Huntsman criticized the divisive tone of the Republican race and said the party needs to unite . And Huntsman's endorsement of Romney was no ringing embrace. Instead, he simply cited Romney's electability. Jon Huntsman's campaign pulled down statements critical of Mitt Romney as he moved to endorse the Republican front-runner. However, the Democratic National Committee won't let Huntsman forget what he said. It has released a list of his greatest Mitt-hits: . 'I believe it is now time for our party . to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. Despite our differences I believe that candidate is Gov Mitt Romney,' Huntsman said at a news conference with his wife and children. Huntsman staked his presidential bid . on making a name for himself in last week's New Hampshire primary. But . his candidacy never really gained traction and he came in a . disappointing third place behind Romney and Texas Rep Ron Paul. Campaign sources said Huntsman was dropping out now because he didn't want to pull support away from Romney, which could prolong the GOP presidential primary. Romney gladly accepted the affirmation from his fellow Mormon. 'I salute Jon Huntsman & his wife Mary Kaye. He ran a campaign based on unity not division, & love of country. I appreciate his support,' the candidate Tweeted moments after the public announcement. Despite his low support from voters, Huntsman's departure will surely be a boon to Romney. He was only polling at three to five percent in South Carolina and Florida, the next two primary states, but he was the only candidate still competing for moderate voters who are the backbone of Romney's support. According to recent polls, nearly all of Huntsman's supporters said Romney was their second choice. This further consolidates the establishment wing of the Republican party. Conservative voters are still divided between former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and, to a lesser extent, Texas Gov Rick Perry. Huntsman is the third candidate to leave . the race. Former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty exited in August and . Minnesota Rep Michele Bachmann dropped out after a poor showing in the . Iowa caucus. By his side: Huntsman made the announcement in South Carolina with his family, including his wife Mary Kaye . Waving farewell: Huntsman said he was ending his presidential bid because he believes Romney is the best choice to beat President Obama . Despite strong credentials -- an attractive, highly-educated former governor and businessman who speaks Mandarin Chinese and has extensive foreign policy experience -- Huntsman never rose above single digits in national polls. He staked his campaign on a victory, or at least a strong showing, in moderate New Hampshire. But the granite state didn't show him the love he was hoping for. He received just 17 percent of the vote compared to Mitt Romney's dominant 39 percent. Ron Paul came in second with 23 percent. New Jersey Gov Chris Christie turned down a Republican movement urging him to run for president this year, but he hasn't ruled out the possibility in the future. He told Oprah Winfrey during her visit to his home in Mendham, New Jersey, that he was considering running in 2016. 'I'll be much more ready for it four years from now than I am now,' he said. Christie says he can see his family occupying the White House in the future. The 49-year-old former US Attorney told Oprah he and his wife seriously considered the calls to run for president against Barack Obama, but ultimately he felt comfortable turning them down. 'Inside me it never felt right. I knew that if it didn't feel right, I couldn't be me,' he said.","Huntsman slammed the Republican candidates for a race that 'degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks'

"Arsenal and Galatasaray will face UEFA charges following the behaviour of the Turkish fans at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night. The Gunners will be charged because they were responsible for security and organisation at the stadium, and are likely to face a fine for 'insufficient organisation'. Galatasaray have been charged with the conduct of their supporters, a more serious charge, which could result in the partial closure of their ground for future Champions League games. Sportsmail understands that Galatasaray fans were issued 3,000 tickets for the match and trouble started when around 500 Turkish supporters  let off flares as they marched to the ground. Although 12 flares were confiscated at the turnstiles, fans managed to smuggle more into the ground - causing a disturbance when they were thrown on to the pitch during  the first half of Arsenal’s 4-1 win.. A fire steward was hit by a flare and Sportsmail also understands that Arsenal fans were pelted with coins and bottles, while over 100 seats at the stadium were damaged. Galatasaray supporters lit flares and threw them on to the pitch at the Emirates Stadium during their 4-1 defeat by Arsenal in the Champions League .

"Ashley Cole seems to have fully immersed himself into his new side, posing in the middle of his Roma team-mates after their 2-1 win at Parma on Wednesday night. The Englishman, who had been on the periphery of a team photo in the summer, was put in the mix of the team photo taken on the visitors' plane. Cole was an unused substitute in the game, which kept up Roma’s 100 per cent record for the season so far. In stark contrast to the early photo, Ashley Cole (centre) is photographed surrounded by his Roma team-mates . The former Chelsea man was an unused substitute as Roma beat Parma 2-1 in Serie A . A spectacular late Miralem Pjanic free kick gave Roma the win after Adem Ljajic had put the visitors in front and Paolo De Ceglie had levelled for Parma. Roma were on the point of dropping their first points of the season until Pjanic scored with a dipping free kick with two minutes to go. Roma were without eight injured players, including key midfielder Daniele De Rossi and newly signed forward Juan Iturbe. When he first arrived at the club, this photo was posted with Cole awkwardly standing beside his team-mates . The first photo lead to a string of  jokes online, and even Cole's Roma team-mate Francesco Totti got involved . But it was captain Francesco Totti, who turns 38 this week, who set up Ljajic's goal by leaving the Serbian forward with only the goalkeeper to beat. Antonio Cassano threatened for Parma in the 54th and then De Sceglie rose above Roma's defense to redirect in a corner. The match appeared headed for a draw until Pjanic showed off his free-kick expertise by curling a shot over Parma's wall that went in off the underside of the crossbar. Adem Ljajic scored the opening goal for Roma after being set up by Francesco Totti . Miralem Pjanic's spectacular 88th-minute free-kick won the game for Roma to continue their winning run .

"American football fans were ecstatic when the 2014 NFL season kicked off last week but few expressed their joy more perfectly than George the dog. When shown a recording of the Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers in 2014 season opener, George couldn't contain his excitement - as he well shouldn't given his four-legged status. George jumps and barks with vigour from the snap to the down, slightly less so between plays. And he calms down totally during commercial breaks. Barking mad: George the dog prances, jumps and barks when American football comes on TV . NFL fan: George can't take his eyes off the screen as the Green Bay Packers take on the Seattle Seahawks .

"Luis Suarez appearing to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup shocked the football community and will certainly live long in the memory. Now, just a few months on, some fans have amusingly recreated the infamous incident using the new FIFA 15 game. In pictures posted to Twitter, fans have claimed the game is ‘so realistic’ for letting them relive the moment that saw the Barcelona striker banned from football for four months. Luis Suarez's apparent bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup shocked football and earned the frontman a lengthy ban . Fans have recreated the now infamous incident of Suarez's bite on the newly released FIFA 15 game . ‘FIFA 15 is so realistic’ said one Twitter user beneath an image that sees Suarez sinking his teeth into Holland's Daryl Janmaat. ‘Was playing the FIFA 15 Demo earlier got to say its pretty damn realistic,’ said another tweeter under an image of Suarez and new Barcelona team-mate Ivan Rakitic. Of course, the ability to bite a player is not actually a feature of the new game. Instead, the gamers have used the game’s replay mode to spot some odd player collision moments in the game. The glitches seem to show Suarez’s mouth sinking into players, and it doesn’t help his case that in some his eyes are closed and teeth bared in an apparent biting action. One fan on Twitter joked that FIFA 15 was so realistic beneath a graphic of Suarez appearing to bite Holland defender Daryl Janmaat . Suarez signed for Barcelona from Liverpool after the World Cup in a £75million deal. However he is still yet to make his competitive debut as he continues to serve his ban for biting Chiellini. And that is replicated in FIFA 15 - fans picking up the game will be unable to use Suarez in the game’s career mode for the entirety of his ban. However playing one of the game's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions - such as an exhibition one-on-one against another gamer - allows the hilarious images to be taken. Suarez's real-life ban until October 26 is replicated on the new FIFA 15 game when users play as Barcelona .

"The best man accused of fatally stabbing his friend's wife had been faking cancer while ensnared by an investigation into thousands of dollars missing from his victim's company it’s been revealed. Jonathan Broyhill told friends he was suffering from pancreatic cancer as well as multiple sclerosis for the last two years, according to friends and a reverend who were asked to ‘pray’ for him by his victims, Jamie and Nation Hahn. Broyhill, 31, is currently hospitalized for self-inflicted injuries after authorities say he fatally stabbed 29-year-old Jamie Hahn in her North Raleigh home on Monday night. Happier times: Jon Broyhill (left) has been accused of fatally stabbing his best friend's wife, Jamie Kirk Hahn (center). Her husband, Nation Hahn (right), was also injured in the attack on Monday . Ripped apart: The couple, who were both well known in political circles in North Carolina, married in 2009 . Her husband Nation Hahn, 27, suffered minor lacerations while trying to defend her, according to police. Last week the Hahns asked the Reverend Nancy Petty to pray for Broyhill during his cancer struggle, according to members of the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh. But on Wednesday, the day Jamie Hahn died from her injuries, Rev Petty informed about two dozen congregants that Broyhill did not have the disease. ‘I felt that I had an obligation to tell my congregation that this was not true and that there were more important things to pray for,’ Petty told WRAL. Broyhill had worked for Jamie Hahn's . political firm, Sky Blue Strategies, and was in charge of campaign . financing and providing reports to the Financial Elections Commission, . according to former Democratic Representative Brad Miller who used Sky . Blue to help him with fundraising around 2010. He told WRAP that Broyhill was the . main employee who had access to the company’s fundraising software and . may be part of a current investigation into thousands of dollars that . has gone missing. 'Murdered': Jon Broyhill is pictured left with Mrs Hahn and right in his mug shot after allegedly stabbing her . Injured: Nation Hahn, 27, suffered minor lacerations while trying to defend his wife in an attack police say wasn't domestic related . Several checks valued at $11,900 in April of 2012 alone were never received by the donors, according to WRAL. ‘I think it's bound to be part of the investigation of Jon's motive,’ Miller told the Island Packet on Wednesday. On Monday friends say Broyhill told the Hahns that he had a doctor appointment the next day and asked if they'd come with him and if he could spend the night. That appointment never existed, it’s now been revealed. But so worried for his health, the request was welcomed and not uncommon according to neighbors of the Hahns who described Broyhill as seen practically living with them. 'It's there everyday,' neighbor Mars DElacuesta said of Hahn's car parked outside. 'I thought they lived together. That's his permanent parking spot over there.' Always around: Neighbors of the couple say that Boyhill's car was always seen parked outside their home, pictured, so much so that they thought he lived there . A former co-worker said Broyhill described himself as being on an aggressive medication for MS for the last two years. She says she never saw changes in his behavior outside of a bit of depression. ‘He seemed depressed and I know he went through stress with MS,’ Amy Holsclaw told the Island Packet, ‘but other than that he was John, and John was a good guy.’ Broyhill, charged with attempted murder, was so close to the couple he dined at their house every week and even went on vacation with them, it has emerged. Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, was released from WakeMed Hospital after treatment and was seen with a bandaged arm as he went to his wife's bedside on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he wrote a string of emotional tweets to pay tribute to his young wife. Heartbroken: Nation Hahn expressed his grief and thanks on Twitter after his wife died on Wednesday . 'I have no idea what I'm going to do with @jamiehahn,' he wrote. 'She was my center, my rock and my soulmate... It is almost unfathomable that the sun can shine without [her] here.' Friends told the Charlotte Observer how, on Monday nights, the three close friends would meet at the Hahn's home for dinner, but tragedy unfolded during this week's meet up. An unidentified woman called 911 around 5.30pm Monday to report that Jamie was 'bleeding terribly' from multiple stab wounds to the abdomen as she lay in a neighbor's yard. 'I don't know where she ran here from,' the woman said, adding that many people had gathered to press towels against her stomach. The dispatcher asked the caller who had carried out the stabbing, and a voice responded: 'Jon Broyhill', the Observer reported. When police arrived on the scene, they followed a trail of blood back to Tealwood Place and found Broyhill inside the Hahns' home, authorities said. Active: Jamie was a political fundraiser with her own company, while her husband was a Democratic strategist . Broyhill was also sent to WakeMed to . recover from non-life threatening injuries, which are self-inflicted, according to WNCT. Police have charged Broyhill with . attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill . inflicting serious injury, but have not revealed a motive. Facebook images show the close . relationship the three shared - enjoying watching sports games at home . and traveling abroad to share holidays. On Wednesday, the community paid tribute to the bright, popular woman, who had set up her own business, Sky Blue Strategies, to help politicians and campaigns fundraise. She and her husband both graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009. 'Jamie lost her struggle to live this . morning. We lost a beautiful and loving wife, daughter and friend. We . all lost a pure and brave spirit,' her family said in a statement early on Wednesday morning. Released: Before his wife's death, Mr Hahn was pictured walking to her hospital with his arm bound . 'Jamie is a ray of sunshine,' state Sen. Josh Stein, who knew all three, said. 'She's always smiling. She . absolutely brings cheer wherever she goes, and that this has happened is . tragic.' 'As a friend, this is devastating,' friend Gary Pearce told the Observer. 'Nation and Jamie are the finest, . kindest, gentlest and most generous people you will ever meet.' Following the tragedy, Nation Hahn talked about his wife at Pullen Memorial. 'She would be the first one to forgive this act of violence against her,' he said. According to the Observer, in 2010 . Broyhill also managed the field campaign for Jane Dyer, a pilot in South . Carolina who was running for a U.S. congressional seat. He also worked with former U.S. Rep. Brad Miller of Raleigh. Nation Hahn worked on former U.S. Sen. John Edwards' presidential campaign and has also helped as an online strategist and with mail campaigns. Among those he's worked with is the Coalition to Protect All N.C. Families, a campaign opposed to the state constitutional amendment that limits marriage to a union between a man and a woman.","Jonathan Broyhill, 31, told friends he was suffering from pancreatic cancer as well as multiple sclerosis for the last two years .

"The world’s number one shape wear brand Spanx has opened its first standalone store. Slimming bodysuits and pantyhose are just some of the wares that will be on offer at the outlet in McLean, Virginia, which opened its doors today. It is said to be the first of several openings this fall and the company’s founder, Sara Blakely, revealed that her vision is to create a place where ‘everybody knows your name - and your bra size'. First Spanx store: Slimming bodysuits and pantyhose are just some of the wares that will be on offer at the outlet in McLean, Virginia, which opened its doors today . The 41-year-old self-made billionaire made a special appearance at the grand opening at Tysons Corner mall this morning, along with CEO Laurie Ann Goldman. Ms Blakely exclaimed: ‘This is a longtime dream coming true for me.’ Spanx, which generates revenues in excess of $225million, is sold in over 11, 500 department stores, boutiques and online shops in 40 countries, but until now, the company has never operated its own retail shop. Further store openings are now set for the King of Prussia Mall near Philadelphia and Westfield Garden State Plaza in New Jersey. Florida-born Ms Blakely launched her brand in 2000 and this year she graced the cover of Forbes' Billionaires issue as the youngest self-made woman to have ever made the list. Self-made: Company founder Sara Blakely revealed that her vision is to create a place where 'everybody knows your name - and your bra size' According to the profile, she made her fortune largely as a one-woman show, travelling cross-country for in-store demonstrations and taking customer service calls from her bathroom at home. She famously never advertises, has no investors, has never been in debt, and built her company with just $5,000 of life savings. The mother-of-one told Forbes: 'I’d never worked in fashion or retail. I just needed an undergarment that didn’t exist.' Her instincts, it seems, were spot on. Neiman Marcus CEO Karen Katz, who saw her first ever pitch, said: 'Sara’s effort was to solve an age-old problem for women in a modern way. We were smitten from the beginning.'","The first Spanx store opened in McLean, Virginia, today ."
"Oliver Wilson superb fortitude paid off when the long- suffering Englishman pipped Rory McIlroy to capture his maiden European Tour title at the Dunhill Links Championship. Wilson had gone from the heady heights of being a Ryder Cup player in the top 50 in the world in 2008 to a lowly 792nd as his career nosedived and he was forced to seek salvation on the Challenge Tour. So bad was his plight the 34-year-old from Mansfield even feared he might be forced to find another job. World No 1 Rory McIlroy takes a break as he waits to play the 17th, where he made a terrible error . McIlroy dropped two shots at the first and ended up missing out on the title by a single shot . Lowly ranked Englishman Oliver Wilson won the tournament, his first with a prize of over £500,000 . But Wilson’s world changed forever on the Old Course at St Andrews when he claimed a one-shot victory over world No1 McIlroy, Scot Richie Ramsay and fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood. Fleetwood missed a birdie on the last to force a play-off, while Ramsay was two clear of the field after his eighth birdie of the day on the 15th, only to bogey the 16th and 17th in a closing 67. McIlroy’s chances ended when he putted into the Road Hole bunker on the 17th. But Wilson, who had held the lead going into the final day, kept calm and a closing 70 earned him a life-changing £489,416. ‘To win at St Andrews is a dream come true,’ said Wilson, who had finished second a record nine times on the Tour. ‘It’s hard to believe after dreaming of this moment so many times. ‘After waking up at three o’clock this morning, I let my mind wander for the next five hours thinking all sorts. Tommy Fleetwood reacts after his putt at the 18th slips agonizingly past the hole to give Wilson the win . Fleetwood congratulates Wilson after the Englishman won his first big tournament . Fleetwood had played well all week but couldn't force a play-off on the eighteenth at St Andrews . ‘Never having won a tournament, my mind kept going back to how I was going to play and I won three times in my sleep. ‘In the middle of last year, playing Challenge Tour, shooting 80s, not even being close to making the cut, was pretty low. That was hard to take and I was starting to think: “What am I going to do?” ‘It’s expensive to play golf and two grand a week goes fast if you’re not making anything. ‘But I just tried to put it out of my mind. I kept working hard and now it has all been worthwhile. ‘I don’t have to go back to qualifying school and I can’t tell you how pleased I am about that!’ Wilson’s wife, Lauren, surprised him when she arrived unannounced to lend her support and, after spotting her as he walked up the 18th, he added: ‘That was very special.’ The World No 792 could not believe it when he won the title after Tommy Fleetwood failed to sink his putt . Wilson holds his head in his hands after the biggest win of his career at the Dunhill Links Championship . So, too, were the words of encouragement from McIlroy when the four-time major winner walked up to him on the 10th and wished him good luck. Wilson said: ‘I’ve always got on well with Rory but now I have even more respect for him. ‘He told me to stick in there, keep playing great and try to win the tournament. This was from a guy who himself was looking to win. So, not only is he a world-class golfer, he’s a world-class person.’ Two mistakes, a double-bogey six at the first and a dropped shot at the penultimate hole, saw McIlroy finish runner-up in the event for a third time since his debut seven years ago. Wilson kisses his wife Lauren on the 18th green after winnning the championship and beginning to celebrate . Wilson gets right down on the floor to take a look at a putt on his way to the excellent win . He said: ‘I cost myself the tournament in the space of about 20 yards at the front of the green at the first and at the Road Hole bunker. They were the only two mistakes I made all day. ‘But I love this golf course. I feel like I play well every time I tee it up and I’m looking forward to coming back next year to defend the Open Championship. ‘I’m ready for a break. I’m not 100 per cent but it’s easy to accept these things when you have two majors in the bag and you have played so well with a couple of trophies on your mantelpiece. ‘I’ve found some sort of calmness on the course or inner peace, whatever you want to call it.’ Wilson, ranked 792 in the world, played one of the shots of his life on Sunday to help with the tournament . McIlroy missed out after two major errors but said he was enjoying playing the Old Course at St Andrews . The only downside for McIlroy was his failure to give dad and playing partner Gerry a 55th birthday to remember by winning the team event. Aberdonian Ramsay just missed out on a third European Tour title after losing three months of the season to an ankle injury. ‘I’m proud of the way I stuck in,’ he said. ‘I didn’t get it done but I gave it 100 per cent the whole week and played to win. ‘It’s good I can play the way I did in a field that is strong on a course that doesn’t always suit me, more the bombers. ‘I just need to find that extra inch which will pull me over the line in a big tournament and I don’t think it’s far away.’","McIlroy double bogeys first hole of final round after bad mistake .

When asked what Rooney was like as an orator, Hodgson said: ‘Oratory is a much over-exaggerated quality. There are some people I think are very eloquent who don’t get messages across well and others who I don’t think you would regard as orators who get their message across very well. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wayne Rooney's latest instagram video of his son Klay . Roy Hodgson has risked upsetting Merseyside by making comments on Wayne Rooney’s Scouse accent .

'But he doesn’t need to. All he has to do is make certain the players he is talking to understand where he is coming from.’ The England manager’s most famous gaffe came in the ‘feed the monkey’ racism row when, at half-time of a World Cup qualifier against Poland, Hodgson urged Chris Smalling to pass to Andros Townsend, saying: ‘It’s like the old Nasa joke — feed the monkey’. He also upset the mayor of Manaus on the eve of the World Cup draw when saying the Brazilian city was ‘the venue to be avoided’.

"Challenges: Findings from a Government-funded study show that the number of schoolchildren needing help for speech and language difficulties rose 71 per cent between 2005 and 2011. The rise has been blamed on the growing use of gadgets . The number of children with speech difficulties has leapt 70 per cent in six years, according to a new study. As many as 1.2million youngsters are now estimated to struggle with speech. Half of pupils in some areas start school unable to put sentences together. The rise is being blamed on the growing use of screen-based gadgets as convenient ‘babysitters’ and a trend for hard-working parents to spend less time with their children. Teachers are also said to be identifying speech difficulties among pupils more readily. Findings from a major new Government-funded study show that the number of schoolchildren needing expert help for speech and language difficulties rose 71 per cent between 2005 - when reliable records began - and 2011. The analysis, part of the Better Communication Research Programme, found that 2.2 per cent of youngsters aged five to 16 were classed as having difficulties in 2011 - some 135,700. But the figures do not capture pupils who are identified as having speech difficulties and are helped within their schools without recourse to specialists, for example using small group tuition. Responding to the findings, the children’s charity I CAN said other studies had suggested that 1.2million youngsters of all ages across the UK have some form of communication problem. They include children with specific conditions that lead to speech problems and others whose environment may play a part in their language difficulties. The charity said that 50 per cent of children in some parts of the UK - particularly areas of social disadvantage - start school with delayed language. Worry: The study, published by the Department of Education, blames growing use of screen-based gadgets as convenient 'babysitters' and a trend for hard-working parents to spend less time with their children for speech difficulties . Jean Gross, the Government’s former . speech and language tsar and a trustee of I CAN, said the sharp rise in . cases of speech difficulties was likely to be down to 21st century . living, as well as better identification by parents and schools. Screen-based . technology - including TVs, games consoles, smartphones and computers - . was increasingly used to occupy children instead of traditional family . activities such as learning nursery rhymes and eating together, she . warned. Meanwhile both mothers and fathers were increasingly working long hours to make ends meet, forcing them to rely on childcare which can be patchy in quality. ‘Head teachers are telling me they are seeing a real increase in the number of children who struggle to string words together,’ she said. Many reasons had been put forward to explain the trend, including the demise of family meal times and even the advent of central heating, which put an end to the days of families congregating around the fire in one room, she said. ‘Head teachers also suggest that parents are just so busy these days trying to pay the mortgage and keep things together,’ she said. Difficulties: 2.2 per cent of youngsters aged five to 16 were classed as having difficulties in 2011 - some 135,700. Posed by model . ‘They may not have as much time to play on the floor with their children and talk to their children.’ This affected ‘cash-rich time-poor’ middle-class parents as well as poorer households. In . one case described by a head teacher, the parents of a five-year-old . who could barely speak was given a BlackBerry as a present. She added: ‘It’s not about parents not wanting to talk to their children but about the stresses of modern life. ‘This isn’t going to change but what parents can do is use the times they do have with their children - car journeys, bath times, meal times - to talk and listen to their children.’ She added: ‘Increased use of screen technology in all its forms is also suggested as a reason.’ Mrs Gross said television programmes could be educational after the age of two if used as a springboard for family conversations rather than a substitute for them. Problems: In one case described by a head teacher, the parents of a five-year-old who could barely speak was given a BlackBerry as a present (stock image) She added that teachers were also thought to be ‘getting better at getting under the skin of why children are struggling with learning’. The latest study, published yesterday by the Department for Education, found that parents may face a long wait - in some cases up to two years - to access specialist support once they have raised a possible problem with their children’s speech. It found that children who struggle with language during their early years were more likely to struggle at school. Early intervention was crucial, it said, yet in many primary classes there was limited use of approaches to help children’s language. Virginia Beardshaw, chief executive of I CAN, said the research ‘demonstrates that parents are having to wait as long as two years between noticing a child’s difficulties and getting help. 'This isn’t acceptable when every day matters to a child’s language development’. She added: ‘We know there is a “golden window” between 0 to 5 where help and early interventions can make a material difference to a child’s language. Early years settings and schools can put programmes and interventions in place so that children do not slip through the net.’ Edward Timpson, children and families minister, said: ‘Communication is fundamental to all learning. It is vital that children with speech, language and communication needs get the support they deserve as soon as possible. ‘The Better Communication Research Programme provides a rich and extensive source of evidence on what works in identifying the needs of children and young people with speech, language and communication needs.’","Rise blamed on screen-based gadgets and games as 'electronic babysitters'

"Tory MP David Davis said a vote for independence would be humiliating for the Prime Minister . David Cameron could be forced to resign as Prime Minister if Scotland votes to leave the UK, a senior Conservative MP has warned. Former Tory leadership contender David Davis said that a Yes vote in next month’s referendum would be such a ‘humiliation’, he would have to consider stepping down. Mr Cameron has insisted he has no intention of quitting, even if he presides over the end of the 300-year-old union. But asked if the Prime Minister would have to go, Mr Davis told the BBC: ‘That’s his call. It will be particularly humiliating for him. ‘It would be a humiliating point for any prime minister to have lost a part of the United Kingdom, no doubt about that.’ John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: ‘A Yes vote would destroy Cameron’s place in the history books. ‘He would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping Scotland in the union and lost his gamble. ‘(It would be) very difficult in those circumstances to see how he could continue for any very great length of time.’ Mr Davis, a former Tory home affairs spokesman who stood against Mr Cameron for the party leadership in 2005, said if Scotland votes to remain in the UK and gets more devolved powers there would be a knock-on effect for England. He said there would have to be a 'more federal answer for the United Kingdom' and this would mean 'at the absolute minimum, English votes for English measures'. Mr Cameron has denied that his position would be untenable if Scotland voted to leave the UK in the vote on September 18. After the SNP won a majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011, he agreed to hold the referendum on independence. Earlier this year when asked if he would resign in the event of a Yes vote, Mr Cameron said: ‘No and I think it is very important people understand that because it is not my name or anyone else's name on the ballot paper. ‘Of course, I want to see Scotland stay in the United Kingdom but I faced a choice in 2011 when the Scottish nationalists were elected to run the Scottish government. ‘Do you have a referendum or do you have some massive fight with them saying “no, no you can't possibly have this choice”?' David Cameron risks going down in the history books as the Prime Minister who lost Scotland and may have to consider resigning, it was suggested on a BBC documentary aired last night . Mr Cameron added: ‘I thought the right thing to do, and this was backed by the other parties at the time, and I remain of the view it was the right thing to do, was to give the Scottish people a fair, legal and decisive referendum. That's what will happen. ‘It was absolutely the right decision. You have to decide the prior question as it were - does Scotland want to stay in the United Kingdom or separate itself from the United Kingdom? ‘Once you have settled that question, then you can properly engage with future acts of devolution - on which again I have a pretty good track record.’","Former leadership rival David Davis said a Yes vote  would be a 'humiliation'

"A 'treatment' for Ebola made from the blood of survivors of the vicious disease is being traded on the black market in West Africa, it has emerged. Health experts have warned the serums could contain other harmful infections as the World Health Organisation vowed to work with governments to stamp out the illicit trade. The 'convalescent serum' is made from survivors' blood, which contains antibodies that could help fight the virus, Bloomberg News reported. Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO said: ‘There is a danger that such serums could contain other infections and wouldn’t be administered properly.' Scroll down for video . A 'treatment' for Ebola made from the blood of survivors of the vicious disease is being traded on the black market in West Africa, it has emerged . The World Health Organisation has vowed to work with governments in the affected countries, pictured, to stamp out the illicit trade of the 'convalescent serum' Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO said: ‘There is a danger that such serums could contain other infections and wouldn’t be administered properly' The announcement comes as the WHO said new cases in West Africa are increasing faster than the capacity to manage them. More than 2,400 people have died from Ebola in recent months and almost 4,700 people have been infected, making it the largest outbreak in history. Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat Ebola, though several are in the developmental stages. Patients are given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and antibiotics to bolster their immune systems and help fight off other infections. However, the blood of survivors contains natural antibodies that can protect against Ebola. Antibodies are produced by the body’s white blood cells and bind to foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria to neutralise them as a threat. About half of the people infected during the current outbreak have survived, providing a potential pool of donors. The WHO is developing a system where blood from survivors of the disease can be drawn out safely and re-injected into patients. It comes as Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly donated blood to a fellow American aid worker infected with the diesase. Dr Rick Sacra received blood transfusions from Dr Brantly shortly after he arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday. Dr Rick Sacra is receiving blood transfusions from Dr Kent Brantly, who recently recovered from Ebola . Dr. Kent Brantly (right), stands with his wife, Amber Brantly, during a press conference announcing his release from Emory Hospital on August 21, 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia after his successful treatment for Ebola . This 2007 photo released by the Nebraska Medical Center shows Dr. Richard Sacra working in west Africa . Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loathed to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.' But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate. He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time. Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. 'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus. 'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics. Dr Sacra, 51, has also been given an experimental drug and other treatments. He is close friends with 33-year-old Dr Brantly, one of the first two Americans treated for Ebola in Atlanta last month, after working in West Africa helping victims of the outbreak. 'It really meant a lot to us that he was willing to give that donation so quickly after his own recovery,' Dr Sacra's wife, Debbie, said. The transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the Ebola virus because the survivor's blood carries antibodies for the disease. Doctors at Emory University in Atlanta and Nebraska in Lincoln, U.S. are also working on lists of survivors by blood type who could donate. Mrs Sacra said she hopes her husband's illness and the experience of other aid workers can lead to new treatments for Ebola in West Africa before the outbreak spreads. Dr Sacra was the third American aid worker with the Ebola virus to be flown to the U.S. for treatment. A fourth worker, whose identity has not yet been revealed, arrived Tuesday morning at Emory in Atlanta. Few details have been released about the fourth American Ebola patient. But the World Health Organization said a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone tested positive for the disease and was to be evacuated Monday in stable condition. Mrs Sacra said she knows her husband will be eager to return to West Africa once he recovers. 'I'm sure when he gets his strength back, he'll be ready to go back to Liberia,' she said. Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat the Ebola virus, but the WHO are developinga way of safely drawing out blood from survivors so it can be re-injected into patients .","Black market for Ebola treatment has emerged in West Africa .

"England embark on 12 months crammed with cricket, knowing they still have much to do to show they have fully recovered from a year that ripped them apart. The tumultuous events of 2014, culminating with the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain, give way to a non-stop diet of high-profile competition that will make or break their still unproven regime. Peter Moores left Heathrow on Tuesday with the prospect of his second coming as England coach being defined by how they fare during a year that includes a World Cup, the Ashes and series against Pakistan and South Africa. Peter Moores faces defining 12 months as England cricket coach with World Cup and Ashes series . Moores, speaking before England flew to Australia, says the Cook decision was brave but necessary . Chris Woakes (left), Joe Root (centre) and Steve Finn arrive for check-in at Heathrow airport . England's Moeen Ali makes a final check on his luggage before check-in ahead of flight to Australia . Woakes (left) and batsman Gary Ballance make their final preparations before leaving for Canberra . Only if England make significant progress in the months ahead will the jury that is still out on both Moores and managing director Paul Downton return a favourable verdict on the massive changes that have swept through the game. The green shoots of recovery that saw England win three Tests against India must now blossom if the fallout which claimed Andy Flower, Ashley Giles, Kevin Pietersen and, in one-day cricket at least, Cook, is to prove justified. England, who left for Canberra on Tuesday and a pre-World Cup triangular series against Australia and India, are not expected to make much of an impact in the 50-over game. Yet if a mediocre World Cup — and they really should make at least the quarter-finals — is followed by stuttering form in the Caribbean and beyond, then the rancour that has enveloped them since their Ashes debacle will claim more victims. Moores, who has had to take over on the back of two 5-0 thrashings by Australia, travels with England still adamant that they have the ‘outstanding coach of his generation’ at the helm for their busiest-ever year. Kevin Pietersen, pictured during a Big Bash league match on Monday, was sacked by England during 2014 . Alastair Cook (left) remains England's Test skipper and will lead the side to the West Indies after the World Cup .

Four Tests, 5 ODIs, 2 T20s . Yet their backing for Cook, both publicly and privately, was total until they ruthlessly cut him adrift after the 5-2 one-day defeat in Sri Lanka so a vote of confidence in Moores will only stretch so far into the challenges ahead. Moores believes England travel with expectation as well as hope in their hearts. ‘We are going to Australia to win it,’ he said. ‘We know 2014 was tough, with the highlight of winning three Tests in a row against India, but we’ve not had a move forward yet in one-day cricket. We will attack the tri-series and the World Cup with a view to making the public excited about watching England play. This trip will be about England winning and not us making excuses.’ This one-day venture will certainly be a tall order. Three and a half years of planning were ripped up when Cook was jettisoned at the last moment and replaced as skipper by a batsman in Eoin Morgan who is in even worse one-day form. Moores insisted Cook was the right man for the job right up to the fateful selection meeting last month when it became clear that the man in whom England have invested so much had finally run out of one-day chances. Eoin Morgan, who's been playing for the Big Bash's Sydney Thunder, will lead England at the World Cup . Morgan himself is in even worse one-day form than sacked Cook going into the World Cup . Eoin Morgan (Middlesex, Capt) Moeen Ali (Worcestershire) James Anderson (Lancashire) Gary Ballance (Yorkshire) Ian Bell (Warwickshire) Ravi Bopara (Essex) Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire) Jos Buttler (Lancashire) Steven Finn (Middlesex) Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire) Chris Jordan (Sussex) Joe Root (Yorkshire) James Taylor (Nottinghamshire) James Tredwell (Kent) Chris Woakes (Warwickshire) ‘The goal we set going back eight months was to have the best 15 players going to the tri-series and then the World Cup. I think we’ve got that, but unfortunately for Alastair he missed out at the last part of that,’ said Moores. ‘It’s a tough one on Alastair, but we can look back and say he had every opportunity to try to get himself on the plane. Plans are there to be changed at times. We’d got to a position where it felt like the right thing to do.’ The scale of England’s task is summed up by the fact that four players who could feature in their first-choice top six — Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor and Gary Ballance — have 37 one-day caps between them while a key figure for group opponents Sri Lanka in Mahela Jayawardene has almost 400 more on his own. Yet England changed tack late before their 2010 World Twenty20 victory and their chances of causing an upset this time cannot really be harmed by the promotion of a canny captain in Morgan. ‘It will be exciting to work with Eoin and I think he’ll bring a lot to the team,’ said Moores. England fast bowlers Chris Jordan (right) and James Anderson embrace before check-in on Tuesday . Stuart Broad is pain-free after rehabilitation from a knee injury and raring for success in a busy 2015 . It is fascinating to ponder how many England players will still be standing this time next year after a gruelling schedule put together by greedy administrators with no thought for the well-being of players nor the quality of the product that spectators pay good money for. Yet Moores was bullish about 12 months that Stuart Broad for one calculates will see him spend 321 nights in hotel rooms if he somehow manages to stay fit for all the cricket that lies ahead. ‘My message to the players is let’s go for it, get in there and play good, hard cricket,’ said Moores. ‘And let’s enjoy representing our country. ‘That goes for the whole year and if at any time anybody feels they can’t do that then let’s move them on because that’s what playing for your country is all about.’ The next 12 months will decide whether Moores is still around to make the same rallying call this time next year.","England play a tri-series with Australia and India before the World Cup .

"He left the field to an ovation fit for a hero. Radamel Falcao had his first goal for Manchester United and it proved to be decisive in clinching victory over Everton at Old Trafford. It also obscured the fact that a player who could end up costing United in excess of £50million had squandered a number of opportunities to get off the mark earlier in the game. Alongside him, Robin van Persie posed even less of a threat. Neither striker, it has to be said, is living up to his reputation at the moment. Radamel Falcao connects from inside the box to score his first Manchester United goal . The United striker pokes him against Everton after Angel di Maria's mishit shot broke to him in the box . Falcao and Robin van Persie have a good statistical record up front together but never seemed to click . The statistics will show that either Falcao and Van Persie have been on the scoresheet in all three games they have started together. Indeed, Van Persie’s first of the season at Leicester was presented to him on a plate by Falcao’s far post cross. Unfortunately for United, it ended there. Since then, this has looked less like a strike partnership and more like two forwards struggling side by side for top form; proof that the fantasy football approach of throwing together two big-name players does not guarantee instant success. There is no clever interplay, no obvious understanding, and no running off one another. Thank goodness United have Angel di Maria to pull it altogether. Robin van Persie picked up an early booking for a late tackle on Everton's Gareth Barry . Falcao has still not completed 90 minutes for United since joining on loan on transfer deadline day . In fairness to Falcao and Van Persie, both are working their way back from knee injuries. In Falcao’s case, he has yet to complete a full 90 minutes since rupturing the ACL in his left knee playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January, forcing him to miss the World Cup. Van Persie made it to Brazil with Holland after suffering a knee injury playing for United against Olympiacos last season, but he has not looked like the same player since. He had just one chance of note against Everton, latching onto to Di Maria’s first-time flick early in the game but steered the ball high over Tim Howard’s goal. Falcao, on the other hand, could have had a hat-trick. Click here to see our brilliant Match Zone including Falcao's match-winning heat map . Falcao was barely involved in United's build-up play but did his most important work in the Everton box . Robin van Persie spent more time on the ball for Manchester United but in less dangerous positions . Falcao contributed little aside from goals, but his strike proved to be the all-important winner . Inside the opening 20 minutes alone, he met Luke Shaw’s excellent cross with a diving header which failed to beat Howard, and then volleyed well wide after being played in by Di Maria’s flick. The former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker then met Di Maria’s corner on the full just before half-time and succeeded only in volleying it high into the Stretford End. It was the attempt of a player increasingly desperate to break his duck. He had two more half chances within two minutes of the restart and then snatched at another close-range effort when Shaw picked him out in the box again. But a player with Falcao’s remarkable goalscoring record will always be a threat. ‘A proper centre-forward,’ said Paul Scholes on television. Van Persie was in the game more throughout but less likely to arrive on the end of a move than his partner . Falcao found it difficult to escape the attentions of John Stones and Phil Jagielka but did get chances . The Colombian striker fires wide while his strike partner looks on hoping for a pass . When Di Maria for once mis-hit a shot in the 62nd minute, his teammate had dropped off his markers and was lurking to stab the ball past Howard from 10 yards. The relief on Falcao’s face was clear to see. Instead of making a rather awkward exit 11 minutes later, Old Trafford gave him a rousing ovation when he was replaced by James Wilson. ‘He needed that goal,’ said Louis van Gaal afterwards. ‘I have talked with him because I thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal. Falcao was beginning to look frustrated as he failed to take his chances before he finally found the net . Falcao may be more used to his role in the opponent's area, but he performed a crucial role on his own line . It was clear how much Falcao's goal meant, both to the player himself and the United fans . ‘He’s a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long. I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.’ United must hope their manager is right. Continuing to play Falcao and Van Persie together will mean dropping Wayne Rooney into his less preferred midfield role and fewer opportunities for Juan Mata. The two stars leading the line must produce, both individually and as a partnership, to make it all worthwhile.

"Taco Bell customers who may have been wondering about the ingredients in the fast-food chain's beef now have their answer. The national chain of Mexican-inspired restaurants, owned by Yum! Brands, has launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12 per cent of Taco Bell's beef that is not actually beef. The company concedes that the ingredients in the 12 per cent 'signature recipe' have weird names - perfect for tongue twisters.' The meat of the matter: Taco Bell recently launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12per cent of its beef that is not really beef (pictured, the Doritos Locos tacos) Coming clean: The fast-food giant has admitted a few years ago that only 88 per cent of its beef is beef, leaving 12 per cent made up of flavoring and coloring agents . But the page goes on to say that all the items, many of which sound like they belong in a chemistry kit, 'are completely safe and approved by the FDA.' ‘They're common ingredients also found in food items at your grocery store,’ the company states. CelluloseA carbohydrate found in the cell walls of plants and helps with water and oil binding. Found in cheese, bread and pasta . TrehaloseA naturally occurring sugar used to improve the taste of seasoned beef . OatsUsed to help beef stay moist . Artificial flavorBlack pepper flavor added to enhance taste . Potassium chlorideA common salt substitute used in the food industry . Soy lecithinIt helps to bind substances that would otherwise separate. common in chocolate bars and salad dressings . MaltodextrinA form of mildly sweet sugar used to balance the flavor. Found in natural soda . Torula yeastA form of yeast that gives seasoned beef a more savory taste . Modified corn starch it's derived from corn and used as a thickener.  Common in foods like yogurt . Sodium phosphatesGives the beef the right texture. They're also commonly found in cheeses, coffee drinks and desserts . Citric acidUsed to add brighter flavor . Caramel color and cocoa powderCaramel color is caramelized sugar. Cocoa Powder doesn't add any flavor, but helps keep brown color in beef . Lactic acidThis acid occurs in almost all living things, and used to manage the acidity to get the right flavor . Source: Taco Bell . ‘Each ingredient helps make our Seasoned Beef taste great. Many of them are items you might use at home such as salt, peppers, and spices. Ingredients like oats and sodium phosphates help make sure the texture is right.’ According to Taco Bell, they start each of the 2billion tacos served up every year with USDA-inspected quality beef, then add water to keep it moist, toss in 'Mexican spies and flavors,' plus oats, yeast, citric acid and 'other ingredients' to ensure the consistency of their 'seasoned beef.' The company, however, insists on the site that the Taco Bell beef does not contain any fillers. In response to speculations that Taco Bell uses low-quality beef in its menu items, the explainer page indicates that the fast-food giant purchases 300million pounds of '100 per cent premium real beef, period.' So what is in Taco Bell's signature recipe, you ask? One of the components is torula yeast - a type of yeast that infuses plain beef a more savory falvor, according to the restaurant chain. Another ingredient is a naturally occurring sugar that goes by the not overly appetising name 'trehalose.' No serving of Taco Bell beef is complete without an artificial 'black pepper flavor,' a winning combination of caramel color and cocoa powder to make the meat appear more beefy, and modified corn starch. The online explainer helpfully points out that corn is a food staple in Mexican culture, adding that Taco Bell cooks add only a small amount of the starch as thickener. Also on the menu is maltodextrin - a 'mildly sweet sugar' added to balance the flavor - and sodium phosphates, which the company states are also found in cheeses, coffee drinks and desserts to make sure the foods 'the right texture.' ‘We believe it’s important that consumers make informed decisions about what they eat, and so for many years have provided details of our ingredients on our website,’ Taco Bell spokesman Rob Poetsch told ABCNews.com. Taco Bell's unexpected move toward greater transparency comes at a time when the company is trying to take on the McDonald’s juggernaut by offering its own breakfast menu. Taco Bell was forced to change its marketing practices and come clean about the ingredients in its lineup of Mexican favorites back in 2011 in response to a class-action lawsuit claiming that the chain's seasoned beef did not contain enough beef to justify the usage of that term.","Taco Bell says 88 per cent of its beef is actually beef, and the other 12 per cent is 'signature recipe'

"In an all-conquering Barcelona team full of Rolls-Royce midfielders and Ferrari forwards, being given the nickname ‘snowplough’ by Xavi could easily have been taken the wrong way, but Sergio Busquets is happy to accept it as a compliment. He’s been clearing all before him and creating the space so that others can play their football since his first-team debut under Pep Guardiola in 2008. Tuesday night’s Champions League game at the Etihad is a reminder of how Busquets played so well in his first season that Barcelona decided they didn’t need Yaya Toure and let him go to Manchester City for £24million. Sergio Busquets says that he's happy to clear space for his Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar . Busquets tackles Malaga's Sergio Barbosa during the La Liga game on Saturday at the Nou Camp . Busquets is all smiles in an interview ahead of the clash with Manchester City in the Champions League . At just 26, Sergio Busquets has already won 18 trophies: one World Cup, one European Championship, two Champions Leagues, four league titles and 10 other club cups. It also brings Busquets face to face with Spain team-mate David Silva, whom he doesn’t hesitate to identify as City’s greatest threat. ‘When they have to create danger they create a lot of danger, especially when the ball reaches Silva,’ he says. ‘He has that freedom of movement within the side and he uses it very well. He can really cause you problems and he has that final pass too.’ The two will be at close quarters on Tuesday night, with Silva trying to dominate the space in front of the Barcelona defence that Busquets has patrolled so well these last seven years. ‘You are right in the middle of things and so to a certain extent you have to control everything,’ he says, describing an art that seems lost to English football — who was our last great defensive midfielder? ‘You are there for the centre backs but also for the forwards because it’s your responsibility to bring the ball out. And defensively, positioning is everything. More than stopping the counter-attack when it happens you want to prevent it from starting. It’s more about being tactically astute than physically dominant. You need to know exactly where to be on the pitch at all times.’ When Busquets first took over from Toure in the centre of Barca’s three-man midfield he looked ponderous in possession but critics soon noticed he never lost the ball. ‘It can appear that I have waited too long to play the pass, but I’m just waiting to see if the options will change, they usually do,’ he says. ‘I play the way I am as a person. I don’t panic, I’m patient.’ Busquets tries to win the ball of Wellington Robson of Malaga (front) Busquets in action in 2009 alongside then team-mate Yaya Toure (right) and Carlos Tevez (centre) He had to be patient as a kid because there were no early signs of excellence and he certainly wasn’t fast-tracked through Barcelona’s La Masia academy. At least he never had a problem finding someone to go in goal during the kickabouts in his back yard. ‘We had a goalkeeper at home and we always wanted to take shots at him,’ he says of father Carlos, who was Barca’s first-choice keeper from 1994 to 1996. His first hero was Luis Figo and he was at the Nou Camp the night the Portuguese was thrown a pig’s head for having joined Real Madrid. ‘I was disappointed when he left the club. Then you grow up and become a player and you look at it differently. Everyone has to be in charge of their own destiny. You play where you want to play.’ That is also how he sees Toure’s switch to City, saying: ‘People were surprised we had sold one of the best players in his position in the world but it wasn’t just about the club wanting to sell. He decided to leave. He could have stayed.’ He doesn’t see Toure’s departure as a ‘personal victory’ but it’s difficult not to interpret it that way. Guardiola rubber-stamped the sale because he believed in the 20-year-old he first coached in the youth team. ‘For him to have been my first manager . . . it is impossible to better that,’ he says. ‘We see football the same way. He is the best I’ve had, and probably ever will have.’ Busquets considers David Silva (right) to be Manchester City's biggest threat to Barcelona . Busquets (left) celebrates Champions League victory with team-mates (left-right) Toure, Xavi, Carles Puyol, Bojan Krkic and Victory Valdes after they beat Manchester United 2-0 in Rome in May 2009 . Busquets began the 2008-09 season in the youth team playing away at Santa Eulalia in front of 1,500 spectators but he finished it in Rome’s Olympic Stadium, beating Manchester United 2-0 in the Champions League final. Was it just a case of playing the same way he had under Pep for the youth team? ‘You try to, but there is no escaping how different things are,’ he says. ‘In the fourth tier of Spanish football the pitches are small, the football is direct, and I wasn’t sat in the dressing room between the best midfield players in the world, Xavi and (Andres) Iniesta.’ With those three at the heart of the team Barca kept getting better and it is the Wembley final two years later, when they beat Manchester United 3-1, that he says marked their peak. ‘If you compare the two finals – the second was much better. We were more mature, stronger, and clearer about what we were trying to do.’ So can he make it to a third final? That will mean getting past Manchester City over two legs for the second season running. Saturday’s shock 1-0 defeat by Malaga, ending a run of 11 straight wins, was not the best preparation but he is not about to let one defeat crush their confidence and he believes City’s open style could suit Barcelona. ‘Malaga got their goal and then defended in numbers with two banks of four and it was almost impossible to attack them. City will want to play and they will be more open,’ Busquets says. ‘The team have reached this stage of the season in good shape physically. We have the best player in the world in Messi, and we have (Luis) Suarez and Neymar.’ Suarez 'gives us so much' according to Busquets of his team-mate who joined Barcelona in the summer . Busquets believes Suarez’s off-the-ball running has opened up spaces for Messi (left) and Neymar . Busquets has taken to Suarez: ‘He gives us so much,’ he says. ‘The numbers at the moment are not the same as they were at Liverpool but the way Barca play is not the way Liverpool play, he is not the player receiving the final pass as often.’ He believes Suarez’s off-the-ball running has opened up spaces for Messi and Neymar. ‘And it is not just the other two forwards who have benefited, but the whole team,’ he says. He also believes Suarez’s willingness to accept that Messi has to be numero uno has helped him settle. ‘Most of us understand that our reference is Leo. He is the one that makes the difference. He is the one who gives us something that other players can’t. And it is important for new players to know that and not let it affect them.’ The two players have spoken about the Premier League and although Barcelona are hopeful he will soon sign a contract extension until 2020 Busquets sounds tempted by the idea of playing in England at some point. ‘Perhaps when you play the same style of football for many years you can tire of it and the football in England is very different,’ he says. ‘I can’t say I’ll definitely play there because I’ve always said that I want to be here for many years but I would like to experience the Premier League one day.’ There would be no shortage of coaches coveting his services if he did switch — he has always been a ‘manager’s player’. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque once said that if he could come back again as any player, he’d ‘come back as Busquets’. That begs the question which player would he be if he could choose? Surely not the ‘snowplough’ who clears the way for the others to play, the guy who never gets the glory? Don’t count on it. ‘It’s not easy being Messi,’ Busquets says. ‘Let the strikers get the praise. I don’t think I would change anything. I think I would just be me.’","Sergio Busquets considers being Barcelona's 'snowplough' a compliment .

"Dallas Archer, 19, who smuggled a gun into a Tennessee prison in her genitals . A teenage girl tried to smuggle a loaded handgun into prison by hiding it in her genitals. Dallas Archer, 19, from Tennessee was taken to Kingsport jail by police after being arrested for driving with a suspended license. As she was searched before entering the facility, a female prison officer was alerted to an 'unknown object' in her crotch. After further examination, it was discovered she had concealed a loaded North American Arms 22 LR revolver in her genitals, according to a police report. A subsequent check showed that four-inch weapon, valued at $250 had been stolen in 2013. It previously belonged to 70-year-old retired car saleman, John Souther, who had it taken from his car, which was broken in to while parked at Kingsport carport. When told where the gun had been hidden, Mr Southern said he would eventually like the weapon back but it would require a 'bath in bleach', according to the website Smoking Gun. Archer was charged with gun possession and trying to introduce contraband into a penal facility. It is thought she was released from custody after posting a $6,000 bound.

"Ali Crawford's second-half strike gave Hamilton an historic 1-0 victory over Celtic as Accies enjoyed their first win at Parkhead in 76 years. The Hoops struggled for most of the first-half against a confident visiting side with returning striker John Guidetti missing the one real chance created. Hamilton midfielder Crawford stunned Celtic Park when he drove the visitors into the lead in the 49th minute before the visitors came under siege. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronny Deila's post-match comments . Hamilton's Ali Crawford wheels away after giving his side the lead against Celtic at Parkhead on Sunday . Crawford celebrates his winning goal with team-mate Dougie Imrie in the second half .

Goal: Crawford 49 . Booked: Gillespie 66, Neil 67 . Referee: Steven McLean . The champions huffed and puffed and missed numerous chances but Hamilton held on to record their first win in the east end of Glasgow since 1938 to go top of the table. Boos rang out around the stadium at full-time, most of them aimed at boss Ronny Deila who has struggled to convince the Hoops fans since taking over from Neil Lennon in the summer. This result will only provide further ammunition to his detractors. There was not a big crowd at Celtic Park but the home fans were glad to see the return of Guidetti. The Swedish striker, on loan from Manchester City, had missed the home Europa League win over Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday night as he was not registered in time for the competition but was the one change made by Deila, who dropped Aleksandar Tonev to the bench. When Accies' defender Stephen Hendrie crossed into the box within seconds of the kick-off - he found no takers - it demonstrated the visitors' confidence. Crawford points to the crowd as he and his team-mates run back to their half after the opening goal . Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) slides in on Tony Andreu of Hamilton during the Scottish Premiership match . The home side, wearing black armbands in honour of former player Hugh Doherty who passed away last week, took time to settle. Accies were breaking with purpose and in the 11th minute midfielder Anthony Andreu hooked a shot from the edge of the box over the bar. However, a minute later Guidetti should have opened the scoring when skipper Scott Brown headed into his path but he screwed his shot from 12 yards past the far post. The game remained tepid which suited Hamilton who remained neat and tidy in possession. Celtic's Efe Ambrose (left) is challenged by Danny Redmond near the technical areas at Parkhead . Hamilton's Grant Gillespie (left) puts in a challenge on John Guidetti during the match on Sunday afternoon . There was a burst of life on the half-hour mark when Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk's hooked cross was met by fellow centre back Jason Denayer, whose header was saved by former Celtic keeper Michael McGovern, who eventually scrambled the ball clear. Moments later, there was a half-hearted appeal for a penalty when Grant Gillespie challenged Guidetti but referee Steven McLean was unimpressed as were the Hoops fans when Brown stormed into the Accies box before failing to pick out a team-mate with his cross. The home side finished the half strongly with Stefan Johansen, Stokes and Brown all having efforts on goal. However, before the Scotland midfielder's drive was saved by McGovern, Denayer was dispossessed by lone striker Mickael Antoine-Curier and it needed the pace of Van Dijk to come to the rescue with a challenge at the edge of the box to concede a corner, the first of three in succession for Accies which came to nothing . Anthony Stokes (right) beats Hamilton's Dougie Imrie during Celtic's Scottish Premiership match on Sunday . Celtic fans sing during their side's match against Hamilton at Parkhead on Sunday . Guidetti had fired over the bar and Stokes had sent a weak effort towards McGovern before Accies took the lead. Hendrie's cross from the left arrived at the feet of Crawford all of a sudden a shot was on and - as Van Dijk challenged - the ball exploded low past Hoops keeper Craig Gordon and into the net. The goal shook up the Parkhead players and their supporters. Kris Commons' drive from the edge of the box drew a fine save from McGovern before Denayer had a close-range header blocked. Deila replaced Guidetti with Leigh Griffiths and Mubarak Wakaso with Tonev just after the hour mark, the home fans showing their displeasure at the Swede departing although he had been off colour. Green and white frustrations grew. Left-back Emilio Izaguirre passed when he should have shot and Stokes headed wide from close range, although Accies might have made it 2-0 in the 69th minute had substitute Louis Longridge, on for Danny Redmond, not opted to shoot when Andreu was better placed, the fruitless corner being scant consolation. Celtic continued their ineptitude in front of goal - another Stokes miss with a header was quite astonishing - with Accies regaining confidence and seeing out the game for an incredible victory.","Celtic have struggled so far this season and sat sixth in the Scottish Premiership going into the game .

"Amanda Knox is unlikely ever to return to Italy, despite the country’s highest court ordering her to face a retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year. Judges accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case, quashing the acquittal of 25-year-old Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29. Scroll down for video . Retrial: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle on Sunday . Questions: Meredith Kercher's sister Stephanie Kercher, 29,  left, said at her family's home in Coulsdon, Surrey, said: 'There are a lot of unanswered questions still'. Right, her sister before her 2007 death . In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, . who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared, were . told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old . British student. Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her . home town of Seattle, Washington, cannot be compelled by Italian law to . appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at . all. Her lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said: . ‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial. Her home is in . Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’ He added that the decision to order a . new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he . said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’ Within minutes of the ruling, Knox . issued a statement condemning it. The girl known worldwide by her . self-awarded nickname Foxy Knoxy said: ‘It was painful to receive the . news that the Italian supreme court decided to send my case back for . revision when the prosecution’s theory of my involvement in Meredith’s . murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and . unfair. Meredith's sister Stephanie and mother Arline welcomed the news about the retrial on Tuesday . Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds DNA evidence was flawed . ‘I believe that any questions as to my innocence must be examined by an objective investigation and a capable prosecution. ‘The prosecution responsible for the . many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for . Raffaele’s sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith’s . family.’ Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone . soon after yesterday’s verdict. Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie . Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’ She added that her . boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to . anyone. Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, . Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She . was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the . picturesque hilltop town of Perugia. Her throat had been slit and her . semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in . Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December . 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively, . But two years later the pair were . freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA . evidence contaminated. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA . and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a . 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal. Meredith’s family welcomed yesterday’s . judgment. Her sister Stephanie said: ‘We are never going to be happy . about any outcome because we have still lost Meredith but we obviously . support the decision and hope to get answers from it. There are still so . many unanswered questions. All we have ever wanted to do is do what we . can for Meredith and to find out the truth of what happened that night.’ Knox had rejoiced after her conviction . was sensationally overturned in 2011. She fled Italy within hours, . returning home to the US, where she quickly embraced life as a free . woman. She now shares a flat with boyfriend James Terrano, a classical . guitarist, and is studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, . where she can be near her parents and three sisters. The former student is preparing for . the publication next month of  a memoir for which she has been paid a . reported £2.5million.

Sollecito remained in Italy and is studying . robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already released a . book about his experience. In it he said that he and Knox were still in . touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype . regularly. Sollecito’s lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said: ‘We are still strong. This is not a sentence in itself: this is just an annulment.’ Knox’s appeal against her conviction . for slander – for having falsely accused her boss Patrick Lumumba of the . murder – was rejected. She has already served the three-year prison . sentence for that conviction, but was ordered to pay Lumumba €4,000 in . costs. The retrial will be held in Florence, with different judges, to avoid accusations of prejudice against the accused pair. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder . Rudy Guede was identified by police after his bloody fingerprint was found on a cushion at the scene of the crime. The . 21-year-old Ivory Coast national had given his fingerprints when he . applied for an Italian identity card several years earlier. He was known to police as a petty thief and small time drug dealer. Guede . had arrived in Italy in 1992 as a five year-old child with his father . Roger, who left his wife behind in west Africa to seek work in Italy . where he had a sister. But . when Guede was 15 Roger went back to Africa, leaving his son behind in . the care of, remarkably, a multi-millionaire Paolo Caporali who had . occasionally employed the boy in odd jobs. In . the summer of 2007, Guede rented a flat in the centre of Perugia and . became friendly with four male students who lived in the flat below Miss . Kercher and Knox. In . September and October Guede was linked to three break-ins - two in . Perugia and one in Milan. He also carried out another break-in at the . offices of a local lawyer in Perugia and at the end of October he was . arrested in Milan after breaking into a school. Following the murder he fled Perugia and went to Germany on a train. He was arrested there and extradited back to Italy. In . October 2008 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murder and . sexual assault of Miss Kercher after opting for a fast-track trial. The day before his arrest on suspicion of Meredith Kercher's murder, Patrick Lumumba had been handing out flyers publicising a candlelit vigil in her memory. Mr Lumumba, a well-known and popular figure in Perugia for a decade, . was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is believed to be . related to murdered Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba. He arrived . in Italy legally in 1988. Married with a young child, he opened a . bar and restaurant called Le Chic on a narrow street in Perugia town . centre in August 2007. The same month that Miss Kercher arrived to begin a . short Italian course. He employed her housemate Amanda Knox to help him with promotional work, before firing her for flirting with customers. He believes Knox took her revenge by framing him for Miss Kercher's murder. Mr . Lumumba was arrested on suspicion of causing her death on November 6. He spent two weeks in prison before being able to prove that he spent . the night of the killing talking to a customer in his pub. In 2009  he sued Knox for wrongly accusing him of the crime.","Meredith, 21, was found dead in the house she and Knox shared in Perugia .

"After keeping a clean sheet during 180 minutes of football against Barcelona this season Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni knows a thing or two about stopping the world’s most expensive forward line. When Barcelona drew 0-0 at La Rosaleda earlier in the season they failed to muster a shot on target and Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were frustrated again on Saturday. ‘We knew that Barcelona are very good at getting in behind teams and reaching the byline so we were very aware of trying to send them inside at every opportunity so that they couldn’t hurt us down the wings,’ the goalkeeper  said after his side’s 1-0 victory.

Barcelona forward Suarez jumps in frustration after bein foiled by Malaga goalkeeper Kameni . Malaga set up with two banks of four players and left very little space for Barcelona to play between the lines. The tactic proved so effective that at times Luis Enrique’s side resorted to hitting long diagonal balls into the box, which proved meat and drink for the 6ft 1in keeper Kameni. There was plenty of food for thought for Manuel Pellegrini but Barcelona defender Jordi Alba dismissed the idea his Manchester City team could use the Malaga blueprint on how to beat Barcelona. He said: ‘Pellegrini was at Malaga before (for three seasons as manager from 2010) and I think they still have some of the habits that he instilled there, but City have very dangerous forward players and I don’t think they will close up at the back the way Malaga did.’ Kameni (left) jumps and attempts to get the ball from Barcelona defender Gerard Pique (right) Kameni jumps in for a ball with Barcelona striker Suarez in an attempt to punch away .","Malaga beat Barcelona 1-0 at the Nou Camp in La Liga on Saturday .

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored in his 14th consecutive home game as Real Madrid made light work of beating Athletic Bilbao. He also made it an incredible 22 league hat-tricks equalling the record held by Alfredo di Stefano and Telmo Zarra. The 5-0 victory was a BBC production with 'Bale, Benzema and Cristiano' too much for the visitors – Gareth Bale set up two of Ronaldo's goals and Karim Benzema also scored twice with Ronaldo taking yet another match ball home. 'We are still getting better, this is still the start of the season' said the record breaking scorer. 'The BBC is working well. We are used to playing together and we keep scoring goals.

If Ronaldo makes it 15 straight home matches scoring, Barcelona will be the victims with the season's first clasico the next Santiago Bernabeu fixture. Real will play Liverpool once either side of the Barça game and with 17 goals in 11 games so far this season Ronaldo is in frightening form. It took him all of two minutes to score the first, heading in Bale's right-footed cross. Cue a celebratory dance involving Ronaldo, Marcelo and James Rodriguez – it might just as well have been a victory jig such is Athletic's woeful record against Real Madrid. They have now lost on their last ten visits to the Santiago Bernabeu. Bale then nearly laid the second on a plate for Karim Benzema who missed the chance. He was defended before the game by coach Carlo Ancelotti against the suggestion that he needs to work harder but the former Tottenham man was certainly putting in a shift as Real continued to dominate albeit with limited success against an Athletic side playing the offside trap well and catching out Real nine times in the first half hour. The offside trap couldn't save them on four minutes before the half time whistle however when Benzema climbed above everyone else in the Athletic Bilbao six-yard box to head home Real's second from a Modric corner. Rafael Varane replaced Sergio Ramos at half time with the defender withdrawn complaining of a calf muscle. Real allowed Athletic two early corners but were soon threatening on the counter attack with Ronaldo racing clear and setting up Bale who blazed over. He made amends 10 minutes into the second half with an assist for Ronaldo's second goal. Ronaldo controls the ball as he speeds towards Athletic Bilbao players at the Bernabeu stadium .

It was pure BBC as Benzema sent Bale galloping down the right and he crossed for Cristiano to score. Athletic had a rare opportunity at the other end but Iker Casillas got down sharply to his left to prevent Ibai Gomez' effort beating him at his near post. Benzema got his second and Madrid's fourth from Ronaldo's cross and it was show of selflessness from the Portuguese on a hat-trick but squaring the ball to his often criticized team-mate. It was Ronaldo's 50th assist in a Madrid shirt. He threatened to grab his hat-trick with a header from Carvajal's cross but it was saved by Gorka Iraizoz. Moments later he had the third although he knew little about it, turning Pepe's shot in with his hip amid complaints from Athletic players that the ball had also touched his elbow. Despite it being the fifth in an easy win, and also slightly fortuitous, Ronaldo celebrated it with all the usual gusto. He now has 13 goals this season in the league and 17 in total. With the double-header against Liverpool on the horizon and Barcelona the next visitors to the Bernabeu he could not be in better form.

"A Diego Maradona connection is one of the many thing that unites them – one has always been made to feel like the Son of God in Argentina - the closest thing the country has ever had to its most famous No 10. While the other used to be the son-in-law of God married to Diego's daughter Giannina. They are like brothers when they meet up with the Argentine national team and both would have loved to have played for the same club side. But on Tuesday Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero will be the best of enemies as they face each other at the Etihad Stadium. It was just two weeks ago when, despite the proximity of Tuesday’s match, Aguero made the most of a free-weekend created by Manchester City’s elimination from the FA Cup to fly with partner Karina Tejada to Barcelona and spend the weekend with Messi and his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo. Sergio Aguero and Lionel Messi are very good friends but will be opposite sides on Tuesday night . Messi and Aguero at Euston Station ahead of Argentina's game with Portugal at Old Trafford in 2014 . The girlfriends are close, as are the sons. Messi’s son Thiago was given a baby-Argentina full strip by Aguero shortly after he was born and Messi is like a godfather to Benjamin, the son Aguero had with Giannina. Messi wrote the foreward to Aguero’s recent autobiography and if Messi and Antonella finally get married this summer, as has been speculated, then Aguero would be short odds to be his best man – once the pair have gone about the business of trying to win the Copa America in Chile this June. Their talent has brought them together on the international stage but the two men had very different beginnings. Aged 15, Aguero was making his debut in the merciless Argentine first division for the club he had always supported, Independiente. Both Aguero and Messi have been in good goalscoring form for their teams this season . Messi was already at Barcelona’s La Masia youth academy at the time living the dream of playing alongside Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique training in the shadow of the Nou Camp with aspirations of making it to the first team one day. Aguero had grown up in the tough La Villa Itati neighbourhood – a densely populated criss-cross of dark alleys and narrow streets where 50,000 of Argentina’s poorest people tried to eke out a living and where he shared a two-bedroom corrugated iron and concrete prefab with father Leonel, mother Adriana and six siblings. Messi comes from slightly more affluent beginnings and it was a distant relative in Cataluña that helped enable him and his father Jorge to travel to the Catalan capital when the boy was just 13 and take a trial with one of the biggest clubs in world football. Messi runs out to train at the Etihad Stadium on the eve of Barcelona's clash with Manchester City . Messi and Gerard Pique share a joke and looked relaxed during training . Their very different paths eventually converged in 2005 at the Under 20 World Cup in Holland. In the pre-tournament squad meet-up legend has it that Aguero became a figure of fun in the team canteen when he failed to recognize Messi, who had already become the most famous young footballer on the planet. Aguero asked ‘who’s that?’ to the amazement of his team-mates and when the two players were finally introduced their first conversion involved Aguero commenting that his middle name Leonel was the same (more or less) as Lionel. Perhaps Messi was already getting sick of being noticed and, delighted that the other had not recognised him, took to Sergio immediately. Aguero (right) prepares for the Barcelona game with Wilfried Bony and James Milner . Aguero (centre) and Fernando (right) share a joke as  manager Manuel Pellegrini watches on . They became pals as Argentina won the tournament beating Nigeria in the final with Messi scoring twice and Aguero playing the last half an hour as a substitute. The won Olympic gold together in Beijing in 2008 and are room-mates at every tournament for their country. When Aguero moved to Atletico Madrid they began to play against each other with various meeting between their respective sides that usually ended with Messi coming out on top. Aguero would invariably find the back of the net in defeat however – he scored five goals in 12 meetings against Barcelona. Messi has the better of Aguero when the pair met while both playing in Spain . The front of Spanish papers Mundo Deportivo and Sport preview Tuesday's game . In total Messi has won eight of the 11 encounters between the two players. But those meetings all came when Aguero was still at Atletico Madrid. Last year he was injured and never faced his great friend. The question both will be asking now is: ‘Will the script change with Aguero in the sky blue of Manchester City?’","Argentina team-mates Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero will line up on opposite sides when Barcelona travel to Manchester City .

"A second female employee at the Washington County Jail in Hillsboro, Oregon, has been accused of having sex with the same inmate — a man held on charges that include failing to register as a sex offender. Brett Robinson, 32, was arrested Tuesday after a grand jury indicted her on charges of custodial sexual misconduct. She was later released after posting $120,000 bail. The revelation comes about a month after Washington County Jail employee Jill Curry, 38, was arrested on similar charges. 'Romantic rivals:' Brett Robinson (left), 32, a staffer at an Oregon jail, was arrested August 19 for allegedly having sex with the same inmate who allegedly had a trsyt with her colleague, Jill Curry, (right) 38, who was arrested last month . The Oregonian reported that both women worked as civilian jail service technicians whose duties included booking and control room operations. The Washington County sheriff's office said it is reviewing jail operations in light of the allegations against its staff. A spokesman, Sgt. Bob Ray, said Curry and Robinson did not know about one another's contact with the inmate. The jail holds 572 inmates and has a staff of 180 corrections deputies and civilian workers. Jill Curry, 38, was arrested July 16 on charges of first-degree custodial misconduct with an inmate. During her arraignment three weeks later, the long-time jail employee was charged with more than two dozen criminal counts, including identity theft. She pleaded not guilty and is due back in court next Monday, reported Hillsboro Tribune. The 38-year-old woman has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004. Curry's indictment stated that the jail staffer had sex numerous time with the inmate in question between May 25 and July 3. Mrs Curry is married to a sheriff's deputy, who has since filed for divorce. According to officials, the allegations against Brett Robinson came to light as a result of the Curry investigation. ‘I consider allegations that involve a second Jail staff member in this case extraordinarily serious,’ said Sheriff Pat Garrett. ‘Addressing these issues demands immediate changes and a thorough, holistic review of protocols within the jail. Both efforts are under way. ‘ . Robinson, who has been working at the jail since January 2013, was placed on administrative leave July 30. The following day, she was placed on unpaid leave based on the facts of the case. The sheriff's office has been tight-lipped about the details of the investigations concerning Curry and Robinson, declining to specify where and under what circumstances the alleged sexual encounters took place. The name of the inmate at the center of the controversy has not been released, but sheriff's officials revealed that he is facing a slew of charges in connection to four separate cases. The unidentified suspect, who is listed as a victim in the probes of the two jail employees, is accused of failing to register as a sex offender; tempering with a witness; sexual harassment and second-degree assault.","Brett Robinson, 32, a staffer at Washington County Jail in Oregon, is facing custodial sexual misconduct charges .

"Host commentator . The Roy Hodgson press conference has now drawn to a close for the broadcast media (the rest will be under embargo for tonight) and so that's where we'll end our rolling coverage as well. For full details of the 23-man squad selected by the England manager this afternoon, click here. And to see a profile of each of the 23 players selected, click here. 'The squad has changed due to injury. We lost four players who were clearly in our thoughts. Theo Walcott, Jay Rodriguez and Kyle Walker. So my list has changed quite a few times.' Hodgson, sat in the Vauxhall car factory, has just been asked whether the England squad is a 'family saloon' or a 'sports car'. He replied simply that he was 'very happy to drive it.' Hodgson adds that Wayne Rooney will bring his own physios with him when on holiday this week to ensure his groin injury doesn't get in the way. When asked whether it was a concern, Rooney said: If it's up to wayne then there's no doubt. In this week where I've told them to forgot about football he has brought physios with him to make sure he is right for when we meet.' On possible injury problems: 'The only player who poses a question is Phil Jones. But my research points to it being a three week injury.' He adds that John Stones will be his replacement if Jones does not make the injury deadline of June 2. On the decision to include Frank Lampard: ' Frank has been captain of the team, and also vice captain to Steven Gerrard. His leadership qualities and his ability will help. He is a very important part of the England set up. 'It would be wrong to focus on the young and less experienced players. We have a lot of experience in this team' On the decision to leave out Ashley Cole, Hodgson said: 'It was an incredibly hard decision. Everyone knows what Ashley Cole is. I am unbelievably grateful for the gracious way he took the decision. Circumstances will prove if it is the right one. 'Luke Shaw has had a wonderful season and has captured the headlines with his form and his ability.' Roy Hodgson is now giving his press conference. He says: 'It's a big day for me.

"I had to laugh this week when people started writing Steven Gerrard off. Liverpool have a few bad results and all of a sudden it’s his fault? Don’t be ridiculous. Gerrard has bailed his team out so many times and if there is a better player who can do that job for Liverpool then I’ve yet to see him. Yes, he will need to be rested at times but there’s a big difference between being rested and being dropped. Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge has been injured, so there are reasons why they are struggling. But it’s so easy to jump on the bandwagon and say people are finished. It’s just lazy. Scroll down for video . Steven Gerrard (left) curls in his free-kick against Everton and answers his critics . Gerrard celebrates his derby goal against Everton in front of his adoring Liverpool fans . Ask any professional: would you rather play Liverpool with or without Steven Gerrard? There will only be one answer. Wayne Rooney's wild challenge on Stewart Downing was cynical and unnecessary. But the truth is he could even have hurt himself. Paul Gascoigne did something similar while playing for Spurs against Nottingham Forest in the 1991 FA Cup final. He went lunging in on Gary Charles and ended up rupturing his own cruciate ligament in his knee. I have done plenty of stupid things on a football field but it was rash, particularly after such a good first half. Now Rooney misses three matches including a big clash against Chelsea. With competition so fierce, he will hate being out of the team. That edge has always been a big part of Wayne’s game. It’s part of what makes him a winner and you don’t want to take that away but he needs to show greater responsibility, especially as captain. Rooney has been quoted as saying United can still win the title. I’m not convinced they can but what else is the captain of Manchester United going to say? It would be more surprising if he had already given up after six games. Wayne Rooney was reckless when he kicked out at Stewart Downing and was sent off on Saturday . Paul Gascoigne injured himself fouling Gary Charles in the 1991 FA Cup final . Edin Dzeko scored two superb goals against Hull, including a fantastic strike from distance that our graphic shows. With Alvaro Negredo gone, City need all their strikers firing and Dzeko is invaluable. The Bosnian is now something of an away-day specialist. He doesn’t score too many against the top teams, but he’s so good in those scrappy games when you need to break down the opposition, as the chart below shows. After the start Southampton have made, there are plenty of players in that side worthy of praise. But one who is starting to stand out is Sadio Mane. He looks absolutely electric. He cost the best part of £12million, so you would expect some big performances from him but there is always a question over foreign signings — can they handle life in the Premier League? From what I’ve seen so far, he looks perfect for it. Mane loves cutting in from that left flank, is quick as lightning and is never short of end product. I like what I’m seeing and if he carries on, he has the potential to rip this league apart. At 23 years old, people might wonder why it’s taken so long for Ryan Mason to get his chance. The truth is Spurs have always had high hopes, but injuries have prevented him from playing regularly. League debuts don’t come much tougher than starting away against your fiercest rivals but he acquitted himself well. He’s quick and can turn defence into attack in an instant — something that’s at a premium these days with counter-attacking so important. Younes Kaboul also deserves credit. I was speaking to Sol Campbell in the Sky studio and we agreed he’s got all the attributes to be a top defender, but concentration can let him down. Saturday was the best I’ve seen him play in a long time. Edin Dzeko celebrates scoring his second goal for Manchester City against Hull on Saturday . Saido Mane, being fouled by Sandro against QPR, has made an electric start to life at Southampton . Neil Warnock congratulates Jason Puncheon after Crystal Palace's win against Leicester . Neil Warnock might not have been the most popular appointment at Crystal Palace. I doubt if anyone is complaining now. They have had some excellent results and I like what he’s done with Jason Puncheon. After Puncheon’s angry tweets aimed at Warnock last season, it would have been easy to not involve him. But Puncheon is a match-winner and Warnock nipped any issues they had in the bud. You don’t stay in the game as long as Neil Warnock has without being able to handle difficult situations. He’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but he has made a good start and has Palace playing the same attacking football that served them so well last season.","Steven Gerrard isn't to blame for Liverpool's poor start this season .

"England embark on 12 months crammed with cricket knowing they still have much to do to show they have recovered from the year that ripped them apart. The tumultuous events of 2014, culminating with the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of a World Cup, give way to a non-stop diet of high profile competition that will make or break their still unproven new regime. Peter Moores left Heathrow on Tuesday with the prospect of his second coming as England coach being defined by how they fare during a year that includes a World Cup, the Ashes and high profile series against Pakistan and South Africa. England coach Peter Moores says sacking Alastair Cook as ODI captain was 'the right thing to do' Only if England make significant progress in the hectic months ahead will the jury that is still out on both Moores and managing director Paul Downton return not guilty verdicts on the massive changes that have swept through the game. The green shoots of recovery that saw England win three Tests against India must now fully blossom if the fall-out which claimed Andy Flower, Ashley Giles, Kevin Pietersen and, in one-day cricket at least, Cook is to prove fully justified. England, who left for Canberra yesterday and a pre-World Cup triangular series against Australia and India, are not expected to make much of an impact in the 50-over game that they still struggle to master after all these years. Yet if a mediocre World Cup – and they really should make the quarter-finals – is followed by stuttering form in the Caribbean and beyond then the rancour that has enveloped them since their Ashes debacle will claim yet more victims. Moores, who has had to take over on the back of two 5-0 thrashings by Australia, travels with England still adamant that they have the ‘outstanding coach of his generation’ at the helm for their busiest ever year. Moores, speaking before England flew to Australia, says the Cook decision was brave but necessary . Yet their backing for Cook, both publicly and privately, was total until they ruthlessly cut him adrift after the 5-2 one-day defeat in Sri Lanka so a vote of confidence in Moores will only stretch so far into the multiple challenges ahead. Moores is adamant that England travel with expectation as well as hope in their hearts. ‘We are going to Australia to win it,’ he said of his World Cup outsiders. ‘We know 2014 was tough, with the highlight of winning three Tests in a row against India, but we’ve not had a move forward yet in one-day cricket. ‘We will attack the tri-series and the World Cup with a view to making the public excited about watching England play. This trip will be about England winning and not us making excuses.’ This one-day venture will certainly be a tall order. Three and a half years of planning were ripped up when Cook was jettisoned at the last possible moment and replaced by a batsman in Eoin Morgan who is in even worse one-day form. England fast bowlers Chris Jordan (right) and James Anderson embrace before check-in on Tuesday . Moores was adamant that Cook was still the right man for the job right up to the fateful selection meeting last month when it became clear that the man England have invested so much in had finally run out of one-day chances. ‘The goal we set going back eight months was to have the best 15 players going to the tri-series and then the World Cup. I think we’ve got that but unfortunately for Alastair he missed out at the last part of that,’ said Moores. ‘It’s a tough one on Alastair but we can look back and say he had every opportunity to try to get himself on the plane. Plans are there to be changed at times. We’d got to a position where it felt like the right thing to do. ‘It was a brave decision to change it, we moved on as a set of selectors and I’m comfortable with that. I think we’ve got the right people on the plane and we’ve got to go there now and perform. We saw some good individual performances in Sri Lanka but it is the team’s performance that counts now and we’ve got to go there with a strong focus to try to win the World Cup.’ Cook (left) remains England's Test skipper and will lead the side to the West Indies after the World Cup . The scale of their task is summed up by the fact that four players who could feature in their first choice team – Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor and Gary Ballance - have 37 one-day caps between them while a key figure for group opponents Sri Lanka in Mahela Jayawardene has almost 400 more on his own. Yet England changed tact late on before their 2010 World Twenty20 victory and their chances of causing an upset this time cannot really be harmed by the promotion of a canny and imaginative captain in Morgan. ‘It will be exciting to work with Eoin and I think he’ll bring a lot to the team,’ said Moores. ‘I think he’ll be a straight-forward captain which will be a good thing for us and will have a strong desire to go out there and show not only what he can do but also what the team can do. ‘Eoin had a great time the last time he went to Australia with England and he’ll be desperately keen to make sure he fires as captain. He’s not only a fantastic one-day player but also has a one-day mind-set in the way he goes about his cricket. He’ll certainly be up for the challenge.’ Eoin Morgan, who's been playing for the Big Bash's Sydney Thunder, will lead England at the World Cup . It is fascinating to ponder how many of England’s players will still be standing this time next year after a gruelling schedule put together by greedy administrators with no thought to the well-being of players nor the quality of the product that spectators pay good money for. Yet Moores was bullish about 12 months ahead that Stuart Broad for one calculates will see him spend 321 nights in hotel rooms if he somehow manages to stay fit and well for all the cricket that lies ahead in all its forms. ‘My message to the players is let’s go for it, get in there, and play good, hard cricket,’ said Moores. ‘And let’s enjoy representing our country. That goes for the whole year and if at any time anybody feels they can’t do that then let’s move them on because that’s what playing for your country is all about.’ The next 12 months will decide whether Moores is still around to make the same rallying call this time next year.

"Barcelona have one foot in the Spanish Cup final after beating Villarreal 3-1 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night. The second leg of the semi-final should be a formality and they continue to show the sort of form that will have Real Madrid nervously looking over their shoulder in the league where the difference is just one point. Barca’s front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez have now scored more goals in 2015 than the entire Madrid team. Messi got one here and Neymar should have added to his tally but missed from the spot. Suarez did not score but was involved in two of the three goals as Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique also scored to record their 10th consecutive victory in all competitions.

Subs not used: Carlos, Campbell, Dorado, Moreno . Goals: Trigueros (48) Bookings: Pina, Ruiz, Musacchio . Villarreal looked like they had come to not lose too heavily and give themselves a chance in the second leg. They defended deeply and Barcelona struggled to break them down for most of the first half. Suarez was found by Dani Alves at the back post but failed to get any direction on the finish. He then just failed to connect with a Messi cross as Barça continued to take the game to the visitors. There was even a rare sliced effort from Messi as Barcelona looked for the first goal. When it came it did come from Messi but it was Suarez who took the plaudits. He chased down Mateo Mussachio robbing the Argentine before scurrying into the penalty area with Messi now in support. The old Liverpool Suarez would have gone for goal but he dutifully played the Argentine in and with crisp finish he put Barcelona 1-0 ahead. The crowd responded by singing the assist provider’s name and not Messi’s. Messi almost returned the favour immediately but Suarez just pulled his cross-shot wide of Sergio Asenjo’s goal. Villarreal had offered little going forward but still could have gone in level but for the brilliance of Marc Andre Ter Stegen. The German got down sharply to his right to stop Luciano Vietto’s shot from Denis Cheryshev’s cross. If he ended the half brightly Ter Stegen started the second period by picking the ball out of the back of his net after substitute Manu Trigueros had hit a spectacular shot from distance that left the keeper with no chance. Barcelona’s response was immediate. Suarez was again involved in the build-up playing a one-two inside the penalty area with Iniesta. The midfielder tried a second wall pass. This time the ball came back off of full-back Mario into the path of Iniesta once more and he made it 2-1. Andres Iniesta of Barcelona celebrates after scoring during the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg match against Villarreal . Suarez reaches for the ball during the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg at the Nou Camp . Neymar was in action for Barcelona as they won the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg . On 70 minutes Barça made it three and this time Gerard Pique did the damage. Musacchio was all over the Barcelona defender but Pique held him off, and rose above him to bury a header past Asenjo. It should then have been three with Barcelona fizzing the ball around in the Villarreal penalty area until it cannoned off of Musacchio’s hand for a penalty. Messi allowed Neymar to take the kick and regretted it as the Brazilian followed an elaborate run-up with a weak shot that was saved by Asenjo. Suarez was booked for dissent late on and could have added a fourth when he shot from inside the centre-circle but the ball bounced just wide of Asenjo's empty goal. The last missed chances will surely not affect the tie. Barcelona should progress when the two play the second leg in the first week of March. They look like going from crisis to Cup Final in just three months. Gerard Pique runs away in celebration after scoring at the Nou Camp for Barcelona .

"It was a job advert designed to find the best mathematical minds in the country by hiding a phone number inside a complicated numerical puzzle. But the Royal Australian Air Force, which posted the ad, has been left red-faced after failing to spot a mistake in the numbers, therefore making the puzzle insolvable. The typos were eventually spotted by users of the website Reddit and the formula has now been corrected. A job advert for an engineer at the Royal Australian Air Force was meant to hide its recruitment phone number inside a maths puzzle. The first four terms shown in the formula added together give this number but the final terms should have then equaled zero. The two typos, highlighted, made the task impossible . According to Business Insider Australia (BIA), the Defence Force recruiters got the formula from a University of Melbourne professor. The Force told the website that the formula was designed as a 'means of driving engagement, and not a formal test.' The site said: 'That’s good, because the formula – which involves infinite sums, integrals, complicated trigonometry and imaginary numbers – doesn’t produce the intended phone number.' Reddit users solved the first four terms shown in the formula and added them together to get the Defence Jobs phone number of 131901. Defence Force Recruiting has since corrected the formula on its website, pictured, by replacing sin 2 x with sin(2x) in the third to last line, and (2k-1)! with (2k+1)! in the penultimate line. The Force thanked the Reddit members who spotted the mistake, adding: 'you are exactly the kind of people we'd be looking for' However, they discovered that the remaining terms were meant to equate to zero but two typos in the formula made this impossible. The incorrect formula showed 'sin to the power of two x' when it should have read sin(2x). To get zero in the penultimate line the formula should have said (2k+1)! instead of (2k-1)! Defence Force Recruiting has since corrected the formula and told BIA: 'Our original formula included two small typos, which we have now fixed. 'We hope people still enjoy the inherent fun and hidden challenges. 'Our thanks go to the eagle-eyed Reddit users who spotted them first; you are exactly the kind of people we’d be looking for.'","The Australian Air Force posted a job advert looking for a engineer .

"Babies are being medicated in the womb in an attempt to prevent them from being  born obese. In a world first, dangerously overweight mothers-to-be in four British cities have started taking a diabetes drug during their pregnancy. The doctors behind the controversial NHS trial say that obesity among pregnant women is reaching epidemic proportions and they need to act now to protect the health of tomorrow's children. Overweight mothers-to-be are being allowed to take diabetes drugs to treat their unborn children in the womb to prevent them being born obese . However, there is likely to be unease about resorting to medication in pregnancy for a problem that can be treated through changes in diet and exercise. If the strategy is a success, the treatment could be in widespread use in as little as five years, with tens of thousands of overweight but otherwise healthy mothers-to-be drugged each year. The Daily Mail recently revealed the rise of the 'sumo baby', with the number of newborns weighing more than 11lb soaring by 50 per cent over the last four years. More than 15 per cent of pregnant women are obese. This raises their odds of dying in pregnancy, of their baby being stillborn and of a host of pregnancy complications, some of which can be fatal. Big babies are around twice as likely to grow into overweight adults, suggesting obesity and the lifetime of ill-health it can bring is 'programmed' in the womb. The trial involves 400 pregnant women in Liverpool, Coventry, Sheffield and Edinburgh. They have started taking metformin, which has been safely used by diabetics for decades and is cleared for the treatment of diabetes in pregnancy. It costs just pence per tablet. Doctors say if the NHS trial is successful the treatment could be in widespread use in as little as five years . Some of the participants have already had their babies but many more births will be needed before it is clear if the treatment works. Mothers-to-be elsewhere are due to take part. The study aims to exploit the ability of metformin to lower levels of the hormone insulin in the bloodstream. Obese women make more insulin than other mothers-to-be and this leads to a greater nutrition supply reaching the baby. Research shows big babies are around twice as likely to grow into overweight adults . It is hoped that lowering levels of insulin will reduce the supply and so cut the odds of babies being born obese. Treatment with metformin may redistribute the baby's fat stores, reducing the deposits around the liver and other organs. Study leader Professor Jane Norman of Edinburgh University said: 'One of the challenges is that many women feel perfectly healthy but there is very good evidence that women who are obese have an increased risk of pregnancy problems and their babies are at risk, and we'd like to reduce that risk.' Addressing concerns about unborn babies being medicated for a problem that many would say could be treated by diet and exercise, she said: 'I absolutely support the improvement of diet and encouraging exercise. 'But we are increasingly faced with women who start their pregnancy obese. Saying at that stage to eat less and exercise more is not particularly helpful.' Obesity experts have welcomed the study, which is funded by the Medical Research Council, the NHS's health research arm and the baby charity Tommy's, saying that while the situation is not ideal, it needs to be tackled. Patrick O'Brien of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists described the study as 'very important'. He said: 'When you are overweight in pregnancy you are at increased risk of just about every complication you can think of.'","NHS trial has been started in attempt to halt obesity epidemic .

"It's already been a huge sporting year, with the World Cup, Winter Olympics and Glasgow's Commonwealth Games delighting millions of  fans around the world. But there's one more genuine spectacular still to come, this week's Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, with old rivals Europe and the United States set to do battle once again. Sportsmail's nostalgic picture series Golden Years this week focuses on the Ryder Cup, taking you on a journey that spans the best part of a century, from the first contest in 1927 through to Europe's memorable win on American soil in 2012. Along the way we show you some charming pictures from those early contests, along with some of the iconic moments like Bernhard Langer's missed putt. And many of the sport's all-time greats are here too, like Jack Nicklaus, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Watson and Nick Faldo. If you wish to share your memories, please leave a comment beneath this article, and we'll be back on a football theme next Wednesday, with  more pictures from archives. Here's a picture of the Great Britain team about to catch the train at the beginning of a long journey to Worcester Country Club, Massachusetts, for the first Ryder Cup in 1927. From left to right: George Duncan, Archie Compston, captain Ted Ray, Fred Robson, Sam Ryder (with dog), the English businessman that is credited with the founding of the event, George Gadd, Charles Whitcombe, Arthur Havers, Abe Mitchell, and team manager George Philpot. The USA were the winners of that first contest . Above, a picture of American great Gene Sarazen in action during the second Ryder Cup at the Moortown Golf Club in Leeds. Sarazen is one of only five golfers in the sport's history to have won all four of the current majors.  Hosts Great Britain were 7-5 winners of that second contest. Below, Britain's Abe Mitchell, in action during the 1929 event, shows that golf clothing has changed somewhat over the last century . Samuel Ryder (left) presents the Ryder Cup trophy to winning captain, Great Britain's George Duncan, after victory over the USA in 1929. Ryder donated the trophy, which was valued at 100 guineas. Scot Duncan, who played in the first three Ryder Cups, won the Open Championship in 1920. Below, Britain's Dai Rees putts on the 18th green at the Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club during the 1937 Ryder Cup. The Americans won 8-4, the first time the hosts had lost in the event . The scoreboard is being changed during the 1933 Ryder Cup at the Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club. Just a two-day event back then, victory once more went to the hosts, with Great Britain claiming a win by the narrow margin of six-and-a-half points to five-and-a-half . Above, American Fred Haas plays out of a bunker during his singles clash with Harry Bradshaw at the 1953 version at Wentworth. Henry Cotton's home team lost out to the Americans in a close contest, the winners victorious by six-and-a-half to five-and-a-half. Below, Great Britain captain Dai Rees holds aloft the Ryder Cup after a seven-and-a-half to four-and-a-half win at Rotherham's Lindrick Golf Club in 1957. However, there then came a period of dominance by the Americans . You may recognise the man in the above picture - it's the voice of golf for generations, Peter Alliss, teeing off on the first hole at Birkdale during the 1965 Ryder Cup. This match was typical of many at the time, with the Americans making it a virtual non-contest with an 18-11 win . Jack Nicklaus, still widely seen as the greatest golfer of all time, plays a shot on the third hole at Royal Birkdale during the 1969 Ryder Cup. Right, Nicklaus shakes hands with Tony Jacklin after famously and sportingly conceding a putt, to ensure the 1969 contest finished in a 16-16 draw. It was the first drawn contest in Ryder Cup history . Above, a picture of Englishman Peter Butler celebrating after making the first hole in one in Ryder Cup history at Muirfield in 1973. Below, one of British golf's all-time heroes, Nick Faldo, celebrating his singles win over Tom Watson at the 1977 Ryder Cup at Royal Lytham & St Annes. This was Faldo's first Ryder Cup, and he carried on playing in the contest until 1997, with 11 appearances in all. He also captained Europe at the 2008 Ryder Cup . Left, Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus pictured during the 1981 Ryder Cup at Walton Heath. Great Britain and Ireland were replaced by Europe for the 1979 contest, but there was no immediate effect. The Americans won in 1981 by 18-and-a-half to nine-and-a-half points. The long wait for an American defeat was ended in 1985 at The Belfry. Right, a celebrating Sam Torrance holds his arms aloft after sinking a putt to claim a singles win over Andy North and clinch victory for Europe . The 1985 Ryder Cup proved to be a glorious one for the Europeans, with Tony Jacklin captaining the hosts to victory at The Belfry. The Americans were beaten in the contest for the first time since 1957. Here, Jacklin celebrates with members of the team - the man spraying the champagne is all-time great and Ryder Cup hero Seve Ballesteros. In the background is Sam Torrance and Bernhard Langer . The enduring image of the 1987 contest is surely this, Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal dancing. His partnership with compatriot Seve Ballesteros proved to be an inspirational one, with the Americans beaten on home soil for the first time. It was Ballesteros that fittingly sank the putt that clinched victory, with Europe 15-13 winners . Christy O'Connor Jnr became a Ryder Cup hero in 1989, making a dramatic birdie on the 18th to beat Fred Couples and claim a crucial point for his European team. Here, the Irishman triumphantly walks on to the 18th green at The Belfry. The overall score was 14-14 in that 1989 contest, the second time in the history of the event that the final score was a draw. It was enough for Europe to retain the Ryder Cup, the final one of four in which Tony Jacklin was their captain . This must surely rank as the single most dramatic moment in Ryder Cup history, with Bernhard Langer missing a six-foot putt in 1991 that would have clinched a singles win over Hale Irwin, a 14-14 draw and retention of the trophy for Europe. Agonisingly for Bernard Gallacher's team, the ball slipped past the hole and the hosts could celebrate victory at Kiawah Island. It was an event that was at times so bitter, it was given the name 'War on the Shore' Three European giants pictured next - on the left, Colin Montgomerie and Nick Faldo during the 1995 contest at Oak Hill. The Europeans came from 9-7 behind on the final day to claim a famous win by 14-and-a-half points to 13-and-a-half. On the right, one of Europe's most inspirational figures of all time, Seve Ballesteros, pictured with the trophy after captaining Europe to victory at Valderrama in 1997. Ballesteros also played in eight Ryder Cup contests . The Americans surged back from behind at Brookline in 1999 to claim a famous victory. Europe were 10-6 ahead after two days, but the Americans dominated the early stages of the singles on the Sunday and the momentum inexorably swung their way. The contest ended in ugly fashion when American players, pictured here, invaded the green in delight when Justin Leonard holed a monster putt on the 17th, even though Jose Maria Olazabal still had a putt that could have kept Europe alive . Of all the memorable celebrations at Ryder Cups, few have matched Paul McGinley being thrown into the lake at The Belfry after holing the winning putt in 2002. McGinley played in three European teams, and all of them were victorious, in 2002, 2004 and 2006. The Irishman will captain Europe in this week's contest at Gleneagles . The 2006 Ryder Cup at the K Club in Ireland was most memorable for the contribution made by Darren Clarke, pictured above, just weeks after the death of his wife, Heather. Clarke, a popular figure with golf fans, was given a rapturous reception throughout the event, but particularly on the final day when he claimed a singles win over Zach Johnson. Europe were comfortable winners by 18-and-a-half points to nine-and-a-half, and in the below picture home captain Ian Woosnam has just celebrated by drinking a pint of Guinness. Pictured alongside him are Sam Torrance, Clarke and Lee Westwood . The last two Ryder Cups have been thrilling affairs. Above, Graeme McDowell celebrates after making a crucial birdie on the 16th in his decisive singles clash with Hunter Mahan at Celtic Manor. McDowell's 3&1 victory gave Europe the point they needed to beat the Americans by 14-and-a-half points to 13-and-a-half. The same margin of victory was enjoyed by Europe two years ago in an even more dramatic contest on American soil. Jose Maria Olazabal's team were 10-4 down at one stage, but fought back for an incredible win. Below, Rory McIlroy celebrates Martin Kaymer's clinching putt, with the European victory christened the 'Miracle of Medinah'","This year's Ryder Cup is being held at Gleneagles in Scotland, with hosts Europe favourites to win .
