"International embassies across London are worth a staggering £4 billion between them, according to a new study. The 140 properties across the city range from the U.S.'s new £600million purpose built fortress in south London to the £750,000 suburban semi in Acton, west London used by North Korea. The research found eight embassies are estimated to be worth £100million or more, with most located in some of London's most expensive postcodes in Kensington, Knightsbridge and Belgravia. The brand new American embassy at Nine Elms in south west London. The purpose-built fortress has been valued at £600million and replaces Grosvenor House, which sold for £500million . The study also reveals that if the tiny Polynesian island nation of Tuvalu - halfway between Hawawii and Australia - was to sell off its London consulate in Raynes Park, south west London, it would pay off 11 per cent of its national debt of £6.6million. In addition the figures show that Ecuador's embassy near Harrods in Knightsbridge, currently home to international fugitive Julian Assange is valued at £15million but would increase in value if the Wikileaks founder finally left. Foreign embassies in the UK are exempt from certain taxes such as council tax and stamp duty if the buildings are sold as non-residential properties. The research also found that if all the embassy buildings were to be sold, the total amount the UK Treasury would lose out on in stamp duty would be £279.3 million. The research comes amid figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics show house prices in London have risen by more than 20 per cent in the past year. Financial publication Spear's Magazine asked property buying agents Lichfields to value the capital's embassies. Josh Spero, from the magazine, said: 'I would say four billion pounds is a conservative estimate - London's embassies are probably worth more than that. 'It's a huge amount of money. The Russian embassy, for example, is easily worth more than £100 million. That is an astonishing value. And almost none of these embassies are for sale. The Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge, central London near to Harrods has been valued at £15million. But researchers say it would be worth a lot more if Wikileaks founder Julian Assange were to leave the building where he is currently living . 'They paid quite a lot of money for them years ago, but they've increased in value. 'It also comes down to the fact that some of these countries used to have a lot more money. 'However, when they do go for sale they can go very quickly. 'Others are listed buildings which means its very hard to do things with them. Maybe in some cases that depresses the sale value slightly. 'One of the things we looked at was whether countries could afford their own embassies. 'Tuvalu, for example, couldn't - its embassy is valued at over 10 per cent of its national debt.' Australia House, home to the Australian embassy on the Strand in central London, is worth at least £100million. New research has found that all 140 of London's embassies are worth a combined £4billion . Asked about the shabby North Korean Embassy, he said: 'It's used for national pride. North Korea aren't interested in glamour. 'They're supposed to be a socialist state that emphasises utilitarianism, rather than western decadence. ' The United States was found to have the priciest embassy with its new Nine Elms site valued at £600 million, £100 million more than its previous site in Grosvenor Square sold for. Occupying some of the grandest buildings are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The embassy of Japan on Piccadilly in central London, which has been valued at £100million. The research revealed that collectively the G7 countries embassies are worth £1.1 billion . They are all in and around high value postcodes such as Kensington, Piccadilly, Belgravia and Knightsbridge, and have all had their embassies valued at £100million or more. There are 30 embassies in the SW1X postcode alone, in Belgravia, north of Eaton Square and Knightsbridge. The research also shows that collectively the G7 countries embassies are worth the most at £1.1billion, while countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey - are worth a relatively modest £85million. The EU embassies were found to be the second most valuable as a group, collectively worth £881million. Germany's embassy is located on Belgrave Square in Belgravia. EU embassies located in London have been valued as being collectively worth £881million . However, some embassies are less pricey than they appear as it was revealed that Russia pays just £1 a year to run its £100million embassy, Harrington House, in one of the world's most expensive roads, Kensington Palace Gardens. This is because of a 1991 agreement that allows the UK a luxurious embassy in Moscow for one rouble a year in exchange. Syria's Belgrave Square embassy was also revealed to be a £35million asset that could keep president Bashar Al Assad going through turbulent times if he chooses to sell it. The research revealed that Nepal and Zambia are sitting on unexpectedly valuable assets, a £30 million building in Kensington Palace Gardens, and a £40 million house in Kensington. Mr Spero added that the new US embassy in Nine Elms would form part of a major development that could see other nations flocking to relocate their own embassies. He explained: 'Obviously some smaller nations as you might expect just had offices or even just consulates. Meanwhile the North Korean embassy in Acton, west London has been valued at just £750,000. John Spero from Spears Magazine says the embassy is more about national pride than glamour . 'Ecuador's embassy is worth about £15million - it's in Knightsbridge so there's no area of London more expensive. It's right out the back of Harrods. 'I am sure that the Ecuadorean embassy property value would increase if Julian Assange was not there.' When embassies are sold as non-residential buildings they are usually exempt from stamp duty, which counts as a local tax. This is calculated in bands, according to the sale value of a residential property, with anything retailing for more than £125,000 having a one per cent tax. Most embassies are likely to fit into the higher bands, taxable at five or seven per cent. Mr Spero added: 'Embassies are exempt from local tax. If they were to be sold as residential properties you would normally have to pay stamp duty on them. The Tuvaluan Consulate in Raynes Park, south west London. If the island nation was to sell off its London consulate, the money would pay off 11 per cent of their national debt . 'Obviously the Mayor of London is very unhappy about this, but we don't pay any tax abroad for our embassies.' Earlier this year it was also revealed that foreign embassies had also notched up more than £75million in unpaid London congestion charge debt over the last decade. The total value of the congestion charge debt incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in London since its introduction in 2003 until the end of last year was £75,364,182. The US embassy topped the table for the highest number of fines and largest outstanding bill, with 70,637 fines handed out over the ten-year period and a total outstanding bill of £8,172,245. Meanwhile in 2013, 5,662 unpaid parking fines were incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in the UK in 2013 totalling £541,599.","New research by property buying agents Lichfields shows the 140 embassies across London are worth £4billion .

"Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The new 'treat size' Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g . The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health . 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. Bags of fun size boxes of Smarties have not changed in price or weight. Customers took to the Allen's Lollies Facebook page to express their outage and label the resized pythons 'just snakes'. 'Devastated that pythons are now 'treat size' …..WHAT???? Python's were pythons because they were BIG – very sad… Not fun for the kids at all any more,' Natika Mitselburg wrote. 'Not cool Allens... not cool... We don't eat them for their nutritional value, we eat them as a treat!! May as well eat snakes,' Claire Taylor wrote. Meanwhile Jesinta McNaughton wrote: 'Allens lollies who are you to tell the public what and how much we should eat per serving - you don't think people will just eat extra rather than one? 'Price difference or not - people EXPECT them to be a killer python, this they are not!'

"Michael Kearns died after he was pinned down by bouncers outside Sailors nightclub in Newquay, Cornwall . A nightclub reveller died after four bouncers sat on him like a 'chair' for ten minutes until he stopped breathing, a court has heard. Michael Kearns, 48, cried out for help and told the security staff he couldn't breathe as they held him face down on the pavement, prosecutors say. But his pleas were allegedly ignored by doormen Lewis Bowns, 26, Richard Favetta, 30, Ian Harold, 45, and Graham Lutey, 34, who now stand accused of unlawfully killing Mr Kearns. Truro Court Court heard the four men ejected Mr Kearns from Sailors nightclub in Newquay, Cornwall, on April 27 last year after he hit another man with stool. Simon Laws, QC, prosecuting, told jurors: 'What he did was wrong and it was part of their job to deal with him. 'He struggled against them but it was a pretty one-sided contest. There were at times four of them against the one of him and at other times there were three of them against the one of him.' Mr Laws said Mr Kearns was forced to the floor on his back then turned over so he was face down on the ground. The jury, who saw CCTV footage of the incident, heard that Lutey, who was the senior doorman, was involved in restraining the lower part of Mr Kearns while Bowns dealt with his arms and head. Favetta is alleged to have helped hold Mr Kearns down during the incident. Mr Laws said Harold then 'took control of Mr Kearns's torso', kneeling on him and then sitting on him as a person would sit on a chair. Mr Laws said: 'He was calling out that he could not breathe and saying that the doormen were choking him. Bouncers Lewis Bowns (pictured, above left), Richard Favetta (above, right), Ian Harold (below, left) and Graham Lutey (below, right) all deny manslaughter . 'They took no notice, they continued to use force on him without any regard to how he was faring. In truth, he was dying.' Mr Laws said this continued for approximately 10 minutes until a witness said Mr Kearns was not breathing and they got off him - but by then it was too late. The four doormen later told police Mr Kearns was being aggressive and that officers had taken a long time to arrive. Bowns, Favetta and Harold, all of Newquay, and Lutey, of Summercourt, Cornwall, all deny manslaughter. The trial continues. Sailors nightclub in Newquay, where Mr Kearns died.

"Bosses of the new Battersea Power Station development have taken their plans for the iconic site on the road as they try to tempt the world's rich to take up residence in south London. Actress Kate Beckinsale fronted a 'launch party' in Hollywood last night in the latest of a series of events aimed at attracting foreign buyers to snap up flats on the banks of the River Thames. Glitzy public exhibitions have now been held in Paris, New York, Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur last week, followed by shows in Tokyo, Beijing, Doha and Milan this week. Actress Kate Beckinsale attended a launch of the Battersea Power Station Development in Hollywood last night as the site's bosses try to convince A-listers to snap up luxury apartments next to the River Thames . Miss Beckinsale was shown models of the buildings planned for the site by CEO Rob Tincknell . The Hollywood event came after businessmen and women in Shanghai were shown plans for the site last week . The events around the world came after rock star Sting and his wife Trudie Styler confirmed they will be among the future tenants living in the redeveloped towers. Developers are keen to get world-famous stars and international businessmen and women into some of the 4,000 apartments being built on the famous site, which is to have its own tube station. Apartments in the power station vary widely in price and size. Studios are available from £495,000, one bedroom apartments being sold for £595,000 and four bedroom apartments for £3million. Prices for the sprawling penthouses - which are likely to attract super-rich buyers - have not been released, but experts predicted they could cost as much as £30million. Battersea Power Station CEO Rob Tincknell with Trudie Styler and Sting, who have bought one of the apartments, attended the New York 'launch night' last week . Also at the glitzy event in LA were Dancing with the Stars dancer Sharna Burgess (left) and actress Hayley Hasslehoff (right), daughter of Baywatch star, David . Mad Men actor Jared Harris was also among the stars perusing flats in the new development in Nine Elms . Footballer Robbie Rogers (left) and musician Steve Cooke, pictured with actor Aiden Turner (right), also attended the Hollywood night . Miss Beckinsale - star of Pearl Harbour and Underworld - was seen chatting with development bosses last night, sparking rumours she could be about to follow Sting in buying one of the properties. Mad Men actor Jared Harris, Dancing with the Stars dancer Sharna Burgess and actress Hayley Hasselhoff, daughter of Baywatch actor David, were seen walking the red carpet at the launch event last night. Last last month, Sting became among the first to snap up an apartment in the redeveloped towers, adding to  his long list of properties around the world. His wife Trudie Styler said: 'The exciting development plans for the whole site are a great solution for the regeneration of an iconic London landmark which has been in decay for the last 30 years. 'We are both very pleased to be part of this new community and really look forward to making our London home at the Battersea Power Station.' Exclusive launch events around the world have featured DJs and musicians in a bid to create a buzz around the London development .

Potential investors give plans for the site careful inspection at The House of Roosevelt in Shanghai . Guests at the event in Paris, which was held in one of the grand rooms of the British embassy last week . Commenting on the events around the world, development chairman Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said: 'The simultaneous global launch to find the most creative businesses, exciting fashion, retail, food brands and restaurants to bring alive each phase of the development at Battersea Power Station is an momentous milestone on our journey to create a new flourishing community in central London. 'By bringing the very best of UK and international businesses to the site, we will create one of the most wonderful places to live, work and visit in the capital.' The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station, which is costing £8billion, will see the 42 acre site transformed into a riverside town for thousands of people. After years of failed bids to redevelop it, the he site was bought by Real Estate Opportunities and the project was given planning permission in 2010. It is expected to be completed by 2025. The power station itself, which has been closed to the public for 30 years, is expected to be opened in 2019. Jo Squillo (left) and DJ Leslie Kirchhoff (right) at the launch nights in Milan and New York respectively . The development of the iconic building, which will be converted into flats, is expected to be finished by 2025 . The site has sat disused for years but plans for its re-development are finally under way after getting planning permission in 2010 . Models of the modern-looking apartment blocks are now being taken around the world to encourage buyers . Work has already started at the site, where rock star Sting announced he had bought a flat last month . At the heart of the scheme called Prospect Place, will be Gehry's Flower building - a striking structure which will offer residents a lounge, library, a large chef's table dining room, a yoga studio and treatment rooms. London-based Foster + Partners have designed a building inspired by the 1930s which will be topped by one of the city's largest roof gardens offering spectacular panoramic views of London. The development will also house 103 affordable homes. The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station.

"Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea must learn how to unpick opponents who throw 10 men behind the ball or miss out on the Barclays Premier League crown again. The Portuguese manager admits his Stamford Bridge side fell short in last term's Barclays Premier League title race due to a lack of final-third quality. Mourinho believes new recruits Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa will help solve that problem, with Chelsea opening their league campaign at Burnley on Monday. New dimension: Cesc Fabregas (second left) and Diego Costa will offer Chelsea more quality . The Portuguese boss admitted Chelsea have worked extensively in pre-season on unpicking opponents who set out solely to nullify his side's threats. 'We need more quality in our football,' said Mourinho. 'When you have matches with space and time it's much easier to play football. 'When you don't have space and time because a lot of football is based around tactics and systems: in a very simple way, everything depends on space and time. 'And when you don't have space and time to play, you need more quality. 'We are working exactly in that direction. 'We need more quality in our game, and we are working on that. 'We have worked on exactly that in training, expecting a team to be defensive and try to close every road to goal.' Touch of class: Fabregas will complement Chelsea's box-to-box midfield runners . Last term, Mourinho's first season in his second managerial tenure at Chelsea, ended with no silverware reward. Defeats like the galling 1-0 home reverse to relegation-battling Sunderland left Mourinho defending his top stars at the time. Now though the Chelsea manager has conceded only sharper build-up play will allow the west London club to break their trophy deadlock. The Chelsea boss believes Fabregas will offer a new dimension in midfield play this term to complement a host of box-to-box runners. The former Real Madrid and Inter manager said none of his midfielders will command automatic selection - but neither will any be out in the cold. Deadly Diego: Costa will offer Chelsea more clinical finishing than they had from their strikers last season . 'That is not so tough, because we play 60 matches in a season,' he said. 'In this first two weeks it's one match a week, but after that starts the cups, the Champions League and the national team. 'So you have to adapt, nobody will feel they are first or second choice. 'Mikel, Matic, Ramires, Fabregas, Schurrle, Van Ginkel: so everyone will play, everyone will feel useful, important. 'On the field we have a very good balance.'

"Clickety clack, clickety clack. It was the soundtrack to my Fifties childhood, as my mother and grandmother knitted constantly. Even relaxing in front of the TV, they were never happy unless their hands were occupied. It’s a trait I inherited, and when my own children were small, I was never happier than when I was ‘creating’ something to swathe them in. But by their teenage years the time came when they didn’t want homemade clothes any more. I suppose wearing something knitted by Mum isn’t cool. Jenni says she inherited her love of knitting from her mother and grandmother who knitted non-stop . Now Ed and Charlie are 31 and 27 — and it would have taken me months to do anything for them. So, in the absence of grandchildren, I put away my knitting needles and took up needlepoint. Then, a couple of months ago, I came across a colourful book of knitting patterns for dogs, by the designer and author Debbie Bliss. In the absence of grandchildren Jenni has started knitting for her chihuahuas Butch, Madge and Frida . And I just knew my three chihuahuas, Butch, Madge and Frida (yes, they are definite grandchild substitutes), would love something to keep them warm this winter. Full of excitement, I dug out my yarns and knitting needles again. Knitting is experiencing a renaissance here — with an estimated seven million knitters clacking away in their homes. And a huge number of knitters will own a dog. What’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho? asks Jenni . So what’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho? My two previous pets, William and Mary, miniature schnauzers, had the kind of coats of their own that could be clipped close in the summer and allowed to grow in the winter, so they never noticed the cold. Chihuahuas, though, are different. Mine are short-haired and, as soon as a winter nip sets in, they regard me as a lunatic when I enthusiastically shout: ‘Walkies!’ Chihuahuas are bred for a Mexican climate rather than the chilly British weather . They hide behind the sofa and emerge reluctantly when I put on my bossy ‘leader of the pack’ voice. I then have to endure their pitiful display of shivering the minute we step out of the door. I’ve even faced scathing comments from fellow dog walkers: ‘Poor little things. Don’t you think they should be wrapped up warm?’ My son, Ed, is a vet, and when I asked his opinion of the growing trend of clothes for dogs and whether I should get some for my three he was scornfully dismissive. ‘If a dog needs a coat it shouldn’t be living in this country. They’re chihuahuas, for goodness sake, bred for the Mexican climate. And they are dogs, Mother. They shouldn’t be treated like pampered, spoilt babies.’ Jenni has lavished love and affection on her pets since her sons Ed and Charlie left home . So my poor little chihuahuas just aren’t built for the chilly British winter. But they do make adorable companions . . . always welcoming, never making demands or expressing disapproval of Mummy — the way children do. To be honest, I think Ed may be a teensy bit jealous of my canine kids, given the love and affection I’ve lavished upon them since he and his brother flew the nest. Debbie Bliss told me she was inspired to create a range of patterns for dog wear because every time she went to talk to her editor about knitting books they ended up talking about their dogs. Combining her two greatest passions in life seemed like an inspired idea. Her pets — Smiffy, the Parsons Jack Russell and Monty, the beagle — seemed happy in the sweaters, and Debbie soon compiled enough doggy patterns for a book. It’s illustrated with lots of fun photos of dogs in jumpers, including spaniels, bulldogs, collies and Yorkies. The patterns vary in difficulty and can be modified for small, medium and large canines. The size of my three meant there was no point considering the Aran or the stripey sailor suit, because even the small wouldn’t have been small enough (and I’m not sure my skills are up to stripes just yet). Nor was I prepared to humiliate them by knitting the funny hats to go with their coats. My guys would have them off in seconds no matter how tight the elastic used to keep such hats in place. So in the end I went for the Puppy Polo (a jumper with a rollneck to you and me). I excitedly restocked my knitting bag with needles, a stitch holder, row counter, darning needle, tape measure and a strange contraption that helps you knit a rollneck in one piece without seams. I was surprised how quickly the skills came back. Soon I was casting on like lightning, doing rib and stocking stitch and casting off neatly without any trouble. Each jumper took the best part of three evenings — time that has turned out to be very well spent. Jennie's brood - Butch, Madge and Frida in their homemade outfits . Madge happily let me fit hers on and modelled it with her usual panache, prancing about like Kate Moss on speed. I chose hot pink to suit her wild personality. Butch (who has white fur) looked very smart in black, and for Frida I picked a softer pink because I thought it would complement her grey coat. She didn’t seem to mind, though she looked a bit cross when she realised it was a bit too long at the back and wiggled from side to side when she wagged her tail — which she does a lot. I told her what my granny always said to me when she’d stayed up all night to finish a sweater for me for school. ‘Don’t worry love, you’ll grow into it.’ (She won’t!) Jenni thinks carefully about the tones that would suit each of her pet pooch's natural fur colour . This week, on a bit of a chilly day, I took all three to the local park. They ran about happily and were thrilled to be stopped every few minutes by fellow walkers saying: ‘Oh, don’t they look gorgeous, where did you buy their lovely sweaters?’ I almost burst with pride when I answered: ‘I didn’t, I made them myself.’ This substitute Granny is very, very happy indeed.","Jenni inherited her love of knitting from her mother and grandmother .

"If you ever wanted proof that pre-season form should not be taken too seriously, the 24 hours between Arsenal’s spectacular win and uninspiring defeat at the Emirates had it. Fielding a side far from their best starting XI, Arsenal tore apart Portuguese champions Benfica 5-1 on Saturday afternoon, suggesting Arsene Wenger’s side could finally rid themselves of any squad depth concerns. Then, a tame 1-0 defeat to Monaco on Sunday brought the Gunners right back down to earth, despite Wenger selecting first team stars. Of course, the players won’t take it to heart. Pre-season has one priority; fitness. Winning games is a bonus, but is there a relationship between form in July and form in the next 10 months? VIDEO Scroll down to watch pre-season Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Arsenal: Gunners forward Chuba Akpom just before being brought down by Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic . Cup: Arsenal did not even win the Emirates Cup - their friendly tournament where they picked the opponents . Manchester United and Southampton fans will hope so. Both have won all their pre-season games so far, despite a new leader and a desperate need for rebuilding at both clubs. Here are the facts. Typically, the Premier League champions rarely lose more than two of their pre-season games, but in recent years the Manchester clubs have not always shown a sign of things to come in the summer months. Last season, Man City lost four of their eight pre-season fixtures, overcome by Bayern Munich, Arsenal, and South African outfits SuperSport United and AmaZulu. Manuel Pellegrini’s side went on to take the league title by two points. Similarly, in 2010, neighbours United lost three of their seven warm-ups, against Kansas City Wizards, Guadalajara and Juventus. Sir Alex Ferguson didn't mind too much, and they wrapped up their 19th title with a game to spare. Tackle: Javier Hernandez and Sergio Ramos compete for the ball in the International Champions Cup .

Likewise, United’s treble season in 1998-99 started with defeats at Birmingham City and Aberdeen. As you’d expect, Fergie didn't take the defeats to heart. There’s also a warning sign for the fans of relegation candidates. Saints, torn apart by the departure of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw, have ignored talks of a crisis under Ronald Koeman and performed on the pitch, while newly promoted Leicester are unbeaten in their four pre-season games with three wins. Encouraging? Don’t read too much into it. In recent years, summer promise has more often than not led to tears come May. Cardiff lost just once in pre-season last term but failed to avoid the drop, while QPR were unbeaten in their seven warm-up matches in 2012 before going down. In 2011-12, the relegated teams enjoyed fine pre-season form - Bolton won six of their eight games, while Blackburn and Wolves each lost just one of their six fixtures. All three went through the trap door and have failed to emerge since. Pairs: David Silva and Mathieu Dossevi battle for the ball while flanked by Giannis Maniatis ad Stevan Jovetic . Fresh from signing the likes of Pablo Barrera and Frederic Piquionne in the summer of 2010, West Ham won six of their seven, beating Monchengladbach, Deportivo and Panathinaikos. Sadly, it took them until late February to even win six Premier League games. You guessed it, Avram Grant’s side went down, alongside Alex McLeish’s Birmingham, who lost only one of seven in pre-season. Shock friendly results can also be misleading. You’ll struggle to find a Newcastle fan left unaffected by the 6-1 defeat to Leyton Orient just two months after dropping out of the Premier League in 2009. Despite Alan Smith, Obafemi Martins, Tim Krul, Joey Barton and Luis Enrique all playing, spirit seemed at an all-time low. They went on to lose just four games in the Championship, and won the division with 102 points under Chris Hughton.

Jump: Phillipe Coutinho heads the ball as Liverpool took on AC Milan in a friendly tournament in America . Players, too, can show promise in July and flop when points are on the line. Aston Villa’s Swedish forward Marcus Allback scored seven goals, including two hat-tricks, before the 2003-04 season, but went on to score just one more in 15 games. Similarly, in 2004, Mateja Kezman took his goalscoring form from PSV to Chelsea for pre-season, scoring four in three games, but only managed another four in the Premier League before leaving for Atletico Madrid. Yaya Sanogo, Roberto Soldado, Ashley Young and Stevan Jovetic will hope to take their impressive pre-season form into the competitive season after struggling in the Premier League last term. Of course, weak squads, fitness and motivational levels must all be taken into account. No matter how many sponsored international super friendly tournaments are created, the thrill of competitive action is difficult to replicate. Pre-season does serve a purpose for fans. It is a time for optimism, a period where all fans get gee themselves up for the new campaign and dream of what is to come. But don’t take it too seriously. When there are points on the line, everything changes. VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights .","Arsenal lost to Monaco yesterday, and so did not win the Emirates Cup .

"The Roy Keane effect produced instant dividends for Aston Villa as they sprung a surprise victory at The Britannia with a well-taken goal by Andreas Weimann. Keane, making his bow as Paul Lambert’s assistant, heard his name chanted by Villa fans as Weimann’s 50th-minute winner exposed some uncharacteristic hesitation in the home defence. With both teams parading three signings apiece, there was plenty of optimism around at The Britannia at kick-off time. Get in there: Andreas Weimann celebrates opening the scoring at The Britannia Stadium in front of the travelling Aston Villa support . Fire power: Weimann blasts home Villa's opening goal to put the visitors ahead in a tight clash at the Britannia Stadium against Stoke . Stoke City (4-2-3-1): Begovic 6 – Bardsley 6.5, Shawscross 7, Wilson 5.5, Pieters 6 – Whelan 6 (Adam 82), Nzonzi 6.5 – Bojan 6, Ireland 5.5, Arnautovic 6 – Diouf 6 (Crouch 70).

Subs not used: Given (GK), Baker, Clark, Elahamadi, Bent. Goal: Weimann 50. Booked: Westwood, Hutton, Agbonlahor. Manager: Paul Lambert 7. Referee: Anthony Taylor 7.5. Attendance: 27, 478 . Particular enthusiasm was shown towards Bojan Krkic, the Barca boy who has ended up at Stoke. He showed dazzling feet early on before sending a shot into the side-netting as home fans warmed to the football manager Mark Hughes is trying to play. Stoke had the best of the early action with Villa prepared to put their foot in when necessary. Steven Nzonzi was painfully caught on the foot by Ashley Westwood and Villa hard-man Alan Hutton, in his first Premier League outing for 27 months, unceremoniously dumped one of City’s debutants Biram Mame Diouf on the turf. Villa gradually emerged from their early attacking slumber and should have nicked the first goal after 14 minutes. Asmir Begovic and Erik Pieters left the ball to each other on the edge of the penalty area and Kieran Richardson nipped in to square for Gaby Agbonlahor. The striker should have buried the chance from six yards but mis-hit wide. He was so embarrassed he vainly claimed his muffed shot had taken a deflection and he should have a corner. Agbonlahor has pace and energy but went into yesterday having scored only one goal in 14 games. Villa were encouraged though and Stoke needed their skipper Ryan Shawcross to be at his best. He blocked everything thrown at him, standing up tall to bravely get in the way of a shot Aly Cissokho. When Shawcross was breached, Begovic saves with his legs from N’Zogbia. At the other end, a late Stoke rally before half-time saw Brad Guzan spill a shot by Phil Bardsley and was relieved Philippe Senderos managed to hack the ball away before Bojan arrived for the rebound. Within five minutes of the re-start, Villa were ahead. Andreas Weimann scored well but in the Stoke dug-out Hughes would have been furious about how cheaply it was given away. Dribbling away: Marko Arnautovic turns away from Charles N'Zogbia as Stoke attempted to exert their influence on Aston Villa in the first half at the Britannia Stadium . First day in the new job: Roy Keane was on the touchline as assistant for Aston Villa and got animated over a decision that didn't go his side's way on this occasion . Battle: Marc Wilson defends the ball from Weimann as he tries to get the better of the Stoke man on the edge of the Potters' penalty area .

N’Zogbia threatened danger with a neat turn on the edge of the box but when Wilson blocked Weimann’s shot on the edge of the area, the danger should have been cleared. Instead, Wilson and Stephen Ireland hesitated as if expecting each other to make the clearance or Shawcross to come across. Weimann didn’t and belted a right-foot shot that seemed to go through Begovic due to its power, though the goalkeeper will be disappointed not to have got some kind of decisive block. Villa’s Austrian forward celebrated enthusiastically in front of the travelling fans with good reason. He only scored once away from Villa Park throughout the whole of last season. The goal knocked the stuffing out Stoke, who had confirmed the loan signing of Chelsea’s Victor Moses earlier in the day. Their defender Erik Pieters ran into Weimann and fell over claiming a penalty, which was correctly dismissed by referee Anthony Taylor. Ron Vlaar went close to scoring a second with a header from a corner, and got a bloody nose as a result after accidentally banging into N’Zogbia. Stoke sent on big Peter Crouch for the last 20 but rarely threatened an equaliser. Indeed, it was Villa youngster Jack Grealish who set up fellow sub Leandro Bacuna with a chance he hit wide. Stoke's only serious glimmer came in injury-time when Senderos made a late block. A tracksuited Keane kept popping out it in the second half, even choosing to exchange words with the fourth official over his award of a Stoke free-kick. At least the result and performance of Villa’s players should ensure they will escape the Keano glare in the next few days. Having a blast: Weimann struck with power to see the ball hit the back of the net and give Villa the lead in the second half at the Britannia Stadium .

"Swansea and FC Utrecht are embroiled in a bitter financial row over Michel Vorm's move to Tottenham. The Dutch club secured a 30 per cent sell-on clause when they agreed to sell the goalkeeper to Swansea in 2011. But FC Utrecht are still waiting for their money due to confusion over Vorm's switch to White Hart Lane. VIDEO Scroll down for The Footballers' Football Column with Michel Vorm . Row: Swansea are discussing a payment they owe Utrecht after Michel Vorm's move to Tottenham . It is understood that Swansea are claiming the keeper moved to Spurs as part of the deal that saw Gylfi Sigurdsson head in the opposite direction. FC Utrecht are insistent that they are owed a percentage of the fee for Vorm, but it is understood that Swansea are claiming there is no sell on because the shot-stopper moved as part of a makeweight in the Sigurdsson's move. And the Dutch club has started seeking legal advice in an attempt to resolve the issue. Vorm spent six years at FC Utrecht before his move to the Barclays Premier League for £1.5million. And the Dutchman, who has 15 caps for Holland, has developed a reputation as one of the most reliable keepers in the country. However, he is likely to be reserve keeper to Hugo Lloris at Tottenham next season.

"Public support for Britain staying in the European Union has risen to a 23-year high, a surprise opinion poll showed today. Some 56 per cent of people now say they would vote to stay in the EU in a referendum, the highest level since 1991. Pollsters say the surge in support for remaining in the Euro bloc of 18 countries is in part as a result of the rise of Ukip, with supporters of other parties becoming more determined not to sever ties with Brussels. Some 56 per cent of people now say they would vote for Britain to stay in the European Union . Support for Nigel Farage's Ukip has soared by 13 points since 2012, but backing for remaining in the EU has risen by 12 points, as David Cameron prepares to renegotiate Britain's membership . The new IpsosMORI survey shows how Ukip's growing popularity has coincided with increasing support for Britain's membership of the EU. In November 2012, Ukip was on just 3 per cent in opinion polls and 48 per cent backed leaving the EU, with only 44 per cent in favour of staying in. However, with Ukip now on 16 per cent, Nigel Farage's dream of exit from the EU appears to be further away. While Ukip has risen 13 points in the polls, the number wishing to leave the EU has fallen by 12 points, IpsosMORI found. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: 'With the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU a hot topic right now, our poll shows support for Britain's membership is up significantly since the depths of the Eurozone debt crisis in 2011 – although that does not mean that the public simply want the relationship to stay the same. 'There is a polarisation in views - Ukip supporters are twice as likely to say Europe is going to be important to their vote in the next election (although it is still some way behind immigration) and are much more sceptical, while supporters of the other parties put the issue lower down on their list and are more in favour of membership.' The poll reveals the highest level of support for remaining in the EU since 1991, coinciding with the rise of Ukip . Among Labour, Tory and Lib Dem voters, a majority are in favour of remaining in the EU. More than half (51 per cent) of Conservatives, 73 per cent of Labour voters and 82 per cent of Lib Dems want Britain to stay in. But contrast, just 11 per cent of Ukip supporters want to stay in. Support for staying in the EU is highest in London (66 per cent) and Scotland (60 per cent). Angry Eurosceptic Conservative MPs blamed Nigel Farage, saying Ukip has increasingly ‘toxified’ the case for a British exit beyond its core support. Tory MP Michael Fabricant, a former vice-chairman of the party, said: ‘Today’s poll puts into stark reality what would be the outcome if there were a referendum on the EU in the next 12 months, which is being demanded by Ukip. ‘It is ironic indeed that it is Ukip and some other Eurosceptics who, through their relentless negativity and messages without any hope, are setting back the out argument.' Tory MP Stewart Jackson added: ‘The challenge is to make a positive case for the UK as a global trading nation whereas the EU is shrinking as a world market.’ However, pro-Europeans welcomed the news that support for staying in the EU has risen. Lib Dem President Tim Farron said: ‘It's an encouraging sign that vindicates the courage shown by the Lib Dems being the lone voice in favour of the UK being better off working together with our neighbours in Europe.’ A Ukip spokesman, meanwhile, said 51 per cent agreed with the party's call for a 'free trade deal with the EU, against 43 per cent who want to keep the status quo or deepen ties'. The spokesman said: 'We can live with those statistics. Of course when Cameron dangles impossible negotiations under people's noses then people want to believe him, but when he fails - as he surely will - then the polls will harden.' Alisdair McIntosh, Director of Business for New Europe, said: 'Many of the public recognise the important economic benefits of staying within the EU. 'Politicians are mistaken if they think people just want to hear ever-louder eurosceptic rhetoric, especially at a time of economic and political uncertainty. This only increases cynicism about the major political parties.' David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Jean-Claude Juncker, who was voted in as the new European Commission president in Strasbourg today, has called to make freedom of movement easier . The Prime Minister vowed to put tackling immigration 'at the heart' of his efforts to reform Brussels' grip on the UK. He is set to outline plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks. However, Mr Cameron suffered a fresh set back  today after new Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker said freedom of movement should be made easier. Mr Juncker, who became European Commission president despite the fierce objections of Mr Cameron, told one of his new commissioners to 'promote freedom of movement' within the EU. Outgoing European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso insisted over the weekend that an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law. Mr Juncker's call for EU migration to be made even easier is a further blow to the Prime Minister. In a letter sent last month, Mr Juncker told Ms Thyssen, a Belgian MEP, that she should be 'improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across Europe'. He cited the EU-wide job exchange website EURES.","56% say they will vote to stay in, with 36% wanting to leave the EU .

"For some Celtic supporters it was almost too much. In the aftermath of Legia Warsaw’s second goal a man in a green polo shirt and beige fishing hat leapt to his feet and stood before the directors' box, arms outstretched. He stood silent, unmoving. After a second or two he rubbed his fingers together in the unmistakable, international sign language of money. No words were uttered. None were required. His message was clear enough. This was the year when Celtic gambled their Champions League ambitions on spending the bare minimum. A year when they placed their chips on black and lost to a Polish team in red. The punt finished up costing them £15million. VIDEO Scroll down for Celtic manager Ronny Deila wants to build a new team .

Subs not used: Jalocha, Dossa Junior, Saganowski, Orlando Sa. Booked: Zyro. Goals: Zyro 36, Kucharczyk 61 . Referee: Paolo Mazzoleni (Italy) For this old club the Champions League has now become a tale of slow, steady decline. A process of corrosive decay culminating in something approaching humiliation. This time last year Scotland’s champions scraped past Shakhter Karagandy of Kazakhstan to qualify for the group stages by the seat of their pants. Since then they have played 10 games in this competition. They have won three – two against KR Reykjavik - and losing seven. Defeats by AC Milan, Barcelona and Ajax they could tolerate. Home and away losses to Legia Warsaw are harder to explain. Much of what happened here felt like a throwback. To routine, humble European exits to the Partizan Belgrades and Neuchatel Xamaxes of this world. Even the ultras of the Green Brigade were rendered mute. At time up the there were no substantive boos, only numbness. This was a night which outlined the stark consequences of downsizing, selling key players, gambling and complacency. In the end the 6-1 aggregate scoreline was identical to that by which Legia beat the Irish part-timers of St Patrick’s Athletic. And yet who can deny that Henning Berg’s team were thoroughly worthy winners over two games? As a Rangers player Berg never won an Old Firm game in five attempts. But that was against the Celtic of Larsson and Sutton. Here Berg fared better, his Polish champions outclassing a desperately limited Celtic side. Describing just how poorly they played over two games is no easy task. Doubling up: Michal Kucharczyk scores Legia's second goal past Celtic keeper Forster .

Concern: Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell (centre) with chairman Ian Bankier and director Eric Riley (right) Trailing 4-1 from the first leg Ronny Deila needed a miracle here. On nights like these the Celtic way is to stage a cavalry charge. To come out the trenches, bayonets poking forth. But there was none of that here. The ‘home’ team – playing at Murrayfield – huffed and puffed. They barely laid a glove on the Legia keeper Kuciak, save for long range shots in either half from Charlie Mulgrew and Anthony Stokes. Neil Lennon's successor is not entirely to blame for what transpired here. But it is a substantial blow to his credibility. Deila offered the view pre-match that it would hardly be the end of the world if Celtic failed to qualify. At times his team – with 11 men on the park this time - played as if they took him at his word. It was all over in 35 minutes. Any slim, remote hope of another storming comeback to match St Etienne, Sporting Lisbon, Cologne or Karagandy was shattered when Michal Zyro raced onto a through ball from Kucharczyk and somehow managed to outpace and outwit a hopelessly indecisive Emilio Izaguirre. There were laments for the Honduran’s exclusion from the first leg in Warsaw. But here he had one, two, chances to clear his lines. At the very worst Izaguirre could have fouled Zyro and taken the yellow. Instead he allowed the striker to take control, sprint clear and calmly slot the ball past Fraser Forster.

There were no wild, unrestrained celebrations from the rump of Legia supporters in the Murrayfield North Stand. They knew they were through from the early stages, from the period when their team settled into this game and looked utterly unruffled. The inevitable was merely confirmed on the hour mark when, once again, Izaguirre was hesitant and negligent. The Honduran surrendered possession close to his own area and a delightfully deft dinked through ball from Zyro allowed Kucharczyk to ghost in and drag the ball wide before finishing brilliantly from an angle. On the bench Deila sat impassive, a coach alone in his thoughts. The new man tried changing things. He brought Nir Biton in for Jo Inge Berget at the start. Stokes replaced Teemu Pukki, Mikael Lustig played in central defence for the suspended Efe Ambrose until he limped from the pitch injured after the hour. In truth it made no real difference. In the early stages, when Celtic had to have the bit between the teeth, Legia looked tentative. For all of 10 minutes. After 20 they settled into the game. Celtic could make no impact.

Calling the shots: Ex-Blackburn boss Henning Berg shouts out tactical instructions to his Legia Warsaw team . Trip: Celtic's Mikael Lustig goes to ground following a tackle from Legia's Ondrej Duda . Young Callum McGregor and Adam Matthews on the right flank were their main creative forces. Three times the right back overlapped the composed 20-year-old, McGregor sending the Welshman scurrying towards the right touchline. Three times Matthews failed to find a green and white shirt with his low cut-backs. It was the story of the night. A night when Celtic looked utterly devoid of imagination, ideas or creativity. Deila threw on Leigh Griffiths, Pukki and a fit again James Forrest in the dying stages. He could have thrown on Messi and Ronaldo to no avail. The game was gone. Celtic were beaten, flat and utterly defeated. Away to the left of the main stand the Legia support bellowed their joy and defiance around an otherwise silent stadium. A small flurry of supporters left the main stand in the dying moments, jabbing fingers at the Celtic directors as they went. How long ago Tony Watt and Barcelona feels now. Who can say where this will 6-1 aggregate defeat to a bang average Polish team will end for Celtic now? The sales of Forster and Virgil van Dijk would be the educated guess. Southampton want the England keeper and there is little reason now for either side to hang around.

Montgomerie has not played in the US PGA since 2010 and made the cut just twice in his last nine appearances, but qualified courtesy of winning his first of two senior major titles this season, the Senior PGA Championship in May. And the former Ryder Cup captain believes Woods will have to be honest with himself and US captain Tom Watson if Watson considers him for one of his three wild cards for Gleneagles. 'It would be very difficult to say if Tiger was fit, not to pick him,' Montgomerie added. 'Can Tom go to Gleneagles and, the horrible thing is, lose having left Tiger Woods here? 'He has more of an excuse now because Tiger might not be fit for five rounds in three days. He has to take players who can play five rounds in three days. Can he play that? Right now the answer is no. Watchful eye: Former Ryder Cup captain Montgomerie is now a regular on the Senior circuit . 'Tiger has to sit down and be very, very honest with Tom Watson and say 'Am I going to help you? Can I win three and a half out of five points?'. If he can say that obviously you take him. If he's honest, right now, it's no, but he's got this week to prove himself.' Woods has up until just before his tee time of 8:35am on Thursday to decide whether to play or miss three of the year's four majors for the first time in his career. Knee surgery in 2008 to replace his anterior cruciate ligament - just after his last major victory in the US Open at Torrey Pines - forced him to miss the Open and US PGA Championship. In 2011 he failed to tee it up at the US Open and the Open because of an Achilles complaint.","Tiger Woods a major doubt for the US PSG starting in Valhalla this week .

"Jesse Matthew, the man charged with the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, dropped out of a second university a decade ago after another rape allegation, it has emerged. After leaving Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in October 2002, Matthew attended Christopher Newport University - but quit following another accusation in September 2003, records have shown. Now more than a decade after the allegations - for which he never faced any charges - he has been linked to the disappearance of Graham, 18, who vanished from Charlottesville on September 13. Investigators are now looking into his movements over the last 12 years, focusing on the  six months he attended CNU when two other young women disappeared without a trace. Serial offender? Jesse Matthew, left, has been charged in the disappearance of University of Virginia college student Hannah Graham (right). Authorities are now tracing his whereabouts for the last 12 years . He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped. His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported. On Wednesday, CNU also released a 'criminal incident information' report, which said an alleged incident involving Matthew took place on September 7, 2003, CNN reported. Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. Arrested: Jesse Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police asked to question him about Graham. He is seen exiting a private plane under federal guard . Break? Police say there is a DNA link between the murder of Morgan Harrington, 20 (left), in 2009 and Graham's disappearance. Cassandra Morton, 23, (right) also went missing around the same time as Harrington . It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved or whether Matthew quit due to an investigation. 'The University is fully cooperating with law enforcement agencies,' a statement from CNU said. 'The success of the criminal investigation is paramount at this time.' Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the Graham's disappearance. The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with her. He is now being held in isolation in a Virginia jail cell. After new forensic evidence also allegedly connects him to the high-profile abduction, rape and murder of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington in 2009, police are now looking at whether he was involved in any other disappearances over the past decade. Two more victims? Sophie May Rivera (left) and Autumn Wind Day (right) both went missing from Newport News, Virginia when Matthew was attending local college Christopher Newport University in 2003 . Missing on Route 29: Five women have gone missing in and around Charlottesville, Virginia, just a few minutes' drive from the same highway in the last five years. Morgan Harrington's body was the only one every found . First school: Matthew dropped out of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in October 2002 . Second: Eleven months later, he dropped out of his new school, Christopher Newport University, pictured, following another allegation of rape. He was not charged in either incident . While he studied at CNU, from January to October 2003, two local women went missing and were never found again. Autumn Wind Day, 24, was last seen shopping at the Food Lion grocery store two miles from campus when she disappeared on July 24, 2003. Less than two months later, 31-year-old Sophie May Rivera went missing after leaving her home located seven miles from CNU. Matthew  dropped out of school a month later. Local police are now reopening the two cold cases to see if Matthew may have been involved. 'While there are no indications that Jesse Matthew is connected to these two cases, both will be reviewed,' Newport News police spokesman Lou Thurston told WAVY. It's uncertain what Matthew did for the next several years but police say they have linked him to Harrington's disappearance and murder in October 2009. Filling in the blanks: Matthew worked as a taxi driver and a source told MailOnline that he gave girls free rides. It's uncertain what he did between leaving CNU in 2003 and picking up his career as a cabbie in 2010 . Her body was found three months later, hidden at a remote farm. DNA evidence of her killer, found on her remains, has since been linked to a 2005 rape case of a Fairfax woman who survived the attack. Eight years after dropping out of CNU, Matthew reappears in 2010 working as a taxi driver in Charlottesville. Two years later he got a position as a nurse's assistant at UVA Medical Cenewhere he was just recently fired following Graham's disappearance. In that time, he may have played a role in the death of Morgan, and also another local woman who went missing around the same time - 23-year-old Lynchburg resident Cassandra Morton. Morton's decomposing body was found in November 2009 and the homicide remains unsolved. Authorities in Montgomery County Virginia are also reopening the double homicide of couple Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were found shot dead in a campground near the Virginia Tech campus in August 2009. Double murder: Police in Montgomery County, Virginia are looking into whether Matthew could have played a role in the murders of couple Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were found shot dead in a campground near Virginia Tech in August 2009 . 'Our investigators will certainly follow up and look at the facts surrounding the Hannah Graham case to see if there is a connection. However, at this time we have nothing to lead us to believe that there is a connection,' Capt. Brian Wright told ABC News. And three additional women went missing from Charlottesville around the same time Matthew moved there. Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange county in September 2010 and 19-year-old DaShad Laquinn Smith disappeared near there in November 2012, WUSA-TV reported. Alexis Murphy, 17, disappeared after leaving her home in Shipman, Virginia, in August 2013. This May, Randolph Taylor, 48, was convicted of her abduction and murder in January although her body has never been found. Another two young women, Alicia Showalter Reynolds, 25, and Anne Carolyn McDaniel, 20, were abducted and murdered in 1996 along the same Virginia corridor. Gone: Alexis Murphy, 17, is one of three women who went missing around the time Matthew returned to Charlottesville. She disappeared after leaving her home in Shipman, Virginia, in August 2013 .

"A woman who rang for an ambulance when she feared her husband was having a heart attack at their home was asked by the operator: ‘Do you have a dog?’ Christine Gayther, 69, was shocked when the call handler bombarded her with scripted questions as her husband Terry, 75, writhed in agony on the floor. Mrs Gayther had first called 999 but was told to ring the 111 line for less serious cases. She did so, but as she begged for an ambulance the operator posed a string of questions, including: ‘What is your husband’s ethnicity?’ Scroll down for video . Terry and Christine Gayther pictured at their Bromley Cross home after his recovery from the aneurysm . It was when the operator asked Mrs Gayther whether she had a pet dog that she hung up and called 999 again to demand emergency help. After 45 minutes an ambulance arrived at the couple’s home in Bromley Cross, near Bolton, and took her husband to hospital. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and after surgery for a ‘huge abdominal aortic aneurysm’ is now recovering at home.

Terry and Christine Gayther on their wedding day in 1964. Mr Gayther is now recovering from the aneurysm at home . Mrs Gayther, a retired market stall trader, said: ‘It seems all common sense has gone out of the window. Unnecessary deaths will occur in future because of this. Terry was virtually dying before my eyes yet I was being asked inane questions like whether I had a dog when all I wanted to know was that there was an ambulance on the way. ‘I kept saying it was urgent but he was just reading this script. I couldn’t even stop him. Terry was rolling about, it was hell and I was screaming for help. ‘If the operator had just said, “There’s an ambulance on the way but let me ask you these questions” that would be fine. ‘It was as if I had to convince him that we were worthy of an ambulance. It seemed like I was on to him for an eternity and I was getting more and more irate thinking that I was being fobbed off. ‘Serious cases can be left with their lives draining away while the person requesting the ambulance is judged on the authenticity of their call.’ She added: ‘Some of the operators aren’t even medically minded and are not giving any thought to what they are just doing. I know they get a lot of silly calls but he should have had enough nous at the end of the phone to realise it was a situation starting up and I needed help from the medics. After all, 999 are there to help.’ Their ordeal began at 9.35am on July 28 when Mr Gayther, a retired engineer, complained of feeling unwell but blamed it on his sciatica, a painful back condition.

"AC Milan will re-launch their bid to sign Adel Taarabt from QPR this week as his representatives head for talks over a proposed £3million transfer. Milan have scheduled talks for Tuesday and are willing to offer £3m plus a percentage sell on clause for any future sale. The Morocco forward still has a year on his contract but manager Harry Redknapp says Taarabt has not trained ahead of the new season, that the 25-year-old is determined to move and would not be fit enough to play Premier League football were he to stay.

'I think he's fit to train this week, but I think wants to move. But if he doesn't want to be here then someone's got to pay the money. He's not going to go cheap.' Milan are also talking to free agent Stephane Mbia, who impressed on loan at Sevilla last season. Meanwhile, QPR want to bring in four new players and have an interest in Villarreal midfielder Jonathan de Guzman and Marseille winger Morgan Amalfitano although the latter is closer to joining West Ham on a free transfer. QPR have also made enquiries about Lassana Diarra at Lokomotiv Moscow although his wages could be an issue. The 29-year-old worked well with Redknapp while at Portsmouth, prompting a £19m move to Real Madrid.

A Murcia delegation led by coach Jose Manuel Aira and accompanied to the LFP headquarters in Madrid by several hundred protesting fans failed to prevent the league from ratifying the sanctions on Thursday. Miranda de Ebro-based Mirandes, who finished 19th among the 22 second-division sides last season and were relegated, will take Murcia's place, the LFP said in a statement. Murcia now need to sell and Wigan are among the clubs to have enquired about who is available. West Ham have made their move for Sunderland striker Connor Wickham. The 21-year-old had a strong finish to last season and played his part in keeping Sunderland up but there have not been an abundance of clubs moving for him. Gus Poyet is keen to move the player on as he has shown little inclination to sign a new contract with his current deal running out next summer. Poyet is keen to convince Fabio Borini of Liverpool to move to the Stadium of Light as he is not blessed with prolific or confident strikers.

"A new pregnancy-style Ebola test could give health workers on the front line in West Africa accurate diagnoses within 15 minutes, it has been claimed. French scientists are in the pre-production phases of the test, which they claim will 'dramatically cut times' for medical teams working in the field. The small white plastic kit is in development and resembles a traditional pregnancy test. It can be used without specialised equipment, speeding up the process of testing for the virus, the researchers from a branch of the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) said. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists in France has developed a new pregnancy-style test for Ebola which could give healthcare workers on the front line in West Africa a diagnosis within 15 minutes . According to the World Health Organisation, the virus, pictured under the microscope, has so far claimed almost 5,000 lives . Current testing for Ebola does not yield results for around 24 hours, depending on the proximity to a laboratory capable of anaylsing the results, according to the team based in Marcoule, southern France. Researcher Fabrice Gallais, said: 'This test works like a traditional pregnancy test available in a pharmacy. 'We place a sample, a drop of blood, serum, plasma or urine, which moves towards this band. 'The virus then gets caught by antibodies, already present on the bands. 'Then depending on the results, you get a coloured reaction.' The new test has already undergone trials in a high-security laboratory in Lyon to obtain a licence, using the strain of the disease currently spreading through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The head of the laboratory, Laurent Bellanger said he expects to begin to roll out the tests on a larger scale at the beginning of 2015. 'We are in a pre-production phase,' he said. 'The tests we're working with now are prototypes which helped us make adjustments. Blood tests and other tests currently take between 24 hours and three days to yield results . The new test can be used without specialised equipment, speeding up the process of testing for the virus, the researchers from a branch of the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) said . A sample, a drop of blood, serum, plasma or urine, is placed on the band. The virus then gets caught by antibodies, already present on the bands. Depending on the results, you get a coloured reaction . A vaccine to protect millions from the Ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations. The head of the World Health Organisation's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the haemorrhagic fever - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan addressed the regional committee for Africa in Benin . Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'. She said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'. Addressing the regional committee for Africa in Benin yesterday, Dr Chan said: 'Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago. Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? 'Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations. 'The R&D (research and development) incentive is virtually non-existent. 'A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay. 'WHO has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see it for themselves.' 'We expect to have a few hundred of them in the coming days in order to start the clinical validation phase. 'Production can then start at the beginning of 2015 on a larger scale which will be adapted according to requirements in the field.' The aim of these rapid tests is to be able to conduct diagnosis as close as possible to the affected communities. Fast tests are also under development in several other countries. Japanese researchers announced last month they found a new method to detect the virus in 30 minutes, while U.S. researchers are also working on a test that could give results in 10 minutes. The most deadly outbreak of Ebola on record has killed nearly 5,000 people, all but a handful of them in Liberia,Guinea and Sierra Leone. There are a number of tests currently used to diagnose Ebola. The majority work within a few days of the onset of symptoms, detecting the virus's genetic material or the presence of antibodies against the pathogen. The most accurate of these is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, a technique that looks for genetic material from the virus and creates copies of it that can be deteched, Dr Bruce Hirsch, an infectious disease specialist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, told LiveScience. He said: 'PCR is a really definitive test. It can pick up very small amounts of the virus.' But the test has its drawbacks. It can be negative in the first three days. Dr Sandro Cinti, a specialist at the University of Michigan Hospital, added: 'Somebody could be in the hospital for three to five days before a diagnosis is confirmed. 'The important thing is keeping the patient isolated until you can get a diagnosis.' Another test for Ebola looks at the antibodies produced by the body's immune system in response to the virus. The antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), can take longer than three days to give a positive result.","The new test is in the pre-production phase, say French scientists .

"Jose Mourinho said he hoped new striker Diego Costa would be treated fairly by referees this season after the Spaniard was booked for an alleged dive in Chelsea’s 3-1 win at Burnley in the Barclays Premier League. Costa scored on his league debut as Mourinho’s team recovered from conceding an early goal to brush Burnley aside at Turf Moor. But the 25-year-old was cautioned by referee Michael Oliver in the first half even though he appeared to be brought down by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho: Diego Costa is an honest player . Harsh decision? Diego Costa attempts to take the ball around goalkeeper Tom Heaton before being booked . Referee! Chelsea players surround referee Michael Oliver as Costa kneels inside the area at Turf Moor . Cautioned: Referee  Oliver gave Diego Costa a yellow card for an alleged dive during Chelsea's victory . Mourinho said: ‘It was a penalty. The linesman made a mistake. ‘We have all explained to him [Costa] what we want and what people in the Premier League like and don’t like. We want it calm with fantastic attitude, competitive but clean and polite. ‘The kid was obviously frustrated to be booked and I hope he doesn’t get any more unfair decisions. Mistake: Jose Mourinho, pictured congratulating Costa at full-time, said Chelsea should have had a penalty . ‘I think Oliver had a very good game and unfortunately the linesman didn’t support him well at that situation.’ Chelsea fell behind on Monday night but Costa equalised before man of the match Cesc Fabregas set up goals for Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic. Mourinho added: ‘I agree with Cesc being man of the match. He controlled the game and chose how to play.'

"Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco manoeuvre themselves into position to strike for the goalkeeper. The Czech Republic’s future at Stamford Bridge has been called into question following Jose Mourinho’s decision to start with Thibaut Courtois against Burnley on Monday night. Cech feels he has been left in the dark over his first-team prospects following the return of Courtois from Atletico Madrid earlier this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say he wants Petr Cech to stay at Chelsea . Not happy with the bench life: Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future this summer . Dropped: Cech was replaced by Thibaut Courtois in goal for Chelsea against Burnley on Monday . And the 32-year-old wants to know what chance he has of reclaiming the No 1 spot before making a definitive decision over his future. But with the transfer deadline just 10 days away, the urgency for answers is growing for Cech. His omission from Monday’s starting XI was the trigger for a number of Europe’s leading clubs to ramp up their interest in Cech. Paris St Germain and Monaco both have a concrete interest in the goalkeeper, and Chelsea are now bracing themselves for bids in the coming days. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti is also monitoring Cech’s situation despite signing Keylor Navas. Chelsea are hugely reluctant to part with Cech, despite all signs pointing towards him being second choice this season. Experience: Cech has been a mainstay in the Chelsea backline for 10 years . VIDEO Cech future unclear . Mourinho, despite publicly admitting continuity in the goalkeeper position is important, still feels Cech can dislodge Courtois and likes the dynamic of having two bona-fide world class keepers in his squad. In an ideal world, Chelsea want Cech to stay and fight for his place, but the goalkeeper is unlikely to accept a season of sitting on the bench. A loan move with away from Stamford Bridge with a recall option could suit both Chelsea and Cech. Meanwhile, Courtois insists he wants Cech to stay at Chelsea. Happy with both: Jose Mourinho insists he wants both (the best goalkeepers in the world) to stay at the club . ‘Do I want Cech to stay? Of course, in training I can still learn from him because he has a lot of experience, he can give me good tips about the Premier League, things I might not know from the start. ‘For the team is better for us to have two good goalkeepers. I don’t have a problem if he stays. Hopefully I can play well and stay in the team. He added: ‘The manager told me an hour before the game. It was nice because I came here obviously to play. ‘But I know that Petr is a great goalkeeper so there is a lot competition, but when you come back from a successful loan you hope to play. ‘Otherwise, it would maybe have been better for me to go to another team.’","Cech wants assurances over position at club before making a decision .

"It is an unusual - although many would argue easy - way to make a quick buck. A U.S. organisation is offering willing volunteers $40 (£25) for every deposit of poo they make - and it's all for a good cause. The stool samples are being used to fight the superbug C. difficile - in the form of a faecal transplant. The treatment is being hailed by many doctors as a 'miracle' cure for patients where all other treatments - such as antibiotics - have failed. A U.S. organisation is offering willing volunteers $40 (£25) for every deposit of poo they make. The stool samples are being used to fight the superbug C. difficile - in the form of a faecal transplant . C. difficile is a bacterial infection that most commonly affects elderly hospital patients. It causes severe diarrhoea, fever and painful cramps. It can also result in life-threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel. Patients with recurrent C. difficile only have a 75 per cent chance of survival and are often ill for many months. However mounting evidence shows stool transplants from healthy donors can help restore the balance of 'good' bacteria in the gut to fight infections. If successful, the patient starts to feel better almost immediately. Now, OpenBiome, the only independent non-profit stool bank in the U.S., is on the hunt for regular stool donors - who can earn up to $250 (£156 a week). The organisation was formed in 2012 after the founder watched a friend and family member suffer for 18 months before receiving a successful, life-changing transplant of faecal microbiota. It now provides a service collecting, testing and providing life-saving faecal samples to 122 hospitals in 33 states. 'Think of us as a blood bank, but for poop,' founder Mark Smith told Boston.com. 'You shouldn’t have to fly across the country to get poop.' He added that cost-wise, it saves on average  $17,000 per patient compared to treatment with antibiotics. And each stool sample can treat up to five patients. In healthy people the bacteria C. difficile lies harmlessly in the gut. But the feared infection is caused when antibiotics upset the balance of the intestines. While natural bacteria that protect against infection are decimated by the drugs, C. difficile multiply. Faecal transplantation was first developed in 1958 but rarely used. However, in 2011, a Dutch study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that 94 per cent of people with recurrent C. difficile could be cured using faecal transplants. This can be compared to a cure rate of just 31 per cent of people with recurrent infection who are treated with antibiotics. It is most effective in patients who have recurrent C. difficile and who have been treated with antibiotics so many times that they are no longer effective. It works because the solution contains 'good' bacteria which fight the infection. If successful, the patient starts to feel better almost immediately. Mr Smith works with gastroenterologists and various other academics to get stool samples to towns and cities within a two - and even four-hour radius. OpenBiome sells hospitals and independent doctors stool samples for $250 a sample. This is the price for a transplant via colonoscopy or enema. Alternatively, 30ml sample for a nasal transplant can be purchased for the same price. In this process, a nasogastric tube runs from the nose into the digestive tract. And the criteria to be a donor? Volunteers must be between 18 and 50, have regular bowel movements and make daily trips to the laboratory in Medford, Massachusetts. At least four donations a week are required, according to the company's website. It says: 'Donors receive $40 per sample. 'If they come in five days in one week, they receive an extra $50. Prospective donors also receive $40 for getting tested.' They must also have a body mass index under 30, have taken no antibiotics in the past three months and not travelled or been born outside the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in the past year. Strict medical screening is in place. Potential donors fill out a detailed medical questionnaire and their stools are tested for infections, plus the health of the bacteria. Blood is also screened for conditions such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Donating involves a 30-minute visit, where a sample is deposited into a bowl that rests over the toilet, Boston.com reports. The company even tries to inject humour into the process. There are incentives - such as becoming a 'super pooper' - or providing the biggest single donation of the month - and dubious-sounding nicknames such as Vladimir Pootin, or Winnie the Pooh. C. difficile is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhoea, fever and painful cramps. It can also result in life-threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel . OpenBiome also encourages donors how to be more productive, so to speak - namely plenty of fibre. Just earlier this week, Boston scientists said C. difficile could be treated using capsules of frozen faeces from healthy people. The idea behind the pills was to avoid a more invasive method of faecal transplant. The researchers developed a method whereby they could freeze healthy stool samples, enclosing them in capsules for patients to swallow. They successfully cured 18 of 20 patients who took part in the study at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston of their diarrohea, improving their condition.

The study is published the Journal of the American Medical Association. All the patients had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate C. difficile and failed to get better after being given standard antibiotics. And last year, Dr Robert Porter, at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, treated the man by pumping his daughter's faeces through his nose and down into his small bowel. The treatment involves mixing stools from a donor - ideally a family member - with saline solution and transferring it by tube through the patient's nose. Dr Porter said: 'Even in the medical world, the topic is a bit of an eyebrow raiser and people are surprised to hear it's so effective. ‘But in recent years we've seen a rise in more aggressive forms of C. difficile and higher mortality rates, with standard treatments becoming less effective.’ He added: ‘One of the reasons this has not been particularly popular up until now is that we haven't had good studies to back it up. ‘Then we had an open trial in The Netherlands, which was stopped early because it was so effective compared to normal therapies. ‘An ethics committee ruled that it was doing so well it would be unfair to continue other methods. ‘It has given us the basis to say we have safe, scientific evidence that this is a very good treatment and very safe as well.'","Samples are being used to fight the deadly superbug C. difficile .

"Liverpool's hopes of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League hang in the balance following their 1-0 defeat away to Real Madrid on Tuesday night. Karim Benzema's decisive goal means the Reds have now lost three successive games in Group B with only two matches remaining. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has come under fire for his team selection against Real - opting to not include seven first-team starters from his line-up. We asked Anfield Road fansite's Jim Boardman his views on Rodgers' tactics. For 5000 Liverpool fans lucky enough to travel to Madrid and take in the whole experience of a European away the feeling on Wednesday won't be one of despondency about the result. Liverpool lost against Real Madrid, their third Champions League defeat in succession but, as many will tell you, there's a lot more to a European away trip than the game itself. The match at the Santiago Bernabeu wasn't all that bad, at least if you forget about the score, if you look at it in the context of what has been awful season so far for Liverpool. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has come under criticism for his team selection against Real Madrid . The Liverpool team line-up in the Bernabeu before the clash with Real without seven first-team regulars . Liverpool substitutes (from left) Philippe Coutinho, Steven Gerrard, Mario Balotelli, Jordan Henderson and Glen Johnson warm-up before the match - all five started their 1-0 league defeat at Newcastle on Saturday . Over 5000 Liverpool fans made the trip to the Bernabeu expecting Rodgers to field his possible strongest team . The players drafted in from Brendan Rodgers' backup list performed well, in many cases putting in a better shift than those he might consider first choice. Yet there was always a sense that Madrid could do far more than they were actually doing in this game. For Rodgers to announce that the Champions League was behind the Premier League in his priorities was a low point during his reign, a sign he didn't really understand what that trophy meant to the fans that have continued to sing his name even during the wobbles of this term. There is still time for him to get the season back in the right direction, but he is really testing the fans' loyalty. The players he put out Tuesday night helped him, to some extent, but that's based on a gradual lowering of expectations over the course of a season. Perhaps the best indication of what the competition means to Liverpool fans, and what the expectations were at the outset, comes from skipper Steven Gerrard, one of those Rodgers chose to leave on the bench Tuesday night. Karim Benzema (left) scored the only goal of the game to condemn Liverpool to their third defeat in Group B . Benzema runs to the delighted home supporters after giving his team the lead against Liverpool . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard came on as a second half substitute against Real on Tuesday night . Gerrard (centre) had spoke of his excitement to face Real after the Champions League draw was made . Speaking after the Champions League draw had been made, Gerrard said: 'It was massive - I planned my whole day around the Champions League draw. We couldn't wait for it, it was so exciting. I've missed it so much. There's almost a jealousy when you watch the Champions League and you're not involved in it. 'They (Real) were one of the sides that all of the players wanted, and certainly the supporters.' Expectations are kept in place by the hope that sooner or later Liverpool will actually find some form, like last year. There is still some time for that to happen but Rodgers needs to show some honesty with the fans - who listen to everything he says to the press - and maybe a bit of passion if he wants their support through what will undoubtedly be some difficult weeks ahead. Liverpool duo Lazar Markovic (centre) and Alberto Moreno have failed to impress since joining the club . In the summer Rodgers himself was feeding expectations, promising fans 'an exciting time' this season, thanks to the 'great work' he'd done and was about to do with new signings. 'The idea is by the end of August we'll have the squad together and it will be a really exciting time for us next season,' he promised. Around £120million spent later - mixed of course with the loss of Luis Suarez - Liverpool have been far from exciting. Back in March, referring to Spurs, Rodgers said 'a team that spent £100m… must have been hoping to challenge for the league.' But not Liverpool? Rodgers raised expectations, increased hope, then struggled to deliver what he'd suggested was on its way. He's still got time to deliver it, but no more time to waste.

"Louis van Gaal is determined to be his own man at Manchester United, but this is one habit he will not mind borrowing from Sir Alex Ferguson. Late goals were a hallmark of Ferguson’s teams and how fitting that Van Gaal’s first appearance as United manager at Old Trafford should end with a stoppage-time winner from under-fire midfielder Marouane Fellaini. It meant that the Dutchman maintained his winning start as United boss, adding Valencia to a list of beaten opponents that includes Real Madrid, Roma, Inter Milan and Liverpool.

Subs not used: Mustafi, Ibanez, Orban, Pereiral, Domenech, Gil. Goal: Rodrigo 71 . Typically, he was still far from happy. It was, Van Gaal acknowledged, United’s ‘worst game’ under him. They were pedestrian at times and Wayne Rooney missed a penalty. On this evidence, he still has a significant amount of work on his hands. On Saturday lunchtime another team in white will line up against United ... and this side will have to raise their game to beat Swansea City. ‘We made a lot of wrong choices, wrong passes and we didn’t press too much,’ said Van Gaal afterwards. ‘We have to choose better the right time to pass the ball. We haven’t done that and that is a pity. ‘It’s a big pressure because the fans expect a lot, but you cannot change everything in three or four weeks and the players cannot change either. ‘We have to wait and see and develop and we need time, but we have won every game up to now and that’s fantastic when you see our opponents.’ That Fellaini should be the man to score the winner was somewhat poetic.

Dream team: United fans hope Ryan Giggs (left) and van Gaal (right) guide United to success this season . The much-maligned Belgian might not face such a bleak future under Van Gaal as some might think, but last night Fellaini’s every touch was greeted with ironic cheers from a section of United fans when he made his first appearance under the new manager as a late substitute. However, the jubilant reaction from United supporters was genuine enough when he scored with the last kick of the game, chesting the ball down and despatching it into an empty net after Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves had collided with his own defender and completely missed Tyler Blackett’s high ball into the box. If Van Gaal can breathe new life into Fellaini’s Old Trafford career, just imagine what he can do for the rest of the team. The 63-year-old might have worked at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich but he seemed genuinely touched by the reception he received last night. ‘Fantastic,’ he said. ‘I came on the pitch and they are shouting and screaming my name.’ There had been no great fanfare for Van Gaal, no banner declaring him ‘The Chosen One’. He doesn’t need reminding why he was brought to United. Ferguson wasn’t even there for the occasion, choosing instead to watch the Super Cup in Cardiff. Top talent: United had an array of talent watching from the stands at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . Spanish sensation: Ander Herrera (right) made his Old Trafford debut against Valencia . Star in the making: Adnan Januzaj (centre) featured in his first pre-season game since the World Cup . But Van Gaal walked out at Old Trafford for the first time as United manager looking every inch a man comfortable in his new surroundings. There was a high-five for club mascot Fred the Red as his players warmed up and a casual, almost nonchalant, wave of the right hand as he strolled towards a home dugout besieged by photographers before kick-off. Then he disappeared from view and got on with what he had been brought here to do. Old Trafford got its first glimpse of the 3-4-1-2 formation he has implemented since his arrival last month, with Ander Herrera making his home debut in a deep midfield role. The former Athletic Bilbao midfielder certainly looked at home against his Spanish countrymen, instigating a lot of United’s best moves. He mustered his team’s first effort on goal in the 23rd minute and it was his pass that released Ashley Young down the right in the build-up to the incident that saw Rooney throw himself rather dramatically to the ground under little contact from Antonio Barragan. The Spaniards certainly felt justice was done when Rooney fired the resulting spot-kick against the foot of the post. No nonsense: Tyler Blackett (right) started for United at the heart of their defence . On the ball: Reece James also started for van Gaal's side in their last pre-season friendly . The England striker also failed to control a sublime through ball from Darren Fletcher before the Scotland midfielder gave United the lead four minutes after half-time. Young’s corner was deflected to the edge of the box and Fletcher’s side-footed finish took a nick off a Valencia defender on its way over Alves. There was little reaction from Van Gaal, who sat scribbling on a notepad. Defender Phil Jones produced a magnificent tackle to deny Rodrigo Moreno, but the Valencia’s No 20 found an equaliser in the 72nd minute when Tom Cleverley tried to cut out a free kick from the right. He was unfortunate to see it deflect over his own defence towards the back post where Moreno applied an emphatic left-footed finish into the roof of the net. Step forward Fellaini, the man most closely associated with the doomed David Moyes era. Late goals never quite fell Moyes’ way in his eight months, but here was Van Gaal at it in his first game. No wonder he was smiling.","Marouane Fellaini scored Manchester United's late winner vs Valencia .

"The Duchess of Cambridge is suffering from crippling morning sickness, but another malady is starting to sweep the nation: royal baby fever. And it seems the second outbreak is set to be just as virulent as the first, with betting now suspended on whether the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, will be having twins. A surge of over 200 wagers caused bookmaker William Hill to first slash the odds from 20-1 to 9-1, and then, due to a suspicious number of new accounts being opened, suspend betting, followed by Coral less than 12 hours later. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be just over 12 weeks pregnant with her second child . 'The fear is that so many people suddenly placing bets implies that there has been a leak of information. 'We are now convinced that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to twins following the sheer volume of bets we have taken this afternoon,' said Coral’s Nicola McGeady. 'There has been huge support for royal twins since the news was announced, but today’s gamble is the biggest indicator yet that someone knows something we don’t.' Another spokesperson for William Hill, Joe Crilly, said: 'Getting 200 plus bets in one-and-a-quarter hours, in that market, is incredible. 'Usually new accounts open when somebody bets on a new football manager, where it would be easy to suggest the punter had inside information.' While in terms of placing wagers this obviously constitutes dishonest betting, most of the public will be more interested in why so many are suddenly so sure of a double royal birth. Kate is believed to have just passed the 12-week gestational period, a time when expectant mothers usually have their first scan - known as the 'dating scan'. Twins? Bookmakers William Hill have suspended betting on the Duchess of Cambridge having two babies . While little can be seen on this scan due to the small size of the foetus, one of the things that is determined, along with the baby's growth and heartbeat, is whether the mother is expecting twins or triplets. There is, at present, no suggestion that the Duchess has had this initial scan, or if she has, what it might have revealed. However, this sudden rush of betting will certainly raise speculation over whether Prince George will soon be joined by multiple siblings. When contacted by the MailOnline Clarence House refused to comment on the speculation.","William Hill received huge surge of bets, dropping odds from 20-1 to 9-1 .

Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey fame and actor and director Richard E Grant are involved with Literatours . This year it hosted the third Isle of Wight Literary Festival, with a diverse line-up from the likes of actor Simon Callow, politician Ann Widdecombe, food writer Jay Rayner and former glamour model, turned best-selling author Katie Price. But the island's literary credentials suffered a blow this week when Literatours announced it was scrapping the tours, laying the blame squarely at the feet of islanders. A message on the company website stated: 'There will be no more public Literatours. Only privately booked Literatours will be run in the future. 'This is due to people living on the Isle of Wight being miserable, whining tightwads.' The Literatours website pulled no punches about the reason for cancelling the Isle of Wight Tours . And the club's Facbook page went one step further poking yet more disdain at the islanders . A post on the official Facebook page went further. 'The Isle of Wight inhabitants made Dickens count the days until he left and they drove Tennyson and Priestly back to London. 'Beautiful place - shame about the people,' it stated. The messages have since been removed and the company has not responded to requests for a comment. Celia Imrie helped launch Literatours on the Isle of Wight in 2013 . Local historian and writer Dr Brian Hinton hit out at the comments. 'The list of literary giants who spent time on the island goes on and on. They were drawn here by its isolation and its beauty, none of them came for the coach tours. 'Dickens wrote David Copperfield in Bonchurch and Henry James described it as the perfect village. 'The world came to be at the feet of the poet David Gascoigne when he moved to the Isle of Wight. DH Lawrence had a wonderful summer here and Keats wrote 'A thing of beauty is a joy forever' while looking out at Carisbrooke Castle. Names from art and literature like Jonathon Meades, come to the Isle of Wight to celebrate its heritage . Isle of Wight-born actress Sheila Hancock at the island's Literary Festival 2014 . 'The only thing that ever drove Tennyson away was the tourists and he would always come back to the Island. 'More recently it has been home to the likes of Oscar-winning director and screen-writer Anthony Minghella and the wonderful Philip Norman.' Award-winning Isle of Wight-based children's author Philip Bell said there was a thriving literary scene on the island. 'There are some very creative and thriving groups and a number of established published authors here,' he said.","Company lists Richard E Grant and Hugh Bonneville on its roster .

"Arsenal wonderkid Dan Crowley has put pen to paper on his first professional contract at the Emirates, a day after turning 17. The highly-rated midfielder, whose style has been compared to current Gunners star Jack Wilshere, joined the club from Aston Villa in 2013 and has since impressed for both Arsenal and England at youth level. Crowley confirmed the contract news on his Twitter account, posting a picture of him signing the deal alongside his family and agent. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England youngster Dan Crowley in action . Signed, sealed, delivered: Crowley has signed professional terms with Arsenal after joining from Villa last year . Young star: The 17-year-old has impressed the coaching staff at Arsenal in his 12 months with the club . Next star? England boss Roy Hodgson speaks to Arsenal youngster Dan Crowley at a Colney training session . Talent: Crowley, at the tender age of 17, is already a fixture in the Arsenal youth side and for England U17s . Age: 17 . Position: Central midfielder/No 10 . Club: Arsenal . Player compared to: Jack Wilshere . Former sides: Aston Villa . Roy Hodgson spoke at length with Crowley while the England senior team were training at Arsenal's London Colney training ground in November, ahead of their friendly against Germany. He was poached from Aston Villa in 2013, with the centre-midfielder earning plaudits there as just a 12-year-old (even playing for the Under 16's at that age), being mentioned as 'the next Jack Wilshere'. In fact, the England international and Gunners teammate himself showed his support, tweeting: 'Everybody follow @danielcrowley24 trust me when I say this kid is a player! Big future….' Similar: The 17-year-old has been compared to Jack Wilshere (left), who has tweeted his support of the teen . Mutual friends: Arsene Wenger (also, with Hodgson), has been impressed with Crowley since he joined the club . Arsene Wenger showed he was keen by splashing out close to £1million on the playmaker to bring Crowley to the Emirates from Aston Villa last year. The England youth international impressed in his first season with the Gunners, playing a key role in the early stages of the FA Youth Cup campaign. His best performance came in the fourth round against Peterborough, when he scored twice and provided four assists in the 6-0 fourth round victory over Peterborough United. He also helped the under-19s to the Uefa Youth League quarter-finals last term, making three appearances in the competition. Arsenal have been busy in the transfer market this summer, signing David Ospina, Alexis Sanchez, Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy - and the news of Crowley's deal is another boost for Gunners fans ahead of the start of the Premier League campaign.","Crowley has been tipped for a bright future by England boss Roy Hodgson .

"Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day. Manchester United slipped up to Swansea while Arsenal were poor in their win against Crystal Palace, so their are several lesser-known gems in this team. Formation: 4-4-1-1 . GK: Hugo Lloris, Tottenham (vs West Ham), 8 . Matt Barlow at Upton Park . Hugo Lloris was inspired in the Spurs goal, making two brilliant second-half saves to deny Stewart Downing, the second shortly before Eric Dier’s winner. RB: Eric Dier, Tottenham (vs West Ham), 7 . Matt Barlow at Upton Park . A clean sheet as part of a 10-man team at Upton Park would have been enough for young debutant Eric Dier, but he also had the audacity to score the winner. The youngster, who started at the heart of defence, stormed forward from right-back to net the only goal in added time. Match winner: Young debutant Eric Dier scored the winner as Tottenham beat West Ham on Saturday . CB: Ashley Williams, Swansea (vs Manchester United), 7.5 . Adam Crafton at Old Trafford . Ashley Williams was superb in defence at Old Trafford, highlighted in the fact United's only goal came from a set-piece. The Welshman, who signed a contract extension in the summer, looks set to have another stellar season as captain in South Wales. CB: James Chester, Hull (vs QPR) 7.5 . Sami Mokbel at Loftus Road . Nets the winner and helps his team to a clean sheet, it can't get much better than that for a defender. Chester nipped in front of Rio Ferdinand for his goal as Steve Bruce's side got their season up and running. LB: Andrew Robertson, Hull (vs QPR), 8 . Sami Mokbel at Loftus Road . Robertson was a constant thorn in QPR's side down the left-hand side for Hull, bombing foward from wing-back. The Scottish debutant provided many crosses in the 1-0 win, and also cleared Steven Caulker's bullet header off the line. RM: Steven Naismith, Everton (vs Leicester), 7.5 . Rob Harris at the King Power Stadium . Another energetic performance from Naismith, who covered the most amount of ground (7.7 miles), but also showed fine technique for his goal. Volleying home off the bar to put Everton 2-1 up, the winger will be central to Roberto Martinez's plans this season. Great start: Steven Naismith started how he finished last season with a goal against Leicester . CM: Lee Cattermole, Sunderland (vs West Brom), 7.5 . Craig Hope at the Hawthorns . He may have scored just twice in 103 Premier League appearances for Sunderland, but Cattermole netted the goal of the day in the 2-2 draw. Five minutes had passed before the defensive midfielder's shot from long range flew past Ben Foster into the top corner. CM: Craig Gardner, West Brom (vs Sunderland), 7.5 . Craig Hope at the Hawthorns . Gardner excelled against his former club on Saturday. Constant energy in midfield gave Alan Irvine just the platform he was looking for. Supplied Saido Berahino's second goal with a wonderfully floated cross. LM: Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea (vs Manchester United), 8 . Adam Crafton at Old Trafford . Not many players can claim to be a match winner at Old Trafford, but Gylfi Sigurdsson capped a fine performance with a neat finish on Saturday. The Icelandic midfielder, in his second spell at the Swans, summoned Van Gaal to an humiliating opening day defeat. Shock: Manchester United's start to the season was ruined by Swansea playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson . CF: Marouane Chamakh, Crystal Palace (vs Arsenal), 7.5 . Jack Gaughan at the Emirates Stadium . Another man starting against his former club, the Moroccan played in an unfamiliar role on Saturday. Tasked with shutting down midfielders and stopping Arsenal finding their stride, Chamakh covered 7.2 miles at the Emirates Stadium, second behind Aaron Ramsey. ST: Saido Berahino, West Brom (vs Aston Villa), 8 . Craig Hope at the Hawthorns . We have an early frontrunner for the Golden Boot. Berahino was the only man to score more than once on Saturday, netting a penalty and a nice poacher's finish. Just a shame he wasn't the match winner. At the double: Saido Berahino was the star man on Saturday, netting two goals at the Hawthorns .","Dier scored winning goal for Tottenham against West Ham .

"Per Mertesacker has become the third member of Germany's World Cup-winning team to retire from international football. The Arsenal defender told the Suddeutsche Zeitung that last month's World Cup final, in which Germany beat Argentina 1-0, was the last match he will play for his country. In an interview to be published in the newspaper on Saturday, Mertesacker explains that he 'wanted to be the one to determine the end of this chapter' after 10 years in the national team.

The 29-year-old nevertheless still has many years of his career to go, and he has now set his sights on winning silverware with the Gunners.

"Police in Arizona have arrested the mother and stepfather of an 8-year-old girl who was kidnapped and murdered last month on drug charges, accusing them of supplying methamphetamine to their daughter's killer. A police SWAT team arrested 29-year-old Tania Ann Grogan and her husband, 28-year-old Ralph Pat Leroy Folster III, at their home in Bullhead City Wednesday evening. Folster initially refused to surrender to police but was taken into custody after a two-hour standoff at their residence in the 2400 block of Lakeside Drive. Scroll down for video . Tania Ann Grogan, 29 (left), and her husband Ralph Pat Leroy Folster III, 28 (right), were arrested on drug charges more than a month after Grogan's daughter was found murdered and buried in a shallow grave . Innocent: Isabella Grogan-Cannella, 8, was kidnapped and killed on September 1 in Bullhead City, Arizona . Arrest: A SWAT team descended on Grogan's home Wednesday after getting a tip about her alleged drug trade . Standoff: Folster initially refused to surrender and tried to escape, but eventually turned himself in . According to investigators, the 28-year-old man had made an attempt to flee by going up to the attic and then attempting to climb into a unit next door before he finally gave himself up, MyNews3 reported. Police say they learned the couple were dealing heroin and methamphetamine last month. They were booked on drug sales and possession charges, and Grogan faces an additional charge of manufacturing meth. Detectives told AZCentral they believe Mrs Grogan likely furnished Rector with meth prior to the September tragedy. The mother is also being investigated for keeping her children in a dangerous environment. The body of Grogan's daughter, Isabella Grogan-Cannella, was discovered on September 3, a day after she was reported missing from her home. Justin Rector, a 26-year-old family friend, has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping, child abuse and abandonment of a body. Rector is accused of abducting, sexually assaulting and murdering Grogan-Cannella in Bullhead City, after she went missing during a game of hide-and-seek late on the night of September 1. The child was found two days later buried in a shallow grave, naked from the waist down. Rector, who has been held in custody without a bond, now faces 35 years to life in prison for the charge of first-degree murder, and a possible 10 to 24 years for the alleged kidnapping, assault, and abandonment of a dead body. Charged: Justin Rector (left) has pleaded not guilty to murdering eight-year-old Isabella (right) Daddy's girl: Isabella pictured her with her stepfather, Ralph Folster, during a pool party . A probable cause affidavit released last month stated that Rector told police that he had been smoking methamphetamine in an upstairs bedroom of his mother's home where Bella lived with her family. Rector had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before she went missing in the early hours of September 1, Police Chief Brian Williamson said after the suspect's arrest. Bella's 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw the girl with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said. Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am. Later that morning, Rector allegedly stole clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said. Police arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance. Distraught: Her mother (pictured together) was shaking and crying in court as Rector denied murder . Tragic: Bella's body was found in a shallow grave two days after she played hide-and-seek with Rector . When her body was found on September 3, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said. An autopsy determined that the little girl died of asphyxiation by strangulation. Rector has a long criminal history, including more than a dozen arrests in the past 10 years. Just hours after Bella was reported missing, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect. 'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote. Police have suggested that Grogan supplied meth to her friend, Rector, before he allegedly killed her daughter . Unhealthy: Police are investigating Grogan (left) for keeping her children in a dangerous environment . Scene: This field in Bullhead City, Arizona, is where police found the little girl naked from the waist down . 'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives. In early September, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up. Bella lived at the Bullhead City residence with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father does not live in the area. Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs. Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was ultimately found as relatives held each other and wiped away tears. The girl was discovered wearing the same green, ruffled, sparkly tank top she had on when she was last seen, police said. However, authorities said she didn't have any clothing on her lower half, and they still are looking into whether she was the victim of sexual assault.","Tania Ann Grogan and Ralph Pat Leroy Folster charged with drug sales and possession .

"In broiling heat on the western tip of Croatia, Patrick Vieira is demanding that little bit more from his young Manchester City players. ‘Come on, come on, come on,’ he urges, with increasing cadence, as his elite development squad — or reserve team, in old money — play a two-touch, six-a-side game. ‘It’s hot, you are tired. Keep the ball. Never lose it.’ Vieira’s proteges, along with the Under 18 group, coached by former Blackburn winger Jason Wilcox, are in the quaint coastal town of Novigrad for a 10-day training camp set against the panoramic backdrop of the Adriatic Sea. VIDEO Scroll down to watch City prospect Devante Cole in action for England U19s . English core: Patrick Vieira lends some advice to young Manchester City star Devante Cole . Father figure: The development squad have been training in Zudigrad ahead of the new season . Discussion: Vieira talks with Under 18s manager Jason Wilcox at a City youth fixture . ‘It’s not an army barracks but it’s also not five-star luxury and glam,’ says Mark Allen, head of the academy. ‘It offers the boys a taste, but we keep them grounded.’ ‘We have a motto here,’ Wilcox begins. ‘Great person, great footballer. That means punctuality, appearance, work ethic, respect. You speak to cleaners how you speak to the manager. ‘You shake hands with every member of staff in the morning and when they leave at night. It’s vital.’ At the club’s Carrington training ground in Manchester, discipline is instilled in these young men. If they forget an item of kit, whether it be their water bottle or shin pads, they will not train. If they are late for a team meeting on match-day, they will not play. Team spirit: Man City are looking to bring youngsters through to accord with Financial Fair Play . Teamwork: The former midfielder chats to Christian Lattanzio during a training session . Angus Gunn . Age: 18, Goalkeeper . He has endured some injury problems but re-emerged as one of the most exciting talents. Ashley Smith-Brown . Age: 18, Defender . Assured as a full back, centre-half or central midfielder, he has already trained under Vieira and played for England Under 16s and Under 18s. Tosin Adarabioyo . Age: 16, Defender . A commanding centreback, powerful and composed in possession. As a 15-year-old last season was regular in the the Under 18s defence. Brandon Barker . Age: 17, Left winger . Direct and fast with a terrific left foot. In Jason Wilcox has the perfect mentor as a left winger. Devante Cole . Age: 19, Forward . The son of Andrew, he can operate from the wing or up front. Was excellent in the UEF A Youth League last season. ‘It is basic good manners,’ Allen says, his face gleaming with pride. ‘Socks are rolled up, shirts are tucked in. I have a great picture where there are two players about to come on for England at youth level. You can tell immediately which one is a City player. His shirt is tidy, his shorts are right, shinpads are correct. It shows they are listening.’ There is a conscious effort to shield these teenagers from the trappings of fame. While adidas are already sponsoring some of City’s English 17-year-olds and agents have free rein to handpick the region’s finest talent, they are also given cookery and driving awareness classes. City are looking to nurture players from the cradle to the gravy train of the Premier League but in the boardroom they recognise that improvement is required. Since the Abu Dhabi takeover in the summer of 2008, no player has graduated from the City academy to cement a place in the first team squad. Last September, City defeated Manchester United with 10 overseas, outfield players. English players Jack Rodwell — who signed for Sunderland on Tuesday — and Scott Sinclair started nine Premier League matches between them since signing two years ago. ‘We want to bring talent through our academy into our first team,’ says Vieira. ‘There are no borders in football but if there are seven or eight Manchester boys, then fantastic.’ Potential: Angus Gunn and Ashley Smith-Brown could be stars of the future at Manchester City . Youngsters: City also have high hopes for Brandon Barker and Tosin Adarabioyo . Upbringing: The EDS team encourage their men to be great people as well as great footballers . Certainly, the potential is there: 30 of the 46 players in Croatia hail from the UK or Ireland. Light blue is increasingly the dominant colour in many of England’s young dressing rooms. ‘We had seven under-16s in the England squad last year,’ Wilcox reveals. ‘That was a record for us. We have some incredibly talented English players. Brandon Barker, Ashley Smith-Brown, Angus Gunn, Kean Bryan, Tosin Adarabioyo. The players are coming through. ‘Below the under-18 group, over 90 per cent of our academy is English. Recently we offered eight professional contracts and six of those are English boys. ‘Four of those six are local boys. It’s the ideal scenario but the wider you spread the net, the more chance you have of finding the gem.’ In charge: Wilcox on the touchline in a Man City Under 18 fixture at Everton's Goodison Park . Way back when: Wilcox, in the colours of Blackburn Rovers, takes on Vieira (right), of Arsenal, in a Premier League match during the 1998-1999 season . The seeds of talent are beginning to germinate. Last season, City’s Under 11s and Under 14s were national champions and the Under 18 side were northern league winners. Under Vieira, an Under 19 side reached the quarter-final of the UEFA Youth League. A 6-0 victory over Bayern Munich reverberated around Europe, with five English names on the team sheet. Most are yet to be seen in the first team squad, something Vieira attributes to the ‘massive’ gap between youth competitions and the demands of elite football. It is why City are thought to remain receptive to discussions over B-teams in the lower tiers. As the authorities prevaricate, City are single-minded in their aspiration and little encapsulates the journey from chip-fat to caviar quite like the money and dedication flowing into this academy. Time and effort: Vieira insists he can shape stars of the future . Having invested heavily in the first team, securing two Premier League titles in three years, Sheik Mansour is now hard at work on City’s foundations. Later this year, the £150m City Football Academy will open, a stone’s throw from the Etihad Stadium, where Tony Blair once intended to build a Super Casino. It will boast facilities unrivalled in the English game and Rick Owen, a club kit man for more than 20 years, reflects: ‘We used to train on council pitches and do pre-season at a school between Stoke and Crewe. How times change.’ On this summer morning, it is a breathless training session in sticky, cloying conditions and Vieira has become irritated, noticing that his players have become attracted to the ball. ‘Stop, stop,’ he orders, his players freezing instantly. ‘Look at yourselves. Ten of you, all bunched together! How can you play like this? Look for the space, make the pitch bigger.’ He motions, spreading out his hands. ‘The boys need to understand this,’ Vieira insists. ‘When you have the ball, the pitch must be as big as possible. If you lose it, make it as tight as possible and then seven seconds, maximum, to win it back. Foreign imports: Manuel Pellegrini's first team has been almost impossible to break into in recent years . Star: Sergio Aguero is one of many big-money moves City have made . ‘The best teams have a quick recovery. When you press, it is the whole team, high and fast, even the goalkeeper. Watch Manuel Neuer — unbelievable, he is like an old No 5. But he wasn’t born this way, he trained hard. If we start early, we can create these players.’ This, in a nutshell, is the club’s philosophy: an intoxicating brand of high-tempo, passing football that has been outlined by Allen, sporting director Txiki Begiristain and academy director Brian Marwood. It is the identity that City now encourage at all levels, from the Under-11 group to the first team under Manuel Pellegrini. Allen expands: ‘When I took the job four years ago I outlined a 10-year plan to really start to see a group of talent coming through together all playing the City way. ‘Cycles take time. In the late 90s it was France, then Spain, now Germany. Our moment will arrive.’ ‘The numbers will not lie,’ Vieira concedes, puffing out his cheeks. ‘We have to make a report in 10 years on how many players are in the first team. Then we can say we did it right or we did it wrong.’ VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights .","City trying to bring through English players for the future .

"Stuart Pearce has fallen out with Nottingham Forest’s owners just three days before the start of the Championship season. The City Ground boss, who has been in charge for only five weeks, is furious at the sale of defender Jamaal Lascelles and goalkeeper Karl Darlow to Newcastle. And in a move which has echoes of Alex McLeish’s doomed 41-day reign at Forest, he has publicly slammed the sale. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jamaal Lascelles' video of Nathan Chalobah dancing . Psycho: Stuart Pearce says promotion from the Championship is no divine right for Nottingham Forest . Never stand still: Pearce is back at the club where he enjoyed huge success as a player . Pearce spent 12 years at Nottingham Forest as a player between 1985 and 1997. Appearances: 522 . Goals: 92 . Honours: League Cup: 1989, 1990 . Pearce won seven, drew nine and lost seven of his 23 games in caretaker charge of the club during the 1996/97 season. Pearce confirmed the two players had been sold — for a fee believed to be around £5million — and then loaned back to Forest for the rest of this season. But he insisted: ‘The players were sold without my sanction. I can’t defend the decision to sell them because it wasn’t my decision. ‘I could sit here and lie and dress it up a little bit and cover the tracks of one or two individuals, but I’m not prepared to do that.’ The club’s Kuwaiti owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi has clashed with both of his previous bosses over transfer and playing policy. And it is clearly happening again. Trouble ahead? Jamaal Lascelles (left) and Karl Darlow are set to sign for Newcastle United . Pearce told BBC Radio Nottingham: ‘Last week, I was asked whether I thought the deal for them going to Newcastle was a good one, and I said, “no, definitely not”. ‘The next I heard on Monday morning was the fact that the players were sold to Newcastle.’ Forest legend Pearce returned this summer as the replacement to Billy Davies, who was sacked in March after falling out with Al Hasawi. First choice replacement Neil Warnock turned down the chance to take over after meeting the Kuwaiti owner — even though the club were just two points off the play-offs. Warnock admitted at the time: ‘When you’ve got experience, or you’ve done the job, you’ve got to do it how you want to do it and I didn’t see that happening.’ McLeish had voiced the same concerns when he quit in February 2013, and the club’s fans will fear that a new campaign has blown up before it has even started. Forest face Blackpool at home on Saturday and Pearce is sure to want talks over his position before then. As if to prepare himself for the rigours of his new job — both on the pitch and in the boardroom — the 52-year-old has completed a five-day survival course in the Highlands. ‘We just pitched up for five days in the wilds of Scotland with two ex-Marines,’ he said. ‘It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. We learnt survival skills, shelter-building, skinning hares. ‘To be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew (of me). There was a fella from Dublin, one from Southampton, myself, an ex-Marine from Alaska, a policewoman from Melbourne and a Chinese fella from the tourism industry. All smiles: The former England Under 21 boss is hoping for City Ground success alongside Steve Wigley . ‘Within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night. It was great fun.’ But any suggestion ‘Psycho’s’ time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly, if politely, dismissed. ‘You’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating. That’s it,’ he shrugs. Pearce’s first task on returning to the City Ground was to tell his players and staff to forget the expectation that comes with being double European champions. ‘I hate the “sleeping giant” tag,’ he snaps. ‘I addressed all the players and staff in May and told them to forget that. Why do Forest have any more right to promotion than another club? ‘The part of my life as a player at this club was fantastic, but when the first ball’s kicked on the first day of the season, that finishes. ‘I’m not naive. But I hope that when we do part company, the club are back in the Premier League.’ Experience: Pearce says he enjoyed coaching the Under 21s (Henri Lansbury and Steve Caulker pictured) The wearied look that marked the end of Pearce’s England 21 coaching tenure has gone. Yet he laughs at the suggestion he might have pined for the intensity of club management after leaving the Manchester City job in 2007. Pearce admits, however, that Forest was one of the few roles that would have enticed him back to domestic football. ‘I didn’t miss it,’ he says. ‘I loved international football. You end up winning the majority of your games while you enjoy Christmas instead of fire-fighting week-in, week-out and you’re working with the best players in England. ‘I’ve been managing and coaching for 12 years. It meant a lot to represent the FA and I thought: “How am I going to replicate that feeling I had representing England?” ‘Forest was one of the clubs I felt would stoke me up again. I’d rather go to work having that feeling about myself than do it just to get paid.’ VIDEO Newcastle have greater attacking threat - Pardew .","Pearce says the pair were sold against his wishes .

"When Juan Mata slipped through the Chelsea exit, Eden Hazard was quick to assess the situation, spot the opening and explode into action, much as he does on the pitch. He sought out Jose Mourinho to ask for the No 10 shirt. He wanted to carry the number of his hero, Zinedine Zidane, on his back but he was under no illusions. Hazard was not expecting Mourinho to transform him into the team’s showman or hand him the licence to play where he liked, absolved of all defensive chores. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eden Hazard take the Ice Bucket Challenge . Quick mover: Eden Hazard sought out Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho to ask for the No 10 shirt . 3 - AC Milan have part-retired the No 3 shirt to honour Paolo Maldini, though either of his sons can wear the number if they grace the club. 6 - Retired by both Milan and West Ham in honour of Franco Baresi and Bobby Moore respectively. 7 - From George Best to Kenny Dalglish, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, it’s a shirt for stars. 10 - The most iconic number in football, made famous by the likes of Pele, Maradona, Zidane and Messi. For one thing, it is not the way the Chelsea manager operates. For another, Hazard feels the luxury playmaker, the iconic No 10, may be gone for good. Modern football is a blur of pace, mobility and industry. ‘I think football is finished with No 10,’ said the Belgian, formerly known as Chelsea’s No 17. ‘You have to play with two wingers and one striker. No more No 10. When I was young I played No 10, but now I’m a left winger or a right winger. During the game you can change.’ ‘When Juan left the club I asked: “Can I take the No 10?” The manager said: “Yes, no problem”. But it’s just a number. If I play the same as last season, it’s not because I have the No 10. I have to do more. ‘I wanted it because it was the number of my idol, Zidane, not when he was at Real Madrid (where he wore No 5) but before in the French League.’ Hazard is shy of the obvious comparisons. Can he emulate Zidane? ‘Maybe one day; maybe one day,’ he smiled. For all his individual brilliance as a dynamic winger, valued by Chelsea far higher than the £32million they paid when signing him from Lille two years ago, Hazard has rarely wallowed in his status. On the ball: Hazard, wearing No 10, is challenged by Burnley's David Jones (left) at Turf Moor on Monday . He prefers to dazzle on the field and disappear into the shadows. Mourinho has tried to coax more from him, encouraging Hazard to embrace responsibility as one of the outstanding talents in the team, but he is a modest personality. He does not crave attention like, for example, Cristiano Ronaldo, although he is unquestionably one of the poster boys of the Barclays Premier League and in commercial demand. He has the power to sells tickets, boots, shirts... you name it. Hazard is the new pack star of FIFA 15 and attempts to do this interview, designed to coincide with its launch, in English. He is trying to speak more in English since his friend and interpreter Demba Ba moved from Chelsea to Besiktas. ‘It’s too much for me, actually,’ replied Hazard, when asked about becoming Chelsea’s answer to Ronaldo or Lionel Messi. ‘I don’t like it. I am not this year better than them. They are here and I am here,’ he says, holding his hands flat, one at head height and one by his chest. ‘I need to work,’ he went on. ‘I am getting closer. I was voted the Young Player of the Year, but I am 23. My first trophy in France was the Young Player of the Year. I was 17. Chelsea is not just one player. It is not only me. We have signed a lot of players. Now we have some good signings like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa. ‘Diego can score and that is good for me. Fabregas is one of the best midfielders in the world and we can have the chance to play, not better than last season because we had a lot of good games, but in an offensive style. I think together we can beat every team.’ Superstar: Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo dribbles with the ball during the UEFA Super Cup match in Cardiff . Magical: Barcelona's Lionel Messi on the ball during the Joan Gamper Trophy match on Monday . It started in impressive style at Burnley on Monday. Chelsea went a goal down but turned on the power with three goals in 17 minutes to ease through their first match of the season. It was an ominous display, especially if you are Leicester City, who visit Stamford Bridge today. ‘We did very well,’ said Hazard, who contributed to Andre Schurrle’s great goal at Turf Moor, with a robust dribble from the left, a move which pulled Burnley’s defence out of position and created space. Even so, he is searching for more. ‘I know as soon as a game is finished if I have done well,’ he said. ‘I don’t need people to tell me. I want to achieve perfection. The World Cup was good but not perfect. ‘It could have gone better. I did two good games but it wasn’t enough. In Belgium, people are happy because we have a very good team and lost against Argentina. People are sad because they know we could go further. Sometimes you make one mistake and that’s it. ‘Chelsea last season was not perfect because at the end I was injured. We lost many games at the end and lost our form. The whole season was good but the last months were not good. I need to score more goals. We need to go into a final, to be champions. We lost out in four trophies.” In demand: Hazard is unquestionably one of the poster boys of the English Premier League . Mourinho’s team lost to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals and finished four points adrift of Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City. Like many at Stamford Bridge, Hazard points to the 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa in March as the moment when the title challenge ended. ‘When we came back in the coach, everyone was angry,’ he said. ‘Everyone knew how important it was.’ Hazard’s own form faded from its mid-season high, as he played on with a slight Achilles tendon problem. He was Chelsea’s top scorer with 17 goals, but the final four were all penalties. He has not scored from open play since the second in a hat-trick against Newcastle in February. On his knees: Hazard celebrates as he scores a hat-trick against Newcastle at Stamford Bridge in February . There was gentle criticism from Mourinho, who said he was not ‘ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team’, and fuelled stories about a return to France with Paris Saint-Germain, but Hazard insists he is happy at Chelsea and enjoys working with the manager. ‘It is a pleasure to play under Jose Mourinho and everything is OK,’ said Hazard. ‘I learn every day. He is a normal coach. He speaks a lot with the players. I like it when the manager speaks a lot with you because it gives you confidence. ‘Sometimes when you lose one game he is sad and he shows other people. You mustn’t smile when you lose. You have to be sad like other perople. You have to win every game.’ So it is on the quest to be Chelsea’s perfect 10.

"Harry the four-year-old pooch pushes himself on a skateboard like a pro, and that's just one of this black Labrador and Patterdale Terrier cross's clever tricks. Owner Christina Farley, 51, of Stubbington, Hampshire, says while Harry started life as a petulant puppy with a serious barking problem he now channels his energy into practicing his stunts. When paired with a skateboard he knows exactly what to do, first putting all four paws on the deck then pushing off with his back right leg to get rolling. Scroll down for videos . Harry, a four year old Labrador and Patterdale Terrier cross from Hampshire, pushes himself on a  skateboard . Owner Christina Farley, 51, of Stubbington, Hampshire, says Harry was a problem pup before he learned tricks . Harry's other talents also include catch a ball with his paws while standing on his rear legs like a meerkat, stacking cups in order of size, getting the post and he also dances on cue. Christina, a self-employed gardener, has spent around four hours a week for the past three years teaching her dog new tricks. ‘When he was four months old he used to bark excessively and he needed to learn a lot of self-control,' she said. Harry loves to get on his skateboard and uses his back right leg to push himself along like a pro . Harry's favourite trick is to stack these colourful children's cups in order of size . Christina says she takes the cups everywhere they go so Harry can show off his skills . ‘I took him to lessons at Canine Communications in Gosport and they said he was like that because he was very intelligent. ‘At first I didn’t believe them but they proved me wrong. He just needed his mind stimulated. Now he does tricks for fun.

The 21-year-old was in Manchester Magistrates Court on Thursday where he was facing charges for two counts of common assault after allegedly attacking his former girlfriend. The court heard that the England Under 21 international threatened to throw acid in Reah Mansoor’s face and blow up her house in a course of harassment. Morrison, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and address, sat in the dock at the court for the brief hearing as the harassment allegation was also added to the charges. District Judge Khalid Qureshi bailed Morrison to appear at Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on August 28. His bail conditions are that he lives in Canary Wharf, London, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, does not go on to the street where they live, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance, to see his lawyers or to visit for a West Ham game in the area and to return to London immediately after the match.

"The FA will need manager Roy Hodgson to do what he does best — talk a good game — to avoid the new Wembley attracting its lowest crowd for an England game when they face Norway on September 3. England fans, after that abysmal World Cup showing in Brazil, unsurprisingly have little enthusiasm for the reciprocal friendly game against unglamorous Scandinavian opposition with only around 10,000 tickets so far sold. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the England team on what is means to play for their country . Low point: Just 57,897 watched England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra in 2009 . This means the FA have a huge selling task to get anywhere near the Wembley audience of 57,897 who watched the World Cup qualifier against Andorra in June 2009 during a Tube strike — the smallest England attendance since the stadium was rebuilt in 2007. Hodgson has not managed to find those marginal gains from England players needed to progress in major tournaments. But he cannot be faulted for his charming demeanour off the pitch when he promotes his team to the public. This will kick off with a big interview on Sky Sports News, his first since the World Cup, when he needs to start drumming up interest in that Norway game ahead of the critical Euro 2016 qualifier away to Switzerland. The FA are also planning a print and online marketing campaign to help sell discounted seats but Hodgson must make the most of his media rounds, squad announcement and choice of new captain. FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission are due to produce a second report on improving coaching this autumn. Considering Danny Mills (right) is the most enthusiastic member of Dyke’s panel, his views on clubs employing specialist coaches is illuminating — especially as the England party in Brazil was top heavy with experts in every field. Mills says: ‘By the time I was at Leeds, we had sports scientists and conditioning coaches — or as I used to call them, job justifiers. 'In their world, what works for you one summer is forbidden practice a year later and as a player that is irritating. If you have experience, you know what you need.’ MK Dons shouldn’t overstock their bars or bank on selling too many programmes for Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against AFC Wimbledon. Away fans have vowed not to spend any money on their relocated club premises and plan to eat before the game in the nearby IKEA store. Wimbledon directors will also sit with their own fans rather than enter the MK boardroom. You would imagine the FA were intending to re-empower their international committee, which used to be responsible for hiring and firing the England manager, judging by its new-look membership. The revamped committee, chaired by Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis, includes Football League independent director Richard Bowker, Notts County’s Jim Rodwell, Crystal Palace’s Phil Alexander and Sunderland’s Margaret Byrne. New look: The revamped international committee is chaired by Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis . Yet this committee hasn’t met since March 2011 nor, say the FA, is there any chance of them doing so with their role remaining purely ambassadorial and far more suited to retired blazers rather than busy club CEOs. Even by FA standards, this is ridiculous. If you appoint club leaders, let them have a say on Hodgson and England business. Johnno enjoys the ride .

"Manchester City have slashed ticket prices by 50 per cent for the trip to Arsenal in September. City have been allocated 2,900 tickets for the clash against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on September 13 and have taken the decision to cut costs for the fans. Travelling fans were set to be charged £64.00 for an adult ticket, while over-65 seats were priced at £27.25 and the under-16 bracket is set at £24.00. Expensive: Manchester City fans hold a banner at the Emirates to protest against ticket prices in January 2013 . Help: City will subsidise the cost of Arsenal tickets for their travelling supporters by 50 per cent . City, however, have moved to subsidise the prices for season-ticket holders by 50 per cent. The loyal followers will now be charged only £32 for an adult ticket, £13.62 for an over 65 ticket and £12 for a junior ticket. A Premier League initiative has seen clubs donate commit to spending £200,000-per-season that must be used to enhance the experience for travelling fans. It is a three year agreement born out of discussions between the Premier League, clubs and fans' groups. City have taken funds from their war chest to halve the cost for the trip to Arsenal. Different clubs use the money in various ways. For example, Arsenal took £2.50 off every away ticket for their supporters last season while they are also offering travel arrangements for games such as the 5.30pm kick off at Everton on Saturday afternoon. Stoke City offer free coach travel to all away games while Manchester United last season knocked £4 off away tickets for their supporters. City's move follows continued protests by the Football Supporters' Federation against the rising cost of watching live Premier League football. In defence of the £64 tickets, Arsenal would argue that their supporters are asked to pay similarly high prices on away trips in the Premier League. Perfect start: Sergio Aguero celebrates after scoring the final goal in City's opening win against Newcastle . It is understood that supporters last season were charged £58 for the away match at Manchester City, £59 at Chelsea and £55 at Manchester United. Equally, Liverpool fans will pay up to £57 when they visit the Etihad Stadium next Monday evening. Arsenal have also been frustrated by the demands of certain smaller clubs. For example, Norwich City supporters were charged only £25.50 when they visited Arsenal last season while Gunners' fans were expected to pay £50 on the return trip to Carrow Road. In January 2013, City fans protested inside Arsenal's ground after being charged £62 for match-day tickets. 900 tickets were returned to Arsenal before the game as supporters boycotted the expensive prices while fans raised a banner inside the stadium asking: '£62!!

"Twickenham will stage the inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup Final on May 2 next year – three years after it last hosted the continent's showpiece fixture in its previous guise. The formation of new competitions in the wake of a revolt by English and French clubs has led to plans for Italy to stage the match to be abandoned. Amid a turbulent spell of political unrest last season, it was announced that the 2015 final would take place at the iconic San Siro Stadium in Milan, if the Heineken Cup survived. Instead, the competition - which had taken place for 19 seasons - was replaced by the new, streamlined Champions Cup, with clubs assuming greater control over that and the secondary Challenge Cup tournament. Since that historic development, a pool draw has taken place, but there has been a logistical delay in revealing fixture details. Glory: The European Rugby Champions Cup has replaced the Heineken Cup, which Toulon won in 2014 . Hosts: Twickenham will be the venue for the inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup final on May 2, 2015 . International: The ERCC final will take place four months before England face Fiji in their World Cup opener . Looking on: England head coach Stuart Lancaster will hope to see some of his players in the ERCC final . An announcement is due to be made on Tuesday that London will host the finals on May 1 and 2, with Twickenham securing the Champions Cup decider just four months before the World Cup begins at HQ with England v Fiji. The major final was held there as recently as May, 2012, when Leinster crushed Ulster 42-14 in a one-sided, all-Irish encounter. The decision to stage the game at one of the world’s leading venues makes sense in terms of capacity - 82,000 - and potential revenue. It is sure to be a lucrative sell-out, but doubtless organisers will be encouraged to consider the merits of taking a final to Italy in the near-future, to drive further development of the sport in that country. During the 19 seasons of the Heineken Cup, Cardiff staged seven finals, with four taking place in London and three in Dublin. The remaining finals were held in Edinburgh (two), Paris (two) and Bordeaux. European fixtures will be announced on Thursday. Joy: Jonny Wilkinson lifted the Heineken Cup for the second year in succession with Toulon in 2014 .

"The 96th USPGA Championship will either conclude on Sunday with Rory McIlroy leaving his latest mark on the road to greatness or a shootout for the ages. Either way cancel any plans to go out, because this is going to be a fitting conclusion to a classy season in the four majors. Has there been a more exciting day in the game this year than Saturday’s third round? Played at a Ryder Cup venue, it generated Ryder Cup levels of hysteria as fearless wannabes, evergreen veterans and unsung Europeans took turns alongside the man of the moment to produce shots of stunning quality. For the final two hours of play the noise was unbelievable as roars echoed all over the property. Fist-pump: A strong back-nine allowed McIlroy to stay in control heading into the final round at Valhalla . Up-and-down display: McIlroy rolls his eyes as he leaves his tee shot on the eighth hole just short of the green . In trouble: The 25-year-old looks into the creek for his tee shot on the second hold during his third round . Patient: McIlroy waits for his caddie as he gets ready to his his ball after losing his drive off the fourth tee . Scrambling: The Northern Irishman comes out of the crowd after hitting up to the fourth green . Upping his game: McIlroy picked up shots on the back nine with birdies at the 10th, 15th and 16th holes . Perhaps inevitably, given how the last month has gone, it was Open Champion McIlroy who had the final word to seize a narrow advantage. At one point there were an incredible ten players either tied or within one shot of the lead. Then McIlroy rolled in a 20 footer to birdie the 15th. At the near 500 yard par four 16th he pummelled a drive 340 yards and his nine iron finished 18 inches from the flag. He birdied the 18th from the sand as well for his third gain in four holes to regain top spot. It was truly mesmerising to watch. Just as compelling was the pairing of Phil Mickelson and Bernd Wiesberger. Mickelson birdied four of his last five holes to give himself a shot at his sixth major on Sunday but he was still outscored by two shots by the 28 year old Austrian, who shot 65 to the 67 from the player he grew up idolising. ‘It was just a dream come true today,’ said Wiesberger. So McIlroy will go into the final round with a one shot lead over Wiesberger on 13 under after a 67. He will not only be trying to win back-to-back majors but complete his third win in a row, after a stupendous run of play that has seen him complete his last 11 rounds in an aggregate of 45 under par, with just one round in the seventies. Distraught: McIlroy reacts to a missed putt for birdie at the picturesque 13th hole . Picture perfect: McIlroy hits an impressive shot on the sixth hole at Valhalla . Rickie Fowler, the man who chased him so hard at The Open at Hoylake last month, is just two back. Then comes the popular Mickelson and Jason Day, with quite a cast on nine under including two Scandinavians in Henrik Stenson from Sweden and Mikko Ilonen from Finland. Given Valhalla’s place in Norse mythology, they’d be appropriate champions, wouldn’t they? On seven under par, six shots back are two former world number ones in Adam Scott and Lee Westwood, and they will probably need to break the major championship scoring record of 63 to win. After yesterday’s play, you wouldn’t rule out someone shooting such a score. McIlroy said he knew hearing all the roars that he needed to do something down the stretch. ‘There was a lot of noise out there and it wasn’t being generated by me, so the birdies at the 15th and the 16th were huge,’ he said. ‘It means I am still in control of the golf tournament but clearly I am going to have to play really well and shoot a low number in the final round. But I’m loving it. This is why we play the game and practice all these hours on the range. 'It has its stresses but I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. You’ve got to enjoy being in the lead because that’s what it is all about.’ Swing low: He drives his tee shot down the fairway on the 10th hole during his third round . Going for a walk: McIlroy makes his way to the ninth tee with his caddie J.P. Fitzgerald . McIlroy and Jason Day certainly had their fair share of adventures in the final group. The 25 year old Northern Irishman and the 26 year old Australian are known for their penchant for spectacular rounds laced with birdies and eagles. But it was a par that each of them made in turn early on that fairly took the breath away. First up was Day, whose jumpiness over the opening holes was personified with a horrendous hook off the second tee. It led to him taking off his socks and shoes, rolling up his trousers, wading through a creek and back – but still walking off the green with a par. Not to be outdone, McIlroy came up with one of his own at the par four 4th. The tee had been moved up on this hole to make it driveable, and Rory duly took dead aim. He was soon dropping his club in disgust, however, as the ball sailed miles left and dropped into a creek. After taking a penalty drop, it left him with a difficult pitch back, which he played well to 12ft. Now he was looking at a par putt that, had he missed, would have meant he was giving up at least two shots to the field and three shots to some. But his solid putting, a feature of his brilliant run of form this summer, came to prominence once more, and he was pumping his fist as the ball disappeared. As both players had proved, sometimes pars are every bit as pivotal as birdies. McIlroy notched his first birdie of the day at the next, and was a ball-width from making it two in a row at the difficult 6th, as his try from 25ft stopped on the edge. No matter. He duly made one on the next hole to establish a two shot lead. The tone for the afternoon was set. Chatting: Jason Day of Australia and McIlroy chat as they walk to the seventh green in Kentucky . Nice approach: McIlroy chips on to the green at the eighth hole of the US PGA Championship . Almost inevitably a good bit of the excitement was being generated by the irrepressible Fowler, the bright spark in this dark season for American golf. Tied fifth at the Masters, tied runner-up at the US Open and Open, he has given himself another realistic shot at winning his first major with a fine round of 67. Then there was Welshman Jamie Donaldson, whose 66 was one of the most admirable rounds of all. After looking a certainty all year to make his Ryder Cup debut at Gleneagles next month, the 38 year old Welshman arrived here having dropping into the 9th and precarious last spot in the automatic standings. With the likes of Ian Poulter, Luke Donald and Lee Westwood all looking for one of the three wild cards at present, the pressure was clearly on. How well Donaldson has responded and how much he deserves to make it. Donaldson told Sportsmail last week: ’No matter how much you try to forget about it, the Ryder Cup is always at the back of your mind tormenting you.’ Now lieing in the top ten in this big-money event on eight under, he can remove all the torment with a good final round today. ‘All I could do this week was go out and take control of my own destiny, and I certainly built towards that with this round,’ he said. ‘This was about perfect.’ With overnight rain and no wind rendering the course defenceless, there was a chance for the early starters to post a low score and make a statement. Emerging Englishman Danny Willett and Scot Marc Warren both shot 66 and Justin Rose a 67, and all of them will have the chance to post a top ten on Sunday.

"With just four days to go until the start of the new Barclays Premier League season there are still gaping holes in many clubs' squads. As the countdown to action continues Sportsmail has picked out the biggest problem positions of all in the top flight and identifies the transfer targets each club have pinpointed to plug the gaps. ARSENAL . Problem position: defender . Solution: Kostas Manolas (Olympiacos) Cost: £8million . Arsenal need a defender to replace Thomas Vermaelen. They wanted Chris Smalling and have designs on Matija Nastasic but Manolas would be good value for money. Wise buy: Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolas (right) shadows Edin Dzeko during a pre-season friendly . BURNLEY . Problem position: striker . Solution: Troy Deeney (Watford) Cost: £10m . Chances are slim of buying Deeney from Watford considering Burnley's budget. They need cover for Danny Ings and Sam Vokes if they are to have a chance of staying up. Hotshot: Troy Deeney (centre) gets away a shot on goal against Bolton in the Championship last Saturday . LEICESTER CITY . Problem position: defensive midfield . Solution: Esteban Cambiasso . Cost: Free (but big wages) Experience and class of such a calibre could protect Leicester's defence as they adjust to the Premier League, which will be a key factor in their survival bid. Bald talent: Esteban Cambiasso (right) is a Champions League winning midfielder with Inter Milan . LIVERPOOL . Problem position: striker . Solution: Samuel Eto'o . Cost: Free . The departure of Luis Suarez and injury to Adam Lallana leave Liverpool short of options for someone who can play off a striker or lead the line while adding experience for their European campaign. Familiar face: Samuel Eto'o spent last season scoring goals at Stamford Bridge with Chelsea . MANCHESTER UNITED . Problem position: centre back . Solution: Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon) Cost: £18m . Playing three at the back will test the dubious injury record of messrs Jones, Smalling and Evans at United. Van Gaal needs cover and versatility which Rojo provides. Versatile: Marcos Rojo (left) celebrates a goal for Argentina against Nigeria at the World Cup . SOUTHAMPTON . Problem position: striker . Solution: Shane Long (Hull) Cost: £12m . Graziano Pelle will carry the fight and score goals but needs an ally who knows the league and can provide support when required. Long's tireless work ethic would suit. No pain no gain: Hull striker Shane Long (second left) puts in the hard yards up front as well as score goals . STOKE CITY . Problem position: winger . Solution: Nathan Redmond (Norwich) Cost: £6m . Pace on the flanks and an improved supply line for his strikers is what Mark Hughes craves. Price has been too high for Andriy Yarmolenko and Oussama Assaidi. Wriggling free: Nathan Redmond in action for Norwich against Wolves in the Championship on Saturday . SUNDERLAND . Problem position: striker . Solution: Fabio Borini (Liverpool) Cost: £14m . May face late competition from Hull City for the striker but without him Sunderland face another battle with relegation. Borini needs convincing they can improve. In demand: But Fabio Borini needs convincing that his future lies at Sunderland, rather than Liverpool . SWANSEA . Problem position: defender . Solution: Federico Fernandez (Napoli) Cost: £8m . Deal is close to being agreed with Napoli. The Argentine was left out of Napoli's Champions League squad and a work permit is Swansea's main obstacle to replacing Chico Flores. Wanted: Swansea are closing in on a deal for Napoli and Argentina defender Federico Fernandez (centre left) WEST HAM . Problem position: striker . Solution: Connor Wickham (Sunderland) Cost: £8m . Anyone who has a decent goalscoring record and stays fit is a bonus as West Ham's search for more firepower reaches crisis point. Spot on: Connor Wickham slots home a penalty for Sunderland against Udinese during pre-season .","Barclays Premier League season kicks off on Saturday .

"La Liga clubs are edging towards a deal that would sell their TV rights collectively in a bid to end the financial dominance of Real Madrid and Barcelona. At present, Spanish clubs sell their rights individually. But this has lead to a complete lack of competition with Barcelona and Real Madrid each receiving around £120million a season. Their nearest rivals, Atletico Madrid, receive less than half that amount. But, as revealed today in The Times, that financial dominance is set to end as the clubs look to copy the Premier League and sells their right together. VIDEO Scroll down to watch latest Galactico James Rodriguez saving pitch invader . President: Barcelona's Josep Maria Bartomeu has been a main advocate of a collective TV rights deal . The deal, which would start from the beginning of the 2016-17 season, would help the image of Spain's league, which has been won by Barcelona or Real Madrid in 15 of the last 20 seasons. Barcelona's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, said: 'Barcelona and Madrid sell individually and we negotiate with a lot of success. 'That helps us to have as many of the best players in the world as possible. But we know the problem: the Premier League is very competitive. 'You never know who will win. In Spain, between 2004 and 2014 it has been just Barcelona and Madrid, mainly Barcelona. Transfer: Selling TV rights individually has allowed Real Madrid and Barcelona to pay huge fees for players . Poached: With so much more money, Barcelona and Real Madrid have been able to poach opposition palyers . Initially it seems a counter-intuitive move for Spain's big two, but an increasingly competitive league will eventually mean more money for them. And, in the mean time, they will not lose any money. Bartomeu said: 'We are leading the attempt to find a consensus. It has been our objective for a long time to convince all the clubs in La Liga to sell the rights as a competition. 'Not all of them have been helpful. We will make the same, but the (revenue) increase will go to the other clubs.'

"Barcelona have dismissed Liverpool's claims that they paid £75m for Luis Suarez, insisting they only shelled out £65m for the striker. Suarez, who is unavailable to play until late October due to a FIFA ban, was finally unveiled at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. But while the Premier League side have insisted to Sportsmail that they received the full release clause for the Uruguayan, Barca have been boasting about their bargaining skills. Unveliing: Luis Suarez was presented as a Barcelona player at the Nou Camp on Tuesday . Doubt: But while Liverpool insist they received the £75m release clause, Barca say they paid £10m less . Introduction: Luis Suarez is announced onto the pitch before kick off on Monday night . 'Suarez's clause was £75m and in the end we paid £65m thanks to the skill of those negotiating,' executive vice-president Jordi Mestre said. His new release clause has been set at a whopping £160m, and the 27-year-old admitted he has always had the Catalan giants in his heart. 'For years I've been dreaming of playing for Barca,' Suarez confessed. 'Every little boy knows, this is something that they want, and my family was here as well. 'To come here and watch Barca play and that one day I would be able to play here, I didn't think it was going to happen. Smiles: Suarez strolled around the Camp Nou turf having had his ban lifted .

"Southampton have completed the signing of England goalkeeper Fraser Forster for a fee of £10m from Scottish champions Celtic. Saints boss Ronald Koeman revealed after Saturday's 1-0 pre-season friendly loss to Bayer Leverkusen that a deal appeared close for the  Celtic stopper, with the clubs having reportedly agreed a fee and the player having already completed a medical. And on Saturday evening the club released a statement on their website confirming a four-year deal for the 26-year-old. Presence: The 6ft 7in keeper has completed a move to Southampton after a successful spell at Celtic . Koeman said: 'Fraser is a very talented player and we are delighted to be able to bring him to Southampton. This is another important part of our rebuilding process ahead of the start of the season. 'The fact that he has worked with Dave Watson before means we already know all about his strengths and weaknesses, and I am confident that we will be able to help him improve even further. 'Fraser is the perfect fit to help complement the players we already have, and he will add a lot of quality to the squad. 'He is an exciting English player with a very good reputation within the game and, at 26, he will enjoy the best years of his career at Southampton.' Top class: Forster saved two penalties in first leg of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Legia Warsaw . Celtic will bank £7.5m from the sale, with Newcastle United set to bank 25 per cent of the fee under the terms of the deal struck when they sold the player to Celtic two years ago. The sale of Forster has been pushed through despite the Champions League reprieve that saw Celtic progress to the play-off round in place of Legia Warsaw in the wake of UEFA’s punishment for the administrative error which resulted in the Polish side fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski. That means Craig Gordon, who has not played a competitive match in more than two years, will now start for Ronny Deila’s side against Slovenian side Maribor, who will host the first leg later this month. The appointment of England goalkeeping coach Dave Watson to Ronald Koeman’s backroom staff has been key to Forster’s move and his arrival will put former Celt Artur Boruc’s place at the club in doubt. Forster recently travelled with the England squad to the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals, where he worked with Southampton's new Senior Goalkeeping Coach, Dave Watson. The Northumberland-born custodian began his career with Newcastle United, and had loan spells at Stockport County, Bristol Rovers and Norwich City before joining Celtic in 2010. After winning three league titles and two Scottish cups as well as gaining UEFA Champions League experience during his time in Glasgow, Forster now moves to St Mary's ahead of the 2014/15 campaign. International honours: Forster's impressive form for the Scottish champions has earned him two England caps . After the Leverkusen game Koeman also revealed the club had had a bid - believed to be in the region of £4.5m - rejected by Leeds for right-back Sam Byram. Press Association Sport understands other top-flight clubs have also enquired about the highly-rated 20-year-old. 'We lost (Calum) Chambers to Arsenal - it (Byram) was a player we had on the list and it's true that we had a bid for him, yes,' the Dutchman said. 'What I heard was that Leeds didn't accept it.'","After Southampton's 1-0 friendly defeat to Bayer Leverkusen Ronald Koeman confirmed Forster had undergone a medical with the south-coast club .

"After being slapped with hefty airline fines in the past, savvy travellers are embracing mobile devices to check in for flights. A new report by travel search engine Kayak has found that two in five passengers (42 per cent) have incurred an average of £51 in airline charges because of issues with traditional paper travel documents. As a result, almost a third (32 per cent) are now choosing to ditch printed boarding passes in favour of smart devices and airline apps. Scroll down for video . There's an app for that: Almost a third of passengers would prefer to check in for flights using mobile devices . The most common issue which affected 14 per cent of passengers was lost boarding passes, followed by the 12 per cent with forgetting to print their boarding passes altogether. These problems are followed by the 11 per cent of people who didn’t have the opportunity or means to do so. For six per cent of people, the print quality of their self-printed boarding pass hindered their journey. Currently several budget airlines charge for the replacement of documents, with Ryanair demanding as much as £15 if you arrive at the airport without your printed check in documents, and £70 for checking in at the airport. Some 57 per cent of travellers believe that airlines fines over forgotten or lost boarding passes are unfair. Of those surveyed, 44 per cent said they prefer digital check-in as they worry about forgetting a printed boarding pass. Similarly, 35 per cent say that they would be more likely to lose a printed copy of a boarding pass than their smart device. Pay the price: Two in five passengers have been hit with heft airline fees following problems with traditional printed travel documents . For 38 per cent of travellers, digital check in is simply more convenient than the hassle of printing, and with 23 per cent of regular travellers admitting to not owning a printer, it isn’t surprising. For a further third (36 per cent) of people, environmental concerns lead them to prefer paperless check in methods. The desire to move away from traditional printed airport check in methods entirely towards digital only would be welcomed by 36 per cent of travellers. The digital revolution doesn't stop once you've boarded the flight. 29 per cent of guests would rather check in to their hotel using their smart phone too. Loella Pehrsson, Regional Managing Director UK, Ireland & the Nordics of Kayak said: 'In today’s fast-paced world remembering to print and keep track of boarding passes and reservations can be an inconvenience to travellers, especially when they have a device in their pocket which can do the job for them. 'Consumers rely on their smart devices in every area of their lives and travelling is no different.'

"Diego Costa apologised for his part in Chelsea’s European downfall last year, then set about backing his words with something more substantial as Jose Mourinho hailed his new centre forward a £32million bargain. Costa scored twice in the first eight minutes as Mourinho’s team beat Real Sociedad at Stamford Bridge in their final pre-season friendly before their Barclays Premier League campaign starts at Burnley on Monday. ‘The market is crazy and for strikers even more so,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘For a striker like him, who is a champion in Spain and a Champions League finalist, who is young, only 25 years old, we consider the price was very much in our favour, considering the values in the market. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho: Chelsea have been waiting for a player like Costa . Announcement: Diego Costa celebrates scoring his first goals at Stamford Bridge .

Player ratings by Sportsmail's Matt Barlow at Stamford Bridge . ‘Diego is a team player; he works a lot for the team. It’s not just about his goals. It’s about his defensive work, his mentality, his ambition. This is the player we bought; the player we were waiting for last season. ‘It’s the reason we did not buy a striker in the winter market. We were waiting for him. We have him and he looks adapted to the team, to our style of play and the Premier League should be happy because sometimes we lose important players to other countries.’ Costa was playing at Stamford Bridge for the first time since scoring a penalty for Atletico Madrid when they beat Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final in April and he needed only 57 seconds to find the net last night, converting a pass from Ramires. ‘I can say I’m really sorry for the part I played in the game we won,’ wrote Costa in the latest edition of the Chelsea magazine. ‘I hope my actions on the pitch and my feet will do the talking and then people can decide if I’m a good player or not, if I’m improving or not. ‘All I can say is that I love playing hard and fairly. Joining was an easy decision for me. We have some of the best players in the world, the best manager in the world and it’s a club with great history. ‘I want to improve, not only as a player but as an individual, and I believe this is the perfect place for me to do that. That’s the reason I chose Chelsea and why I want to defend this shirt.’ Remember the name: Chelsea's new forward celebrates scoring his first goal at Stamford Bridge . Embraced: And he is hugged by captain John Terry as he enjoys the moment . Doubled up: Eden Hazard goes down under a challenge from Esteban Granero . Double: And Costa celebrates with his team-mates after scoring the second soon after . His second owed everything to Andre Schurrle, who thumped a post from the corner of the penalty box and the rebound dropped at the feet of Costa, who tapped in with his left foot. It took his goal tally to four in pre-season and a full-house were soon singing his name. Costa went close to his hat-trick in the second-half before he was replaced by Fernando Torres on the hour. Forgiven? You bet, just keep ’em coming, seemed to be the consensus as he acknowledged the standing ovation. At this point he looks every inch the goalscoring centre forward Mourinho bemoaned the lack of last season. Apart from teenager Nathan Ake at left back, Mourinho  started with what appears to be his strongest team, which looked well-balanced and powerful, although the second half was littered with substitutions. Thibaut Courtois was preferred in goal to Petr Cech, the strongest indicator to date that the Belgian has the edge in the tussle to be No.1 goalkeeper. The rest of the back four was as it was for most of last season, with John Terry and Gary Cahill in the centre and Branislav Ivanovic at right-back. Nemanja Matic anchored the midfield, with Cesc Fabregas and Ramires on either side. Up front, Eden Hazard and Schurrle flanked Costa. Filipe Luis was one of four changes at half-time and quickly impressed with a dashing overlap and dangerous cross. There are still areas where the squad seems thin, but it is stronger than this time last year. Much will hinge on Costa and his ability to keep finding the net — and the signs are positive.

Tory and Labour MPs united today to urge their party leaders to take action on immigration to show they understood why voters were turning to Ukip. Nigel Farage today called for all immigrants with 'life threatening' illnesses to be blocked from coming to the UK . It comes after immigration figures showed David Cameron was losing his battle to reduce net immigration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year – which he pledged at the last election. Official figures show the number of migrants arriving in Britain outstrips those leaving by almost 250,000 a year – similar to the levels seen under Labour after the borders were opened to eastern European migrants in 2004. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘There is more we need to do to listen to people who are voting UKIP, particularly on immigration and I’d be the first to say that.’ He said: ‘In my own constituency there will be traditional Labour voters with the same concerns about immigration – absolutely we need to hear those concerns and act on their concerns.’ Mr Burnham said he could not defend immigrants ‘sending back benefits’ to their families in Europe. He said: ‘I think it doesn't meet most people's test of basic fairness, you know, that you haven't contributed but then you can take out. And that has to change. ‘I think what they don't agree with is the idea that people can then just arrive and take benefits and send them back, and that needs to change. And Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have both said it needs to change.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband today said it was not prejudiced to be concerned about immigration - but insisted capping the number of migrants coming to Britain would not work . Tory Local Government minister Brandon Lewis insisted the Government were acting to cut migration. He said the Conservatives would put immigration ‘at the heart’ of renegotiation ahead of the EU referendum in 2017. ‘What people are worried about though is that migration from the EU, and the Prime Minister as I say made it very clear last week that's got to be one of the key things at the heart of renegotiation that we will have before that referendum which we will deliver in 2017.’ Labour MP John Mann challenged Ed Miliband to ‘step up to the mark’ after the surge in support for Ukip in yesterday’s two by-elections. He said: ‘People want action, not listening, on the big issues – and the big issues include immigration. ‘People feel that the speed of immigration into this country is too fast, that the price that people are paying in terms of lower pay, in terms of forced housebuilding in areas in the north is too big. ‘And we need some action to demonstrate that Labour not just is listening, but is prepared to do something on these concerns. ‘What he should say is that we want to have and will get back from Europe the right to determine the numbers coming in and the skills coming in so that we have that power. ‘That’s the fundamental change that’s needed. And so, yes, at the moment, that would mean a reduction in numbers without question.’ The Prime Minister is failing to fulfil his pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year . Douglas Carswell was one of the most prominent Eurosceptic Tory MPs but his defection to Ukip in August was still a major surprise in Westminster. The libertarian Clacton MP regularly spoke out against the Government on Europe, the economy and Parliamentary reform. The maverick backbencher once led calls for MPs' expenses to be opened up to the public– but was then criticised after it emerged he claimed cash back for a 'love chair' for his home. In Clacton his popularity outstrips that of the Tories. One senior Conservative said: 'There is not a Tory machine campaign machine in Clacton, it is a Carswell machine.' Mr Carswell grew up in Uganda where his doctor parents worked. He was educated at St Andrews School, Kenya, before moving to the exclusive Charterhouse boarding school in Surrey. Fellow Labour MP Jack Straw said Labour needed a stronger message on immigration to address the surge in support for Ukip. He said: ‘But there are lessons in this by-election result. We were right to concentrate on the NHS; we’ve also, however, got to be stronger about our messages on immigration as well.’ Tory MP Mark Pritchard claimed Ukip voters needed to understand that the only way to get tougher controls on immigration was to vote Tory. He said: ‘The only way we’re going to have that referendum, the only way we’re going to deliver even tougher immigration controls, the only way we’re going to continue to grow the economy in the way that we’ve seen over the last few years is under a Conservative government, under a Conservative prime minister; not under Douglas Carswell, Nigel Farage, Ed Miliband, whoever it might be.’ Fellow Conservative backbencher Bernard Jenkin said politics needed ‘far less fudging’ and ‘far more talking about how things really are’. He said: ‘For example, if you want to control EU immigration we're going to have to take back control over our borders.’ Last night's by-election results left Ed Miliband in pole position to be the next Prime Minister, Mr Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister said: ‘What last night demonstrates is that if you see a big Ukip vote, you will end up with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, Ed Balls as Chancellor and Labour in power.' Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps added: ‘Let me be blunt. What we have seen is a simple truth. This just puts Miliband closer to victory. This has just made his job of getting into Number 10 easier.' Mr Miliband this afternoon appeared to agree with the Tory response. He said: ‘The Tories are a party losing in their own backyard and retreating from what they used to call their own frontline. The Tories are a party that cannot win a majority at the next general election.’ Douglas Carswell (pictured celebrating with Nigel Farage) is Ukip's first elected MP in the House of Commons . Nigel Farage said Ukip was making 'staggering gains in stridently Labour territory' after Mr Carswell's victory . Ukip's next target is Rochester and Strood, where Mr Carswell's fellow defector Mark Reckless is hoping to return to Parliament. Mr Carswell said: 'In Rochester, as in Clacton, I believe voters will reject negative campaigns by old party machines.' This morning Mr Farage claimed more MPs were likely to defect to Ukip within the next few months - including Labour backbenchers.","Nigel Farage's party handed the Conservatives a drubbing in Clacton, Essex .

"Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri wants to keep Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal and told him he already plays for a ‘great’ club. Manchester United have been linked with Vidal for much of the summer and the Chile international has also attracted interest from other top clubs in Europe. Allegri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: 'He (Vidal) is like a caged lion. He would like to play, but he needs to train more. Arturo has a great spirit. Wanted man: Massimiliano Allegri has urged Arturo Vidal to stay at Juventus . 'It is normal that there are rumours about him: the great teams search for the great players. But Vidal is already in a great team.' The Juventus boss is keen to add two more players to his squad ahead of the season and the defence of their league title. Patrice Evra, Alvaro Morata and Kingsley Coman have joined this summer, while Udinese winger Roberto Pereyra arrived on loan. Saga: Vidal has been linked with a move to Manchester United all summer . But Allegri, who replaced departed Antonio Conte at the helm earlier this summer, believes his team still needs further improvements. 'We need two more signings,' he added. 'But they have to be quality signings. We need a defender and a striker. 'It's useless to give names as acquisitions depend on who you can bring in and who is on the market. 'We have little time to act and we must choose carefully. We cannot afford to make any mistakes regarding these two signings.' Don't go away: Massimiliano Allegri is looking to add to his squad and does not want to lose Vidal . On the arrival of Evra, Allegri added: 'He's working hard, with a load he was not used to. He needs time to get accustomed to Italian football and these coaching methods.' Allegri also wished his predecessor Conte good luck with the national team, saying: 'It was the right choice for the Italian national team. I wish him good luck. I hope he'll do well, Italy really need it.' Juve begin their Serie A title defence against Chievo in Verona on August 30.

"Quarantined: Kaci Kickox was put in compulsory isolation when she came back to the U.S. from Sierra Leone . A nurse put under mandatory quarantine at a U.S. airport when she came back from fighting Ebola has criticized new measures to contain the disease, saying she has been treated like a criminal. Kaci Hickox, a nurse with Doctors Without Borders, arrived at Liberty Newark Airport in New Jersey yesterday after returning from an assignment in Sierra Leone, one of the West African nations hardest-hit by the outbreak. But she has said that when she arrived she met a scene of chaos and suspicion, where officials left her in the dark, falsely declared she was feverish then bundled her into an emergency motorcade to hospital. On arriving at University Hospital in Newark, Hickox tested negative for Ebola - but must remain under quarantine for the next three weeks under new rules. It follows widespread concern about how Dr Craig Spencer, another Doctors Without Borders worker, was allowed to go free in New York for a week before it emerged that he had Ebola. Hickox, writing for the Dallas News, said that she was held at immigration for three hours while a 'frenzy of disorganization' raged around her. She added that suspicious officials who 'barked' at her as if she had broken the law made her so worried and flustered that inaccurate forehead scanners read her temperature too high - sparking fears she had Ebola. She said that the moment an official recorded a temperature of 101 she was met with the 'smug' statement 'you have a fever now'. Safe exit: The nurse (circled in red above) is seen exiting an ambulance in a Hazmat suit . Rushed over: She was taken to the hospital by a motorcade . She was then bundled into an ambulance, which stormed down the freeway to hospital surrounded by an eight-car police motorcade. She was pictured emerging at the hospital wearing a hazmat suit. Media outlets were briefed that she had 'developed a fever' and she arrived at hospital to doctors expecting the worst. But when her temperature was taken properly, the oral thermometer  recorded a normal result of 98.6. Hickox, who holds degrees from the University of Texas at Arlington and the Johns Hopkins University, said that her rough treatment makes her worry for her colleagues still in Africa trying to stop the virus outbreak which has killed some 5,000 people there. New rules: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, listens as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie talks at a news conference on Friday. The governors announced a mandatory quarantine for  'high risk' people . She wrote: 'I had spent a month watching children die, alone. I had witnessed human tragedy unfold before my eyes. 'I had tried to help when much of the world has looked on and done nothing... I sat alone in the isolation tent and thought of many colleagues who will return home to America and face the same ordeal. Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?' She continued: 'The epidemic continues to ravage West Africa... We need more health care workers to help fight the epidemic in West Africa. The U.S. must treat returning health care workers with dignity and humanity.' Hickox is the first person to fall under the new quarantine rules, which cover the states of New York and New Jersey, and were announced yesterday by New Jersey Governor Chirs Christie and his New York counterpart Andrew Cuomo. Any person traveling from the three West African nations who had contact with infected, or possibly infected, people will be automatically quarantined for 21 days. This includes doctors. It will be coordinated with local health departments. Governor Christie tweeted on Friday: 'Today, a healthcare worker arrived at Newark Airport, w/ a recent history of treating patients w/ Ebola in West Africa, but w/ no symptoms.' He said that the New Jersey Department of Health determined that a legal quarantine order should be issued. He added: 'This woman, while her home residence is outside of this area, her next stop was going to be here in NY.' However, the rules have not been met with universal support. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio sounded a note of caution over a 'chilling effect' on innocent doctors and nurses. A spokesman for the mayor said: 'The mayor wants to work closely with our state partners, but he wants to make sure that there will not be any sort of chilling effect on medical workers who might want to go over to help.' The New Jersey Department of Health was not available to comment.

"Cooking up a storm: Roland Leonard flambes in the kitchen of The Cat Inn in West Hoathly. He was fined £340 after admitting a charge of growing cannabis . A chef who worked at a Michelin-rated restaurant grew cannabis alongside his fruit and veg. Roland Leonard, 43, was arrested after cops found more than 20 plants at his home in West Hoathly, West Sussex. Some of them were in a garden greenhouse growing next to his tomatoes. Leonard, the former head chef West Hoathly's The Cat Inn admitted a charge of producing a class B drug at Crawley Magistrates’ Court. He was fined £340 and ordered to pay further costs of £119. Speaking after the hearing, on October 22, defiant Leonard said the cannabis was for personal use to help him unwind after work. 'I want to stand up and represent the tens of thousands of people who are responsible cannabis users,' he said. 'I work very long hours day and night - often up to 70 hours a week and I use cannabis to help me unwind. 'It really helps me to cope with a high-pressure job and I can’t see that I’m causing any harm to anyone else by using it. 'Everything I do is organic and self-sufficient, including the home-grown cannabis. 'But the bottom line is I’m not allowed to grow it any more so I won’t be using it any more.' Leonard, known locally as Max, handed in his notice at the Cat Inn, a 16th-century free house, before being arrested. He is now taking up a job working with children with learning difficulties. The father-of-one, who was caught after police raided his home, pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He said both his current and future employers are aware of the conviction. Police found these plants growing in a plastic greenhouse on Leonard's back garden, next to his tomatoes . A further search of inside Leonard's home revealed these plants beneath a grow light in a bedroom . Mark Kateley, prosecuting, said: 'On October 2 there was a drugs warrant executed at a premises in West Hoathly. 'Initially, when police entered the rear garden, they discovered approximately seven cannabis plants inside a plastic greenhouse. 'The defendant was elsewhere, at a local pub, where he was located and arrested. 'When conveyed back home, he provided officers with a front door key and a search of a bedroom was carried out, where a further 13 plants were found in addition to equipment such as heat lamps and blackout blinds. 'He informed the officers he is a user of cannabis, which he smokes for his own personal purposes. 'He admitted cultivation, albeit on a personal basis for his own benefit.' Leonard at work. After the hearing he said he used the cannabis to unwind after working long hours . The court heard there was no evidence that Mr Leonard had been dealing the drug . Defending, Christos Christou, said: 'The defendant is a chef, but is due to commence employment at a charity establishment to work with children with learning difficulties. 'In his 30s he was drinking heavily every night - often consuming half a bottle of gin but he has since turned to cannabis to deal with stress and anxiety. 'The reason he grew cannabis at home is because he didn’t want to involve himself in the criminal activity of going out on to the streets to buy it. 'The plants were grown in his home and in the soil in the garden alongside tomatoes and other vegetables. 'He is now due to go to his doctor to seek alternative medication. 'His career up to now has been very good - this was simply a minor blip.'","Roland Leonard worked at The Cat Inn in West Hoathly, West Sussex .

"Much of the talk surrounding Liverpool this summer has been focused on who will replace Luis Suarez. What Brendan Rodgers quickly realised is that there was probably no one that could. And therefore against Southampton at Anfield he had to adapt - changing last season's hugely successful system to make up for the loss of his £75million striker. Daniel Sturridge, cut loose from his familiar partner, worked as a lone striker. Raheem Sterling went wide on the left while Philippe Coutinho took his place on the right with a license to move inside. Rickie Lambert had to settle for a spot on the bench. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers share an emotional text from Luis Suarez . New trio: Raheem Sterling was on the left with Daniel Sturridge a lone striker and Philippe Coutinho on the right . Making up the numbers: Brendan Rodgers has had to find a way to replace the best striker in the world . Giving direction: Rodgers issues instructions to his players after taking a note on his pad . Back in business: Sterling confidently gives Liverpool the lead after Jordan Henderson's brilliant ball through . Done and dusted: Sturridge scores the winner past Fraser Forster to give Liverpool all three points . It was a familiar sight at Anfield last season - an incisive through ball cutting through the opposition defence and finding a forward to confidently finish off the move with aplomb. Only this time round, that forward wasn't Luis Suarez. Raheem Sterling moved inside from his left wing position and latched on to Jordan Henderson's excellent ball from inside his own half to tuck the ball beyond Fraser Forster - putting Liverpool ahead after 23 minutes. But while last season Liverpool were free-flowing and constantly dangerous - against the Saints there were teething problems, although they did eventually start the post-Suarez era with a win. And it had all started so well - Rodgers' tactical switch paid dividends midway through the first half when  Sterling scored the opener. The pacey 19-year-old was hanging around on the left while Manquillo and Jordan Henderson fought for the ball in midfield. With Sturridge and Coutinho otherwise occupied, Henderson looked up to see Sterling as the best option. The additional width provided by his new role put Sterling in the perfect positon to sprint away from Nathaniel Clyne and giving him the chance to finish coolly past Fraser Forster. It was the sort of move so frequently seen last season when Suarez was cutting defences into ribbons - and would have had Liverpool fans believing that there is life after Suarez. But unfortunately that moment was out of the ordinary rather than the norm. While there were concerns about nullifying Sterling's threat out wide for England this summer - Liverpool ended up having exactly the same problem with Coutinho. Finish: Sterling puts the ball in the back of the net during the first half to give the Reds the lead . Delight: Rodgers' new system looked to be paying dividends as Sterling put Liverpool ahead after 23 minutes . Tactical issue: Coutinho found it difficult to create from out wide and his inroads into midfield weren't great . The Brazilian playmaker has been in great form for the Reds in pre season but he simply couldn't get ahold of the game - finding it difficult to create from the wide role and finding himself a little lost when he tried to make inroads into the centre of the park. That left Sturridge starved of service with Sterling - who was excellent in the first half - only providing fleeting glimpses of his talent in the second half as Southampton grew into the game. Steven Gerrard for once looked a little lost, leaving Henderson as the prime creator - a role that he performed admirably but that proved too much to shoulder alone. Tightly marked: Sterling finds it difficult to escape from the excellent James Ward-Prowse at Anfield . What now? Coutinho and Sturridge prepare to restart the game after Nathaniel Clyne's equaliser . Got that one wrong: Coutinho heads off after failing to spark Liverpool into life at Anfield . Rodgers rung the changes, with Joe Allen coming in for Lucas and Lambert making his debut in place of Coutinho. Allen made things a bit more direct and his impact helped create the winner. Sturridge slipped in the winner after the ball had bounced around the Southampton area with four Liverpool players in the box as they mixed it up. It was relief rather than justification for Rodgers' tactical switch but for now it doesn't matter. Liverpool are off and running with three points - but the conundrum of how to replace Suarez continues and they will need to do more against Manchester City in their second Premier League game. Decider: Sturridge watches as his side footed finish drops into the bottom corner of Forster's net . Relieved: Sturridge celebrates the winner that he provided with a deft touch from Sterling's headed pass .","Last season's player of the year joined Barcelona in £75million deal .

"Glenn Hoddle is set to be appointed to Queens Park Rangers’ backroom team as Harry Redknapp looks to implement a 3-5-2 formation. The former England manager could make a dramatic return to football at Loftus Road this week after productive talks with Redknapp on Friday night. Redknapp, who played a 4-4-2 system last season, wants to replicate Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 formation during the forthcoming campaign. And the QPR manager wants Hoddle, who is well versed at playing with three at the back, to play a lead role in the transition. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Sherwood: The game has moved on since Hoddle managed' Incoming: Former England boss Glenn Hoddle has agreed a deal to become part of QPR's backroom staff . Keeping his hand in: Hoddle worked for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil over this summer . Hoddle used the formation during his managerial spells at Swindon and Chelsea, and also deployed the system intermittently during his time with England. The former Tottenham manager even played as a sweeper during the closing stages of his career. The switch is expected to see Rio Ferdinand play as a sweeper with Steven Caulker and Clint Hill flanking the former England star. Even though Hoddle hasn’t coached for eight years — since he left Wolves — the 56-year-old has made no secret of the fact that he wants to get back into football. He was linked with a return to White Hart Lane following Andre Villas-Boas’s sacking last season, but Daniel Levy handed the reins to Tim Sherwood. To keep his hand in, Hoddle has set up an academy to develop talented youngsters, as well as working as a television pundit for Sky Sports and ITV. But he is poised to accept a role that will see him return to football on a day-to-day basis, working alongside Redknapp, Kevin Bond and Joe Jordan. Hoddle will be permitted to continue his punditry work as long as it does not conflict with club duties and he will be allowed to leave Loftus Road should a desired management role crop up. Tactical guru: Hoddle used the 3-5-2 formation during his time as England manager . New man: QPR signed Jordon Mutch for £6million last week but lost to PAOK at the weekend . Redknapp has been looking for a new coach since Steve McClaren’s departure for Derby midway through last season. Ferdinand’s ability on the ball will be vital to QPR’s transition to a new formation. Hoddle worked with him during his time with England, giving the 35-year-old his full international debut in 1997. The 3-5-2 formation is set to make a comeback with Glenn Hoddle at QPR to implement the system he helped popularise in the 1990s. Hoddle used the formation for England’s 1998 World Cup campaign, having tested it out while manager of Chelsea. At Loftus Road, Rio Ferdinand will play the sweeper role that Hoddle had in mind when signing Ruud Gullit at Stamford Bridge in 1995. Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United revolution will also showcase the system, as he used it to guide Holland to third place at this summer’s World Cup finals in Brazil. Top-level football is saturated with teams playing 4-2-3-1, so playing three at the back allows a side to outnumber the opposition forwards and go man-for-man in midfield while possessing the added attacking threat of two men up front. Width is provided from two wing backs who must be able to contribute in both halves, with United’s signing of Luke Shaw seeing the teenager pencilled into the left-sided role at Old Trafford. New signing Mauricio Isla, who has arrived on a season-long loan from Juventus, is expect to fill the right wing-back slot and former Arsenal defender Armand Traore is the leading contender to play left wing-back. Redknapp still hopes to strengthen his squad before next weekend’s opener against Hull. He wants a defensive midfielder and the club have explored a potential deal for West Ham’s Momo Diame. Redknapp is also interested in former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Lassana Diarra, who is currently at Lokomotiv Moscow. Brushing up: New signing Rio Ferdinand is set to be deployed as a sweeper in the new system . Delighted: Harry Redknapp agreed a deal with Hoddle to join the club on Friday night . Meanwhile, Redknapp is increasingly confident of keeping Loic Remy, who had looked certain to leave Loftus Road this summer after his impressive loan spell at Newcastle last season. But the France striker has seen moves to Arsenal and Liverpool fall through, raising Redknapp’s hopes that Remy, who also interests Tottenham, can play a role for him next season.

"Ed Miliband is  facing a major backlash from his own party – with one MP warning his opposition to strikes in Syria could play into Putin’s hands.

Ed Miliband said he would back limited military action against Islamic State in Iraq, but insisted conditions would need to be met for him to support raids in Syria . The Labour leader is now facing a massive backlash from his own party - with one MP warning his opposition to strikes in Syria could play into Putin’s hands . And defence spokesman Vernon Coaker was forced to sack aide Iain McKenzie for voting against strikes in Iraq. Mr Miliband said that it would be ‘better’ to have UN backing, and his aides suggested Barack Obama and David Cameron should plead with Mr Putin to drop his opposition. Labour: . Diane Abbott .

Plus: Rushanara Ali (Formal abstention) Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander  insisted he had not made a UN resolution a ‘condition of future action’. But a string of former ministers lined up to warn it makes no sense to support attacks in Iraq but not Syria. Former Cabinet minister Peter Hain said: ‘Allowing Isil to retreat across an invisible border, to them, which they control, into Syria and regroup is simply no answer.’ MP Ian Austin said: ‘Are we saying we will take action against terrorists responsible for beheading a British citizen on one side of the border, but would not target them if they scuttle a few yards across into Syria?’ He said the ‘genocidal’ actions of IS meant there was no need to seek the approval of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad or his ally Vladimir Putin. He said: ‘It is really important we do not give any impression that Putin . . . has got a veto of any sort.’ Pat McFadden, another former minister, said: ‘If the Government’s position is it is illegal or wrong to act in this way in Syria, then why is it not illegal or wrong for the United States?’ Former Foreign Office minister Meg Munn said she was ‘deeply troubled’ by Britain standing on the sidelines. Labour said Mr Miliband was not ‘blocking’ action on Syria. But with the Prime Minister wary of acting without Labour, many fear he is effectively wielding a veto by setting these conditions. Former Labour defence secretary John Hutton urged both men to consider sending in combat troops. He said: ‘I hope it doesn’t come to that. But I think it would be a very great mistake to signal to our enemy in advance the limits we are prepared to place now on the sort of support we might be prepared to give.’ Lord Dannatt, former head of the Army, said: ‘You can’t deal with half a problem and I think there will be an inevitable expansion into Syria.’ One of the country's first female Muslim MPs, Rushanara Ali quit the Labour frontbench after refusing to back support for air strikes in Iraq . Shadow education minister Rushanara Ali  quit the Labour frontbench after refusing to back Ed Miliband's support for air strikes in Iraq. Elected in 2010 as one of the country's first female Muslim MPs, she defeated George Galloway, who was a major critic of new military intervention in Iraq. Born in Bangladesh, her family moved to the East End when she was seven and she grew up in Tower Hamlets. The 39-year-old worked as a researcher for former Bethnal Green MP Oona King from 1997-99, before joining the IPPR think tank. In a letter to Mr Miliband ahead of the vote on Iraq, Ms Ali said: 'I understand the case that has been made and will not be voting against the motion. 'But I am unable in conscience to support the motion and I will make a deliberate abstention.'","Ed Miliband said he would back limited military action against IS in Iraq .

"Two managers have been suspended after a hospital trust admitted discharging hundreds of suspected cancer patients by mistake. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said at least one person might have died as a result of the errors and 121 patients are yet to have their cases reviewed. A £40,000 external investigation is under way at the trust, which is made up of Hemel Hempstead Hospital, Watford General Hospital and St Albans City Hospital. An independent investigation into the blunders at the Trust has revealed a GP warned there could be a major problem in November 2012 - a full year before the Trust launched its investigation . In one case where a patient died, the trust said it was thought a delay in seeing them might have contributed to their death. It is now in the process of contacting the family of a second patient who has since died. That patient had advanced cancer at the stage the initial referral was made. In another case, a patient had their diagnosis delayed due to errors but their cancer was found at the earliest stage. Overall, 810 people have had their cases reviewed. Of these, 686 have been told there are no clinical concerns about the care they received. The mistakes came to light in . November when Samantha Jones, who took over from Mr Filochowski as chief . executive last February, asked for a review of the system for booking . cancer appointments. A review by the trust, which runs . Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead hospitals, found that 686 people . were not harmed by the delays. It is investigating other 121 cases and speaking to doctors and relatives. None turned up for their initial examinations however, possibly because they did not receive appointment letters. Given the urgency of their cases, staff should have contacted them immediately to arrange another slot. Former chief executive: Jan Filochowski left in late 2012 and moved on to Great Ormond Street, London . Instead, it is thought they were removed from the computer system with no further action taken. The blunders made some patients wait several weeks for diagnosis – with fatal results in two cases. Patients who missed their first appointment and were recorded as not showing up were discharged by the hospital. NHS rules say patients should always be offered a second appointment. The patients had been referred for urgent appointments by doctors between January 2010 and November 2013. The trust announced today that a £40,000 external review is being carried out by four authorities, including NHS England and the Trust Development Authority. It said it had offered patients 'our apologies for any anxiety and distress' caused by the events and had implemented a new IT system to track each patient’s appointment, missed appointments and cancellations. Trust chief executive Samantha Jones said: 'It is absolutely clear that the trust was not always following the correct administrative processes for these patients and we let them down. 'These concerns date back a number of years and were identified as part of the new management team’s commitment to improve the way we administer and manage patient care. 'I would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected and particularly to the relatives of those who have since died. The mistakes came to light in November when Samantha Jones, who took over from Mr Filochowski as chief executive last February, asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments . 'We have of course made significant changes to help prevent this ever happening again and will share the outcome of our investigations with those affected and with the wider public.' The trust said it is 'confident' it has contacted everyone affected . by the errors but anyone concerned should contact their GP or call the . trust’s information line on 01923 217100. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said today the errors were 'very worrying and clearly unacceptable'. He said: 'What has happened at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust is very worrying and clearly unacceptable. 'Every patient in the NHS expects and deserves the very best care to give them the highest possible chance of surviving cancer. 'An independent review has been set up to investigate the issue urgently, and the Care Quality Commission will be monitoring the situation closely on the ground. 'The new and independent chief inspector of hospitals will be looking at the quality of care for patients - including cancer care - in his ongoing programme of inspections. 'This Government is also making the deliberate falsification of hospital records a criminal offence as part of our new emphasis on transparency and openness in the NHS.' It also emerged last night that the man . who was in charge at the time quit the Health Service just as the . problems were coming to light. Jan . Filochowski, who had moved on to Great Ormond Street, suddenly left the . London hospital in December, saying he wanted to pursue ‘other . opportunities’. He takes . with him a £3million taxpayer-funded pension pot. The mistakes affected . 810 patients urgently referred to the West Hertfordshire trust for tests . between 2010 and 2013 because their GP feared they had cancer. A few weeks later, Mr Filochowski, . 62, announced he was going to retire just a year into his Great Ormond . Street posting. The married father of two gave up a £280,000 annual . salary, saying he wanted to focus on NHS consultancy and business books. He . was handed a retirement lump sum payment of £412,000 on top of his . £140,000-a-year pension – one of the most generous in the public sector. Speaking from his £1.3million home in .

"Alan Pardew and Newcastle take on England new boy Saido Berahino on Sunday – but the United boss believes he boasts a pair of Three Lions hopefuls of his own. Midfielder Jack Colback was included in Roy Hodgson’s squad in August only to withdraw because of injury, while defender Steven Taylor was an unused substitute against San Marino last year. The Magpies duo have not been involved since those respective calls and remain uncapped. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew believes Jack Colback (left) and Steven Taylor can win England squad recalls . Pardew, though, feels both players can again stake a claim for international honours this season. ‘Could Jack play for England? For sure,’ said Pardew, whose side travel to West Brom on the back of four straight wins. ‘He’s been a significant part of our season in a positive way. If I was to mark him I’d say seven out of 10, but I think he can get eights and nines here. ‘I’ve really enjoyed watching him play. I love his mentality. All he needs to do is build on what he’s done. To come from our big rivals (Sunderland) and to have played the way he has is a real testament to his character.’ Colback (left) has impressed for the Magpies since joining the club from local rivals Sunderland this summer . Taylor, meanwhile, has played every minute of United’s last three wins in the Premier League having previously been out of the side. And Pardew said: ‘You can’t argue with his record (since he came into side). ‘He’s a player that, when he’s confident, can get in the England squad, which he did during my time here. ‘The key to Steven is having a sustained run and staying injury-free, which he is having at the moment. When he gets his confidence he’s an outstanding centre-half.’ Pardew hailed Taylor (left) as an 'outstanding centre-half when he gets his confidence' Colback, though, perhaps faces a tougher task at the heart of England’s midfield. ‘We’ve got a good batch of central midfield players in the England squad, so Jack has good competition,’ Pardew added. ‘But I’ve got no problems with Roy’s selection, and neither has Jack. ‘He’s a very simple player to manage. He makes the game simple. He’s low maintenance – he comes in, does his work, is terrific and goes home – lovely.’ Newcastle face in-form West Brom striker Saido Berahino (right) at the Hawthorns on Sunday .","Newcastle travel to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday in Premier League .

"A female police officer whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton is suing Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague. Ricky Haruna, 39, claims she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police after complaining about racism and has now launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She says fellow cops laughed when a suspect used the racist term 'midnight' to her face and revealed that she did not receive support from senior officers. Ricky Haruna (left) used to escort Kate Middleton  to her car but claims she was fired from the force after complaining about racism . The allegations are among a string of claims which have now been submitted to an employment tribunal after she was sacked from the Met in June. In a statement released by The Mirror, she said: 'I was harassed and ­victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management. She also alleges that she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, saying: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' Despite her ordeal Ms Haruna is now desperate to return to the Met, where she received commendations for outstanding service.

The allegation went on to form one of three she faced at a disciplinary hearing which led to her being sacked. Ms Haruna's solicitor Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice, said: 'When PC Haruna reported the bullying in the workplace, rather than support her, the Met's response was to target her and sack her.'

"In a country as highly populated as China, examples of noteworthy driving are not difficult to find. But while high speed crashes and overturned lorries are commonplace, the relatively innocuous act of parking a car  rarely makes the news. But two incidents this month highlight the extremes of parking in China. While one man was filmed effortlessly squeezing his large 4x4 into a space only a few inches larger than his vehicle, CCTV footage showed another  making a complete hash of reversing out of a parking bay - crashing into the neighbouring vehicle a staggering 15 times before speeding off. Sublime: Without needing to correct his manoeuvre, Chen Zhongliang was able to reverse his large 4x4 into a space only inches larger than the car itself - making it appear purpose made for his vehicle . Ridiculous: The  driver in the second incident displayed a considerably less skilled parking technique . In the first incident, filmed in the city of Quanzhou in Fujian province, 31-year-old Chen Zhongliang was seen parking his bright orange Faw Besturn X80 in exceptional style. Without needing to correct his manoeuvre, Mr Chen was able to reverse his large 4x4 into a space only inches larger than the car itself - making it appear purpose made for his vehicle. The sublime parking had nothing to do with luck however, as the stone groove is actually outside Mr Chen's home, giving him plenty of opportunity to practice squeezing his car into the tiny gap. The driver in the second incident displayed a considerably less rehearsed approach to parking. Earning him the dubious accolade of the country’s 'worst driver', the unnamed man was caught on CCTV taking 10 minutes to simply reverse out of a parking bay. While doing so he managed to hit the car next to him a staggering 15 times. Effortless: Filmed in the city of Quanzhou in Fujian province, 31-year-old Chen Zhongliang was seen parking his bright orange Faw Besturn X80 in exceptional style . Ease: Chen Zhongliang's parking had nothing to do with luck, as the stone groove is actually right outside his home - giving him plenty of opportunity to practice squeezing his car into the tiny gap . Not a scratch: Mr Chen was able to park his large 4x4 in the tiny space in a single impressive manoeuvre . The footage, taken earlier this month in Jiangyin, a city of around two million people in the east of the country, shows the hapless man trying dozens of bizarre angles and manoeuvres to get out the bay. Had he simply reversed backwards out of the space, he'd have avoided any bumps or scrapes. After eventually getting out of the parking space, the man was seen speeding away from the scene without making any effort to let the unfortunate driver of the neighbouring car know what he'd done. He was later tracked down by police officers, who contacted local car dealers to find his identity. Officers confiscated the man’s licence on suspicion of being involved in a hit and run, pending further penalty measures, according to the South China Morning Post. Mirror, signal, massacre: The footage shows the hapless man trying dozens of different angles to get out . The man, who had only been driving for two months, has been called 'reverse brother' by Chinese social media users .

Yet 67,759 people died in road accidents in China in 2009 - more than double the number in the U.S.","Chen Zhongliang, 31, parked his bright orange car in exceptional style .

"Ukraine has destroyed the majority of a Russian military convoy which crossed over its border on Thursday night, the country’s president said yesterday. Petro Poroshenko claimed his forces had attacked the column of armoured personnel carriers and that most had been ‘eliminated’ – but warned Russian arms continue to flow in to rebel fighters. The Ukrainian president revealed details when he spoke on the phone to David Cameron, who called on Russia to show that it wanted a ‘peaceful resolution’. A larger humanitarian convoy of hundreds of trucks is still in Western Russia, unable to cross the border. But yesterday it appeared it may have merely been a decoy to mask the incursion elsewhere on the border. Scroll down for videos . Incursion: Ukraine said it traced and attacked a column of Russian armoured personnel carriers, like the ones above which are waiting near the border . Mr Cameron last night expressed ‘grave concerns’ at a marked escalation in hostilities between the two countries. The Russian ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office to ‘clarify’ reports of a Russian military incursion and what officials called the ‘continued build-up of equipment on the border’. Moscow denied its forces had entered Ukraine, and accused Kiev of trying to sabotage deliveries of aid. But Mr Poroshenko said the ‘given information was trustworthy and confirmed because the majority of the machines had been eliminated by the Ukrainian artillery at night’. After Mr Cameron spoke to President Poroshenko, Downing Street released a statement saying: ‘The Prime Minister expressed grave concerns at reports of Russian military vehicles crossing the border. ‘Russia... must not use the aid convoy as a pretext for further provocation. ‘Both leaders also agreed on finding a political solution to de-escalate the situation and the Prime Minister welcomed President Poroshenko’s readiness to engage with Russia and other partners to achieve this. Attacks: Ukrainian military forces said their artillery destroyed the 'majority' of a 23-vehicle column . Heavy weapons: Ukraine said artillery guns, such as the one pictured above, destroyed the Russian vehicles . Heavy armour: Government forces from Kiev have been rolling into the rebel-held east - near the Russian border - over the past few days . Held up: A man takes a picture of Moscow's aid convoy parked in a field in Kamensk-Shakhtinksy, Russia . ‘Russia needs to demonstrate the same willingness to find a peaceful resolution.’ A convoy of armoured vehicles with Russian military plates was seen crossing the border into eastern Ukraine on Thursday night, leading to fears it could mark the beginning of a full-scale incursion by Moscow. As many as 23 armoured personnel carriers, along with fuel tankers and other logistics vehicles made the crossing under cover of darkness near the rebel-held Ukrainian town of Donetsk. Senior diplomats fear Vladimir Putin could try to use the growing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine as a pretext for invasion. European leaders meeting in Brussels said any unilateral military action by Russia would be a ‘blatant violation of international law’ and said the EU was ready to consider further sanctions. Speaking in Brussels, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he was ‘very alarmed’ at the reports. He said: ‘We would urge the Russians to withdraw any military personnel they have inside Ukraine and stop supporting the separatists. The situation is potentially very dangerous.’ Kiev and its Western allies have repeatedly accused Russia of arming pro-Moscow separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: ‘It just confirms the fact that we see a continuous flow of weapons and fighters from Russia into eastern Ukraine and it is a clear demonstration of continued Russian involvement in the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine.’ Convoy: Hundreds of trucks carrying Russian humanitarian aid are still waiting not far from the border . The Russian foreign ministry has accused the Ukrainian military of stopping the convoy from getting into the country, despite entry being agreed with Kiev . - By MailOnline Deputy Political Editor Tom McTague . Britain this afternoon summoned the Russian ambassador for emergency talks, amid reports of a military incursion into Ukraine. Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko has been asked to ‘clarify’ the reports after the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko held talks with David Cameron today. Mr Poroshenko told the Prime Minister that a military convoy had crossed from Russia into Ukraine overnight. He added that a ‘majority of the machines had been eliminated by the Ukrainian artillery at night’. According to Mr Poroshenko the Prime Minister ‘reaffirmed his strong and gradual support to Ukraine and the actions of the President’ in dealing with the Russian incursion. Arriving in Brussels today, the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he was ‘very alarmed’ by the reports. Condemnation: Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, left, told Birtain about the attacks today. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, right, had earlier said any incursions carry 'very serious' consequences . He said: ‘If there are any Russian military personnel or vehicles in eastern Ukraine, they need to be withdrawn immediately or the consequences could be very serious.' Mr Hammond added: ‘We would urge the Russians to withdraw any military personnel that they have inside Ukraine and stop supporting the separatists as they have been doing for the last few months. ‘The situation is potentially very dangerous and that's why we are here today discussing it.’ Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed the incursion.

"Ashley Rhodes-Courter was three when her childhood came to an abrupt end. The daughter of a struggling teenage mother, her life had been blighted by fecklessness and her parent's regular brushes with the law. But when social services stepped in to take the little girl and her younger brother Luke away, she found herself shuttling between foster homes while her mother fought to prevent her children from being adopted. After more than a decade of living with carers, including several convicted criminals, she was finally adopted and, now 29, says she is furious that it wasn't allowed to happen sooner. Scroll down for video . New life: Ashley Rhodes-Courter is now married and an adoptive mother-of-one as well as a foster parent . Adoption: After spending a decade shuttling between foster homes, she wants to see more adoptions . Ms Rhodes-Courter has also told of how she was left 'demoralised' by her experiences and says more needs to be done to vet carers, pointing out that she herself was made to live, in one instance, with a convicted paedophile. 'I moved 14 different times during the nearly 10 years I was in foster care,' she says angrily, speaking from her Florida home. 'Most of my homes were overcrowded and almost 25 per cent of my foster parents were, or became, convicted criminals. Needless to say, I was not placed in the most desirable of circumstances. 'While in care I was beaten, went hungry, and was generally neglected. Luckily, I was the kind of kid that learned how to stay out of trouble. 'But many of the other children were not as lucky. My brother was almost killed in one foster home and the abuse stories I heard from my foster brothers and sisters are almost unspeakable.' Although adopted in 1998 by the kindly Courter family, she remains furious about what happened to her and says that adoption should be made easier - and should happen sooner. 'I should not have been in foster care for as long as I was,' she says. 'They should have done more to place me with a suitable relative, or I should have been available for adoption much, much sooner. 'Instead, the courts kept giving my mother more and more time to get her act together until a volunteer advocate for my case came forward and convinced the courts to terminate my mother's rights. 'But by that time, I was already nine years old and had nearly grown up in the system.' Difficult: In 10 years, Ashley lived in 14 homes with carers that included convicted criminals and a paedophile . The author of a successful 2008 memoir, Three Little Words, Ms Rhodes-Courter has also thrown herself into campaigning for the rights of children in care and says better vetting for would-be foster carers is essential. 'All children should be protected,' says the foster mother of 20 and adoptive mother of one. 'In the United States, every citizen can report child abuse. 'That abuse will be investigated by law enforcement and if it is found that the child is not safe in their home, the child will be removed.' But although police are quick to intervene in abuse cases, what follows afterwards can leave the child even more damaged than before. 'In most cases, foster families would be the better than a group home since they are supposed to be more ""normal"",' she explains. 'Children that grow up in group homes or facilities can become institutionalised and have difficulty functioning in the real world as teens or adults. 'But the reality is that many children end up bouncing home to home, relatives are not always located or searched for properly and sometimes they go back to their families only to return to foster care again. 'I think the Government need to support child welfare initiatives and make sure we get help for foster parents, social workers, and agencies with a view to keeping children and families safe.' Video courtesy of University of Southern California . Happy ending: Ashley with her adoptive parents Phil and Gay, her husband and their small children . But it is finding a way to get more children out of care homes and into loving adoptive families that remains her overwhelming passion and she cites her own appalling upbringing as a good example of why change is needed. 'Finding a forever family was scary for me at first,' she admits. 'Most people think adoption is a happy occasion but I was terrified that it was too good to be true and that it would fall apart. 'I had seen so many kids be ""un-adopted"" and sent back into foster care. I had been rejected by so many foster families and I didn't expect this home to be any different.' Despite her fears, her adoption by Phil and Gay Coulter - both of whom are on the receiving end of a paean of praise in her memoir - proved to be the making of her. 'I think my life would be very different if I had never been adopted,' she says, frankly. 'I always loved school and had a drive to succeed but they introduced me to a world that I never would have known. 'I like to think I would have made good choices but my life would have been infinitely harder and probably not as successful. 'Simply having stability and not having to worry about where I would sleep, whether eat, and knowing I was safe allowed me to thrive. For the first time in my life I got to travel, have slumber parties with friends, and participate in school activities. 'Children who do not find families  often become homeless, teen parents, have abusive relationships, or get arrested and don't lead productive lives. That easily could have been me.'","Ashley Rhodes-Courter spent a decade shuttling between foster families .

"Many Australian men could be living with chlamydia, and not even know it. While the rate of chlamydia is significantly higher in women than men, a new study on sexual health suggests a large percentage of the male population could have the disease but remains undiagnosed. Chlamydia is mostly screened at general practices, but young men visit their GP less than women, and when they do they are three-times less likely to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases. Young men visit their GP less than women, and when they do they are three-times less likely to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases . Many men were also found to be wrong in their beliefs that STI screenings are painful, invasive or embarrassing . 'Despite being an at-risk group, the voices of young men are largely absent from discussions around sexual health promotion,' the study's lead research Dr Amy Litras said. The study, which calls for targeted promotional strategies to combat the surging rates of Sexually transmissible infections (STI) in young people, also found that many men don't know that some STIs don't have symptoms, leading to the lack of testing. Many men were also found to be wrong in their beliefs that STI screenings are painful, invasive or embarrassing. *Small amounts of clear or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis . *Painful urination . *Burning and itching around the opening of the penis . *Pain and swelling around the testicles . WebMD . 'Participants thought an STI test was likely to involve some combination of intimate examination, needles, blood tests and painful swabs,' said Dr Litras. 'When told that for most young men without symptoms it would be as simple as a urine test they said they would be much more likely to get one.' In a related study, the internet was found to be the first stop for sexual health information instead of a local doctor. The study suggested concerns about privacy and embarrassment were the main barriers preventing men from talking to their GP about sexual health. The studies will be presented at the Australasian Sexual Health Conference in Sydney which runs from October 9-11. Chlamydia, also known as the silent killer, is the most common STI among young people. In 2012, 82,707 new cases were reported in Australia. The STI is caused by a type of bacteria, which according to the Australian Government Department of Health affects 60 per cent of males and females. If Chlamydia is left dormant suffers can become infertile.

"Rescue crews  are desperately searching  for a sheriff's deputy who radioed for help minutes before her empty patrol car was found submerged in floodwaters. The officer is believed to have been swept away on Thursday in Lake Austen, West Texas, where heavy rain has caused dozens of streets and  homes to flood. Roger Wade, a spokesman for the Travis County Sheriff's Office, said the deputy was checking low-water crossings during the heavy storms when she called in for assistance. Search: Austin firefighters in boats and Travis County Sheriff deputies in a helicopter search Lake Austin for a missing Travis County Sheriff deputy who was swept away in a flood near Fritz Hughes Park . Rescue operation: A Travis County Sheriff deputy and his dog participate in the search. Officers believe the missing deputy was swept away by a 'low-water crossing' She radioed shortly before 2 am CDT Thursday, saying her vehicle was being washed away in an Austin-area subdivision. 'We believe she was swept into the low-water crossing by water going down the street,' said Wade, who identified the deputy only as a seven-year veteran of the department. Austin-Travis County EMS was contending with three other swift-water rescues in the region, Cmdr. Mike Benavides said. No injuries were reported in those rescues. The Austin area received five to seven inches of rain early Thursday, said Cory Van Pelt, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in New Braunfels. Rainfall from remnants of Hurricane Odile pelted parts of the U.S. Southwest, including in Texas from El Paso to Houston. 'We are getting moisture from Odile,' Van Pelt said. 'We also got a lot of Gulf of Mexico moisture that came in, a combination of the two.' Austin Energy reported about 1,100 customers without power Thursday. Heavy rain also caused flooding in far West Texas, where a portion of Interstate 10 remained closed for several hours Wednesday night and fire crews responded to more than 100 weather-related calls. Forecasters issued a flash flood watch through Thursday night for the El Paso area, where two people were rescued from a swamped vehicle. A third person who swam to safety was being treated for minor injuries, El Paso Fire Department Battalion Chief Carlos Franco said.

'This is like a funnel, all the water that comes from the mountains, from other streets just comes down here,' he said. Greg Lundeen, a National Weather Service meteorologist for the El Paso area, said some areas of east El Paso received up to 3 inches of rain in an hour Wednesday night and that rain is expected to continue falling over the next 18 hours. Several hundred homes and businesses in the El Paso area lost electricity, according to El Paso Electric. In southeastern New Mexico, the town of La Union saw up to three inches of rainfall, forcing residents to scramble to keep water out of their homes.

"Nigeria and Senegal have both been declared Ebola-free after completing 42-day periods with no new cases detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the end of the outbreak of Ebola   in Nigeria today after active surveillance found the country to be free of the disease. 'Nigeria is now free of Ebola,' WHO representative Rui Gama Vaz told a news conference in the capital Abuja, prompting a round of applause from other officials. 'This is a spectacular success story ... It shows that Ebola can be contained but we must be clear that we have only won a battle, the war will only end when West Africa is also declared free of Ebola.' A teacher uses a thermometer to test students' temperature to check for symptoms of Ebola at a school in Lagos. Nigeria will be declared Ebola-free if no new cases are detected before next Monday October 20 . Senegal was declared free of the deadly virus on Friday. One traveler from Liberia triggered an outbreak in which eight people - most of them health workers - died in Nigeria, before the disease could be contained. The traveler, a Liberian-American diplomat called Patrick Sawyer, collapsed at the main international airport in Lagos on July 20. Because the country was ill-prepared and had no screening procedures in place, Mr Sawyer was able to infect 19 people. This included a number of  workers in the hospital where he was taken, which did not have proper protection equipment. A Nigerian health official uses a thermometer on a worker at the arrivals hall of Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. WHO has described Nigeria as a 'spectacular success story' after the country was declared Ebola-free following a 42-day period in which no new cases were detected. Senegal had one patient who was confirmed to have Ebola but he recovered and appears not to have infected anyone else. But in the three worst affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - 'new cases continue to explode in areas that looked like they were coming under control', WHO has said. 'An unusual characteristic of this epidemic is a persistent cyclical pattern of gradual dips in the number of new cases, followed by sudden flare-ups,' the organization added. WHO says that waiting for 42 days from the time when the last person with high risk exposure tests negative for the virus gives sufficient confidence to declare an outbreak over. The 42-day period is twice the generally accepted maximum incubation period of the virus. WHO said that in 95 per cent of cases the incubation period was between one and 21 days. In 98 per cent, it was no longer than 42 days. But the health agency has said that it is possible for the virus to survive even longer, remaining for as much as 90 days in the semen of an infected man. WHO said in the three worst affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, 'new cases continue to explode in areas that looked like they were coming under control' Outside West Africa, the spread of the disease has been confirmed in Spain and the United States. Possible cases have been investigated in several other countries, but none has yet turned out to be Ebola. WHO said it was concerned by media reports that some countries facing a possible first Ebola case had declared the cases to be negative within hours. 'Such rapid determination of infection status is impossible, casting grave doubts on some of the official information that is being communicated to the public and the media,' it said. Countries without recognized laboratories specializing in viral hemorrhagic fever testing should send their first 50 negative specimens to a WHO collaborating center, the agency added. All countries should have their first 25 positive tests double-checked.","Agency declared end of outbreak of Ebola virus in Nigeria today .

"Houston Mayor Annise Parker says her youngest daughter was barred from taking a driving test 'because she has two moms.' Parker, who is the first openly-gay mayor of a major American city, said Thursday that the Department of Public Safety wouldn't accept the documents that her daughter Marquitta took to sign up for the test. 'Daughter needs drivers test. Has all docs, some in MomA [Annise] name, some MomK [Kathy Hubbard], but w/ birth cert showing both,' she said via Twitter. 'DPS says can only be from 1 mom!' Houston Mayor Annise Parker says her daughter Marquitta (right) faced extra hurdles while getting a driver's license because she has two mothers . Moms Kathy Hubbard and Annise Parker on their California wedding day in January 2014 . The mayor says it took her three trips and an 'unnecessary paper chase' to get her youngest daughter a driver's license. 'Thank you to the DPS clerk & supervisor in the Rosenberg office who took the time to read my daughters documentation & realize it was OK,' she said Friday afternoon. Parker has three children with Hubbard: Daniela Parker, Marquitta Parker and Jovon Tyler. A spokesman for the department denied the claims. 'All individuals applying for their first Texas driver license must provide a variety of documents to prove their identity, Social Security Number, US citizenship or lawful presence status, and Texas residency,' press secretary Tom Vinger told Lone Star Q. 'In this case, the adult applicant did not initially present sufficient documentation to prove residency. Once she provided the required documentation, she was able to complete the transaction. 'There is no indication that any delay in the process was related to same-sex marriage.' Parker and Hubbard were married earlier this year in a sunset ceremony in California on the 23rd anniversary of the beginning of their relationship. 'This is a very happy day for us,' Parker said then. 'We have had to wait a very long time to formalize our commitment to each other. 'Kathy has been by my side for more than two decades, helping to raise a family, nurture my political career and all of the other ups and downs and life events that come with a committed relationship. 'She is the love of my life, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life married to her.' Parker's election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor. Texas does not recognize same-sex marriages. Parker has previously stated that she wanted to get married in Houston, but acknowledged that being able to do so may be a long time in coming.

"Didier Drogba failed to inspire a vapid Chelsea side as they fell to their first defeat of pre-season in his second debut with the club. The Ivorian forward capped his last Chelsea appearance with the winning penalty in 2012’s Champions League final against Bayern Munich but back in Germany he – and Chelsea’s other forwards - were starved of service in a game they deservedly lost courtesy of Ludovic Obraniak’s header and penalties from Eljero Elia and Felix Kroos. Brazilian trio Oscar, Willian and Ramires along with World Cup winner Andre Schurrle return for pre-season training on Monday and Jose Mourinho will be glad of a boost to his creative options as Chelsea struggled to break down their German counterparts. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Obraniak beat Courtois with a brilliant glancing header . Return of the Drog: Didier Drogba made his first appearance for the Blues since rejoining Chelsea . Beaten: Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois conceded two goals in Germany . Battle: Chelsea failed in quest to extend their unbeaten friendly run during match against Werder Bremen .

VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho . There were some positives though: Thibaut Courtois capped a 45-minute debut with a top save to keep out former Blue Franco Di Santo’s close range header, while Diego Costa again led the line well during his time on the field. Werder Bremen: Wolf, Fritz, Lukimya, Caldirola, Garcia, Galvez, Bartels, Obraniak, Junuzovic, Di Santo, Elia. Goals: Elia 17, Obranik 37, Kroos 89. Chelsea: Courtois .

Subs not used: Chalobah, Christensen, Solanke. But in truth Mourinho’s Chelsea were disappointing on their fourth outing of this European pre-season tour – and the Blues boss will be glad to regroup at their Cobham base when they return from Germany. John Terry handled in the area after 18 minutes to give Elia the chance to expertly convert a penalty past Courtois and give Bremen the lead. And Obraniak doubled the deficit 20 minutes later with a brilliant header that skimmed into the Belgian debutant’s bottom right hand corner. Chelsea on the other hand were poor – while Diego Costa caused a nuisance up front the best chances of the first half fell to Mo Salah and Fernando Torres who were both wasteful and looked lost on the flanks. Nightmare debut: Drogba will not be happy how his first performance back in blue shirt went . Disappointed: Courtois looks disappointed having conceded two of Werder Bremen's three goals . Lost hope: Petr Cech is beaten by a late penalty by Werder Bremen's Felix Kroos . Outplayed: Chelsea failed to deal with Werder Bremen's attacking players such as Eljero Elia . Poor show: Jose Mourinho will be hoping his side can quickly recover from a setback against Werder Bremen . Drogba made his return to the side after the break but frequently found himself second-best to strong Bremen centre back Assani Lukimya. Cesc Fabregas had Chelsea’s best opening, latching onto Eden Hazard’s ball across the box with 20 minutes left but his chipped effort left a lot to be desired and landed on the roof of Raphael Wolf’s net. To add insult to injury, substitute Kroos then went on to make it 3-0 minutes before the final whistle after Nathan Ake’s perfectly good last-ditch tackle was deemed to be a penalty by the referee.","Jose Mourinho's side fail to beat German outfit Werder Bremen .

"Penny Jacquet began getting menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes nearly 20 years ago . For most women, the menopause is an uncomfortable phase of life where symptoms usually pass within three to years. But Penny Jacquet is still struggling more than two decades on. Nineteen years after she first began experiencing hot flushes, she is still battling them - and says she fears they will never cease. Appearing today on ITV's This Morning, the mother-of-two said: 'My symptoms began in 1995, a couple of years after the birth of my second daughter. 'Early menopause is common in my family, but while my mother and grandmother sailed through theirs, mine was terrible from the start. 'One day, on a visit to London with my daughter, I had ten hot flushes. 'I can't remember anything we saw because I felt so ill and kept having to run outside for fresh air.' Mrs Jacquet told  hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'My periods stopped, my skin started itching and my hair became brittle. 'Before a hot flush, I'd have a panic attack - it was awful. 'I didn't know where I was, what I was doing - my self confidence totally went. 'In the end, I worked it out that a few seconds after the panic attack....woosh - and my face would be scarlet and dripping in sweat.' She said while her symptoms did affect her socially, she had little choice but to get on with life, given that both her daughters were still at school. Her husband, she says, has been kind and understanding - but her persistent symptoms have dented her self confidence, she said. 'I couldn't take hormone replacement therapy because I have breast cysts, which can lead to an increased risk of cancer if HRT is taken. 'So, I tried every natural remedy, from black cohosh to evening primrose oil. 'I used oestrogen and progesterone creams to help with the discomfort during sex, but nothing would work. In the end, I gave up and thought: ""I'll just have to wait until it's over"". 'But it didn't end. And many of the symptoms - the itching, soreness and hot flushes - are still with me. 'I didn't want to make a fuss, so I just coped. At its worst, it made me feel very alone, because I couldn't believe anyone else could be going through what I was. 'I had no idea other women had symptoms that were as debilitating or lasted as long.' Ms Jacquet was speaking out to mark World Menopause Month. Around four million women in the UK alone go through the menopause every year, with the average age being 51. Up to 80 per cent of women experience symptoms other than the ceasing of periods, such as hot flushes, mood swings, memory loss, night sweats and painful sex, GP Dawn Harper told the programme. She said: 'I see really successful women who just lose it - they can't even decide what pair of knickers to put on in the morning.' She went on to explain that women such as Penny, who began showing signs at 42, are considered young for the menopause. 'Anything over 45 but before around 50 is considered early - and anything over 40 is premature.' Commenting on Penny's case, Dr Dawn Harper (right) said the symptoms will not go on forever - the flashes and mood swings will get a lot better. She added that many women suffer unnecessarily in silence . Dr Harper added that while the age periods begin is based largely on body weight, there is a strong genetic link when it comes to the age of menopause. And commenting on Penny's case, she said: 'The symptoms will not go on forever - the flashes and mood swings will get a lot better.' She went on to explain that many women feel they have to simply put up with symptoms of the menopause - which is wrong. 'Far too many women just accept vaginal dryness and uncomfortable sex. 'You don't have to put up with it and you don'd need to be frightened of HRT. This Morning asked viewers which of the following symptoms affected them most when going through the menopause? They said: . Hot flushes and night sweats: 49 per cent . Psychological (including mood swings and anxiety) problems: 27 per cent . Sleep problems: 9 per cent . Vaginal problems: 8 per cent . Joint aches: 7 per cent . 'It's not HRT or nothing - for flushes and sweats there is an old-fashioned blood pressure treatment that can help. 'Dryness can be tackled by applying [the hormone] oestrogen to the area. 'There are so many options available - including remaining a healthy weight and eating plenty of soy, which raises oestrogen levels. 'It's definitely worth talking to your GP about it.' The official definition of the menopause is the last period, with the stage leading up to this known as the perimenopause. Contrary to popular belief, the average age of the menopause has not changed, says leading expert Dr Heather Currie, of the website Menopause matters. 'It may be that slowly, more women are beginning to talk about the perimenopause,' she said. The most commonly recognised early symptoms of the menopause include hot flushes, night sweats and disturbed sleep. However they may also include bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, tiredness and a general lack of energy, adds Dr Currie. 'It's not uncommon for symptoms to be gradual, and come and go, which can confuse the issue. 'However the most obvious sign is usually a change in the regularity of periods – even in the late thirties or early forties.'","Penny Jacquet, 61, saw her periods stop when she was just 42 .

"Solicitation: Georgia investigators allege that Roberts used his position of authority and town resources to solicit sex from minors . The police chief of a small town in Georgia was arrested Wednesday after a months-long investigation into whether he used his position of authority and town resources to solicit sex from underage boys. Molena police chief and city manager James Roberts was denied bond on Thursday as he's being held on two counts of solicitation of sodomy and one count of theft by conversion. Roberts, who also serves as the mayor of nearby Concord, allegedly used his standing in the county to solicit sex from two young men, even providing one with gas on the county's dime. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation began looking into Roberts after the grandparents of one minor Roberts pursued reported it to the Pike County Sheriff's Office, according to the  Journal-Reporter. GBI investigators searched both the Molena and Concord city halls, along with the Molena police station and Roberts's home. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, they found that Roberts had texted obscene images to one minor using a phone provided by the city. Investigators also found that the police chief had given another young man a key and code that allowed him to fill up his own personal vehicle with gasoline paid for by the county. The towns have a little more than 700 residents between them, though so far it seems the alleged crimes were confined to Molena. Concord Mayor Pro Tem John Strickland told the Journal-Constitution that Roberts presided over a city council meeting Tuesday and that officials had no idea he was being investigated. When investigators showed up to Concord city hall on Wednesday,  they inspected computers for evidence. Accused: Roberts with an unidentified woman in this Facebook photo published by the Pike County Journal-Reporter was denied bond . 'We will try to get the council together [Thursday] to go over what’s gone on with these accusations,' said Strickland. 'The city of Concord’s not implicated in anything here.' Molena officials are also likely to speak about the situation with Roberts when they convene Thursday for a scheduled budget meeting. 'We’re in limbo at the moment trying to absorb everything,' said Molena Mayor Jay Garner.","Molena police chief and city manager James Roberts was denied bond on charges of solicitation of sodomy and theft by conversion .

"Captain Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal now have the forward firepower to mount a long-overdue sustained assault on the Barclays Premier League title. The manner in which the FA Cup winners saw off defending champions Manchester City in the Community Shield, albeit against a makeshift side, at Wembley has given hope Arsene Wenger's men can finally last the distance through to May 2015 for what would be a first championship in more than a decade. Wenger strengthened the Arsenal squad with the £30million summer addition of Chile forward Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, while the arrival of France international Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle offset the loss of Bacary Sagna, who joined City on a free transfer. VIDEO Scroll down for Mikel Arteta: It is a privilege to be named captain of Arsenal . Glory: Mikel Arteta celebrates Arsenal's Community Shield victory with Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez . Consistent: The Spaniard has been a solid performer for the Gunners since joining from Everton in 2011 . Add to that the raw talents of Joel Campbell, the Costa Rica forward back from a loan spell at Olympiacos, and Yaya Sanogo, who netted four against Benfica in the Emirates Cup, as well as the imminent return of England forward Theo Walcott from his knee injury and the Gunners will certainly have plenty of frontline ammunition. 'Attacking-wise this season, we are going to be more different and we are going to have more of a surprise factor,' Arteta told Arsenal Player. '(Alexis) looks very good. He has got pace, that special technique, his feet are so, so quick. 'He is a bit cheeky on the pitch, and got those runs, that movement, is always on the shoulder of a defender and he wants to score goals. Alexis has the right attitude here - very humble. 'He is going to do well - I think the fans are very excited and I think they are right because we have signed some player here.' Victorious: Arteta holds aloft the Community Shield after Arsenal's 3-0 victory over Manchester City . Arteta, appointed as permanent club captain following the sale of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona, added: 'I am very impressed with Joel (Campbell). He's got great feet, great technique, is very creative and he's a young lad who is full of energy and is enthusiastic. 'He wants to stay here, wants to make his stamp here and I think the boss is going to give him a chance.' Wenger indicated he would like to bring in another defender to cover Vermaelen's departure, the Belgian international heading to the Nou Camp for more first-team opportunities. Arsenal have been linked with the likes of Schalke captain Benedikt Howedes, Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo, Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho and Greek international Kostas Manolas. Calum Chambers joined in a £16million deal from Southampton earlier in the summer and the 19-year-old has produced some consistent displays during pre-season. Arteta is confident there is more to come. 'I am impressed by Calum's character, by how quickly he is adapting and how secure he is when he plays,' said the Spaniard. 'He is mature, a normal guy and I think he is going to be a very important player for us in the next few years.' Reward: Arteta has been handed the captain's armband at the Emirates after proving to be a reliable performer . German World Cup-winning trio Lukas Podolski, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil have all returned to Arsenal's Hertfordshire training base. However, they are unlikely to be considered for the Gunners' Premier League opener at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday, with the first leg of the Champions League play-off against Besiktas in Istanbul next week a possibility. Walcott, who missed the World Cup after suffering a serious knee problem in the FA Cup win over Tottenham in January, and Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, signed from Nice in the summer, have not been included in Arsenal's UEFA squad list for the tie as they continue their respective recoveries from injury.","Arteta has been confirmed as Arsenal's new captain .

"The International Cricket Council has decided not to appeal against the ruling that saw England seamer James Anderson found not guilty of breaching its code of conduct. Anderson was last week cleared of any wrong-doing by judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis relating to having been accused by India of pushing and abusing their all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion during the first Investec Test. Only the ICC, via chief executive Dave Richardson, could challenge that verdict - as well as the one that cleared Jadeja of a lesser charge - but after announcing on Tuesday that it would consider the verdict, the governing body has decided not to push the case further. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jadeja and Anderson cleared of wrong-doing . Flash point: Ravi Jadeja (left) and Jimmy Anderson (right) leave the field for lunch during the Trent Bridge Test . Richardson said: 'This outcome is the result of two exhaustive and thorough disciplinary processes and, after considering the written decision, the ICC is satisfied with the manner in which the decisions have been reached.' Richardson's refusal to re-open a case that was heard at length via teleconference after last week's Test at the Ageas Bowl finally draws the Anderson-Jadeja saga to an end. The England seamer, top wicket-taker in the series and man-of-the-match in Southampton, had been facing a ban of up to four Tests if found guilty but can now go into his home match at Old Trafford on Thursday with no cloud hanging over him. Free: Anderson trains with the England team at Old Trafford on Tuesday ahead of the fourth Investec Test . In the clear: Anderson could have faced a ban had he been found guilty of breaching the ICC's Code of Conduct . The decision will be welcomed by the England and Wales Cricket Board, who were surprised to see the issue escalated so far by the tourists, while India will be highly aggrieved. They have been eager to see Anderson punished, with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni thought to have resisted all attempts to find a diplomatic solution. Lewis' ruling, which was delivered with surprising speed given the prolonged and exhaustive nature of the hearing, had focused on the lack of decisive CCTV evidence and the conflicting nature of testimony from the opposing sides. As such Richardson, a trained lawyer himself, saw no benefit to a challenge. 'It was a complicated and sensitive matter relating to charges brought against two players at different levels of the ICC Code of Conduct,' Richardson noted. VIDEO Jadeja and Anderson cleared of wrong-doing . Bitter sweet: Jadeja during India's nets session at Old Trafford in Manchester on Tuesday . 'There appears to have been vastly conflicting evidence on both sides, with a total of 13 witnesses who gave testimony. After carefully considering the decision by Gordon Lewis, whose vast experience was invaluable to the process over recent weeks, we believe that no further purpose would be served by prolonging the process through further appeal proceedings. 'The disciplinary procedures were robust and transparent and all parties had ample opportunity to ask questions, test the evidence and make submissions. We have determined that there is no merit in an appeal and that it would not be in the best interest of the sport to take such action.' Lewis had also called on the ICC to look again at their disciplinary code after finding its terms unwieldy in his first appearance as a commissioner. Richardson added: 'As a matter of best practice, the ICC will now review the procedures as set out in the Code and reflect upon the comments made by Gordon Lewis in his decision about how a case of this nature might better be provided for in the future.'","Chief executive Dave Richardson decides not to challenge ruling .

"Yaya Toure will not receive a new contract from Manchester City but manager Manuel Pellegrini insists that the midfielder is content with life at the Etihad Stadium. The club’s summer was pockmarked by some rather peculiar behaviour by Toure and his agent Dimitri Seluk, in which the pair bizarrely claimed that City did not treat the player with sufficient respect on his birthday. ‘Really, I spoke with Yaya and he’s very happy,’ Pellegrini said, ‘I don’t know what happened in the summer. I hope Yaya can repeat the season he had last season.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Man City stars get suited and booted ahead of new season . No new deal: Sportsmail understands that Yaya Toure will not receive a new contract from Manchester City . Hopeful: Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini is keen for Toure to repeat last season's feat during this campaign . A host of City stars have this summer signed long-term deals with the club, with Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Sergio Aguero this week joining Samir Nasri in agreeing new contracts. When asked if further announcements could be expected soon - with Toure’s name in particular mentioned - Pellegrini smiled: ‘We will see in the next days.’ Sportsmail understands that Toure is not one of those in line for a renewed deal but Edin Dzeko is set to put pen to paper soon. City are also keen to retain Joe Hart and James Milner. Hart’s existing deal has two years to run while Milner - who has been monitored by Arsenal and Liverpool - will see his deal run out at the end of this season. The England midfielder will wait to see how many opportunities he is given in the first-team before agreeing an extension. Toure, however, is only 14 months into a four-year deal that is believed to be worth in excess of £200,000 a week and City see no reason to enter into dialogue with the 31-year-old over a new contract. In action: Toure, picture during last week's Community Shield, is 14 months into a four-year deal at Man City . Close: Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko is set to sign a new deal with the current Premier League champions soon . Meanwhile, Manchester City will begin their title defence at Newcastle on Sunday afternoon and they are likely to be without £32 million signing Eliaquim Mangala. The French central defender completed his move to City on Monday but Pellegrini feels that he requires further work on the training ground before he can be considered for selection. Joe Hart is expected return ahead of new recruit Willy Caballero in goal but Pellegrini is yet to make a decision on Sergio Aguero, who has suffered a number of muscle injuries in the last 12 months and City are keen to ease him in after his World Cup exertions this summer. ‘I think that always this team needs Sergio Aguero,’ Pellegrini added,’It is also important for him to make a good pre-season. He has had so many months without playing normally. We will see on Sunday.’ Touch and go: Pellegrini is yet to make a decision on whether to start Sergio Aguero against Newcastle .","Yaya Toure will not receive a new contract from Manchester City .

"The mother of a terminally ill 11-year-old with alopecia said her daughter was forced  to remove a pink wig she wore to school as it might encourage others to dye their hair. Ashanti Elliott-Smith suffers from a rare disease which causes her body to age eight times faster than normal and means she is not expected to live past the age of 15. The pupil at Oakmeeds Community College, West Sussex, was  told  to take the wig off by a teacher because it was 'not cold in the school' and she felt so humiliated that she has not wanted return. Scroll down for video . Ashanti Elliott Smith, 11, was forced to remove her bright pink wig by a teacher at her school in West Sussex . Her mother, Phoebe Smith, said: 'She was devastated when they told her to take it off. Her little heart was broken. It's disgusting. It is bright but she should have the right to wear whatever colour hair she wants.' 'She was so proud of her hair but this has put her on a downer. 'When I took her into school three teachers by the office said she looked glamorous and beautiful and said how lovely her wig was. 'But as soon as I turned my back they told her to remove it. It was so embarrassing for her. 'It was the first time she wore the wig into school and she has not been back in since last Thursday. 'It's a pink wig, come on, other children would have understood. I have only got a few years left with her so we want her to live it to the full.' Her mother Phoebe (right) said Ashanti was devastated and did not want to go to school the next day . The incident allegedly occurred at Oakmeeds Community College, West Sussex, last Thursday . Ashanti's rare condition, Hutchinson Gilford Progeria, causes symptoms including stunted growth, hair loss, weight loss, wrinkled skin, stiff joints, and heart disease. The pink wig was donated by friends as Ashanti's family struggles to afford human hair wigs. Ms Smith said: 'There is no rule about terminally ill children not being able to wear wigs. 'She looks a lot different to other children. We get a lot of bad comments about Ashanti and this knocked her right back.' A student, Kate Boyd, commenting on Facebook, said: 'She suffers with alopecia and I think she should be allowed to wear a wig to school if it makes her confident and... makes her feel like anyone else at school.' Colin Taylor, Headteacher Oakmeeds Community College, said: 'Ashanti attended school in a large purple wig which was the first time she had appeared in school wearing a wig or any form of head wear. 'Her Learning Mentor, who meets her every morning and supports her throughout the day along with a Learning Support Assistant, spoke to the Head of Year about it. 'It was agreed by the Director of Inclusion and Head of Year that Ashanti would wear the wig home but not in lessons because it was not cold in the school and she had never wanted to wear one before. Ashanti wanted to wear the wig to school to hide her alopecia, a side effect of Hutchinson Gildford Progeria . Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition characterised by the dramatic, rapid appearance of aging beginning in childhood. Affected children typically look normal at birth and in early infancy, but then grow more slowly than other children and do not gain weight at the expected rate. They develop a characteristic facial appearance including prominent eyes, a thin nose with a beaked tip, thin lips, a small chin, and protruding ears. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome also causes hair loss (alopecia), aged-looking skin, joint abnormalities, and a loss of fat under the skin. The condition does not disrupt intellectual development or the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. It is commonly referred to simply as Progeria, the Greek word for 'prematurely old'. The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene called LMNA, which produces protein. Sufferers commonly die of heart disease at an average age of 13 years old. Ashanti suffers from rare disease Hutchinson Gilford Progeria which causes accelerated ageing . 'We tried to discuss this with Ashanti's mother on Thursday but we were not able to make contact with her. 'We have worked closely with Ashanti's mother to ensure her wishes that her daughter is treated like all other pupils are met. 'Ashanti is a pleasure to have in the school and we believe we have done everything we can to meet both her needs and her mother's requirements during the first half term. 'Ashanti has settled well at Oakmeeds. 'At no time to our knowledge did she request special consideration about head wear but we would fully understand it if Ashanti was to need a hat or indeed a wig when the weather gets cold - even indoors. 'In the past other children have worn wigs following serious illness, but ones that were of a natural look - not large brightly coloured ones. 'We are more than happy to discuss this with Ashanti and her mum when College starts again next week after the half term break.' Her father Albi Elliott , 44,  spent £3,500 charity money intended for Ashanti to go swimming with dolphins . In June this year it emerged that Ashanti's father stole £3,500 of charity money that was intended for her to go swimming with dolphins. She was given the donation by Sussex British Motorcycle Owners Club (SBMOC) in 2010 so she could go for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to America. But her father Albi Elliott, 44, hid the money from the rest of the family and within two months had spent it - on trips to Tesco. Blasting his actions as 'callous and despicably devious', the judge at Chichester Crown Court jailed Elliott for three years.","Ashanti Elliott-Smith, 11, has Progeria disease which accelerates ageing .

"Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism squad has arrested a 33-year-old man accused of links to terrorist activity in Syria. Two addresses in west London linked to the unnamed suspect have also been searched by Metropolitan Police detectives. The man was arrested on suspicion of assisting committing acts of terrorism and on suspicion of funding terrorism. Held: An unnamed 33-year-old man from west London has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences linked to Syria . He is being held at a south London police station, a Met spokesman said. He added: 'The enquiries relate to an investigation into suspected terrorist activity in Syria'. A series of arrests have been made in recent months of suspects either travelling back from war-torn Syria, trying to reach the country from the UK or attempting to send funds for terrorism there. In the  18 months to June this year there were 65 arrests linked to Syria but more than 40 came in 2014. Hundreds of would-be British jihadists have gone to the war-torn Middle Eastern state to join fighting there, and UK authorities recently launched a campaign to encourage Muslim women to inform on relatives they suspect of planning to travel there. The typical route for would-be jihadis is to fly to Turkey and then travel overland to Syria. Terror threat: Men like Aine Davis, pictured centre right, a convicted drug dealer and Muslim-convert believed to be fighting with ISIS forces in Syria, would be arrested on returning to the UK . UK authorities have warned of the dangers of going to the Middle Eastern state, with a controversial campaign aimed at encouraging female relatives of aspiring terrorists to contact police. It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad. People convicted of fighting in Syria could face life in prison and going to an ISIS training camp carries a sentence of 10 years in prison.

"With more than two months to go until Christmas Day and Halloween and Bonfire Night still weeks away, most people won't have even thought festive decorations. But for one hotel in North Yorkshire it seems it is never too early to enter into the Christmas spirit. The St George Hotel in Harrogate has already erected an artificial tree in the bay window at the front of the building - 75 days before Christmas Day. The front of the St George Hotel in Harrogate where a Christmas tree has already appeared in a bay window, circled . The appearance of the tree comes despite it being two months until Christmas and Halloween and Bonfire Night still weeks away . It is also despite the fact it is three weeks until Halloween and a month until Bonfire Night. It was spotted by people passing by the three-star hotel in the spa town with one saying he was 'staggered by what he saw'. Businessman Richard Chew told the Daily Express: 'It looks completely ridiculous. 'Whoever decided to put up the tree should hang their head in shame.' However, one of the hotel managers told Mailonline that the only reason for the Christmas display was to promote their festive party nights. He added that it was placed inside one of the hotel's function rooms and they weren't aware of any negative feedback about the tree. The 12 foot Christmas tree in the Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford, Kent, which had to be taken down after customers complained . It comes after a pub in Kent that put up a Christmas tree back in August were forced to take it down after customers complained. Excited manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up the 12 foot tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford - despite temperatures outside at the time reaching 25C. But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, said he had took down the tree because the plan 'backfired'. The manager said it had all been a 'bit of banter' to promote the fact the restaurant had started taking bookings, but that several customers had made negative comments. The tree baffled diners, who said they were shocked to enter the pub and be greeted by the festive decoration.

"When boxer Shannon Briggs barged in on Wladimir Klitschko's meal, it ended in humiliating fashion - with a glass of water over the head.

"Two Honolulu city councilmen have dropped their proposal to rename a beach after Barack Obama – marking the second time officials in the president's home state have balked on honoring him with his name on a stretch of sand and surf. It was a series of complaints from the public that drove Councilman Stanley Chang and Council Chairman Ernie Martin to withdraw their plan, which would have changed the name of Sandy Beach Park to President Barack Obama Sandy Beach Park. 'We've heard a number of concerns from members of the community,' a diplomatic Chang told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 'Given the facts we received, we don't think it's necessary to move forward,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Paradise: Sandy Beach near Honolulu will not be renamed after Obama, following 'concerns' leveled byHawan . He left his pen and phone on the beach: Obama sampled the waves at Sandy Beach in 2008 . The beach is a popular bodysurfing spot on Oahu's east side. The Associated Press reports that it was a favorite for the president as he grew up. Cameras caught the future Oval Office occupant riding waves there while he vacationed during his first presidential campaign in 2008. In remembrance of that event, the city council approved funding this year for a 'plaque dedicated to President Barack Obama's love of bodysurfing at Sandy Beach Park.' But on the issue of renaming the entire site, Martin said in a statement that he heard concerns from the community about the historic nature of the beach and cultural sensitivities associated with renaming age-old locations that date back centuries. But he added that there may be other public facilities more appropriate to honor the president. It's not clear whether substituting one of them would kill the $500,000 in renovation and beautification funding slated to accompany a beach name-change. Hawaiians were split this week in interviews with KHON-TV2. 'I don’t think it’s fair because, personally, he’s done nothing for our beach over here,' Waimanalo resident Kanaloa Kane told the TV station. 'Maybe he did grow up here, but as a local, I've been surfing here for 10 years easy and I don’t think it’s fair.' But Beth Amann, another frequent Sandy Beach visitor, thought the money would help keep the beach spiffy. 'I think it’s definitely going to help for sure,' she said. 'That way, they’re going to keep things more picked up probably, more improvements' So far Obama's name hasn't been applied to any public buildings, sites or facilities in the state of Hawaii. Current law prohibits renaming such places for anyone who is still alive. In 2009 the council debated a bill that would have added a loophole for 'a president of the United States born in Hawaii.' Councilmen and women who wanted to honor other famous Hawaiians shot it down, however, complaining that it was too narrow. The idea back then was to rename Aina Moana Beach Park, which locals refer to as Magic Island. The new name would have been President Barack Obama Beach Park at Magic Island. Swamped, but not by Republicans in Congress: Obama won't see his name on the beach's main sign, but a plaque already commemorates his love of bodysurfing there . Todd Apo, who was chairman of the Honolulu City Council in 2009, told Travel Weekly then that his constituents would rather have named the park after then-Sen. Daniel Inouye. 'I think everyone appreciates the important connection between our current president and our state,' Apo said. 'But people have raised the point that someone like Senator Inouye has done a huge amount for our state over his extensive term in office, yet there's no exception for him. So where do you draw the line?' Some politicians on the panel complained that no one who spoke for the Native Hawaiian community had been consulted. The name Aina Moana means 'land of the sea' in Hawaii's native language. Activists often object to measures that dilute the presence of native names, artwork and customs in the state, which joined the U.S. only 55 years ago. None of the beach name-wrangling in Hawaii is related, however, to a momentary renaming of a famous French beach for the U.S. president in 2009 by then-UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. During a remembrance ceremony marking the 65th anniversary of the D-Day invasion at Normandy, Brown referred to Omaha Beach as 'Obama Beach.'","Nothing in Hawaii is named after the president, who was born there in 1961 .

"Bereaved pet owners have been left devastated after Australian insurance provider Petplan has refused to cancel their policies following the death of their beloved animals. Australia's second largest pet insurance provider, Petplan, which is backed by Allianz, has come under fire from one of Australia's leading consumer sites Choice. An investigation by Choice has found that the insurance firm has been neglecting grief-stricken pet owners, by forcing them to continue paying their insurance premiums for up to 12 -months following the death of their pets. Bereaved pet owners have been left devastated after Australian insurance provider Petplan has refused to cancel their policies following the death of their beloved animals . According to Choice Head of Media, Tim Godfrey, Petplan needs to stop 'profiting from pet owners' grief'. 'We are calling on Petplan to change its policy which puts profit ahead of common sense and compassion' he said. 'We continue to receive complaints from distraught pet owners who have been forced to pay premiums for the remainder of their policy period, even in cases where they made a claim but their pet passed away.' Lochan and Skye both passed away within three-months of each other. Their owners are being forced to pay their premiums until March 2015 . 'Your family wouldn't expect to pay your health insurance premiums if you passed away so why should pet owners be forced to pay premiums after the death of the family pet?' Petplan's policy is currently locked tight, with the wording of their clause causing confusion for customers who claim they were never alerted to the particular section. 'In the event that you cancel the policy for whatever reason after having made a claim, no premium refunds are payable and the remaining premium for that period of Insurance must be paid.' Annandale residents Selvi and Ross Macleod  told Daily Mail Australia that they were 'vulnerable following the passing of their two cherished Border Collie dogs and Petplan have given them no sympathy since. The couple owned their dog Skye since he was 6-months-old and he was 9-and-a-half when he died in October. They were also caring for Lochan since he was 6-weeks-old and he was thirteen when he passed away in June. Annandale residents Selvi and Ross Macleod told Daily Mail Australia that they were 'vulnerable following the passing of their two cherished Border Collie dogs and Petplan have given them no sympathy since . Now they have been told by Petplan that they must continue paying their insurance premiums until March 2015 for both Skye and Lochan, even though neither of their deceased dogs will ever need to make another claim. Mr Macleod revealed that the couple are paying $100-a-month in premiums to the insurance firm for both dogs and expressed his dismay at the firm's practices. 'When they both died very close to each other, we felt quite vulnerable,' he said. 'We notified the insurance company and when we contacted them by phone they said 'according to the contract you have to keep paying until the end of the first year',' Cookie the British Bulldog was 7-years-old when she passed away in August, however her grieving owner is still paying just over $78 a month for her insurance policy . He said that Petplan refused to be flexible, informing them that their only option was to continue paying their insurance premiums until the end of their contract. The couple were 'pretty shaken' at first but decided to contact Choice as they were 'disgusted' at their insurance provider's reaction. Choice apparently have tried on multiple occasions to contact Petplan, but to no avail. Selvi Macleod said the couple had decided to buy pet insurance, as both their dogs were getting older and they were advised to get some cover by their vet. She said they did not do much research into the company and if they were to do it all over again they would definitely not pick Petplan. 'It's so underhanded,' she said. Cookie's owner has been informed by Petplan that she must continue paying her premiums until Cookie's policy expires at the end of December 2014. Cookie is pictured here with Ms Hooker's son Tyson . 'You're already grieving for your pet and you don't know what other circumstances are happening in people's lives,' She said it was outrageous that the same company representative was never available to speak to customers directly on the phone. 'It's all verbal, you don't get any written acknowledgement,' she said. 'Even when you try to call, you're never speaking to the same person, it's always someone else,' 'When they're actually selling, they allocate someone to you,' hoice has launched a campaign to put pressure on Petplan to change its policy . 'You're basically just a number,' she said. Monika Hooker is another disgruntled Petplan customer who has also had the heartache of dealing with the insurance company following her beloved pet dog Cookie's death. The British Bulldog was 7-years-old when she passed away in August, however her grieving owner is still paying just over $78 a month for her insurance policy. Ms Hooker has been informed by Petplan that she must continue paying her premiums until Cookie's policy expires at the end of December 2014. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Hooker said 'no one reads the fine print' when you take out an insurance policy and 'you expect it to be common sense'. 'With health insurance, you don’t have to keep paying,' she said. 'If you make a claim, it doesn't mean you’re stuck with them for the whole year, you can change whenever you want to,' Ms Hooker said. Ms Hooker has told  Petplan that she will be cancelling her remaining two dogs' policies once their contract comes to an end. 'It's not right, they're not covering her anymore, there’ s noway they're not going to be paying money out,' she said. 'It’s not common sense, it’s unfair.' Choice has launched a campaign to put pressure on Petplan to change its policy and amend clause nine from page 15 of the product disclosure statement, to read: . 'In the event that you cancel the Policy for whatever reason (other than the death of your Pet) after having made a claim, no premium refunds are payable and the remaining premium for that Period of Insurance must be paid.' The amended policy would  follows the decision earlier this year by Australia's largest pet insurer, Petsure, to end the cruel practice. According to Choice's  Tim Godfrey, by simply adding the words 'other than the death of your Pet'  Petplan would align its product disclosure statement with  Petsure and alleviate a great deal of needless suffering among grieving pet owners. 'When it comes to pet insurance clearly not all insurers are the same so it pays to do your research before committing to a pet insurance policy,' says Mr Godfrey. 'It's also important to remember to choose your pet insurer wisely because once you have opted for a pet insurance provider, it is usually for the duration of the pet's life.' 'We have found there is little scope for switching when it comes to pet insurance policies as any conditions your pet suffered from before the start of the new policy will be excluded, leading to more costly cover,' he continued.

"Amir Khan has revealed he would relish a fight against Kell Brook in the UK, following the latter's IBF welterweight world title triumph on Saturday night. Unbeaten fighter Brook beat deposed champion Shawn Porter by a majority decision in Los Angeles - with the judges scoring the bout 117-111 and 116-112 in his favour while the other official classed it as a draw on 114-114 points apiece. The Sheffield boxer's success in America has led to speculation that a domestic super-fight with Khan could next be on the cards for the pair.

Let's get ready to rumble: Khan (centre) and Brook haven't seen eye-to-eye in the past . The duo have publicly revealed in the past that they don't seen eye-to-eye and the opportunity to fight Brook is something Khan would look forward to in Britain. 'I think it definitely can happen, we'll just leave it to the teams now to negotiate and talk about what's going to happen,' Khan told BBC Radio 5 Live when asked if he would fight Brook. 'I'm contracted to Golden Boy Promotions and Al Haymon, who's my advisor, so I'm just going to let them takeover and if the fight can happen - let's make it. 'I'm up for it and it's definitely a fight the British crowd would want to see. Bigger goals: Brook (left) said Khan 'can get in the queue to fight' him after defeating Porter . Class above: Khan (left) won his last bout against Luis Collazo (right) in May . 'Having the fight in the UK would be amazing. I'd like it somewhere such as Wembley Stadium which I think would be a quick sell out. 'It's a fight that would have the UK fans excited, it's something they've been talking about for a long time and I always said Kell would have to prove himself first before he can fight me. 'Now he's done that by beating Porter and winning a world title, but then you can't disrespect me because I've been on the world title stage for a long time and he has to remember that. 'He's an all-around good fighter, but the way to beat Kell is to be in control, push him back, make him think and hit the angles. Weaknesses: Khan believes Brook's (left) body is a weak spot of the Sheffield fighter . 'I think he has a weak body as well, at times he got caught with a shot and he was hurt. He's a big puncher but by making him move you can catch him then and he can't sit on his punches. After his victory against Porter, Brook said Khan 'can get in the queue' as the 28-year-old lines up mega fights against the ilk of Floyd Mayweather. The pound-for-pound king Mayweather has long been a potential opponent of Khan's and the Bolton boxer believes Brook has to get past him first before dreaming at a shot against the 37-year-old. 'If he thinks about what he's said, I've been in eight world title fights winning two world titles as well unifying world titles. This is only his first world title so he's got a long way to go yet before he can get past me,' Khan added. Too good: Floyd Mayweather (left) is widely regarded as the pound-for-pound boxing king . 'I've had one fight at this weight division and now we're at the same weight - our fight can happen. 'Kell has to have a couple of more big fights before he can think about that. 'He's only just got his one world title and I'm sure he'll want to defend it a few times before having a super-fight with the likes of myself, Mayweather or [Manny] Pacquiao.

Of course, Suarez has since moved away from Anfield - sealing a £75million deal with Barcelona - but Liverpool fans across the world previously flocked to have the Uruguayan on their replica kit.

Unsurprisingly, Wayne Rooney is consistently in the top 10 and that was no different in the last campaign. The continued sale of 'Rooney 10' shirts goes some way to explaining why United have always been so desperate to keep the striker and only heightens the perception that the club's global brand is as important as results. Louis van Gaal will be hoping new signing Ander Herrera makes enough of a mark to nestle in on this list next year, but performances don't always dictate who finishes where on this particular list. A case in point is Shinji Kagawa, whose name has shifted loads of United shirts since his move from Dortmund - largely because of the Japan midfielder's vast appeal in Asia.

"Aluminium builds up in the brain causing contamination that leads to Alzheimer's, Professor Chris Exley claims . Aluminium found in food, cosmetics and medicines could be poisoning our brains and causing Alzheimer’s disease, a professor has claimed. Aluminium builds up in the brain, eventually causing contamination that may cause Alzheimer’s disease, Professor Christopher Exley, of Keele University has argued. The metal compound is found in  most processed foods, tea, wine, fizzy drinks, cosmetics and drugs like aspirin. Professor Exley said the very fact that studies have revealed aluminium deposits in the brain should serve as a warning that we are being contaminated. He said: ‘The presence of aluminium in the human brain should be a red flag alerting us all to the potential dangers of the aluminium age. ‘We are all accumulating a known neurotoxin in our brain from our conception to our death. ‘Why do we treat this inevitability with almost total complacency?’ His latest report builds on his previous work, in which he suggested there was a link between the aluminium found in deodorants and cancer. Aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust, and is naturally found in food because plants absorb it from water and the soil. While 50 years ago we may have ingested small amounts of aluminium from vegetables and the pots they were cooked in, today it is added to almost everything we consume. Aluminium sulphate is added to water to make it more clear, and it is added to cakes and biscuits as a raising agent. It is also found in most processed foods, food colouring, tea, cocoa, malt drinks, wines and fizzy drinks. Aluminium is now found in almost everything we eat and drink, from bread and cakes, to drinks, cosmetics like toothpaste, talcs and suncream and drugs like aspirin and antacids . Cosmetics, talcs, toothpaste, suncream and antiperspirants contain aluminium, as well as drugs such as aspirin, antacids and vaccines. The body excretes aluminium, but if more is ingested than the body can excrete, it is deposited in the bone, brain, liver, heart, spleen, and muscle. Professor Exley argues the human brain is both ‘a target and a sink for aluminium’ when it enters the body. Carole Cross, 59, died in 2004 from a rare and aggressive form of Alzheimer’s disease usually associated with much older people suffering from the condition. She had been living in the Camelford area of north Cornwall in July 1988 when the poisoning occurred. She was one of 20,000 customers affected when a relief lorry driver mistakenly added 20,000 tons of aluminium sulphate to the drinking water at the Lowermoor treatment works. Her husband, Dr Doug Cross, believes her exposure to high levels of aluminium during the incident caused her death and at her inquest a coroner ruled there was 'a very real possibility' this was the case. At some point, the aluminium accumulated in the brain will reach a ‘toxic threshold’ and the affected area of the brain will not be able to cope, he said. If the same part of the brain is suffering from other conditions, then reacting to the presence of aluminium will make the condition worse, he added. He concluded that aluminium could fuel early onset on Alzheimer’s, a condition affecting memory, and make the disease worse. He said: ‘In this way aluminium may cause a particular condition to be more aggressive and perhaps to have an earlier onset - such occurrences have already been shown in Alzheimer’s disease related to environmental and occupational exposure to aluminium.’ Reducing exposure to aluminium and removing it from the body could prevent Alzheimer’s disease, and further tests should be carried out to test the link, he concluded. His report was published in the journal Frontiers in Neurology.","Professor Chris Exley argues aluminium posioning could cause Alzheimer's .

When contacted by MailOnline, Ji’s model agency Premiere said: ‘She is not too thin. We will not be making further comment'. Comments were mixed after Stella changed the shot, which she admits was 'misleading' One comment on the picture of Malaika says: 'Much better, but still incredibly disappointed in your first choice of model. Please *think* next time', while another berates 'Considering what a huge influence stella is on young people and as the mother of a young girl I'm appalled at the previous 'model' pic.' On Twitter one girl says: 'Let's use anorexia to promote my clothes as a publicity stunt', but then admits 'I do like that top though.' The British designer has also come under fire this week for 'weird' comments about her latest collection after saying strong women 'are not terribly attractive' McCartney was backstage after showcasing her spring/summer 2015 collection when she said: ‘Strength on its own in a woman is quite aggressive and not terribly attractive all the time. ‘This collection is really celebrating the gentle side.’ Some of McCartney's (left) fans began a campaign to 'unfollow Stella' on Instagram forcing the designer to remove the image and issue an apology . She drew criticism from feminists after she revealed her latest collection ‘was celebrating the softness of a woman, and her fragility. Strength on its own in a woman is quite aggressive and not terribly attractive at times’.

"The military leader of the pro-Russian separatist movement in Ukraine has stepped down in a shock resignation, it has emerged. Igor Girkin - known as Strelkov - has headed up the military faction since the conflict broke out last year. His is the third resignation of rebel leaders in the past week. It comes as Vladimir Putin revealed he plans to equip the former Red Army with secret weapons which the West does not possess in a gargantuan £335 billion defence spending programme. Shock resignation: Military head Igor Strelkov has become the third rebel leader to step down in the past week . Movement: Alexander Borodai (left) confirmed the move days after he handed over to Alexander Zakharchenko . The move will likely impact the damage to Russia's relations with the West, which have suffered the worst breakdown since the end of the Cold War. Mr Strelkov's departure was confirmed by Alexander Borodai, the former premier of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic . But he denied claims Mr Strelkov had been wounded, and gave no reason for the move. In the past seven days, Mr Borodai has also stepped aside - handing over to Alexander Zakharchenko. The rebel leader in Luhansk, Valery Bolotov has 'temporarily' given his role to defence minister Igor Plotnitskiy. Addressing the latest resignation, Mr Borodai told local media: 'You probably already know that he, like myself, has left his post. Plans: Vladimir Putin plans to plug the former Red Army with £335 billion, he has revealed, by arming them with secret weapons which the West does not possess as tensions with the West intensify . Chopper: A Russian attack helicopter was also seen patrolling the skies in a distant province of Russia today . On the march: Russian tanks also showed their power in Sergyevsky at the opposite end of the country . 'The Donetsk People's Republic already has a new defence minister.' 'This is about the most modern arms, offensive and defensive systems that other armies do not have so far,' he told lawmakers. 'Some things are already well-known in the field of strategic offensive weapons - I mean nuclear deterrent forces. 'There are some things that we are not talking about yet, but let's say, the time will come.' Putin said without revealing details that he wanted to 'cheer up' his Western 'partners' with the new weapons and 'bringing them to life'. 'This is not militarization, but a very serious additional impulse to the development of the defence industry,' he claimed in a speech in Crimea, annexed in March after a major army operation. Rival aid: The Russian convoy, left, has come to a stop not far from the Ukrainian border, while the government's own trucks, right, have started rolling towardss Luganks from Kiev and other cities . Powering ahead: This morning the convoy was 280 miles from the Ukrainian border, set to arrive later today . He also warned of the danger of Pakistan developing medium range nuclear arms. 'The development of this class of weapon in Pakistan can only cause us certain alarm, because - let's be frank - we understand that this is a country with a complex political regime,' he said. He was concerned by 'what happens there, how the situation will evolve, and in whose hands these weapons will end up - especially as this is a nuclear power. 'And there are questions about other countries, many of them, while we have been restricting ourselves. Of course, we will think about this and analyse it.' Putin has frequently expressed worries about installations linked to a US missile shield in eastern Europe.","Igor Strelkov has become third rebel leader to resign in one week .

"Michael Oliver is an excellent referee but still inexperienced at the very top level dealing with world-class players — and he met one at Turf Moor in Diego Costa. The Chelsea forward was sharp to intercept a backpass and knock the ball past Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal.

"One year ago to this very day, Darren Fletcher lay in a hospital bed with an intravenous drip connected to his arm. He was so heavily sedated following surgery that he could barely open his eyes to watch the television in front of him. On the screen, Scotland were giving England a run for their money at Wembley. It was a fixture he had always dreamed of playing in. Fletcher’s future as a footballer was hanging in the balance. The decision to undergo a series of operations had been taken in an attempt to finally quell the suffering caused by chronic ulcerative colitis. Suffering that had severely disrupted three years of his career. Scroll down for videos... Reversal of fortune: Darren Fletcher has been named Manchester United vice captain behind Wayne Rooney . This morning, the picture surrounding Fletcher is very different. As another Barclays Premier League season prepares to dawn, the 30-year-old is getting used to his new role as vice-captain of Manchester United. Talk of comebacks and courage is all too readily bandied around in the sporting world, but Fletcher’s own recovery has been genuinely remarkable. Forget any notion that his appointment as Wayne Rooney’s back-up is rooted in sentiment. That is hardly Louis van Gaal’s style. Rather, this is a case of Fletcher proving through his unstinting efforts over pre-season that he has a real future within the plans of the Dutch taskmaster. Fletcher scored in Tuesday’s 2-1 friendly win over Valencia before expressing sincere delight about his new status within the squad. ‘It’s a very proud moment for me and my family,’ he said. ‘Wayne and I have always worked well together and will continue to work closely together in our new roles. I would like to thank the manager for putting his trust in me.’ Guess who's back! Darren Fletcher celebrates scoring against Valencia in United's last pre-season game . VIDEO Rooney to lead Manchester United . That is the key issue here. Van Gaal has clearly liked what he has seen from Fletcher in terms of performance and personality. ‘A natural leader,’ was the 63-year-old’s assessment. Those who have followed Fletcher’s struggles are almost as thrilled as the man himself about this confirmation of his continued worth to one of the world’s biggest clubs. Former United favourite Lou Macari has been close to the situation via his work for the in-house television station. ‘Getting back in and around the Manchester United first team is the real prize for Darren,’ insisted Macari. ‘Because at one stage that looked a long shot. ‘Being the type of character he is, he has battled his way through it. He is now back playing and will be delighted to be vice-captain. That, though, is not the priority. The priority was to get back and into contention for the first team. ‘Time doesn’t wait for you when you are out for that length of time. Other people come along and try to take your place. It is a real struggle to get back into the team but Darren has met it head-on. Comeback kid: Darren Fletcher acknowledges the United fans after returning to the team last season . United: Darren Fletcher teamed up with ex-rugby star Lewis Moody to raise awareness about his condition . ‘The new manager clearly believes there is still a good, long future for him. Everyone was under pressure when van Gaal came in. Everyone was tested. ‘But Darren was perhaps under more pressure because he knew he had lost a year or more from football. ‘When he returned at the back end of last year, he was alright but he wasn’t the Darren we knew before. ‘Gradually, though, with a bit more fitness under his belt he has restored that ability to get around the pitch. ‘I counted the other day that there are 13 or 14 players looking to get into United’s midfield. That is some competition, but he has come through and got a place at the start of the season. It’s remarkable stuff.’ As you might suspect, Macari has boundless admiration for the relentless determination Fletcher has shown over the past few years. Flying high: Darren Fletcher was a regular member of the United team under former manager Alex Ferguson . Dutch of class: New manager Louis van Gaal has impressed with the Scotsman since taking over . ‘Unless you have that illness then I don’t think you can appreciate the impact of it. It’s not a broken leg or a hamstring tear, this almost brought Darren’s life to a standstill. ‘But he fought back with everything he had and anything he gets from here on is thoroughly deserved. ‘A lot of players might not even have considered trying to fight back. At Darren’s age, it’s fair to say these guys are well and truly financially secure. ‘It is all credit to him that he wanted so badly to get back on the pitch. Not to earn a new contract or more money – but to play football at the top level. ‘Other players might not have been able to handle what Darren has been through and called it a day. There was no chance of that with Darren.’ The role as one of van Gaal’s dressing room lieutenants should come easily to Fletcher. A United man to his core, he could be a valuable sounding board for the Dutchman as he seeks to revive the club following the turmoil of David Moyes’ brief and ill-fated reign. ‘Darren has been at the club with Sir Alex (Ferguson) for such a long time and knows what is expected,’ said Macari. ‘We are not just talking about performances on the pitch but about conducting yourself in the right way. About being a true professional. ‘That background has been so important to Darren. Without his way of thinking, this comeback may not have happened.’ Fletcher’s continued progress is also a significant boon to Gordon Strachan as Scotland prepare to begin their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against world champions Germany in Dortmund next month. Hot Scot: The midfielder warms up in Warsaw ahead of his first game for Scotland under Gordon Strachan . Spot on: Darren Fletcher takes a penalty for Scotland in a Euro quualifying game against Lithuania in 2011 . The midfielder made his first appearance under Strachan as a second-half substitute during the 1-0 friendly win over Poland in March. Now, though, it seems the national side may be able to call upon a player who has moved far closer to his previous capabilities. ‘Without a doubt, having a fit and on-form Darren Fletcher would be a huge boost for Scotland,’ insisted Macari. ‘Without being disrespectful to anyone else, we don’t have a large number of top players in Darren’s mould. He has proved himself over the years. ‘Hopefully, he can keep progressing and play a real part for the national team in this next campaign. A Scotland with Darren Fletcher is certainly better than one without him.’ CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"Karl Pierson (pictured) killed a classmate before killing himself in Denver last year . A student who killed a classmate before taking his own life at a suburban Denver high school last year showed a friend photos of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting and thought one of the images was 'funny in a crude way,' according to documents released Thursday. Karl Pierson, 18, also showed the friend pictures of the shotgun he later used in the December 13 attack at Arapahoe High School, according to investigators' applications for search warrants. The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office released the records to The Associated Press as part of an open-records request. The documents show detectives investigated tips that other students knew of Pierson's plan, but police have said they concluded no one else was aware of it. Authorities believe Pierson was targeting his debate coach when he entered the school with a shotgun, machete, homemade bombs and 125 rounds of ammunition. Investigators said he shot and killed 17-year-old Claire Davis before turning the gun on himself in the school library as security officers closed in. The coach escaped unharmed. The documents show Pierson had written numbers on his arm corresponding to classrooms and the message, in Latin, 'The die has been cast.' Two school security guards told investigators they saw Pierson looking at pictures of guns and mass shootings on his computer six weeks before the shooting. And police found a book about the Columbine High School attack when they searched his mother's home. Scroll down for video . Arapahoe County, Colo., Sheriff Dave Walcher talks during a news conference last week to release new details from a lengthy investigation into the deadly shooting at Arapahoe High School .

In closing the case last week, Sheriff Dave Walcher said school officials did not suspend Pierson in September and allowed him to return to class after he threatened to kill the coach, who had recently demoted him as captain of the team. Pierson's mother kept him out of school three days. Administrators did not deem him a danger, even though the coach told them he was so fearful he considered resigning. A school resource officer who is also a deputy made a report of the threat but took no further action.","Karl Pierson, 18, killed Claire Davis, 17, at a Denver high school last year .

"Melbourne's Etihad Stadium is no stranger to huge crowds but on Saturday, there wasn't a single AFL fan in sight. The venue played host to thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, who were attending a three-day holy conference called the International Convention. Packing out the Docklands arena, more than 65,000 people from 60 countries attended the largest gathering of its kind in Australia. Around 500 people were baptised during Saturday morning’s session, while others scheduled themselves in preacher training workshops, forums and sermons. The event will continue through the weekend, and organisers are expecting a record breaking 70,000 delegates by Sunday. The event is open to hundreds of different ethnic and language backgrounds from all around the world. Highlights will include two theatrical productions and a mass baptism as well as talks on how to reduce anxiety and the connection between family values and Jesus' teachings. One reddit user, named speedyleedy took to the page to describe their reaction from visitors in Melbourne. 'I got asked for some directions by some American JWs yesterday, I started explaining and saw their faces, completely lost,' speedyleedy wrote. 'I just walked them there and had a quick chat. Found out that everyone had been really welcoming to them and a lot of randoms (not JWs) have really helped them enjoy their trip to Melbourne. 'I explained some of my limited history of Melbourne and they were really greatful. Lovely bunch of people. 10/10 - would recommend.'

"Diego Costa was lucky not to be seriously injured in Chelsea's latest pre season outing, just managing to get out of the way of a terrible two-footed tackle from Fenerbahce defender Bruno Alves. It might have been a friendly but the uncompromising Portuguese centre back seemed to be taking it seriously - diving in for a dangerous challenge on Chelsea's £32million forward. Combative Costa was right in the 32-year-old's face immediately after to let him know what he thought of the foul, but the guilty party was let off by the referee with just a yellow card.

Flying: Costa leaps to try to avoid Alves and luckily escaped any injury - it could have been serious . Oops: It looks as if Alves knows exactly what he has done wrong as he prepares to appeal to the referee . Aggression: Costa makes it clear what he thinks of Alves after his terrible tackle in Istanbul . The summer signing from Atletico Madrid had earlier put the Blues ahead, escaping four defenders to score a brilliant goal to set up a 2-0 win - but Alves was determined to make sure he wouldn't be doing the same thing again. With the Fenerbahce centre back left as the last man on a Chelsea counter attack, Costa pushed the ball slightly too far forward and Alves saw his opportunity to take it before sending his man tumbling in a tackle that could have broken his leg if it was a split second earlier. With just Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres as backup, Chelsea are pinning their title hopes on the Spain striker - and will be relieved to see him escape from Istanbul unharmed.

"Jose Mourinho insists he will have to act coldly when he announces to either Petr Cech or Thibaut Courtois that they will not be his first-choice goalkeeper for this season on Sunday. The Chelsea manager believes he has two of the three best goalkeepers in the world at his disposal but will let one of them know this weekend that they will not be his No 1. And he admits that whoever he leaves out will be considering their future at the club. Potential exit? Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admits Petr Cech or Thibaut Courtois could leave the club . Decisions:  Mourinho admits he still hasn't chosen who will be in goal for Chelsea's trip to Burnley . Stalwart: Petr Cech has been Chelsea's No 1 goalkeeper since joining the club in 2004 . Rising star: Thibaut Courtois is challenging Cech for the goalkeeper spot this season . 'The best way for me to work is to think pragmatically, in a cold way, forget a little bit try to hide the emotions around these situations and decide what I think is the best for the team,' he said at the Blues' press conference on Friday. 'I don't tell you because they don't know. The team doest know. They will know at the same time all of them. 'My opinion with all the respect to fantastic goalkeepers around the world, I think Chelsea has two of the three best goalkeepers in the world. 'This is something unique. Is it a problem for me? A great problem. They are both fantastic goalkeepers. It's a problem every manager in every club would like to have.' Champion: Courtois (centre) won La Liga with Atletico Madrid last season . Cech has been Chelsea's No 1 since joining the club in 2004, but faces fierce competition from rising star Courtois who enjoyed a successful three years out on loan at Atletico Madrid - which culminated in winning La Liga last season. 'If Petr [Cech] plays [Thibaut] Courtois can think about leaving, or visa versa,' Mourinho added. 'In this moment they are working well and hard and we are so happy to have them both. 'I prefer to analyse this in that perspective. During the season if one is definitely my first choice I have to support and stimulate the other one. 'I can't have one of these incredible goalkeepers on the bench three or four months waiting for a Capital One Cup game.

The Portuguese has made four signings this summer that he believes can propel the Stamford Bridge outfit towards the title this season. The West London outfit finished third last season in the Premier League and the competition of England's top flight is something Mourinho thinks is unparalleled around Europe. 'Last season we did not feel as a title contender but we finished very close to the title. We were not feeling one of the top favourites for the Champions League and we played the semi-final. We did well,' he added. 'This season we bought some key players after our analysis of last season and our squad. We believe. More than believe we are already feeling that these new players brought the squad and the team into another dimension. 'I imagine the words you want to hear from me and the words I can say because I can feel and I will think anybody can criticise me because of that, yes we are title contenders. If you expect me to say we're going to win the Premier League I can't say that. 'I have to respect this competition. It is of the country championships, the only one which has more than two title contenders. The only country, with five or six for sure it's the only one. 'I have to respect the opponents and the efforts of the other clubs to improve their top teams.

Blue is the colour: Cesc Fabregas moved to Stamford Bridge in a £30million move from Barcelona . In his first season back in charge of Chelsea last term, Mourinho faced two charges of improper conduct by the Football Association. The 51-year-old was sent off in the Blues' 1-0 defeat Aston Villa in March which preceeded an £8,000 fine in October for protesting to referee Anthony Taylor about time-wasting during his team’s 4-1 win against Cardiff City in October. Despite his issues with the FA, Mourinho lays his disciplinary troubles with England's footballing governing body. 'It's easier to say they had a run-in with me. You know me for a long time,' he said. 'You can analyse the way I am and approach things. You can see some differences from 10, nine, eight years ago, they had a run-in with me not me with them. Ask them. Or the only thing I can say is I hope they don't have a run with me.'

"Is there another fixture in the football calendar that encapsulates the two ends of the Premier League spectrum better than Burnley versus Chelsea? West London chic meets old Lancashire grit. This time last year, Burnley were playing Yeovil Town at a half-empty Turf Moor. Sean Dyche’s team were among the favourites for relegation from the Championship and their supporters could never have dreamed what lay ahead. On Monday night, the old place will be packed to the rafters in front of a global television audience for the visit of Jose Mourinho’s multi-millionaires. VIDEO Scroll down to see Dramatic Jose Mourinho: Yes, we are title contenders! Expensive acquisition: Chelsea's new star man Diego Costa arrived for £32m this summer . Contrast: One man who will mark Costa, Michael Duff (left), cost just £30,000 and Burnley's main striker Danny Ings (right), the man who fired them to promotion, cost just £900,000 . It has inevitably drawn comparisons with Burnley’s only other appearance in the Premier League when the Clarets shocked Manchester United 1-0 in their home opener under the floodlights at Turf Moor five years ago. The stands literally shook when Robbie Blake hammered home the winner that night, and it will be no different if Dyche’s team pull off another shock against Chelsea. On paper, the chances of that look slim but this is the Premier League after all. The difference in value between the two probable starting line-ups is quite staggering; more than £200million spent by Chelsea compared to the £5m it has cost to assemble this Burnley team; a multi-national side made up of World Cup and Champions League winners against a bunch of free signings, Premier League journeymen and cast-offs from the big clubs brought together by the inspirational Dyche; Mourinho against the man they call The Ginger Mourinho. No wonder Dyche’s players have been seeing a sports psychologist to prepare them for the mental battle of staying up. Mourinho: Jose will know that he has to deliver this season after a trophy-less campaign last time out . Ginger Mourinho: Whilst Sean Dyche has already surpassed expectations by reaching the Premier League . BURNLEY - £5.080m . Tom Heaton (free); Kieran Trippier (£450,000), Jason Shackell (£1.1m), Michael Duff (£30,000), Ben Mee (£600,000); Scott Arfield (free), Dean Marney (£500,000), David Jones (free), Matt Taylor (free); Danny Ings (£900,000), Lukas Jutkiewicz (£1.5m). CHELSEA - £206.6m . Thibaut Courtois (£7.8m); Branislav Ivanovic (£9m), Gary Cahill (£7m), John Terry (academy), Filipe Luis (£16m); Nemanja Matic (£21m), Ramires (£19.8m); Willian (£32m), Cesc Fabregas (£30m), Eden Hazard (£32m); Diego Costa (£32m). A few of them have extensive Premier League experience such as David Jones, Dean Marney, Matt Taylor and new signing Stephen Ward. Others have played briefly in the top-flight but some will never have come up against the type of opposition they face on Monday. Nothing sums up the gulf in resources better than the contest between Burnley’s veteran defender Michael Duff and Chelsea’s new signing Diego Costa. Duff, 36, has played in all top six tiers of English football and is celebrating 10 years at Turf Moor after joining the Clarets in 2004 from Cheltenham for £30,000. Chelsea paid 1,067 times more than that to buy Costa, 25, from Atletico Madrid for £32m following his appearance for Spain at the World Cup. Mourinho also brought in Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis as part of a £78m summer transfer spend, while Dyche’s biggest extravagance was the £1.5m he paid Middlesbrough for striker Lukas Jutkiewicz. Big finish: Robbie Blake scores the winner against Man Utd on Burnley's return to the top flight five years ago . Rocking and rolling: He celebrates securing the famous victory in front of a packed house at Turf Moor . Age: 25. Position: Striker . Signed: from Atletico Madrid, 2014, £32m . Salary: £180,000 a week . Clubs: Braga, Penafiel (loan), Atlético Madrid, Braga (loan), Celta (loan), Albacete (loan), Valladolid, Atlético, Rayo Vallecano (loan), Chelsea . International caps: 2 for Brazil, 4 for Spain . Age: 36 . Position: Centre half . Salary: £10,000 a week (approx) Signed: from Cheltenham, 2004, £30,000 . Clubs: Cheltenham Town, Cirencester Town (loan), Burnley . International caps: 24 for Northern Ireland . Burnley captain Jason Shackell, who will partner Duff in central defence against Costa, has no doubt the veteran Northern Irishman is up to the challenge. ‘Duffo encapsulates everything about the team,’ said Shackell, who also had a brief spell in the Premier League with Norwich. ‘He’s really worked his way up and he deserves his opportunity. ‘We had the best defensive record last year and that’s an incredible achievement, especially in your mid-30s. There’s no reason why it should stop now. He’s fitter than some players I’ve seen who are 10 years his junior. I have every confidence he’s going to do great. ‘Costa is obviously a fantastic player. For Chelsea to spend that kind of money on him he’s got to be a great player, and I’m sure he’ll light up the Premier League at some stage this year. ‘We’re really looking forward to testing ourselves against him. You have to step up in all areas of your game. We’re playing against some of the best players and I think the biggest thing for me when I played in there previously was if you make a mistake you’re going to get punished. Pricey: Cesc Fabregas has been another expensive arrival for Chelsea this summer . Frugal: Whilst goalkeeper Matt Gilks is one of a number of players to arrive on a free at Turf Moore . ‘But it’s the same as last year and we were underdogs then. It brings a certain freedom and freedom can be a powerful thing. With the pressure off there’s no weight on our shoulders. We can go out there and give everything and see what happens.’ Duff is the only survivor from the last Burnley side to play Chelsea at Turf Moor in January 2010. John Terry’s 82nd-minute header proved decisive in a 2-1 win that day, and Terry, Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic (who played in his first spell at Stamford Bridge) will be back on Monday night. Nothing much has changed in the meantime. Chelsea are still among the leading title contenders and Burnley are still favourites for relegation – but the Premier League can still throw up a big surprise.","Burnley vs Chelsea encapsulates two ends of the Premier League spectrum .

"This is officially my start to the season. Back to work, picking my 10 players for Sportsmail... and then watching to see how they fare through the campaign. Some of these picks are obvious because they are big-money buys but I hope you will agree there are some surprise names, too. There isn’t a Manchester City player but that’s because there is no mystery about their squad. Leave a comment below and let me know your players to watch. Enjoy the season! No 1: Alexis Sanchez . Arsenal fans might tell you they didn’t expect to see another fast winger type coming in but you can’t ignore the chance to sign the electrifying Chilean. Sanchez is the most exciting signing of the summer so far and I hope he settles quickly. He played wide for Barcelona but still has a very good goal return (39 goals in 88 league games). When you play with Lionel Messi, you won’t get much of the central ground but I expect to see more of him through the middle in the Barclays Premier League. Wherever he plays, his unbelievable pace will hurt defenders. Expect to see him on the ball often and opening up his body to dribble at pace. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW! There’s £60,000 in prizes including £1,000 up for grabs EVERY WEEK… . VIDEO Jamie's top picks including goals from Diego Costa and James Ward-Prowse . Stellar signing: Alexis Sanchez brings pace, trickery and menace to Arsenal's forward line. Watch out! The leader of the pack: Sanchez gives Arsenal an extra dimension and should become a huge hit with fans . No 2: Ander Herrera . Manchester United have spent a long time trying to replace Paul Scholes and now they have found their man. I call him a ‘ticker’... he gets it and he gives it and he keeps the team ticking along, just like his compatriots Andres Iniesta and Xavi. He can hit a long pass too but most of his work will be pass-and-move in the middle of the park. One fault is that he doesn’t score enough goals and Manchester United need more from that area of the pitch. The new Scholes: Ander Herrera will keep things ticking over in midfield, but he needs to add goals to his game . Keeping things moving: Herrara should be a great addition in the engine room of Manchester United's midfield . No 3: Bafetimbi Gomis . A replacement for Wilfried Bony or will they play together at Swansea? They have looked the part in pre-season. Both are powerful and Gomis will score goals. I’ve liked the Frenchman for a long time and as he was free he’s an absolute bargain when you see clubs like West Ham scratching around for a forward. Solid signing: Bafetimbi Gomis (left) looks the part in pre-season and could be an absolute steal for Swansea . No 4: Raheem Sterling . I expect this brilliant kid to be another player Real Madrid will be chasing in a year or two. He is an explosive little powerhouse, a mighty mouse of an attacking player who is as strong as an ox. I am told he has returned to training at Liverpool looking hungry and sharp and that he is bulking up. No World Cup fatigue for him. We are used to a winger being easy to bully but it looks as if defenders will hurt themselves trying to kick this 19-year-old. Liverpool will have to change the way they play after losing Luis Suarez and so Sterling could be used behind Daniel Sturridge or playing either right or left of him. One of his many qualities is that you just cannot predict where he will be playing when the Liverpool teamsheet arrives, which gives Brendan Rodgers the valuable element of surprise. He draws penalties and free kicks because he gets in and around defenders, under their arms and is great at protecting the ball. Sterling is lightning quick, too, but needs to score more goals. The challenge will be for him to hit double figures as he continues his rapid rise. Powerful: Raheem Sterling packs a punch despite his diminutive 5ft 7in stature . Trickery: Sterling's wizardry with the ball is jaw-dropping at times, but he must score more goals . No 5: James Ward-Prowse . There is a lot of doom and gloom around Southampton because of the exodus of so many players, including captain Adam Lallana. But having such big boots to fill presents a real chance for this lad to shine. This Portsmouth-born 19-year-old is a set-piece wizard and an all-action midfielder who I can see breaking into the senior England set-up before the end of the season. He’s got an engine, gets around the pitch and starts the season after a successful summer tournament in Toulon for England’s U20 team. His free kick against Brazil was named goal of the tournament and he was voted the event’s third best player. I am expecting a lot from him. Steely determination: James Ward-Prowse has the opportunity to make a real name for himself at Saints . Bright, bright future: Ward-Prowse is a dead-ball expert and could be on the path for a full-England call-up . No 6: Diego Costa . My sources from the Chelsea training ground are raving about this powerhouse centre forward and how he is gearing up for the new season. It sounds like he was born to be a Jose Mourinho player. He looks like a Bond villain, he is aggressive and will use every trick in the book to gain an advantage. Watch him wrestling with defenders in the area, pulling and scratching and diving to win penalties. Jose will love him, defenders will hate playing against him! He is a finisher — and I fancy him to settle quickly and score plenty. He is a strong boy who will fit into Chelsea’s preferred system of playing one up. On the scoresheet: Diego Costa will add muscle - and goals - to Chelsea's front line= . All-action: Costa can be aggressive and will do anything to gain an advantage . No 7: Rio Ferdinand . My dad, Harry Redknapp, rang me to say: ‘I’ve got a chance of signing Rio Ferdinand for QPR’. I like Rio, and loved him as a player but I was uncertain. After his illustrious Manchester United career, I expected him to glide off into the TV studio or to chase other business interests. Dad said: ‘I’ve looked him in the eyes and he wants to play.’ He hasn’t gone for the money, that’s for sure, as he is not the highest paid player at QPR, but he’s in this list because I’m excited to see how it works out for him. He will be defending differently from his time at United and he has put himself under pressure with this move but he looks in excellent shape in preseason. The small pitch at QPR might help him and having Steven Caulker next to him certainly will. Moving on: Rio Ferdinand opted to play for QPR rather than retire into the sunset . Key signing: Ferdinand adds a wealth of experience to QPR and could be all set for a swansong . No 8: Danny Ings . The Burnley striker is raw but he has lots of ability. Now we’ll see if he can he handle the step up from the Championship, where he scored 27 goals in 64 starts. Ings has also made his mark with the England U21 team with two in four games and was the Championship Player of the Season. He won’t get as many chances in the top flight but he is a strong spearhead for Sean Dyche’s team. I’m also convinced that Ings and Kieran Trippier, Burnley’s very talented right back, can make the breakthrough with England. They are bright young talents ready to step up. Step up: Danny Ings is in the Premier League on the back of an impressive scoring record in the Championship . Rising star: Ings has also made a name for himself on the international scene with England U21s . No 9: Romelu Lukaku . The £28million Everton paid for a player Jose Mourinho doesn’t fancy is huge, especially considering Belgium left him on the bench as an impact substitute for much of the World Cup. There are times when Lukaku looks like the next Didier Drogba with his brutal power and then there are moments when he looks as if he couldn’t trap a bag of cement. He still has a bit to prove and he needs to repay the faith shown in him by Roberto Martinez and Bill Kenwright. He’s no longer a loan player doing someone a favour, as he was at West Bromwich and Everton in the past two seasons. At the very least he must match his return of 15 goals last season. Staying put: Romelu Lukaku penned a deal with Everton after a successful loan spell last season . Fans' favourite: The Everton faithful will have been delighted with Lukaku's signing and the statement it makes . No 10: Erik Lamela . You may consider him an odd choice, but the Spurs player who endured a terrible opening season in English football, is a wonderful talent. I am told he is looking sharp in training and, while there is a lot of competition on the right side for Spurs — Andros Townsend and Aaron Lennon are also competing for a place — he could get the nod or feature through the middle. He cost £30m and you have to ask how Franco Baldini, Spurs’ director of football, believed him to be worth that. But with a fellow Argentine as his new manager, we could see him emerge.

"Stoke City won their first pre-season game of the campaign at the sixth attempt as Bojan Krkic's third strike in three games helped them to a 2-0 victory over Real Betis at the Britannia Stadium. The surprise summer signing from Barcelona continued his excellent pre-season so far by firing in Stoke's second goal from the edge of the area just before half-time. Eric Pieters had opened the scoring on the half-hour mark to send Mark Hughes' men on their way to their first pre-season victory.

Three draws and two defeats - with just four goals scored - from their first five pre-season matches was not what Hughes would have expected from his side. And with just one match left - away to SC Freiburg on Saturday - before Stoke host Aston Villa in their first Premier League match of the season on August 16, this victory  will have provided Stoke's squad with some much-needed confidence. Betis started the match the brighter, however, with Nono striking an early volley safely into the hands of Asmir Begovic. Bojan then tested former Antonio Adan in the Betis goal with a powerful header on eight minutes following a cross from Pieters. Former Manchester United striker Mame Diouf then kept Adan busy with a 20-yard piledriver. In charge: Stoke manager Mark Hughes walks along the touchline during their match with Betis . Competitive: Stoke's Ireland (right) passes the ball under pressure from Real Betis' Javier Matilla (left) And the opener came on the half-hour mark, with Bojan and Steven Nzonzi linking up well with a neat one-two before Phil Bardsley lashed a cross into the box for Pieters to slide in and put the home side ahead. Betis responded almost immediately, with Vincenzo Rennella smashing a shot wide from 20 yards. But Stoke soon doubled their advantage. Just before half-time, Bojan ran at the Betis defence and unleashed an unstoppable shot from the edge of the area into the back of the net for his third strike of pre-season. With Stoke coming out after the break 2-0 ahead, Hughes' men sat back a little and Betis had the first opportunity of the half. Substitute Cedrick Mabwati crossed for fellow replacement Ruben Castro, whose shot sailed over the bar from 15 yards out. Appeal: Stoke striker Bojan protests to the referee after a strong challenge on him by a Real Betis player . The Spaniards were then desperately unlucky not to pull a goal back as they hit the post twice in quick succession. Jorge Molina rocketed a shot off the woodwork before Cedrick managed to pick out the exact same spot with the rebound. Betis continued to dominate the second half and it took a brilliant save from Stoke stopper Begovic in the 71st-minute to deny Molina when the striker broke clear and rushed towards the Stoke goal. Begovic's heroics seemed to finally jolt Stoke back to life as the immediately attacked and Bojan was unlucky not to add his second of the evening when his sliding shot was well-saved by the feet of substitute goalkeeper Dani Giminez. Bojan was taken off in the 79th-minute to a standing ovation. He looks set to be a Potters fans' favourite.

After taxes he . would likely be left with a net worth of around $800 million making him . hip-hop’s richest man, toppling P. Diddy by $100 million. Apple . is in the market for a subscription-based music service to complement . its 'iRadio' ad-based offering, launched in 2013 as part of an attempt . to jump into a music-streaming arena then split between a handful of . startups such as Pandora Inc. Founded by . rapper Dr. Dre and legendary music producer Jimmy Iovine, Beats . Electronics is best known for its 'Beats by Dr Dre' line of trendy . headphones that vie with the likes of Skullcandy Inc, Sennheiser . Electronic and Bose Corp. This year, it launched a music service that has won plaudits for its . slick design and human music curation, versus the computer-algorithms . that determine playlists for most of its rivals. But . analysts on Thursday questioned whether Beats, valued at just $1 . billion during its last funding round in September, was worth that . price. Feeling good: Dr. Dre (left) celebrated his headphones deal with Apple last night by declaring himself the richest man in hip hop . What a deal! Apple is orchestrating a $3.2 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker and music streaming distributor founded by hip-hop star Dr. Dre and record producer Jimmy Iovine . Apple . had more than $130 billion in cash as of the end of March, but the vast . majority of that is parked abroad and investors have called on the . company to return more cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. Apple-watchers . have speculated that the company that upended the music industry - and . today is the single largest seller of tunes - was contemplating a . Spotify-like on-demand music service to go with iRadio service and . iTunes. 'This . is really puzzling,' said Forrester analyst James McQuivey, who said . there was huge overlap between the two companies' customer base. 'You . buy companies today to get technologies that no one else … or customers . that no one has.' 'They must have something hidden … under the hood,' he said. In . two of the largest deals this year, Facebook paid $19 billion for . WhatsApp and its half-billion users, and it paid $2 billion for Oculus . VR and its cutting-edge virtual reality headset. Apple . declined to comment on the report. Beats Electronics did not respond to . requests for comment on the news, which was reported first by the . Financial Times. The potential acquisition would add Beats Electronics' popular line of headphones and music streaming service to an Apple line-up that already includes digital music players and the iTunes store, the world's top music retailer . Apple . has not made a billion-dollar acquisition in at least a decade. The . company prefers to develop and design its products in-house, though it . has tended to pay several hundred million dollars for small but . important bits of technology to propel its core consumer electronics . business, such as the acquisition of PA Semi in 2008 that led to the . processor now found in all iPhones. The . company has been under pressure to try to revitalize growth as iPhone . sales slow in a rapidly maturing market. Critics have also accused the . company of slowly 'losing its cool' and innovative edge to new and . upcoming technology companies, and missing the music-streaming . bandwagon. Technology . giants Google and Amazon began jockeying for position in music last . year, looking at ways to make streaming profitable and to develop a . service seen as crucial to retaining users in an increasingly mobile . environment. For Google and Apple especially, the endeavor was critical to ensure users remain loyal to their mobile products. Beats has also partnered with a host of celebrities, including Lady Gaga, to create endorsed  earphones. Dre and Snoog Dogg: The headphones have become a bit of status symbol worn by celebrities as well as audiophiles . They . realized they had to stake out a place or risk ceding control of one of . the largest components of mobile device usage. Analysts estimate roughly . half of smartphone users listen to music on their device, making it the . fourth most popular media-related activity after social networking, . games and news. Apple . launched its own streaming music service last year, hoping to jump into . the fast-expanding arena as growth of its iTunes service falters. Apple's . Chief Executive Tim Cook met with Iovine, the Beats CEO, last year on a . potential partnership involving Beats's planned music-streaming . service. Dre - who guided the careers of a string of rap artists such as Eminem and 50 Cent - compared his company with Apple in 2011. 'We're trying to eventually be second to Apple. And I don't think that's a bad position,' Dre told The Fader music website. Beats . Electronics received a $500 million investment from Carlyle Group in . September that valued the company at over $1 billion. It also bought . back in September a 24.84 percent stake held by Taiwan smartphone maker . HTC Corp, which once held as much as 50.1 percent of the company.","Beats was founded by music producer Jimmy Iovine and the hip-hop star Dr Dre and until recently was best known for its headphones .

"Kellie Maloney has praised the world of sport for the reaction to her shock sex change revelation. Maloney, formerly known as the boxing promoter Frank, announced at the weekend that she was now a woman. And the 62-year-old said she was worried about the reaction, adding that she'd known from a very young age she was in the wrong body but suppressed it due to her working-class upbringing, during which she was taken to Millwall at three.

Watch the full interview on Good Morning Britain . Now and then: Maloney as Kellie on ITV and (right) last year as Frank, bowing out of boxing . Maloney told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'The reaction has been extraordinary. Stan Collymore, Lennox Lewis, they were great. 'I knew (she wanted to be a woman) when I was very young. But I come from a working-class background, I was taken to Millwall when I was three. 'When I was against my brothers I had to excel at everything. I had to the best at any sport. 'It was very hard and I felt I don't want to be different. I thought it'd just go but it didn't.' Asked how she felt about any negative comments, she said: 'I received so many of them in my boxing business they'd just be like water off a duck's back now to me. Really, that life has prepared me for this transition.' The catalyst, Maloney revealed, was when her father died of cancer, adding: 'The day my father died four years ago the lid came off it.'

The ex-boxing promoter and manager also revealed about trying to seek assurances from professionals: 'I would phone the counsellor because I didn't want him to know who I was. I'd say, ""Tell me I'm not a transsexual"" but he'd say, ""I don't know you, if you're asking me there must be something in it"".' Maloney re-iterated that she would have killed herself had she not revealed her true self but said the hardest thing was telling her former wife, insisting: 'I would have killed myself.

"Sportsmail's Tuesday columnist puts his neck on the line in forecasting what he believes will happen in a season that could prove to be the most intriguing Premier League campaign yet, as well as predicting outcomes in the Champions League and La Liga plus England's fortunes in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. Gareth Bale will score 30-plus goals - providing he stays fit. The confidence he has built up in the past 12 months at Real Madrid and the physical power he can now add to his talents will see him take his game to another level. The players around will help of course, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Real Madrid won both the Champions League and La Liga, with Bale taking centre stage. The Welshman netted 15 times last season; double it and more this year. VIDEO Scroll to watch Bale in training with Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez . Hitman: Real Madrid's Gareth Bale practises free kicks during a training session on Monday . All smiles: Bale is back in the Welsh capital for the Super Cup against Sevilla on Tuesday night . Wayne Rooney will have his best ever season at Manchester United. I’m not just talking about the amount of goals he will score, I’m talking about his all-round game. He will score and create, and he will flourish under a world class manager who believes in him. Show us what you can do, Wayne. Time to shine! Wayne Rooney should flourish in a Manchester United shirt under new boss Louis van Gaal . Knows where the net is! Rooney looks like to pile in with goals and assists at Old Trafford this season . VIDEO Rooney favourite for captaincy . Luis Suarez will get sent off at least twice. He will be a marked man, referees will be watching closely – nobody will want to be the man in the middle who misses the fourth bite - and opponents in Spain will be as masterful of the dark arts of football as Suarez is. He’s got off lightly in England – this won’t happen in a Barcelona shirt. .......................................................................... Manchester City will win nothing. With the squad they had, and the changes at other clubs, City should have won the title by 10-12 points last season, but in the end only clinched it because Chelsea dropped points late in the campaign against Villa, Palace, Norwich and Sunderland, while Liverpool lost to Chelsea and slipped up at Crystal Palace. Manuel Pellegrini gets his sides playing decent football, but that can only take you so far. On Sunday he changed nothing when Arsenal were outplaying the champions from the first minute. The unhappiness of Yaya Toure this summer has smacked of everything that was wrong with the latter part of the Roberto Mancini era at the Etihad. And his handling of the goalkeeper situation is nothing short of bizarre. I’ll be fascinated to see who is in between the sticks for City on the opening weekend, but I know that whoever misses out won’t be happy. Joe Hart doesn’t deserve to be dropped; Willy Caballero will wonder why he’s been signed after playing every minute of every game in La Liga last season. .......................................................................... QPR will be a joy to watch. When Harry Redknapp arrived at Rangers the dressing room was in an appalling state. Last season he worked with a backdrop of financial pressure to get promoted. He may not have done it in style, but Redknapp took QPR back to the top flight. Now with the pressure off, Glenn Hoddle on the staff and with most of the high-earning wasters away from the club, Redknapp can get QPR playing similarly to Spurs when they were ripping teams to shreds in the Champions League. Results may not always go their way, but Rangers should be good value this season. All smiles: Luis Suarez completed a £75million move from Liverpool to Barcelona after the World Cup . Tougher time: The defenders in La Liga should be more adept at playing the striker at his own game . Will we see this again? Manchester City are going to struggle to retain their Premier League crown . Resolved? Yaya Toure's unhappiness at the Etihad Stadium will be a growing concern for those at the club . Trepidation: Manuel Pellegrini has his side playing good football but they appear to have gone backwards . Awful: City were completely outplayed by Arsenal at Wembley in the Community Shield on Sunday . Gliding: Shaun Wright-Phillips moves beyond Stelios Kitsiou in QPR's friendly against PAOK on Saturday . England will lose to Switzerland next month in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. I have no doubts they will qualify, but England have lost their captain at a time when leadership is needed. I’m sure Steven Gerrard will have his own regrets about his international career, but he’s been excellent in qualifiers and will be missed. Some of the England squad think the World Cup was positive for England, so I wonder how much time they’ve actually spent thinking about how they could have done better for their country. For me, off the back of a record-breakingly bad World Cup, and against a Switzerland side who impressed me in Brazil, I can only see England losing. I’ve booked time off and paid for my tickets so it won’t stop me going to the game to support my country, but I just can’t help thinking we will slip up. The question then will focus on Roy Hodgson’s future. Bad to worse: England were humiliated at the World Cup but could struggle against Switzerland too . Chelsea will win the title. If they don’t then Jose Mourinho has really lost his powers. He’s been allowed to sign two talismanic players in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, to fill two key roles in the team. Chelsea should have won it last season, this time around there are no excuses. So far in his career Mourinho has proved he is a more successful manager than Pellegrini, so with the squad the Portuguese has the title should be heading to Stamford Bridge. Big year: Jose Mourinho should deliver the Premier League title with the players at his disposal . Like the kid who stayed in uniform and watched from the sidelines while the rest of us took part in school sports day, Tottenham Hotspur will once again be admiring the successful sides next season. I respect what Mauricio Pochettino did at Southampton – they were good to watch. And if he is given time he may do something decent at White Hart Lane. But I’ll be amazed if it’s this season. There is a lot of work to do at Spurs and I’m shocked Pochettino hasn’t gone back to Saints for some players. Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana are two who would surely have improved Tottenham. He’s a miracle worker if he takes them into the top four. Pochettino wasted a golden opportunity in the FA Cup with Southampton last season by fielding a weakened side and losing at Sunderland in the fifth round, so if he takes that philosophy to Tottenham they won’t be doing anything in the cups this season. In the short-term it will be same old Spurs. But beyond that, if they stick with Pochettino, it could be fruitful. Job on his hands: Mauricio Pochettino will find life tough as Tottenham manager in his first season . Worth the money: Spurs should have moved for Liverpool's ex-Southampton defender Dejan Lovren (left) Swansea will be going down. It will be one of the Premier League’s real special achievements if Garry Monk keeps them up. They ended last season winning three of their final four games. Before that they enjoyed just one victory in 12. Losing one key player this summer was a blow. Losing two was careless. Losing three could be disastrous. Michu, Ben Davies, Michel Vorm, Chico Flores, Jonathan de Guzman have led the exodus. They have been big players for the Swans and they will all be missed. If Wilfried Bony also leaves, Monk won’t have a prayer. Big miss: Michu has left Swansea City for a season-long loan spell at Serie A side Napoli . Tricky time ahead: Garry Monk will know he faces a battle to keep the Swans in the top flight . Louis van Gaal will have his fair share of touchline spats. He’s a guy with a sense of humour but in the heat of the battle he could’ve fallen out with Mother Theresa. Most likely to wind up the Dutchman are Alan Pardew, Arsene Wenger and Mourinho.

"A 23-year-old old man from Minnesota who had coached young girls at a local high school  is accused of sexual assault and kidnapping after bringing two 13-year-old  girls he met online to the basement of his parents' home. Authorities say Casey Lee Chinn from Burnsville met the girls through Omegle, a free online chat site, and picked them around 7:30pm on Monday. Police were then able to track the girls to the Burnsville home by by tracking the signals from their mobile phones. Scroll down for video... Chinn, 23, is charged with 6 counts of criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping and solicitation . Police found the girls Tuesday morning, crying and 'huddled behind a couch' in the basement of Chinn's home in Burnsville, Minn. Perhaps the most unbelievable aspect of the criminal complaint against Chinn is that he allegedly had the girls in basement because he lived with his parents who were upstair . Omegle is a free online chat site that randomly links users with strangers. It's promotional tagline is 'Talk to strangers!' According to the charging documents, the girls had been communicating with Chinn via text and other social media apps for about a month and the chats were 'sexually explicit.' Chinn knew the girls' age and acknowledged picking them up, the documents say. When police arrived at the home, he initially denied the girls were there but after a search of the residence the two were found 'huddled behind a couch in the basement, crying and upset.' Chinn explained to the police that he had believed the girls were unhappy and agreed to pick them up and drive them around before taking them to his home in Burnsville. He told them to enter the back door and to stay in the 'basement because he lived with his parents,' the documents said - he then sexually assaulted them both. Chinn serves as a volleyball coach at Christo Rey Jesuit High School in Minneapolis. This past winter, Chinn was named as a volunteer baseball coach in the South Washington County School District . Chinn was charged Thursday with six felonies - two counts of third degree criminal sexual conduct, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of solicitation. Chinn has worked at several metro-area schools and organizations as a coach, according to authorities and has no criminal records. He has no criminal record in Minnesota. He was cited for speeding in a 2009 when he was 18-years-old. Officials at Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Minneapolis have since placed Chinn on leave from the part-time job as volleyball coach which he began in September. 'We are cooperating fully with the Anoka County Sheriff's Office and are encouraging our school families to discuss any interactions that their children may have had with Mr. Chinn and to come forward with any concerns,' the school said. Chinn also has been involved in girls' softball in Burnsville and worked as a volunteer junior varsity baseball coach at East Ridge High in Woodbury for the 2014 season.","Charges filed against sports coach Casey Lee Chinn detail two weeks of sexual online chats and text messages with a pair of 13-year-old girls .

"There will be no US Open heroics from Dan Evans this year after the British No 3 slumped to a first-round loss in qualifying at Flushing Meadows. The Birmingham player had a match point in the second set against Jimmy Wang but could not take it and was eventually beaten 4-6 7-6 (11/9) 6-2. Twelve months ago the mercurial Evans made his major breakthrough by qualifying in New York and going on to reach the third round. Game over: Dan Evans fell at the first hurdle and failed to progress in US Open qualifying . His final match was a thrilling encounter against Tommy Robredo - who went on to beat Roger Federer - that he could and probably should have taken into a fifth set. Evans has not kicked on as he or those within British tennis would have hoped, the 24-year-old admittedly not helped by a niggling knee injury. Landing Wang, the 16th seed and world No 132, was a tough first-round draw but Evans battled hard to win the first set and, having let a golden chance to break go by at the start of the second, he dug in admirably. But he was edged out in the tie-break, Wang saving Evans' match point with an ace and then taking advantage of two poor points from the British player to end the set. It was Wang who had the momentum going into the decider and Evans never managed to wrestle it back. Long 12 months: Evans reached the third round of the US Open last year in his major breakthrough . The defeat will see Evans' ranking plummet from its current 176 well into the 200s and he must try to find something like his form of last summer to prevent it dropping further. There was British success from James Ward, who comfortably saw off unheralded Bosnian Aldin Setkic 6-2 6-2 to set up a second-round qualifying clash with France's Vincent Millot. Ward is at a career-high ranking of 131 after an excellent run on the North American hard courts and will have high hopes of making the main draw in New York for the first time. The 27-year-old was the only one of five British players to survive the first round, with Dan Smethurst joining Evans in exiting the tournament on Wednesday.

"Crystal Palace have been fined by the Premier League for their part in the ‘spygate’ saga involving Cardiff City last season. The top-flight authorities found that Palace had breached their ‘good faith’ rule - B16 - by obtaining information about Cardiff’s team ahead of their 3-0 win in Wales on April 5. Victory: Crystal Palace won the game 3-0 at Cardiff to move seven points clear of the drop zone . Claim: Vincent Tan (left) made the complaint following the 3-0 defeat in April . Cardiff complained in a five-page letter to the Premier League that their former head of recruitment, Iain Moody, now the director of football at Palace, had contacted Cardiff employees for information. Cardiff: Marshall; Theophile, Caulker, Turner, Taylor; Zaha , Mutch, Medel, Daehli; Campbell, Jones. Subs: Lewis; Eikrem, McNaughton, Cala, Bellamy, Cowie, Noone . CLICK HERE to read the match report . The size of the fine is unknown, although the maximum for the breach is £25,000. The then-Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis strongly denied the accusations at the time, saying: ‘You look at it, for three weeks we have picked the same formation and same team, we haven’t changed anything. ‘Irrespective of who or where it has come from it is pure speculation until the team-sheet comes in. Although I try to avoid it myself, I have known managers change the team 10 minutes before the team sheets have gone in so it is very difficult to say it is definitely going to be that team.’ Sportsmail revealed the complaint in April, with the club requesting an investigation into Palace’s conduct. They later denied that they requested the result of the match be overturned. Boss: Tony Pulis, who was managing Palace at the time, refuted the claims . A prominent Cardiff source claimed to Sportsmail at the time that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had only learned of Moody’s alleged efforts when a message sent from Moody's phone was received by Bolton manager Dougie Freedman in error. The message, which contained the starting 11 that Solskjaer ultimately fielded against Palace, was forwarded on to Solskjaer, who opted against changing his team. He is believed to have confronted Pulis ahead of the fixture. Cardiff’s complaint included a text from Moody naming midfielder Aron Gunnarsson as the source of the information. Cardiff claimed it read: ‘Straight from Gunnarsson their line up is 4-4-2 Marshall, KTC, Caulker, Turner, Taylor, Daehli, Medel, Mutch, Zaha, Campbell, Jones.’ Gunnarsson denied any involvement and Solskjaer publicly supported the player.

"Alistair Darling has revealed he will stand down as an MP at the next general election with a warning that Scotland could face another independence referendum unless Labour halts the SNP advance. Mr Darling, who led the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence, spoke of his disappointment that Labour had not capitalised on the 'No' vote in the referendum. It comes amid recent opinion polls that suggest Labour is on course to lose the vast majority of its Scottish seats at Westminster to the SNP at the next general election. Former Chancellor Alistair Darling has announced he will stand down as an MP at the next general election . He told the Financial Times: 'My frustration is that we actually won. You can't say it often enough. We made the arguments, we had confidence in ourselves.' The Labour MP for Edinburgh south west backed former Scottish secretary Jim Murphy to reverse the party's fortunes in Scotland following the resignation of Johann Lamont last week. Three candidates - MP Jim Murphy and MSPs Sarah Boyack and Neil Findlay - are standing to succeed Ms Lamont as leader, with Kezia Dugdale MSP and the MP Katy Clark hoping to become deputy. He said: 'Jim has the enthusiasm, the energy and above all he's a fighter. For too long we have sat back when we needed to fight.' The MP for Edinburgh south west recently led the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence . Mr Darling, 60, said he wanted to step aside from politics while he was still 'relatively young'. He may now forge a lucrative career in the private sector, but has hinted he may return to front-line politics to fight to keep Britain in the EU during an 'inevitable' referendum. In a separate interview with the Edinburgh Evening News, he said: I've been an MP for 27 years, many of them on the frontbench, I was Chancellor during the economic crisis and I’ve just fought a gruelling referendum campaign. Now it’s time to move on. ’I'm sorry to go, but it’s better to go when you’re still enjoying it rather than hanging on too long. 'I hope I’ve got many years in front of me, but I want to go and do something different.' His departure comes despite some Labour backbenchers wanting Mr Darling to return to the party's front benches, possibly as a replacement for Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor. Mr Darling, who entered Parliament in 1987, served as Chancellor between 2007-2010 after a holding a range of Cabinet roles following Labour's election in 1997. Mr Darling, who turns 61 next month, defeated Alex Salmond in the Scottish independence vote . The MP for Edinburgh south west served as Chancellor from 2007-2010 during the economic crash . Alistair Darling had 'fundamental disagreements' with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown over key economic policies during the last Labour government . He led the Better Together campaign which last month defeated the 'Yes' campaign by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. Prior to that, he served as Chancellor under Prime Minister Gordon Brown during the collapse of Northern Rock and the subsequent global banking crisis. In his memoirs, he spoke of the tensions between the two men which increased markedly. 'Relations between myself and Gordon became progressively more difficult,' he said. 'We had a fundamental disagreement in 2008 as to how bad this (the financial crash) was going to be. And then during 2009 we had this whole argument about what you do about the deficit.' And he said the last 18 months of Mr Brown's government had a 'permanent air of chaos and crisis' about them. He said he always feared Mr Brown regarded him as a 'stopgap' chancellor and said he resisted efforts to replace him with Ed Balls, a close ally of Mr Brown, in June 2009. Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said Alistair Darling had made an 'immense contribution' Jim Murphy, who Mr Darling has backed to lead the Scottish Labour Party, said he 'deserves all our thanks' Tonight Labour MPs paid tribute to Mr Darling, who also served as Secretary of State for Transport, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Secretary of State for Scotland. Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said: 'Very sad to hear Alistair Darling is standing down at the next election. He has made an immense contribution to our country and our party. 'When Alistair Darling gets up and speaks in the Commons, all sides of the House of Commons shut up and listen. He'll be greatly missed.' Jim Murphy, who Mr Darling has tipped to lead the Scottish Labour Party, said: 'History will judge Alistair Darling to have made an immense contribution to Labour, Scotland and the whole UK. Deserves all our thanks.' William Bain MP for Glasgow north east said: 'Huge contribution to public life made by Alistair Darling. He showed politics can be honourable, decent and change countless lives for the better.' David Miliband, brother of Labour leader Ed, said: 'My retiring friend and colleague Alistair Darling is a gentle giant of politics: high on integrity, low on ego.' Mr Darling's departure will come as a further blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was found to be even less popular with voters than Nick Clegg in the most recent YouGov survey. Just 18 per cent think Mr Miliband is doing well, giving him an overall satisfaction rating of minus 55 - one point behind Liberal Democrat leader Mr Clegg. During a near 30-year career in frontline politics, Alistair Darling rose from being a 'safe pair of hands' minister to greater prominence as chancellor. He spent his formative years in Edinburgh, attending the city's exclusive Loretto public school. He became an advocate in 1984, two years after being elected to the former Lothian Regional Council. After becoming an MP in 1987, Mr Darling rose quickly through the Labour ranks. In opposition he served on the front bench in several roles, including as home affairs spokesman. Following Labour's 1997 election win, Mr Darling served as chief secretary to the Treasury. He then replaced Harriet Harman as social security secretary (a job later re-named work and pensions secretary). Mr Darling once said he would like to be remembered as 'the minister who began to eradicate poverty', but was targeted by pensioners outraged when their pensions were raised by only 75p. The episode led to a rebellion at Labour's conference in 2000. Mr Darling, said to have a skill for mastering complex briefs in record time, became Secretary of State for Transport in 2002, when Stephen Byers resigned amid the collapse of Railtrack. His proposals for road pricing - not universally popular among drivers - sparked fierce debate. Mr Darling's later comments, while at the Department of Trade and Industry, that Britain's future energy needs may have to be met partly by a return to nuclear power, also raised eyebrows. Alistair Darling rose from being a 'safe pair of hands' minister to greater prominence as chancellor . Following Gordon Brown's elevation to Prime Minister in 2007, he was handpicked for the job of Chancellor. Mr Darling, memorably warned in the summer of 2008 - not long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers - of the worst financial crisis in 60 years. The chancellor later said the resulting Brown camp backlash was like having the 'forces of hell' unleashed on him, but Mr Darling stood firm. When Mr Brown apparently tried to evict his long-time ally (and neighbour) from No11 in the summer of 2009, it was widely reported Mr Darling threatened to resign. In his memoirs, published after Labour was voted out of office, Mr Darling said there was a 'permanent air of chaos and crisis' when Mr Brown was prime minister. However, the pair were reconciled during the referendum campaign where Brown played arguably the crucial role in helping to keep Scotland part of the UK. Despite losing the election, Mr Darling was possibly able to take some comfort that his prediction of financial meltdown was, as he put it, 'fairly accurate'. Despite initially insisting he was not interested in leading the pro-Union Better Together campaign Mr Darling returned to the fray and helped defeat Alex Salmond in the independence referendum on September 18.","Mr Darling, who led the Better Together campaign, will stand down as MP .

"A teen who was acquitted of killing his stepbrother three years ago has admitted snorting meth to cops after being arrested for the third time in a week - including twice in the same day. Josh Young, 18, from Louisville, Kentucky, was caught by police just before midnight on Wednesday trespassing on someone else's property. Earlier in the day his neighbors had called 911 after they reported seeing him waving his arms in the middle of the street and trying to get into random cars. Drug-related decline: Josh Young is pictured, left, in August 2013 when he was acquitted of killing his stepbrother and, right, in a mugshot following one of his three arrests in a week after admitting to snorting meth . Police said Young later confessed he had been snorting meth and he claimed someone was chasing him, reports WHAS11. He has been charged with trespassing and public intoxication and is expected to be arraigned on both of Wednesday's arrests on Thursday morning. Young had also been arrested last weekend after shoplifting $14.71 in merchandise from Walmart. The troubled teen was only released from jail two weeks ago for assaulting his girlfriend in April. These new charges will likely mean a probation violation on a previous charge where Young pleaded guilty to assaulting a man who testified against him at his murder trial. Young had previously been acquitted in the murder of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011. Young, left and now sporting several facial tattoos, had been acquitted in the murder of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, right, in May 2011 . In his recent mug shots, Young has sported several facial tattoos - a tear under his left eye and a star near his right eye. Terry Zwicker, father of murdered Trey, told WDRB that he thought the tear signified that Young had killed someone and the star that he was a gang member. He faced trial in August 2013 but was acquitted on the charge of complicity to murder and one count of tampering with physical evidence. His father, Josh Gouker, was sentenced to life in prison in July 2013 after pleading guilty to the murder. He had initially told police that Young had confessed to the killing but changed his story. At the time he said of the murder: 'It just felt right. I know it sounds monstrous and all that s***, but it's not. If we was in the Old Testament, it'd be the same thing.'

In the photo on the right he is pictured after arrest in April - prior to getting his recent tattoos . Gouker has since claimed that he lied when he took responsibility for Zwicker's death and has attempted to appeal his conviction. Zwicker's devastated father told WLKY in April that he found out about the teen's run-ins with the law on Facebook. 'I feel strongly that our justice system got it wrong. I know the little boy. I know the little boy has violent tendencies. I've known him most of his life. 'This just goes to show that that somebody made a mistake somewhere and now there's a young lady that's been hurt because of it,' said Terry Zwicker. He added to WDRB that he still believes Young should be locked up. 'He deserves to pay for what he's done and not only what he's done to that young lady. He deserves to pay for the murder of my child. I'm not stupid. 'I know the boy did it. I feel it in my bones that he did it so this just goes to show the jury was wrong by letting him go and now somebody else is hurt,' he said.

Suarez established a reputation as one of the Barclays Premier League’s best-ever strikers while at Anfield but several flashpoints overshadowed his performances. The South American was found guilty of racially abusing then-Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, banned for 10 matches after biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic and was regularly accused of diving. The ugly side of his game reared its head again during the World Cup when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini — the third time in his career he has been found guilty of such an offence.

It was great to have you while we had you. But you’re not worth the risk”. ‘He’s great to have but an accident waiting to happen. He’s done his time here, but I can’t say I’m sorry to see him go. ‘We won’t miss him because there is only so long we can go on defending the indefensible.’ Scudamore’s comments came at the official launch of the new Premier League season. It was the first time the 55-year-old has spoken publicly since sexist emails from his account were leaked to a national newspaper and nearly cost him his job earlier this year. Scudamore has since apologised and insisted the organisation does not have a sexism problem.

There’s some very aggrieved female employees who have seen the organisation characterised in the way it was. Of course, it was difficult and I apologised straight away. ‘The clubs were assembled and they gave me their backing unanimously. I can’t say more than that, they were private emails and there is a legal process that is going on so I can’t say more.’ Scudamore also reiterated his intention to introduce a ‘39th Premier League game’.

"Chinese state media has warned readers not to call themselves Dumbledore when choosing an English name. Chinese people who come to the West to study, work or do business often choose and English sounding name. But it's a process fraught with pitfalls and can result in unintentional hilarity. An article published by CCTV News warns readers against using the names of fictional characters or figures from religions or mythology. Dumbledore: Chinese state media told its readers to avoid fictional characters when choosing a Western name . 'As with ""famous people"" names, these only work if the name is common anyway. Choosing Harry, from Harry Potter is ok. Hercules, Satan, Dumbledore or Jesus, is a different story,' it says. 'Unique names like these aren’t just very amusing to English speakers, it also suggests you have some connection to that name.' CCTV warns readers to be wary about the connotations of English names, which 'can come with a ""feeling"" or idea about what sort of person you are.' When choosing a Western name, Chinese people often merely find a word they have a particular affinity with, then choose its English translation. For example a woman born in Autumn might simply call herself after the season. But this method can also have risks. Choosing a food stuff as a name is particularly popular, yet very risky,warns CCTV. 'One of the issues here is that food names can be ""very"" suggestive. 'To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ""non-smart girl"" names, or ""stripper"" names.' To make matters worse, Dong and Wang, both popular and common family names in China, are in the West colloquial terms for male genitalia. 'So avoid anything like ""Bunny Wang"" at all times,' CCTV warns.",Article on state media gives advice in choosing Western name .
"Increasing numbers of doctors are deserting the NHS for a better life in Australia and New Zealand, figures reveal. The exodus of doctors – who cost the taxpayer up to £610,000 to train – is forcing the NHS to import staff from southern and eastern Europe. According to a major report from the General Medical Council, the number applying for certificates to work abroad has risen by a fifth since 2008, to nearly 3,000 a year. Scroll down for video . The General Medical Council says that doctors applying for certificates allowing them to work abroad has risen by a fifth since 2008, with those aged between 25 and 27 most likely to leave . Just over half have applied to work in Australia and New Zealand, where the demands are less intense and doctors enjoy a better work-life balance. And doctors aged 25 to 27 are most likely to leave – making up one in five of those applying for certificates. Figures also show that rising numbers of doctors are coming to Britain from southern and eastern European countries such as Greece, Italy and Romania. But experts say the exodus of UK-trained doctors is putting patients at risk by creating too many vacant posts – particularly in A&E units and GP surgeries. Only last week the Royal College of GPs warned that as many as 550 surgeries could close within the next year because doctors nearing retirement won’t be replaced. Staffing shortages are made more problematic by the fact that a growing number of doctors are women, who tend to only work part-time after having children. The GMC’s figures show that 44 per cent of doctors are women and they are expected to overtake men by 2017. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: ‘The face of medicine is changing. Of particular concern are the potential shortages in some specialist areas where there are diminishing numbers of doctors in postgraduate training and large numbers over the age of 50. ‘Recruitment in some parts of the UK, especially deprived areas and more remote communities, is also a significant challenge.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The mass exodus of GPs – driven by soaring demand and plummeting resources – is a danger to patient safety. 'On the one hand, GPs are leaving the profession due to intense pressure and a lack of support, and on the other, not enough medical students are opting for general practice because they see the pressure we are under.’ Just over half have applied to work in Australia and New Zealand where the demands are less intense and doctors enjoy a better work-life balance . Figures from the GMC show that last year, about 2,900 doctors applied for a ‘certificate of good standing’, which allows them to work abroad, a rise of 22 per cent since 2008. Some 51 per cent were for Australia and New Zealand, while 10 per cent were for Canada. The GMC insisted that not all doctors actually left after acquiring the certificate and many only went for a short period. Last December, Dr Clifford Mann, chairman of the College of Emergency Medicine which represents A&E doctors, warned that the exodus of doctors was a ‘waste of taxpayers’ money’. He pointed out that each one has cost the taxpayer £610,000 over the ten years of their studying and training. However, marginally more doctors are still joining the register than leaving. Last year, a total of 13,150 joined and 12,231 left – either through retirement, moving abroad or quitting the profession altogether. The number arriving from southern and eastern Europe has doubled since 2008 to 1,840 last year. They represent 14 per cent of those joining the register – about one in seven. There are just under 270,000 doctors licensed to practise in the UK.","Nearly 3,000 doctors a year apply for a certificate to work overseas .

"The yacht of media mogul Kerry Stokes has been stormed by pirates off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The Channel Seven boss' boat was boarded by thieves on Friday morning as it anchored near Krangket Island, close to Madang on the country's east coast, to refuel after travelling from Cairns. A spokeswoman for the Seven Network confirmed to AAP the boat was robbed at the end of last week, but Mr Stokes and his family did not arrive in the area until Sunday. Kerry Stokes' yacht was stormed by pirates on Friday morning off the coast of Papua New Guinea . Thieves boarded the yacht after using a row boat to reach the vessel. 'The yacht was robbed and the thieves were confronted by the crew,' the spokeswoman said. 'The family have been travelling up there for years and the people up there are wonderful. 'This is out of character.' Former Madang governor Peter Barter said the boat refuelled at a local marina on Friday before travelling out to Krangket Island. 'They did not want to make an issue over this incident but we insisted that a report was made to police,' Mr Barter said. A spokeswoman for Channel Seven said Mr Stokes and his family were not on board at the time . 'Regretfully this incident is already known around Cairns and will deter motor yachts [and] tourists from visiting Madang and PNG.' Mr Barter said Mr Stokes' yacht went in to lockdown after the incident. Thieves took watches, mobile phones, laptops, diving equipment and cash in the early hours of the morning, the ABC reported.

"Angry parents have complained after a primary school introduced unisex toilets in a bid to 'prevent transphobia'. Pupils at Harbour Primary School in Newhaven, East Sussex, were shocked to discover they had to share the 'gender neutral' toilets at the start of the school year. Many parents say their children do not want to share facilities with the opposite sex because it makes them feel 'uncomfortable'. Unisex: Parents complained children were shocked to find unisex toilets and felt 'uncomfortable' sharing . There are around 500 pupils at the school for three to 11-year-olds. One concerned mother said her seven-year-old does not feel 'comfortable' using the toilets. She said: 'I know of several parents who have raised complaints and they have now invited us to a meeting about transgender equality. 'This was just introduced from the start of term and no one told us before. 'There are seven-year-old girls using the same toilets as 11-year-old boys. 'My daughter has said she doesn't feel comfortable about it. 'Although we are all up for equality we feel this is not allowing our children to choose. 'A lot of our children don't want to use toilets of the opposite sex.' Headteacher Christine Terrey said the decision to include single sex toilets in their new building had been taken by East Sussex County Council. She has invited parents to a meeting on 'transphobia', which will include a discussion about the toilets. Headteacher Christine Terrey said the decision to introduce single sex toilets was to prevent transphobia . Mrs Terrey said: 'The toilets are all in cubicles and they all lock. We just want all our children to be able to use the toilets. 'We no longer have urinals because they were quite unpopular with the boys..' And a letter to parents said: 'We want all the children in our school to feel safe and be happy. 'We also want our families to feel informed about how to effectively support transgender and gender questioning by their children, preventing any transphobia at the school.' East Sussex County Council said it chose to install unisex toilets because they are better for 'hygiene, maintenance and pupil behaviour'. A spokesman said: 'As part of the rebuilding work a decision was taken to install toilets which could be used by boys or girls, with lockable cubicles. 'Unisex toilet blocks are considered preferable in terms of hygiene, maintenance and pupil behaviour. 'We feel this kind of toilet block, which complies with all national guidelines, is an appropriate solution for children of primary school age. 'We are not aware of any cases of children being reluctant to use the new toilets. 'On the contrary, the feedback we have received from the vast majority of parents, children and staff has been overwhelmingly positive.

'For anyone below 11, it isn't an issue.' Mr Clark added: 'I think it's more than reasonable for kids to share. It's change isn't it?

"Great Britain's Lynsey Sharp just fell short in her bid to retain the European crown, as not even a personal-best performance was enough for her to add gold to the 800 metres silver from the Commonwealth Games.

"Bernie Ecclestone’s fixer in the paddock, his Man Friday and most loyal lieutenant, is a Sardinian called Pasquale Lattuneddu. For years, he has whispered that ‘Bernie will live for ever…120 or 130 eassssily…we’ll all be gone before he is.’ And there appeared to be some strange truth in Lattuneddu’s prediction when Ecclestone resumed control of Formula One after striking the deal of a lifetime of extraordinary deals: paying £60million to a German court to stop a bribery trial that could have put him in prison for 10 years. VIDEO Scroll down for Bernie Ecclestone appearing at £60m bribery settlement . Walking free: Bernie Ecclestone has seen the bribery case against him dropped following a settlement . Free man: Ecclestone settled on a £60million pay-out and can now fully focus on running Formula One . Ecclestone left, as the court spokesman said, a ‘free man’ and ‘no conclusion on guilt or innocence’. He flew straight back to London to ‘do what I do best, which is run F1’. Ecclestone, who is 83, said he would resume his place on the board that runs F1, Delta Topco, having relinquished his position earlier this year to fight the charges in Munich. There is no legal impediment to his doing so. VIDEO F1 boss Ecclestone pays to end bribery trial . Opportunistic: Ecclestone signs an autograph for a fan after attending his trial in Munich . All over: Ecclestone stands in an elevator as he prepares to leave the court following his case being dropped . So Ecclestone seems to have won once again despite opposition factions within the business and the teams. He remains a shareholder and works as F1 chief executive of CVC, the private equity firm who have made more than five times their outlay since buying into the sport in 2005-6. So what lies ahead for Formula One? There are those who think that Ecclestone is too old, or too dictatorial or too reluctant to market the sport in a modern world of social media. The detractors have pointed to falling TV audiences this season. Ecclestone enraged many by saying that the internet was a passing fad. It is this kind of old-fashioned view that the modernisers will hope he addresses now he is firmly back in his office. Thinking: Ecclestone stands in the background as his lawyers discuss matters before the case was dropped . Despite the grumbling, it remains true that Ecclestone has created a phenomenon in four decades running the sport. Much of the wealth has been accrued through TV rights deals. He has also raised massive revenues from nations or individuals who want to stage a race. He has, as one very senior figure in the ownership of the sport told me, won round several of his detractors because he makes ‘palaces out of sand’ — races in the desert, or indeed in Baku, where the calendar takes grand prix racing in 2016. At every race we hear debates in the paddock about how to improve ‘the show’. I hope Ecclestone proceeds with caution in this area. The sport should be wary of gimmicks, such as double points for the last race, that devalue the world championship. It should be bolder, and replace two of the practice sessions with races — not championship races with points counting towards the drivers’ title, but fun, short sprints of, say, 20 laps, perhaps with reverse grids — something that should never be contemplated for the main race on Sundays. Ecclestone is in favour of elitism, making the drivers nearly unavailable to the public. There is a fashion to decry this, and a call for fans to be allowed into or closer to the paddock and garages. Fine, if it can be done without damaging the allure and glamour of the spectacle. It is to these challenges, and more, that Ecclestone returned to his desk.","Bernie Ecclestone free to focus on running F1 after bribery case dropped .

"Former Voice Australia star Sabrina Batshon has been granted an interim apprehended violence order against her former friend and actor Alex Haddad, after a court hearing today heard Haddad's actions had left her 'petrified to wake up each morning'. Ms Batshon has been embroiled in a public spat with Mr Haddad, who took out his own AVO against the singer in July. The feud between the pair escalated until they appeared in a tell-all interview on Nine's A Current affair on Monday night. Sabrina Batshon was accompanied by boyfriend Simon Saade as she fronted Parramatta court on Tuesday . Ms Batshon said in court today that Haddad tried to blacklist her and destroy her career, as well as making threatening calls to her friends and family . Ms Batshon fronted Parramatta Local Court, in Sydney's west, on Tuesday after she too made an application for an AVO against Mr Haddad. But Mr Haddad was not present in court. His lawyer Leon Apostle said his client was not at court because 'the matter has received a lot of media.' Ms Batshon told the court that Mr Haddad got close to her when he heard she was set to appear on The Voice Australia. He would drive her to and from auditions and acted as her support, the court heard. 'He threatened to destroy my career' the voice singer said in her application to the court. 'He has blacklisted me.' 'He made phone calls to my father and best friend 'Jason' and I have evidence he threatened me,' she told the court. Ms Batshon said she was a former friend of Mr Haddad and was 'never' in a relationship with him. She said she had an argument at her home after she decided to take another friend, Joe Davidson, with her to voice auditions. 'He followed through with blackmail to try an destroy my career. He wanted to be in a relationship with me.' Magistrate Joan Baptie read a string of text messages submitted by Batshon's lawyer that were from Mr Haddad trying to discredit Ms Batshon. An emotional Ms Batshon also told the court Facebook posts by Mr Haddad were also threatening to her career and that he made numerous false claims. Haddad was spotted alone in Newtown at the time he was expected to appear at Parramatta Court . Mr Haddad (pictured) was not present in court: his lawyer Leon Apostle said his client was not at court because 'the matter has received a lot of media' An emotional Ms Batshon also told the court Facebook posts by Mr Haddad were threatening to her career . The pair have been embroilled in a public spat since July, when Mr Haddad took out his own AVO against the singer . 'He claimed somebody raped me, I had to clear his name, it wasn't true,' Batshon said. 'He said I sleep around.' While Haddad had never assaulted the singer she says: 'I am petrified waking up every morning.' Mr Haddad declined to give evidence in court, but his lawyer Leon Apostle challenged Ms Batshon's credibility. 'This whole ordeal is just for people to feel sorry for you,' he said. 'No of course not,' she replied. Magistrate Joan Baptie said it was appropriate to grant an interim order based on Batshon's testimony. 'It is clear on some material, mutual mud slinging between parties and includes some immaturity with both parties.' Outside court Me Haddad's lawyer said his client was harmless. 'Thank god we have a judiciary that will listen to both sides before reaching a conclusion,' said Mr Apostle. Ms Batshon said she was happy with the outcome and that the judge was fair. 'He can't come near me or my loved ones and continue what he's been doing, going to the media' she said. 'Any move forward is a step in the right direction' 'I do think Alex is genuinely unwell, I hope for his sake he stops this' she said. The matter is again up for mention in court on November 18th.","Sabrina Batshon has been embroiled in a public spat with Alex Haddad, who took out his own AVO against the singer in July .

"Film buffs won't have to wait for the latest blockbusters to hit Australian cinemas as the nation's largest film distribution companies will fast-track the release most major film titles. As part of a new strategy by Village Roadshow, movies will be either be shown before, simultaneously or soon after they are screened in the US. CEO and co-chairman Graham Burke announced the plan on Tuesday, which will drop the traditional release pattern to combat rapidly increasing online piracy.

Village Roadshow CEO  Graham urke . He admitted that the decision to hold back on the release of The LEGO Movie had been a 'painful' mistake. 'We estimate that (piracy of) The LEGO Movie cost somewhere between $3.5 million and $5m in sales and of course this is straight to the bottom line and the Australian Tax Office,' Mr Burke told The Australian. 'It was doubly painful because Lego was produced in Australia. Piracy not only impacts profits, but if unchecked will ­impede new business models and growth.' However he also revealed some titles will be delayed due to school holidays, competitive release patterns and lack of screens, if.com.au reports.

"Brendan Rodgers believes Alberto Moreno will be a terrific signing for the club as the Sevilla defender finalises his switch to Anfield.

"Three couples, who are determined to build the restaurant of their dreams, have turned to crowd sourcing to fund their $100,000 project. The entrepreneurs, who also co-own another bar in Perth, have so far raised over $80,000 for the creation of Lucky Chan's Laundry and Noodle Bar which, if successful, will be the first permanent crowd-funded restaurant in Australia. One of the creative minds behind the community project, Andrew Bennet, told Daily Mail Australia that donors were not contributing to a charity, but would have their money returned to them in another form. Scroll down for video . Lucky Chan's Laundry and Noodle Bar will be the first permanent crowd-funded restaurant in Australia if the future owners, three couples from Perth, reach their target . 'Every dollar that people contribute is matched, dollar for dollar with a reward or a giveback. They are given an opportunity to redeem that value at the restaurant when it opens,' Mr Bennet said. 'That's really important as to why we've been so successfully.' The 32-year-old said that donation options start from as little as $5, with which donors will have their name painted on the 'Great Wall of Chan'. 'The top tier pledge level is $20,000 and we have actually had two different people take that on,' he said. 'One of them is a lovely couple who are getting married next year and wanted something different for their wedding reception, location and theme. We'll be closing down the venue just for them, as we won't take bookings like this in the future. With only 15 days to go, the team of entrepreneurs have raised more than $80,000 of their $100,000 limit . One of the future owners of the restaurant, Andrew Bennet (right), said the crowd-sourcing project was not just about sourcing money, but also about hearing design and food ideas from the future customers . 'We are also taking the chance to sit down with them and work through wedding cocktails and food for the one off because we've been blown away by their support.' One of the most popular pledges is the Lucky Chan Hot Date, designed for a couple to donate $55 towards the building of the restaurant and in return receive a romantic dinner and drinks for two to the value of $85. But it's not just about sourcing money, Mr Bennet explains. Even if the owners don't reach their  $100,000 target in the next 15 days – which would mean they don't receive a cent of the pledged donations, Lucky Chan's will still come to life. The future owners of the bar have been using their donations' page and social media to ask people what they want the future bar and restaurant to serve and even look like and also to create excitement about the coming venue. The future site of Lucky Chan's: The restaurant and bar will be designed to resemble a Chinese laundry that has been haphazardly converted into a speak-easy . 'On the hard dollar side of things, one hundred thousand isn't going to be the complete funding budget for project,' Mr Bennet said. 'The reality is that if the Kickstarter campaign didn't go ahead, Lucky Chan's will still be a reality – perhaps a smaller less compelling vision than what we had planned, but with Kickstarter it will be enriched by not only financial support but their thoughts and opinions and the feedback about what they want to see when it opens. 'The feedback we've been getting most is about our opening hours. A lot of restaurants and bars close at midnight and from day one of our campaign people were telling us they wanted a late night option for a good quality meal and drink - and not just the hard core hospitality nerds but mums and dads and professionals. 'We've also had great feedback about the décor. We're planning to have a large open air courtyard at the top – so there have been suggestions on how to animate that space at night, like Chinese lanterns or kind of silent movie screen. So all these ideas that we haven't thought of is exactly why we caught these nets out and want to hear from our future customers.' The highest contributors include a couple who have donated $20,000 for Lucky Chan's to be built, and in return will have their wedding reception at the venue . 'People end up feeling like they own a bit of their own bar, which is exactly what we wanted.' If all goes to plan, Luck Chan's will open in early January of 2015 as a quirky restaurant and bar that resembles an old Chinese Laundry that has been haphazardly reorganised into a speak-easy. 'The idea was to create a late night venue in North Bridge which paid homage to the history and culture of the Asian migration in the area,' Mr Bennet said. 'One of the industries that many brought with them was the concept of the Chinese laundry and in some small areas during the 1900s, there were something like between 50 and 70 of them. 'We are not pretending that we are doing an authentic Asian restaurant by any means, we just want to pay respect and homage to deep flavours and tastes that went before us.'","Lucky Chan's Laundry and Noodle Bar will be the first permanent crowd-funded restaurant in Australia if the future owners reach their target .

"Chris O'Hare got Great Britain off to a medal-winning start on the final day of the European Championships, taking 1,500 metres bronze in a race which Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad made up for the heartache of losing his steeplechase crown earlier in the week. The controversial 29-year-old made headlines across the world on Thursday evening after bizarrely choosing to remove his top as he entered the home straight, sticking it in his mouth and waving to the crowd. Mekhissi-Benabbad easily won the 3,000m steeplechase but, after an initial yellow card for show-boating, had the title stripped after Spain launched an appeal citing rules on clothing, shoes and bibs. Bronze: Chris O'Hare earned a bronze medal for Great Britain on the final day of the European Championships . The Frenchman looked noticeably downbeat and run-down as he qualified from the 1,500m semi-finals, but was back to his normal, extrovert self in Sunday's final. Making his move with 400m to go, Mekhissi-Benabbad raced to the line, beating his chest down the home straight to win the 1,500m gold in three minutes 45.60 seconds. This time he kept his vest on at the end of a race which O'Hare managed to win bronze for Great Britain in three mins 46.18 secs. Team-mate Charlie Grice crossed the line 12th having taken a tumble, while Ireland's Paul Robinson came home fourth. Ciaran O'Lionaird did not finish after taking a nasty-looking blow. Race: the gold medal was won by Mahiedine Makhissi-Benabbad, who made up for his steeplechase fiasco . 'I think I could have challenged Mekhissi-Benabbad if I'd have been closer to him in the final 200m,' O'Hare said after the race. 'His 3,000m steeplechase disqualification was silly regardless of his behaviour - he ran a superb race against a great field here today so fair play to him. 'This year's been a bit of a mess so this medal is a great outcome for me. I'm done with my season now, I'll have a few days off now and then get ready for the cross country season.' Great Britain added another bronze to their collection shortly afterwards in the women's 4x400m. Congratulations: Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad congratulates O'Hare after the race . As expected, individual world champion Christine Ohuruogu was left out in preference of the less experienced members of the team and they did not disappoint. Eilidh Child, fresh from winning 400m hurdles gold on Saturday, handed the baton over in the lead after the first leg, with Kelly Massey not fretting when she dropped down the pack as Shana Cox also got the baton in first place. Margaret Adeoye ran a fine last leg but was unable to sneak a top-two place, with France edging Ukraine to the line in a European-leading time of 3:24.27.","Chris O'hare has won 1500m bronze in Zurich .

"The Athens Olympics were meant to be a celebration of the Games' history, as the spiritual home of Olympic sport hosted the world in the XXVIII Olympiad. The Greeks poured around €9billion (£7.13billion) into building new stadiums and infrastructure, and despite disputes and delays in the run-up to the event, put on a successful games. However, a decade on, the stands lie empty, completely unused and allowed to fall into disrepair, as the global economic crisis meant the country's government were unable to invest in the upkeep of the Olympic venues. Nothing left: A swimming pool from the Olympic village is filled with dirty rainwater and debris a decade after the Athens games . Contrast: Athens' open-air pool during the 2004 Summer Olympics, when it saw Michael Phelps win six gold medals and break two World Records . Welcome home: The Games' motto is one of the few remains left standing in an Olympic park that has almost entirely fallen into disrepair . Empty: The diving venue, where Leon Taylor and Peter Waterfield won silver for Team GB, is now in a sorry state in the Greek capital . Deserted village: The Olympic village that hosted the athletes just ten years ago is now a desolate wasteland covered in graffiti . Falling down: Paint peeling, seats ripped out and benches collapsing, the aquatic centre is a shadow of its former self . Life's a beach: The stand built to house beach volleyball is still standing, but the sand in front of it is overgrown with plants . As it was: The Olympic beach volleyball stadium, complete with extra temporary stands, as it stood during the 2004 games .

Team GB won nine Gold medals during the competition, among which the most memorable were middle-distance runner Kelly Holmes' 800m and 1500m double. In the velodrome Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy each won their first Olympic golds as Great Britain recorded their best medal haul in the modern era. The mens 4x100m relay team of Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish, Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis won gold on the track as the British quartet saw off an American team which included newly crowed individual Olympic champion Justin Gaitlin. It was also the games that launched boxer Amir Khan into the limelight, his silver medal in the lightweight division leading to a professional career, while . Elsewhere in Athens a 19-year-old Michael Phelps won the first six of his record 22 gold medals in the pool, setting two World Records in the process. The games were not without their controversy - most notably when home favourites Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou pulled out of the championships after missing a doping test. Remains: This is all that's left of the Olmypic Canoe and Kayak Slalom centre where Team GB picked up one silver and two bronze medals . Back then: Britain's Campbell Walsh competes in the final of Olympic Games men's Kayak K1 race in the Hellinoko complex, where he won a silver medal . Torn apart: The Olympic Baseball stadium is now little more than an overgrown field with a broken big screen, surrounded by unused seats . Home run: The baseball stadium as it stood in 2004 - now it is an overgrown ruin . Rapid: The Canoe and Kayak course was still full of water a year after the games. Today it is completely dry, another relic of the 9bn Olympics . All dried up: The Helliniko Olympic complex, which included the canoeing course and the baseball stadium, now lies deserted . But despite the shame of their celebrated athletes, the astronomical cost, and the building difficulties which threatened the games even before they started, the Athens Olympics were seen as a success both in Greece and internationally. However, Greece was hit hard by the global financial crisis and, with no real post-games plan, the state-of-the-art venues were abandoned. Ten years on, they are the sad legacy of the event that was supposed to welcome the Olympic Games home. Load of rubbish: The swimming pool that once hosted international athletes has now become a rubbish dump in Athens . No village people: What was once a luxury hub for the summer games is now a deserted shell in an overgrown wasteland . What's the score? The seats are still in place at the Olympic Hockey Stadium but the broken score-board tells its own story . All over: The beach volleyball venue is no longer used, another of the Olympic venues that has been allowed to fall by the wayside . In use: The beach volleyball stadium has fallen entirely out of use since the end of the games ten years ago . No one left: The derelict stands of the Olympic Baseball stadium are a symbol of the games' decay as economic hardship prevented Greece from maintaining their venues . Broken down: The Taekwondo Stadium is still standing, but the roads outside are covered in rubble and the venue itself is fenced off to visitors . Ruins: Parts of the Athletic Centre in Athens are entirely unrecognisable from the slick venues that the world saw a decade ago .","Games legacy almost non-existant with stadiums falling into disrepair .

"The sister of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, who is fighting in Syria with Islamic State forces, has condemned her brother's actions as 'abhorrent'. This week Sharrouf's older sister Damour Sharrouf and her husband Ahmed Alwash are again under scrutiny over their business Bisotel Rieh, located in Lakemba in Sydney's west. The  Fairfax Media reported that proceedings have commenced against the remittance firm, after it was suspended late last month amid accusations it was funneling money overseas to fund terrorism in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Khaled Sharrouf's (right) sister Damour has described her brother's actions as 'abhorrent' and 'repugnant to Australian law and values' The nation's financial intelligence unit, Austrac, announced the suspension following information that as much as $20 million had been sent to Turkey and Lebanon. On Thursday Bisotel Rieh released a statement confirming the Austrac investigations and the links to Sharrouf, who made headlines when he posted a shocking picture of his young son brandishing a severed head earlier this year. 'Bisotel acknowledges that Ms Sharrouf's brother, Khaled Sharrouf, is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation and has in recent months engaged in shocking behaviour that is repugnant to Australian law and values, and that Ms Sharrouf herself finds abhorrent,' the statement read in part, according to Fairfax. Ms Sharrouf's and her husband Ahmed Alwash's business Bisotel Rieh (pictured) had action launched against it after it was accused of funding terrorism . It also revealed: issues within the company had been identified by Austrac in relation to: 'existing systems, practices and procedures for managing the risk that it may, inadvertently or not, facilitate terrorism funding'. Bisotel Rieh, which means magic carpet, also said their registration had not been cancelled and denied there were any allegations that the company, Ms Sharrouf or Mr Alwash financed any terrorism operations nor provided any money to Khaled Sharrouf. Sharrouf is one of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for Islamist groups in the Middle East, and drew international condemnation after he posted a revolting image of his son brandishing a decapitated head on social media in August. The nation's financial intelligence unit, Austrac, announced the suspension of Bisotel following information that as much as $20 million had been sent to Turkey and Lebanon . He fled to Syria via Malaysia using his brother's passport. The picture was captioned: 'that's my boy!' While about 60 Australians are fighting in Iraq and Syria with groups such as Islamic State, another 100 are believed to be providing support from Australia. Earlier this month the sister of another Australian terrorist, Mohamed Elomar, was stopped at Sydney airport trying to board a flight to Dubai with her two children. The woman, who was not named, was questioned before she was released, but was not allowed to leave Australia. Sharouff is one of at least 60 Australians fighting alongside Islamic State militants in the Middle East .","The sister of Khaled Sharrouf has said her brother's actions are repugnant to Australian law and values .

"In north London, they perhaps hoped that he would never come back to the Barclays Premier League. At least, if he did, they hoped he would come back home to them at Arsenal. It was never likely, of course. Cesc Fabregas has always craved challenges and those who do so rarely go back, they only look forward. That is why Fabregas left Barcelona for Highbury in the first place. He was only 15. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cesc Fabregas's brilliant goals in pre-season . Running the show: Cesc Fabregas was Chelsea's star man in the Blues' win over Burnley on Monday night . You're welcome: Fabregas congratulates goalscorer Andre Schurrle having assisted the German . And that, of course, is why Fabregas - 27 now - considered a move to Manchester United last summer and finds himself at the heart of Jose Mourinho’s evolving midfield at Chelsea. They may never forgive him at Arsenal. At Chelsea, meanwhile, they will merely learn to love him if he continues to play as he did here. Of course, it is peculiar to see him in Chelsea blue. We will get used to it soon enough, though, if he produces more moments like the one that lit up the first half at Turf Moor. Pass of the season: Fabregas played forward the perfect ball for Schurrle to score and give Chelsea the lead . The technical levels of our sport continue to improve, despite what the romantics say. Still, though, there are some things only certain players can do, even at this exalted level of the game. Only a tiny percentage of Premier League players, for example, would even have seen Andre Schurrle’s run on the periphery of his vision when the ball was played to Fabregas on the edge of the penalty area midway through the half with the game poised at 1-1. Even fewer could have picked the pass, first time with his right foot, that allowed the German to advance on goal and score. It was a ‘blink and you will miss it’ moment — the kind of pass you will only see a handful of times each season. Fabregas (right) was pretty imperious all night and was certainly helped on his Chelsea league debut by a midfield that provided him with willing runners and angles throughout the game. When you can see things and pass the ball as well as he can, you need moving targets. This is what Fabregas had during his better years at Arsenal and, of course, his time back at Barcelona and with the Spanish national team in recent years. We have all seen him play as a ‘false nine’ for club and country in Spain but he will be glad to know that is not the role Mourinho has in mind for him at Stamford Bridge. Middle man: The Spaniard plays the ball forward under pressure from Burnley midfielder Dean Marney . ‘I know clearly the player he is,’ said Mourinho. ‘In Barcelona he was playing all over. Nine, fake nine, winger but he knows that I know his best position. He gives us what we need in midfield. He brings other people in.’ It may be too early to say this but there did appear to be signs that Chelsea will play a little more expansively over the next nine months than they did previously under Mourinho in either of his two tenures. If they do, Fabregas - anchored at the base of midfield on Monday night - will be key. Here, he pulled strings for the likes of Schurrle and Chelsea’s new centre forward Diego Costa and he was, on the whole, the best player in a pretty impressive Chelsea performance. Skills: Fabregas backheels the ball into Branislav Ivanovic's direction who crossed for Chelsea's opener . Precision: Fabregas played in Schurrle for the second with an exquisite through ball over the top of the defence . Curler: Fabregas sent in a perfect corner which was neatly converted by defender Ivanovic for the third . Certainly a midfield featuring players like Fabregas, Schurrle, Eden Hazard and the Brazilian Oscar seems set up to move the ball with a little more pace and imagination than some we have seen in the past. On Monday night it was a style of football that dazzled Burnley at times. Home manager Sean Dyche will not be too disheartened. The good news, he will have told his players, is that they only have to face Chelsea one more time this season. Burnley’s campaign will not stand or fall on the back of nights like these. Next weekend they go to Swansea and perhaps we will learn a little more about them there. On ‘Our Turf’ — as they have branded it — they scored first and briefly a dream loomed large. Fabregas was the man with the big pin, though, and when he burst the bubble he did so in a way that many people here will remember.

"Luis Suarez will train with his Barcelona team-mates on Friday after his ban for biting an opponent at the World Cup was relaxed. The Court of Arbritration for Sport (CAS) upheld his fourth-month ban from competitive football for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup but eased the conditions which mean Barcelona can officially present him at Nou Camp on Monday, when there will be a huge media presence. The 27-year-old is also able to play in friendly matches now and he will make his first appearance in Barcelona’s colours when they face Leon FC in the Joan Gampher trophy at Nou Camp the same evening. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez shove a camera out of his way as he leaves court . Ruling: CAS ruled that Luis Suarez can take part in training and friendly matches but didn't reduce his ban . The Uruguay striker, who moved to Barcelona from Liverpool for £75million last month, had been unable to train with his new team-mates or even set foot inside the Nou Camp under the original terms of suspension. Suarez had gone to the highest authority in sport, the Court of Arbitration, in an attempt to get them to overturn the punishment that was handed to him by FIFA in the wake of his outrageous behaviour during a Group D game in Natal in June. His representatives had argued that the punishment was too severe but CAS did not agree and insisted that he serve the suspension. He will miss eight La Liga matches and another three Champions League games. Switzerland-based CAS — an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations — said: ‘The sanctions imposed on the player by FIFA have been generally confirmed.’ Training: The Uruguayan forward has been training on his own since signing for Barcelona . Suarez, though, now has permission to train with Barcelona after CAS deemed some of the measures taken against him ‘excessive’ and he will link up with his new team-mates for the first time today when manager Luis Enrique puts on a session that is scheduled to start at 9.30am in Barcelona. Barcelona released a statement yesterday saying: ‘Following the announcement of the verdict by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding the appeal against the sanction imposed on Luis Suarez by FIFA, FC Barcelona hereby announces that the player will join the first team’s training session scheduled for tomorrow Friday at 9.30am in the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper. ‘Likewise, the public presentation of Suarez as a new FC Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou, on occasion of the Joan Gamper Trophy match.’ Incident: Luis Suarez was banned for four months by FIFA after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup . Suarez remains banned for Uruguay’s next eight competitive matches and will miss next year’s Copa America and some World Cup qualifying matches. Still, the court confirmed he is allowed to play non-competition friendly matches under the terms of FIFA’s disciplinary rules. Uruguay have friendlies scheduled for September 5 in Japan and September 9 in South Korea and Suarez is eligible to play in those matches. It is the third time Suarez had been found guilty of biting an opponent in his career. While he was at Ajax, Suarez bit PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in November 2010, and while at Liverpool he bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013. Punishment: Although Suarez didn't even receive a booking during the match, he was later banned by FIFA .

Travis, 69, accused the authorities of wasting ‘millions’ on the investigation into a string of allegations against him spanning several decades.

"North Korea held talks with a UN human rights investigator for first the first time in ten years, in a charm offensive designed to nullify attempts to prosecute its leaders for crimes against civilians. UN human rights chief Marzuki Darusman said he was surprised and gratified North Korean officials had raised the possibility of allowing him to visit their country during their meeting. But he said the prospect of such a trip remains deeply uncertain because leader Kim Jong Un was insisting he drop moves in a UN resolution to prosecute the country in the International Criminal Court over its human rights record. Scroll down for video . Hail our dear leader: North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un attends a women's football match between the national team and the Wolmido team at the remodelled May Day Stadium in Pyongyang . Happy clapper: North Korea held talks with a UN human rights investigator for the first time in ten years in a charm offensive designed to nullify attempts to prosecute its leaders for crimes against its civilians . A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, published in February, detailed wide-ranging abuses, including the use of prison camps, torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities. Darusman said he conveyed North Korea's message to the European Union and Japan, which drafted the resolution. He said he would not be involved in any further discussions between the parties on the issue. Darusman met with four North Korean officials on Monday, the first such encounter since the office of special rapporteur for human rights in North Korea was created 10 years ago. He said he was surprised when the officials mentioned the possibility of a visit, which would be a breakthrough in international efforts to have a first-hand look at the way the deeply impoverished but nuclear-armed country treats its citizens. He said the North Koreans also floated the possibility of a visit by the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. 'It's quite a big jump for North Korea,' Darusman said at a news conference. 'It's a very pragmatic step they are taking.' But Darusman said the North Koreans made clear they want mention of the ICC dropped from the resolution 'so that they would be in a position to issue an invitation.' A U.N. commission of inquiry warned leader Kim Jong Un in a letter earlier this year that he may be held accountable for orchestrating widespread crimes against civilians . The nonbinding resolution, which could be introduced to the UN General Assembly next month, would urge the Security Council to consider referring North Korea's situation to the ICC, as well as press for targeted sanctions. It doesn't name names but a UN commission of inquiry warned leader Kim Jong Un in a letter earlier this year that he may be held accountable for orchestrating widespread crimes against civilians. Darusman said the North Koreans were upset about the mention of Kim because 'it touches on the sanctity' of the leader. An EU spokesperson did not discount the possibility of addressing the North's concerns. 'The objective of this text is to bring change to the human rights situation in the country, by which we mean real improvements on the ground,' the spokesperson said. 'It is with this objective in mind that the EU and its co-sponsors will look at any proposals made by the DPRK.' A Japanese official said the government in Tokyo has been made aware of the message conveyed by Daruman 'but I cannot predict whether the resolution will be modified or not.' A still from video reportedly showing a prisoner being abused by North Korean officials. A UN Commission of Inquiry report published in February detailed wide-ranging abuses, including the use of prison camps, torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities . The official said 'our policy is for now unchanged' and Japan would continue seeking support from U.N. members for the resolution. The officials both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on private discussions by name. Darusman, who has been special rapporteur since 2010, said it is 'out of question' for the resolution to drop calls for officials to be held accountable for human rights atrocities but he spoke of the possibility of 'reformulating' the language. When asked whether that could mean dropping direct mention of the ICC he said, 'it depends on how you formulate that.' The North has been on the defensive since the U.N. commission of inquiry released a harshly critical report accusing the regime of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of South Koreans, Japanese and others. That report recommended that the North's situation be referred to the ICC, something Daruman backed in the annual report he presented Monday to the General Assembly's commission on human rights. Even if the Security Council were to take up the matter, China would likely veto any resolution that included a referral of its North Korean ally to the ICC. But the North Koreans have engaged in an unusually public diplomatic blitz to stop the idea from even reaching a vote. Choe Myong Nam, a North Korean foreign ministry official in charge of human rights issues, told The Associated Press on Monday that no date has been fixed for a visit from Darusman, but his country is looking for a 'new and objective report' on North Korea's human rights situation. 'Previous reports he has prepared have been based on rumors and fabrications, as well as distortions,' he said. Phones rang unanswered Tuesday at North Korea's UN Mission.","Kim Jong Un wants UN attempt to prosecute NK over rights abuses dropped .

"Arsene Wenger remains suspicious about Manchester City’s swoop to sign Frank Lampard before he begins life at New York City, their sister club in the USA. The Premier League champions confirmed on Wednesday that Lampard has joined the club on a six-month contract until January 31 when he will move on to New York City FC for the MLS season. Lampard's deal to the Etihad has been questioned by some following City's relationship with the American franchise, with Wenger one of those to express his displeasure at the transfer. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Arsene Wenger: Frank Lampard loan raises FFP suspicions' Sceptical: Frank Lampard's (centre) Manchester City move has been queried by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . Unhappy: Wenger has raised concerns about City's move for Lampard as a way of moving around FFP . Earlier in August, the Arsenal boss raised concerns that the England international's deal is a way for City to navigate UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. The 64-year-old re-laid those fears sarcastically again on Thursday, when asked about his thoughts on the transfer. ‘It was a surprise that he went to Manchester City,' Wenger said. ‘He went to New York first and the shortest way to Manchester is not to travel to New York first. If you look at a map there is a shorter way.’ Lampard became a free agent in the summer after 13 years at Chelsea during which he became the club’s record goal scorer. The Chelsea legend is believed to harbour doubts about playing his former side and to avoid any embarrassment, City are happy to let him go to America before the end of January in order to begin pre-season work for the MLS which starts in early March. They face Chelsea at home on September 21. Lampard trained for the first time with his new City team-mates in traditional soggy Manchester conditions on Wednesday and after a brief team meeting outside, moved inside to the club’s Carrington training centre to do gym work.

"Eric Dier joined Tottenham to play in matches like Saturday's London derby victory over West Ham, but did not expect to be the man scoring the last-gasp winner. The England Under-21 international moved to White Hart Lane from Sporting Lisbon over the summer and made an instant impact as he grabbed the only goal of the game against their local rivals.

Dier was delighted with his start at Spurs and was happy to be involved on the opening day of the new Barclays Premier League season. 'I was just really happy to play to be honest and to score on top of that, well, I never imagined it,' he said. 'I saw the keeper coming out in the corner of my eye and I wanted to touch the ball around him and put it in. It all happened really quickly. I didn't get any time to think about it and that was probably a good thing. 'I really enjoyed it and it's why I wanted to come here, to play in games like this. I'm really happy to be here.'

'This is a picture of what is our philosophy, our style,' he told Tottenham's official website. 'It is important as it shows our ambition and our philosophy to try and win. 'He was brilliant, but not only him, the whole team. It was an unbelievable win because last season we came here and left with zero points.'

West Ham handed two of their own summer signings their debuts as Cheikhou Kouyate and Aaron Cresswell were named in Sam Allardyce's starting line-up.

The 24-year-old was named in the Professional Footballers' Association Championship Team of the Year last season but was left deflated following his impressive debut. 'I had all my family here and it was a proud moment for me personally,' he said. 'But it's not about me, it's about the team and getting the three points. It's not personal, it's not about individual performances. The first thing you look at is the result and we didn't get that on Saturday, so I'm very disappointed.' The Hammers face another London derby when they travel to Crystal Palace next weekend and Cresswell is keen to get the season up and running.

"FA chairman Greg Dyke has committed to funding independent research into head injuries in the sport amid growing concerns over an alarmingly high incidence of dementia among former professional players. Dyke has met the family of former England striker Jeff Astle — who died in 2002 aged 59 from early on-set dementia which a coroner found was caused by heading footballs — and he apologised for the FA’s and PFA’s failure to deliver promised research while providing assurances more will be done to tackle the problem. ‘It was reassuring to hear Mr Dyke taking this issue so seriously,’ said Astle’s widow Laraine, who is leading the ‘Justice for Jeff’ campaign calling for stricter concussion measures. ‘He assured us more would be done in the future to understand the extent of this issue and protect future generations.’ Head on: Alvaro Pereira clashes with Raheem Sterling during England's encounter with Uruguay . Last week the FA’s head of medical services Dr Ian Beasley told Sportsmail that football will face a ‘tsunami’ of legal claims if concussion protocols continue to be ignored — with a string of high-profile incidents during this summer’s World Cup and last season’s Barclay’s Premier League serving to highlight the issue. ‘We’re not even counting (head injuries) properly yet,’ admitted Beasley. ‘We want robust research that gives us some idea of what’s going on. ‘The FA should not run the research. We need to present ourselves to a big academic body and say “help us formulate some research which will give us some answers as to what happens on a football field”. Out cold: Pereira lies on the field after a collision as teammates Diego Godin and Fernando Muslera look on . This week it emerged that as many as six of Aston Villa’s 1957 FA Cup winning side may have died suffering from dementia while the Mail on Sunday has also been inundated with calls and letters from families of ex-professionals with the disease. In June, Professor Willie Stewart, a world-leading neuropathologist who accompanied Astle’s family to Wembley to meet Dyke last week, re-examined the former West Bromwich Albion striker’s brain and confirmed he died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) — a form of dementia caused by repeated head injuries and found in former boxers, american footballers and rugby players. ‘This is potentially a significant public health issue and needs to be treated as such,’ said Stewart. Floored: Hugo Lloris was concussed against Everton in November after clashing with Romelu Lukaku . On Saturday, West Brom announced they will dedicate a home game to Astle in a bid to help raise awareness of head injuries in football while a picture of the club’s record scorer will be displayed on the big screen at the Hawthorns in the ninth minute of every home game this season. While reassured by West Brom and the FA response, Astle’s family have been angered by a contradictory interview given by PFA chairman Gordon Taylor on Wednesday. In the talksport interview Taylor claimed an unpublished study from 2002 — which the FA insist was never completed — showed ‘no causal link’ between head injuries in football and dementia. But while denying a link exists, Taylor added that professional footballers ‘know the risks’ and pointed to boxers continuing to box despite tragic cases. Taylor’s comments were branded ‘irresponsible’ and ‘ill-informed’ by experts. Sportsmail has also learned that Uruguay defender Alvaro Pereira, who was knocked unconscious against England during the World Cup but allowed to play on, has suffered complications from the injury and was last week knocked out again playing for his club Sao Paulo in Brazil.","Greg Dyke commits to funding independent research into head injuries .

"Leading GPs are in revolt over a controversial NHS scheme to pay them £55 for every new case of dementia they record. They branded it ‘unethical’ and warn it will lead to patients being wrongly diagnosed, with ‘truly tragic consequences’. The scheme was launched by NHS England last month to boost worryingly low detection rates of dementia – currently less than half of cases are picked up. Leading GPs are in revolt over a controversial NHS scheme to pay them £55 for every new case of dementia they record . Practices will be paid £55 for every new case recorded until April. But more than 50 leading GPs, academics and campaigners have written to the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, and Alistair Burns, the national clinical director for dementia, voicing ‘serious concerns’. In a joint letter, published in the BMJ, they warn that ‘misdiagnosis is a real possibility’ as dementia is difficult to confirm in the early stages and often based on a doctor’s opinion. They fear it could lead to patients being wrongly labelled as having the illness which would incur ‘truly tragic consequences’, as the diagnosis would cause huge anxiety and distress for patients and their families and it could be years before mistakes were realised. It goes on to say that the scheme sets a ‘dangerous precedent’ and risks undermining patients’ trust. The letter was written by Dr Martin Brunet, a GP from Guildford, Surrey, who is regarded as an authority on dementia, and signed by Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, as well as a number of Oxford and Cambridge academics. The homes of patients going to hospital after falls should be checked for hazards such as loose carpets, clutter and cables, say health watchdogs . The homes of patients going to hospital after falls should be checked for hazards such as loose carpets, clutter and cables, say health watchdogs. New guidelines also tell staff to look for other risks like low tables, baths which are hard to get out of and even pets. The assessments should be carried out each time an elderly person falls and sees a GP or hospital doctor, says NICE. The watchdogs said falls are the leading cause of death in the over-75s and cost the NHS an estimated £2.3billion a year. Almost a third of the over-65s fall over at least once a year and 1 in 20 need to go to hospital. The tests and any necessary action are carried out by specialists, including nurses working for NHS trusts. NICE added that patients prone to falling should be referred for exercises to improve balance, like tai chi and yoga. Professor Gillian Leng, NICE deputy chief executive, said: ‘Every hospital fall costs on average £1,215. If we can reduce falls, people not only get safer care but it could also help achieve cost savings.’ Dr Brunet said last night: ‘They shouldn’t be asking us to do this and I really don’t want to have anything to do with this money at all. ‘We shouldn’t be in a position where money comes into the moment of diagnosis – there shouldn’t be incentives.’ Other leading GPs who have put their names to the letter include Iona Heath, former president of the Royal College of GPs and Laurence Buckman, previously chairman of the GPs committee at the British Medical Association. Dr Martin McShane, NHS England’s national clinical director for people with long-term-conditions, said: ‘Our aim is that every patient with dementia gets the best treatment and the right support as early as possible.’","Scheme would see GPs paid £55 for every new case of dementia they record .

"Australia's top female criminal prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, will not face a scheduled inquiry by corruption body ICAC due to start on Monday, as a judge has delayed her bid to have the probe into allegations of perverting the course of justice halted. The corruption watchdog was due to open its three-day inquiry into the silk on Monday over allegations she and her son Stephen Wyllie told his girlfriend Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in May. After the allegations were aired, Ms Cunneen sought urgent action in the Supreme Court to shut the inquiry down. But Justice Cliff Hoeben said on Friday that he was unable to hand down a decision before the weekend, standing it over until Monday at 2pm. ICAC barrister Jeremy Kirk SC initially said the commission would be willing to hold off launching its hearing until 3pm on Monday - an hour after Justice Hoeben's expected decision. Scroll down for video . Top prosecutor: Lawyers for Margaret Cunneen, SC, a familiar figure in Sydney courts prosecuting gang rapists and murderers, have taken action against corruption body ICAC over claims she instructed her son's girlfriend to fake chest pains to beat a drink driving breath test . Keep private life private: Margaret Cunneen, who has launched the court action with her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilley (both pictured, above) contends that the corruption body has no business investigating matters concerning her private life . 'I think we have to be sensible and mature. There shouldn't be a rush,' he told the court. Once the decision was handed down on Monday, it was likely either party would appeal it, he said. Following a short break, Mr Kirk said the commission ""would not commence the public hearing prior to 10am on Tuesday"". Meanwhile, it was announced on Friday that Ms Cunneen had been elected to the NSW Bar Association's governing body, the Bar Council. In a show of support by her colleagues, the 55-year-old deputy senior crown prosecutor garnered the second-highest number of votes with 387 nods, behind Jane Needham SC's 441. Speaking outside court, Mr Moses said his client 'certainly got good support from members of the bar in terms of the vote'. Mr Moses has previously attacked the ICAC's pursuit of Ms Cunneen, saying the watchdog had gone beyond its jurisdiction. But Mr Kirk said the ICAC had a duty to investigate allegations she had perverted the course of justice because she was a public official. On Thursday, Ms Cunneen's counsel told the court  ICAC had no business investigating her private life. Ms Cunneen launched the urgent action along with Stephen Wyllie, 26 and 25-year-old girlfriend, Ms Tilley. Under fire: Stephen Wyllie (pictured, right), Ms Cunneen's 26-year-old son and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilly, 25 (above, left) are parties in the NSW Supreme Court action proceeding against the Independent Commission Against Corruption, for which a decision has been delayed by the judge . Arthur Moses, QC, that just because she holds public office doesn't mean she loses ' the rights of any other citizen when a matter arises in their personal life which has nothing to do with their public function'. He said neither Ms Cunneen nor any other public official including 'dog catchers and rangers' should lose their rights as private citizens. He said Ms Cunneen's role as deputy senior crown prosecutor was 'irrelevant' in the case of the car crash investigation. 'You have a state body making a decision impacting on the rights of citizens,' he said. Seeking documents: Margaret Cunneen, SC, has sought documents tracing the origin of the 'malicious complaint' which  landed her before a now delayed ICAC hearing . Since the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) launched action against Ms Cunneen last week, the widely respected NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor has received a groundswell of support from senior figures in the Australian legal fraternity. The ICAC hearing to investigate allegations of perverting the course of justice against Ms Cunneen is due to begin next Monday. The action, which has been described as a 'witch hunt',  could 'only be the result of a malicious complaint', the 55-year-old mother of three sons told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Cunneen launched her Supreme Court action on Tuesday to challenge the ICAC's power to investigate the claim, and to seek documents and a copy of the 'allegation or complaint' which set off the Commission's investigation into Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley. Mr Moses asked Justice Clifton Hoeben to eject ICAC from an active presence in the court proceedings, arguing it 'endangers the impartiality' of the Commission to rule in the looming hearing against Ms Cunneen. 'If the Commission becomes the protagonist it endangers their impartiality in subsequent hearings,' Mr Moses said. He said Ms Cunneen and her fellow applicants were demanding ICAC's reasons for mounting the investigation in the first place. 'They don't have any get out of jail free card,' he said, 'they are accountable like anybody else.' But counsel for ICAC, Mr Kirk, said the Commission would resist explaining in court as to why the charges of perverting the course of justice had been laid. Mr Moses is seeking an order restraining the ICAC from taking further steps in relation to the investigation, the reasons why the action was taken, and a declaration that the commission is acting outside its jurisdiction. The car crash at the centre of the ICAC claims happened on May 31, when Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time. Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured. The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident. Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash, which happened in May. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August. Since ICAC Launched its action, there has been an outcry from legal figures including former NSW State cabinet head, Professor Gary Sturgess, that the matter should have been investigated by police. Justice Hoeben has previously ruled against Margaret Cunneen, in 2007 when she was prosecuting in the retrial of convicted gang rapist Bilal Skaf. One of three judges on the Court of Criminal Appeal, Justice Hoeben ruled Ms Cunneen should not participate in the retrial because she had made public  statements about the case of Skaf and his fellow gang rapists which would compromise 'appropriate fairness and detachment'. In a separate action, the acting Inspector of the ICAC, prominent former Supreme Court judge David Levine, QC, announced he was conducting an audit into the Commission's action against Ms Cunneen.

"The multimillionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur accused of killing her 8-year-old son has admitted that despite fearing her ex-husband was plotting to kill her, she never reported the alleged threats to the police. Gigi Jordan is on trial in Manhattan for the 2010 killing of her autistic son Jude Mirra. She is accused of giving him a lethal cocktail of pills after – she claims – he suggested they kill themselves. In court on Wednesday, Jordan claimed that a bodyguard paid by her ex-husband and former business partner Ray Mirra to guard her and her son, had admitted he was actually there to kill her. Credibility gap: Gigi Jordan, right, pictured in court in 2011 with her attorney Alan Dershowitz, admitted in cour ton Wednesday that despite fearing her ex-husband was plotting to kill her, she never reported the alleged threats to the cops . ‘Did you ever call 911 about Mr. Harris being hired to kill you?’ Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos asked. ‘No,’ Jordan calmly told a skeptical courtroom, reports the New York Daily News. The credibility of her claims were further stretched when she admitted that she had never taken Ray Mirra off the emergency contact list at Jude's school - even after he had supposedly made death threats against her. Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn, deluxe Manhattan hotel room in February 2010. Jordan, who had also taken pills, was found on the floor nearby. She claims she tried to revive her son after he took the pills. Even though the second grader was unable to speak, she claims he urged her to take their lives by typing messages on her phone. She claims they both feared that her ex-husband, Raymond Mirra, would kill her after she learned he'd allegedly stolen millions from her. Mother and son: Jude Mirra was found dead in the $2,300-a-night hotel suite next to his mom in February 2010 . She said she did not know what would become of her son and feared that he would be left in the care of his biological dad who she accused of molesting him. Jude’s father Emil Tzekov has denied the allegation. 'Let's just get out while we can,' she claims Jude wrote on January 26, 2010, days before his body was found in the Peninsula Hotel. 'We r going to die anyway let's do it ourselves instead of them. 'We need to leave in a way we want to, not their way. Get the pills and try to do it.' She claims he wrote other messages claiming it wouldn't be murder and urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully. 'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.' Standing trial: Jordan claims that her son urged her to take their lives because he feared his father would kill them. She claims she feared for her life after learning her ex had stolen money from her . She testified that she was in a place of desperation because she lived in fear of her ex-husband, who had legally adopted Jude. 'I felt numb, defeated, I felt like it was over, it was done,' she said. 'There was nothing I could do.' In court on Thursday, she explained that she deliberately gave her son a lethal dose of prescription drugs and exchanged goodbyes but later tried to revive him. When she heard him struggle to breathe, 'my heart started pounding,' she testified. 'I raced over to him. I was crying and sobbing,' she said. 'I was crying and calling, 'Jude! Jude! Jude!' And then I started to attempt CPR.' Her tearful account provided a stark contrast to the prosecution's portrayal of her as a dark woman coolly killing her only son. Emergency responders' accounts of her condition have varied from incoherent to composed. Jordan says she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons: Some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed to keep her from raising allegations of financial malfeasance, and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him. Scene of the crime: Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue as a 'mercy killing'. Above, the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue . Devastating: Prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her  lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Above, emergency crews take away Jude's body . Killed: The boy was non-verbal, had PTSD and immune system abnormalities, his mother claims . 'I couldn't see any way out of the situation,' she said. Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime. Prosecutors say Jordan had no right to kill Jude, whatever her reasoning. They say Jordan climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open - so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest - and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe. Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, Bogdanos has said. She also wrote a suicide note. She has denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him. The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to Jordan. Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm. Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days.","Gigi Jordan, 54, is on trial in Manhattan for allegedly force-feeding her son, Jude Mirra, a fatal dose of pills in their luxury hotel suite in 2010 .

"Real Madrid's new signing James Rodriguez said winning the Golden Boot was a 'dream come true' as he posed with trophy. The 23-year-old posted pictures on Twitter with the trophy he won after scoring six times at the World Cup in Brazil. To celebrate, the Colombian midfielder will also play in gold boots this season - and is hoping they will extend his goal scoring run.

Winner: Rodriguez won the award despite Colombia only making it to the quarter-final, where they lost to Brazil . Comparison: Real Madrid fans will be hoping Rodriguez brings his World Cup form with him to La Liga . 'I was hoping to win it because I have always dreamed of winning something like this,' James told The Associated Press. 'This is also a source of happiness to my country Colombia. Because they gave me lot of strength so I could win the award.' James' first goal against Uruguay in the round of 16, when he chested the ball down and then volleyed it in, was voted the best of the competition. 'It was something so special that will always stay with me,' Rodriguez said about that spectacular strike. He also scored the second in a 2-0 win. 'Those are goals that stay in the memory. I think I left a mark with that goal. It made us pass to the quarterfinals and that was also historic,' he said. Now the 23-year-old must find a way into a star-studded attack already featuring Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. 'I have big hopes, but first I have to train well and earn my place in the team so I can play regularly and win titles,' James said. 'I am now in a club that is always hungry for titles. And I think that if you want to play here you must always keep a high level of performance. And I am prepared for that.' James' quest for playing time could be further complicated if Angel Di Maria stays with Madrid, with other clubs apparently put off by the large price tag for the Argentina winger. VIDEO Beckham backs Rodriguez as Real deal . Madrid: Despite only signing for Monaco last summer, Rodriguez moved to Real Madrid for £63m . Star: The 23-year-old's performances at the World Cup made him the tournament's hottest property . That would leave James competing for time with the versatile Argentine, Isco, Luka Modric and fellow new signing Toni Kroos. 'They are all stars,' James said. 'For me it is a pleasure to be with them. Even training with them. It is something unique and I hope I can play here together with them for many years.' Rodriguez signed from Monaco in a  £63m deal after a hugely impressive World Cup with Colombia, scoring against Greece, Cameroon, Japan, Uruguay (twice) and Brazil. The former Porto man is the first Colombian to win the award, and in doing so has joined an elite list of players that includes Ronaldo, Eusebio and Gerd Muller.

"He is still two months away from his official debut but Luis Suarez already knows how it feels to hear the Camp Nou chant his name. Now begins the difficult task of watching from the sidelines until October 25 as his new team-mates start the season without him. The former Liverpool striker was finally presented to Barcelona supporters at the Camp Nou on Monday night before Barça's 6-0 win over FC Leon, five weeks after signing for the club, and four days after his Fifa ban on all football activity was lifted.

He finally made his entrance against the Mexican side captained by former Barcelona defender Rafa Marquez on 76 minutes replacing Rafinha, by which time Barcelona were already 4-0 ahead and had  made nine changes. Messi scored after three minutes from a Neymar pass and Neymar netted on 12 minutes after a brilliant through ball from Andres Iniesta.

He confirmed his status as top scorer in pre-season converting Dani Alves’ cross after the Brazilian had been picked up by Rakitic’s perfect pass. Suarez came on with 14 minutes left but was joining the applause before he could really join the action as Munir scored again to make it 5-0 this time from a Sandro pass. Sandro completed the rout on the whistle scoring to make it 6-0. There were several neat passes from Suarez but there was a decidedly pre-season air to that last quarter of an hour just as there had been pre-match when he was introduced along with the entire squad to what was still a half empty stadium. New coach Luis Enrique was first out to a back-drop of fireworks and applause. His squad followed him one by one with right-back Martin Montoya introduced first followed by Pedro and Pique.

"Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is happy for Arsenal to win ugly, but knows they cannot afford too many costly defensive lapses if they are to challenge for the Premier League title. The Gunners came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday through a dramatic stoppage-time winner from Aaron Ramsey, which denied the managerless Eagles what would have been a well-deserved share of the points on the opening day of the new campaign. Despite all of their attacking potential Arsenal were again undone by some all-too-familiar slack defending, with Brede Hangeland heading home a near-post corner into the unguarded opposite side of the goal. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: They made it very difficult but we kept going . Scrappy: Arsenal beat Crystal Palace yesterday, but laboured to their victory . Arsene Wenger's side managed to level before half-time when Laurent Koscielny flicked home a deep free-kick from new £30million man Alexis Sanchez, but then struggled to break down a determined Palace side. Finally though Arsenal were able to open up the visitors, who were reduced to 10 men after a second caution for winger Jason Puncheon. Mathieu Debuchy's shot from a knockdown by substitute Olivier Giroud was saved by Julian Speroni, only for Ramsey to lash the loose ball in from close range. 'Maybe it was not the most beautiful of games, going 1-0 down we had to respond, but we will take the three points,' Szczesny said. Defence: Wojciech Szczesny said he was disappointed to concede from a set piece . 'We conceded to another set-piece which was not very good, although it was a good delivery and a great header, so that is something we can hopefully improve on.' Sanchez showed some positive touches, albeit without setting the match alight. Wenger is confident the Chile forward will soon grow into his new surroundings. 'I am very happy with his attitude because he kept on fighting for 90 minutes, even if he is not completely ready physically,' said the Arsenal manager. 'Tactically he needs to improve his understanding with his partners but he looked lively and dangerous until the end. Adjusting: Arsene Wenger said he is pleased with how Alexis Sanchez is settling in at Arsenal . 'I am happy with his overall attitude and performance.'

"Chelsea's preparations for the Premier League season were dealt a blow as Didier Drogba limped off less than 30 minutes into his first start since returning to the club, as Jose Mourinho's side rounded off their pre-season tour of Europe with a hard-fought win against Ferencvaros. The former Ivory Coast international went down clutching his ankle midway through the first half and had to be replaced by Oscar after 28 minutes. Chelsea were already behind at the point, due to the left boot of former Fulham playmaker Zoltan Gera. Ramires equalised for the visitors with an impressive dipping strike early in the second half, before substitute Cesc Fabregas netted his second goal for the Blues with a stunning individual effort nine minutes from time.

The Blues lined up without goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois due to a minor injury problem, with Petr Cech starting in his place, but Mourinho fielded an otherwise strong side with just eight days to go until their Premier League opener against Burnley. In Istanbul on Friday, Chelsea beat Fenerbahce 2-0 and lost 1-0 to Besiktas in 45-minute games - and Mourinho would have been pleased to see better from his charges as they edge closer to both full fitness and the start of the competitive season. Andre Schurrle was dangerous for the Blues in the early stages of the game, setting up Drogba with some neat footwork inside the box and then forcing Dibusz into making a smart stop low to his left with a fizzing shot from the edge of the box. Chelsea bossed the opening exchanges but it was Ferencvaros that took the lead in the 17th minute, former Fulham and West Brom playmaker Zoltan Gera ghosting in at the back post to smash a volley past  Cech at the back post after a well-worked move  down the right. Minutes later Drogba went down clutching his ankle after trying to meet a cross inside the Ferencvaros box and though the Ivorian tried to continue his night was curtailed as he limped off with boot in hand to be replaced by Oscar.

Mourinho made six changes at the break with Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa among those introduced, but it was one of those that survived his half-time cull, Ramires, that drew Chelsea level with a fabulous finish from the edge of the area. Ramires and Jon Obi Mikel made way for Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic on 61 minutes, and the latter was immediately involved, sprinting back to stop Ferencvaros from bursting into the Chelsea box after the hosts had broken with lightning speed when Gary Cahill's header bounced back off the right-hand post. The visitors looked the more likely to score a winner in the closing stages as their exciting attacking trio of Fabregas, Costa and Hazard caused problems in the Ferencvaros penalty area, and nine miuntes before the end they got their goal. Fabregas cut in from the right-hand side, bewitched three Ferencvaros defenders with some quick feet, and then hooked a right-foot finish past Dibusz to make it 2-1.

"A bitter memory of her father being stopped by police and her own brushes with cops rushed back to  Daniele Watts when the actress ended up in cuffs over refusing to hand an officer her ID . The Django Unchained star wrote Saturday in an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel how a memory of her father being stopped without cause made her unwilling to cooperate with police responding to a 'lewd behavior' call in Los Angeles. 'When I was 16, my father was driving me home from a school play when we saw flashing lights,' Watts explained. 'We hadn't been speeding. I remember my father asking the police officer what was wrong. The officer ignored his question and demanded identification.' Refused: Daniele Watts was not allowed to leave the scene when officers were called to respond to a charge of 'lewd behavior,' where she refused to give ID . The officer did not explain why he had pulled them over. Instead he asked Watts's father questions such as 'Who is she?' while adding a disparaging remark about Watts's costume. Watts explains her father felt he 'was powerless to stop the questioning or protect me from the officer's judgments,' but still handed over his license to avoid the officer making 'life very hard.' So when Los Angeles police approached Watts and her partner Brian Lucas - who is white - earlier this month following a call of 'lewd behavior,' she recalled that memory, she said. She refused to turn over ID to officers after being spotted in a car with Lucas, when she said that the couple was just kissing, though TMZ claimed photos were of something more extracurricular. An audio recording obtained by MailOnline caught audio of when police walked up to Watts to demand identification. 'It is a constitutional right that we do not have to present ID to any member of law enforcement unless we are being charged with a crime,' she's heard saying. Tape: Watts spoke of having police called on her and her partner Brian Lucas because of their races, which brought on a backlash when tape and photos of the incident surfaced . Star: Watts played the role of Coco in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, and she's had roles in shows like Californication . She later walks away from the scene and is detained in handcuffs, in spite of officers not charging her. Watts claimed that the officers grilled her about her relationship with Lucas and made her feel like a prostitute. The audio led many to criticize Watts for 'crying wolf' over racial profiling when it emerged that she is the first to mention race during the interaction with police. In her op-ed, she says that when she said 'Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black?' she thought of three recent episodes that echoed the one with her father. During a stop for speeding in Texas, Watts says an officer removed her from the car and interrogated her about how she and Lucas knew each other and why they were traveling together. In California, she watched a police car pass by her and Lucas talking in a parked car, then double back with lights flashing to check out a call of 'suspicious persons' due to a 'flurry of robberies.' Another time Watts says she and Lucas were sorting through his father's garage and were stopped on 'concerns about robbery,' when Watts says she adamantly refused to provide ID. The Daily News reported the officers involved are the subject of a probe by the LAPD for charges including biased policing and conduct unbecoming, though there are no official allegations. As for Watts, she says she couldn't have 'turned my back on the 16-year-old who watched her father' embarrassed by police by turning over ID when she says she had the right not to.","Daniele Watts was detained briefly after refusing to hand over identification when officers were called to a scene of 'lewd behavior'

"Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter has just one tournament left to qualify for this year's European team after failing to move into the automatic places in the US PGA Championship. Poulter remains 12th in the standings after finishing joint 59th at Valhalla and will not change his schedule even if he fails to win enough points in the first FedEx Cup event next week. 'I'll play next week and if I play well enough then I'll be an automatic in,' said Poulter, who was one of the heroes of the 'Miracle at Medinah' in 2012. 'If not, it's up to somebody else.'

"Nottingham Forest last night provided a boost after the turmoil between boss Stuart Pearce and owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi by breaking their transfer record and signing two players for a combined £6.5million. Striker Britt Assombalonga joined from Peterborough for a fee of £5m to top the 1997 capture of Pierre van Hooijdonk, while Sheffield Wednesday winger Michail Antonio arrived for £1.5m. But another note of concern emerged with key player Henri Lansbury set to leave for Burnley with the clubs negotiating a fee of around £3.5m. Incoming: Britt Assombalonga will step up to the Championship after joining Nottingham Forest for £5.5million . Lansbury’s exit is believed to be another deal that initially progressed without Pearce’s full knowledge. The manager was angered by sales of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle behind his back, before Lansbury told the 52-year-old last week about his desire for Premier League football. Al-Hasawi had challenged Lansbury, 23, to sign the new contract first offered in February but it is understood the terms are significantly less than certain team-mates and he will not be putting pen to paper. Burnley boss Sean Dyche is keen on the midfielder, who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the City Ground from Arsenal for £1m in 2012, and would offer regular game time.

But the country's state run national newsagency EFE quoted Ministry of Health sources as saying that tests carried out last night had all proved negative and that the unnamed man, who is in his 30s, was not a victim of the dreaded epidemic affecting several countries in West Africa. He was placed in isolation at the San Juan hospital on Saturday evening and the results of the tests came through a little less than 24 hours later.

Robert Lewandowski scored a stunning first-half strike for his new team but Landon Donovan scooped the MVP award after scoring the winning goal. Donovan was left out of the USA squad for the World Cup by manager Jurgen Klinsmann but he seized his opportunity in the annual MLS All Star Game on Wednesday. The match in Portland was Bayern's second and last on their summer tour having beaten CD Guadalajara 1-0 on Thursday in New Jersey. The German champions will return home and take on Borussia Dortmund in the Super Cup on August 13 before kicking off their Bundesliga defence against Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on August 22. Poland striker Lewandowski gave Bayern the lead in the eighth minute as his piledriver from the edge of the area left MLS goalkeeper Nick Rimando with no chance. Substitute Bradley Wright-Phillips, who joined New York Red Bulls from Charlton in 2013, drew the MLS All Stars level early in the second half. The former Manchester City and Southampton forward latched onto a through ball and smashed a left-foot shot past Tom Starke into the top corner in the 51st minute.

Bayern ended the game with the likes of Neuer, Dante, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Mario Gotze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller on the pitch. But Guardiola left the Providence Park pitch feeling annoyed at some of the tackles made by the MLS All Stars. Bastian Schweinsteiger, who came on in the 80th minute, left the game just before the end after picking up a knock in a heavy tackle. LA Galaxy striker Donovan told ESPN: 'I understand he doesn't want his players to get hurt. 'They're not great tackles but they're not the worst tackles I've ever seen and I hope Schweiny's not hurt.' Bayern Munich later tweeted that Schweinsteiger 'has a bruised ankle but nothing serious.'

"For three decades, the key to identifying a pedestrian struck and killed near an interstate exit ramp sat at investigators' fingertips. They just didn't realize it. The man was walking on Interstate 65 in central Kentucky in 1984 when he was struck by a semitruck. With no identification, the only clues he left were a couple of tattoos, a pack of cigarettes and his fingerprints. The prints yielded no matches. John Doe's body remained unidentified thirty years later, when the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System asked state police to review cold cases. Forensic analyst Keith Dollinger went through John Doe's file and noticed something odd about the ridges and patterns of the fingerprints. 'It looked to me like right hand prints were on the left hand card because of the way the ridges went through,' he said. He was right: Investigators had transposed the prints. The right hand was on a card labeled ""left"" and vice versa. 'Once he figured that that out, it kind of snowballed from there,' Kentucky State Police Lt. Brian Sumner said. Mystery solved: Police in Kentucky have finally solved the 30-year-old case of a man who was struck and killed by the side of the road in Elizabethtown. The error: the man's fingerprints were mislabeled (stock photo) Now, the man has a name: Roy Andrew Langley, who sometimes went by the alias 'Red Anderson.' He spent his life in and out of police custody and was 34 when he died by the side of the road in Elizabethtown. A preliminary identification was made in May, and this week, the Hardin County Coroner's Office tracked down Langley's sister in Houston for confirmation. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Debra Langley Hamidian were unsuccessful Friday. Transposing fingerprints isn't an everyday mistake, but it's not uncommon, said Todd Matthews, director of case management and communications for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. 'There have been other times where prints were flipped,' Matthews said, although he didn't have statistics on the frequency. In fact, the officer who made the catch in Langley's case said he's caught himself making the same mistake. 'It's something that happens every so often,' said Dollinger, a forensic specialist analyst with state police's Automated Fingerprint Identification System. 'It's just something you have to be careful about.' After discovering the error, Dollinger, who has 20 years of experience, resubmitted the prints through the state and national identification systems and turned up Langley's name. 'It was kind of a quiet satisfaction,' Dollinger said. ""It was a good thing because we know who the fellow is. 'The family can get some closure.'","Since 1984, detectives in Kentucky have tried to solve the case of a 34-year-old man who was struck and killed by the side of the road in Elizabethtown .
Now they've finally figured out why the case went cold: the man's fingerprints were transposed in the police filing system .
The man's right hand was on a card labeled 'left' and vice versa .
Once police flipped the cards, the fingerprints matched those of a man named Roy Langley, 34, who spent most of life in and out of police custody ."
"West Ham's new signing Enner Valencia insists he can reach match fitness in time for their first game of the season against Tottenham. The club's joint chairman David Sullivan said on Thursday afternoon that their £12million striker would not be available for the club's Barclays Premier League opener and would be out for two games. But Valencia disagrees and claims he can still make it for the match on August 16. 'I'm training normally at the moment,' he said. 'I'm training hard to get match fit. I couldn't play for a couple of days after the World Cup and stopped for a while. I could still be all right for the first game of the season against Tottenham or possibly the second.' VIDEO Scroll down for West Ham unveil their new 'Superman' Enner Valencia . Chance: Enner Valencia believes he can be fit for the early games against Tottenham and Crystal Palace . Down and out: West Ham are already without Andy Carroll until December with an ankle problem . The 24-year-old, who scored three goals in the World Cup for Ecuador, arrived in London last Friday evening and began training with the team on the Saturday. Sources at West Ham believe he will make the bench for the Spurs game and could play some part towards the end. Valencia is understood to have picked up an ankle injury at the World Cup, which has left him short of match fitness. Target: Peter Crouch is the No 1 preferred striking signing for West Ham as the season begins . Still got it: Samuel Eto'o is another consideration after he enjoyed a productive spell at Chelsea . Wildcard: Hugo Almeida might be one to consider for the Hammers and Sam Allardyce . Sullivan had said earlier in the day that it would keep the player out for the first two matches. ‘The player we’ve spent the most money on, Enner Valencia, is our big summer signing and he is about two or three weeks away from being able to play, because he was at the World Cup,' he said. ‘He’s now in full training but I think the earliest he’ll play is in the Capital One Cup match, so it’ll be exciting for people to see him make his debut in that match.’ With club record signing Andy Carroll out for up to four months with an ankle injury, West Ham are desperate for more options up front. They have made offers for four strikers in the hope that one of the deals comes off.

"Alastair Cook credited his wife Alice for backing him at his lowest ebb earlier this summer as England celebrated a triumphant 3-1 win over India. The England captain had been considering his future in June as his side faced defeat by Sri Lanka, but he was all smiles after a feeble India were trounced by an innings and 244 at The Oval. Asked to name the most important factor in his decision to stick with the job, Cook said: ‘The support of my wife. You can bare your soul quite often to Alice, and she’s very good at getting me back on the straight and narrow. VIDEO Scroll down for Alastair Cook: I thought we would win but not so emphatically . Turned the tide: Alastair Cook is all smiles after England trounced India in the final Test at The Oval . ‘I’m glad I stuck through the tough times.’ Both Cook and man of the series Jimmy Anderson — who finished only three wickets short of Ian Botham’s England-record 383 Test victims — claimed the dressing-room had been helped by India’s insistence on trying to get Anderson banned following his altercation with Ravindra Jadeja at Trent Bridge. 'It's right up there... it's the best I've probably bowled, yeah,' Anderson said of his own form. Happier times: Cook had been considering his England future in June .

'That's a credit to all - not just the four seamers, but Moeen Ali as well.' On what had changed since the loss at Lord's, he said: 'We decided to concentrate not on plans for particular batsmen, but on what we do well - hitting the top as much as we could, challenge their outside edge, challenging their forward defence. And I think as we've gone on through last three Tests we've improved on that in each game.'","England captain said his wife Alice backed him when we was at his lowest .

"Football and the pub - From Sir Alf to Dixie Dean . Life's a beach for Best, Becks and Sir Bobby . The way television covers football has changed immeasurably over the decades, and nowadays we can watch matches played all over the world at the press of a button. One programme has survived, and indeed thrived, during all these changes and has become the most popular and iconic TV football show in the country. Sportsmail's nostalgic picture series Golden Years this week pays tribute to Match of the Day as the BBC's famous football programme celebrates its 50th birthday. We have pictures from some of the presenters and commentators that have graced the programme over the decades, including legendary figures such as Kenneth Wolstenholme and David Coleman, and today's favourites including Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer. We would very much welcome your memories in the comments section, and we'll return next week with more special pictures from the archives. VIDEO Scroll down for Hansen's infamous remark: 'You can't win anything with kids' Match of the Day has gone from humble beginnings 50 years ago to becoming the most famous of all TV sports programmes. The first broadcast came on August 22, 1964, and half a century later it is shown to millions of viewers every Saturday night. This special picture to celebrate the 50 years of Match of the Day shows those most closely associated with the programme - David Coleman, Gary Lineker, Kenneth Wolstenholme, Jimmy Hill and Des Lynam . Match of the Day was first shown in the early evening of August 22, 1964, on BBC2, with an estimated audience of 20,000. The game shown was between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield, where the hosts claimed a 3-2 win. Here's a picture of Liverpool's Gordon Wallace beating Arsenal defender Don Howe and goalkeeper Jim Furnell to head home. Below, the Anfield crowd appear entertained by a cat that managed to find himself the centre of attention for a while that day . Match of the Day's first presenter was Kenneth Wolstenholme, the man who will forever be remembered for speaking the words 'They think it's all over... it is now' when England scored their fourth goal against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley. Here  is Wolstenholme for a Match of the Day broadcast from Upton Park in 1966, and a match between West Ham and Sheffield United. Below, Wolstenholme describes the action in east London using a classic lip microphone . As viewers, we naturally preoccupy ourselves by what we see on screen - the presenters, pundits and action. But there is a whole other world in the background  and here's a picture of executive producer Alec Weeks at the controls in 1974. Weeks was executive producer of the programme between 1965 and 1980 . This 1974 picture shows a BBC cameraman close to the action at Portman Road, for a match between Ipswich and Liverpool that was to be shown on that evening's Match of the Day. Liverpool went down to a surprise 1-0 defeat that November afternoon, and ended up runners-up in Division One to Derby. Match of the Day was very much a colour television affair for many viewers by then - the first match shown in colour on the programme was Liverpool v West Ham in 1969 . John Motson first became properly known to a wider audience when he commentated on Hereford's memorable FA Cup upset win over Newcastle in 1972, and he went on to become the BBC's lead commentator. Here he is pictured (left) before a match between Ipswich and Middlesbrough in 1982. On the right, one of the finest broadcasters of all time, David Coleman at Old Trafford for a clash between Manchester United and Sheffield United in 1971. Coleman, who died last year, also presented much of the BBC's other sporting output, including the Saturday afternoon programme Grandstand. He also covered 11 summer Olympics and six World Cup finals . For a couple of generations of viewers, Barry Davies was one of the main voices of TV football. Here he is at Anfield for Match of the Day in 1974. Davies first worked on the programme in 1969, and continued until 2004. Probably the most famous line he uttered in football commentary came in 1974, when Derby's Francis Lee scored against Manchester City - 'Interesting... Very interesting. Look at his face. Just look at his face.' The presenter most associated with Match of the Day for a certain generation must  be Jimmy Hill, who fronted the programme between 1973 and 1988. The former Fulham and Brentford forward, and Coventry manager, had worked for LWT before joining the BBC. Above, he presents Match of the Day in 1973 . Another fine 1970s picture of Hill above, this time with him preparing for broadcast just minutes before Match of the Day was due to go on air in 1975 by smoking a pipe. Below, Hill in glorious technicolour in 1981. During the 1980-81 and 1982-83 seasons, the programme was moved to a Sunday afternoon, but for the vast majority of its history, Match of the Day has remained a Saturday night show . The years and decades come and go, and yet there is still one constant with Match of the Day - the voice of Motson. Above, him in arguably his most famous scene, reporting from a snowy Adams Park before an FA Cup match between Wycombe and Peterborough that, before it was postponed, was due to be shown on Match of the Day that evening. Between 1988 and 1992, ITV had exclusive terrestrial rights to top-flight football, with the BBC rebranding a more occasional Saturday programme 'Match of the Day - The Road To Wembley'. Below, Motson pictured at Newcastle's St James' Park ground in 2005. He has been going nearly as long as the show itself . It was the end of an era in September, 2004, when Davies commentated on his last match for Match of the Day, a clash between Manchester City and Arsenal. Hehad commentated for the programme for 35 years - his first was for Crystal Palace vs Manchester United in August, 1969. That week 10 years ago, Davies said: 'It is not easy to give up something that has been a major part of my working life but I think I have had a good innings.' Match of the Day has surely never had a more unflappable host than Des Lynam. When the BBC won back rights to show top-flight football in 1992, Lynam was in his element, and fronted the famous highlights programme every Saturday night. Alan Hansen, once a cultured defender with Liverpool and Scotland, became the most recognisable pundit - and he uttered probably the most famous line in Match of the Day history in 1995 when he was talking about a defeat for Manchester United at Aston Villa and said 'You can't win anything with kids'. Here's Hansen and Lynam pictured with former West Ham great-turned-pundit Sir Trevor Brooking . In the early days of the programme, Match of the Day used to show one game, which soon became two. By the 1990s and the start of the Premier League era, key moments of every match were  shown. Here's a picture of the control room in 1997, with a match between Leicester and Tottenham showing on the various screens . When Lynam made a surprise move to ITV in 1999, Gary Lineker took over as the main presenter of Match of the Day. Here he is pictured with Hansen in 2001. Lineker enjoyed an oustanding playing career before he moved into broadcasting, with spells at Everton, Barcelona and Tottenham. He also starred for England, scoring 48 goals and producing a host of brilliant performances at the World Cup finals of 1986 and 1990 . Forty years after Match of the Day was first shown, the BBC decided to expand its weekend coverage, with a Sunday programme called Match of the Day 2 introduced in 2004. The first presenter of the programme was Adrian Chiles, who is pictured here on the set in 2007. Chiles is now the lead presenter for ITV's football coverage . Jacqui Oatley became the first woman to commentate for Match of the Day in 2007 when she described the match between Fulham and Blackburn at Craven Cottage, a game that finished in a 1-1 draw. Oatley began her career on radio, and has covered a host of major sporting events during her time in television . The amount of live football shown on television increases each year, but Match of the Day continues to be enjoyed by millions every weekend. The above promo picture shows Alan Shearer, Mark Lawrenson, Gary Lineker and Alan Hansen before the 2007-08 season. Below, Messrs Hansen, Lineker and Shearer are ready to watch the Saturday afternoon action, in preparation for an evening broadcast, in 2009 . The Match of the Day team moved to a new home in Salford in 2011, a short distance away from Manchester United's Old Trafford ground. The programme seems to go from strength to strength as the seasons go on, with the main Saturday programme and Sunday's Match of the Day 2 now joined by Match of the Day 2 Extra and Match of the Day 3. Other famous sports programmes have gone, the likes of Grandstand and Sportsnight, and yet Match of the Day continues to not just survive, but thrive . We couldn't leave without mentioning that famous theme tune, which wasn't actually used from the start of the programme, but was introduced in 1970. Composer Barry Stoller created the tune for the show in his north London basement, and over the decades it has become one of the most famous television tunes of all time. The below video shows the theme being used for the first time in 1970, with David Coleman presenting the programme...","The BBC's famous football show has been on our screens since 1964 .

"A woman has been arrested at Madrid airport after confessing to hiding £70,000 worth of cocaine in her breasts. The 43-year-old Venezuelan woman used two plastic bags containing 3.75lbs (1.7kg) of cocaine as breast implants to get through customs at the airport in the Spanish capital. The woman was singled out when she arrived at customs, due to her nervous appearance, but officials found nothing after searching her possessions. Scroll down for video . What a boob: A handout picture released by the Spanish National Police shows the two breast implants containing £70,000 worth of cocaine hidden in breasts of a woman arrested at Madrid's airport . The woman had just arrived on a flight from Bogota, Colombia, and officers took her to one side due to her behaviour as she went through customs at Madrid airport. Although nothing was found in her luggage, customs officials ordered a full body search. A frisk by female officers revealed irregularities and deformations in both of the suspect's breasts. The passenger then 'became nervous and confessed to carrying cocaine implants,' a police statement said Friday.

"After yesterday's woeful performance in the 3-0 Community Shield defeat by Arsenal, Manchester City fans may be tempted to press the panic button before the season has even begun. But don't worry too much, City fans, with your star names still to return and history on your side, this could yet transpire to be yet another glorious season for Manuel Pellegrini's men.... VIDEO Scroll down to watch new City signing  Mangala score brilliant back heel volley . Not the best start: Manchester City players head up the Wembley steps to receive their runners-up medal following  a 3-0 defeat to Arsenal in the Community Shield on Sunday . 1. Best players still to return . Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Vincent Kompany, Martin Demichelis, Frank Lampard, Fernandinho and Sergio Aguero were all rested after their World Cup exertions. Other star names such as Joe Hart and David Silva only started on the bench. Many of those players would walk into and transform City's starting line-up. Don't expect to see too much more of Dedryck Boyata and Matija Nastasic in a Manchester City shirt this season. Suited not booted: Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Alvaro Negredo and Bacary Sagna of Manchester City watch the 3-0 loss to Arsenal in the Community Shield from a Wembley executive box . Touchline chat: Vincent Kompany talks to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger ahead of the match . 2. City were slow starters last season . The Champions lost four of their first 11 games last season and Manuel Pellegrini's side were languishing in 8th position by the middle of November. They were even below David Moyes' Manchester United by that stage. As with all the best title winners, they clicked into gear when it truly mattered, losing only two of their last 27 matches and winning their last five. There will be no panic at Manchester City, although clashes against Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea before the end of September will call for a vast improvement. Slow starters: Manuel Pellegrini's side took a little time to get going last season but ended up as champions . VIDEO My team weren't ready - Pellegrini . Just champion: Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy on the final day last season . 3. Eliaquim Mangala is set to arrive . The Frenchman will add further pace and athleticism to the City rearguard and is expected to form an outstanding partnership with Vincent Kompany. It was a problem position for Pellegrini for much of last season - although Demichelis did come good in the end - and the Chilean will be relieved to now have two centre-backs of elite standing in his ranks. Incoming: City are set to complete the signing of Porto's Eliaquim Mangala to strengthen their defence . 4. The Community Shield is not the best indicator . Come on, now, even David Moyes' Manchester United won it last year. More pertinently, the last time City lost in the Community Shield - in the summer of 2011 - they went on to win the Premier League title. When they won the Community Shield against Chelsea the following summer, they then surrendered their crown and lost to Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup final. False dawn: David Moyes lifted the Community Shield this time last year but his tenure at United was a disaster . 5. History suggests the Treble is on . The last team to lose a Community Shield 3-0? The Manchester United team that would go on to win the treble in 1999. On that summer's day in 1998, United were defeated by a Nicholas Anelka-inspired Arsenal. So don't worry too much City fans. Oh, and some bad news for giddy Arsenal followers...the Gunners failed to win the Premier League on the four previous occasions they lifted the Charity or Community Shield (1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2002-2003, 2004-05). No form guide: Arsenal won the 1998 Charity Shield 3-0 against Man United, but Alex Ferguson's side went on to win a Treble of the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup that season .","Manchester City were well beaten 3-0 by Arsenal in the Community Shield .

And it was Brentford got off to the better start with Stuart Dallas testing Wayne Hennessey with a looping header in the first minute, then the Palace keeper was called into action again when Alan Judge shot from the left hand side of the penalty area. But Palace got back into the game through Australian international Mile Jedinak who had two good chances. Battle: Brentford's James Tarkowski  controls the ball under pressure from goal scorer Glenn Murray (left) Challenge: Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie  contests the ball with Brentford's Alan McCormack . The first was a shot that was deflected wide for a corner and then Jedinak forced David Button to make a save at his far post with a good downward header. Yannick Bolasie then forced Button to make an even better save as the Palace man fired a fierce shot from the edge of the area.

Despite Palace having much go the ball in the Brentford half, Adrian Mariappa showed he was still alert as he cleared a Gray’s first chance of the game off the line after the Brentford striker lobbed Hennessy. But if Gray thought he was unlucky not to give the lead, he missed the opportunity to make up for it as he put a guilt edge chance over the bar on the stroke of half time when unmarked six yards out. But Brentford did take the lead just after the break when Douglas turned Damien Delaney inside out and placed his shot neatly past substitute goalkeeper Julian Speroni. Gray then made up for his two first half misses with a good finish past Speroni after beating Delaney once again to double Brentford’s advantage. But Palace’s fightback started less than less than a minute later when Glenn Murray lifted the ball over Button from a yard out. And then Chamakh levelled from close distance after Button failed to hold onto Joe Ledley’s shot. But record singing Odubajo won the game for Brentford with brilliantly worked goal past Speroni to give Warburton’s men a confidence boost ahead of next week’s Championship opener against London rivals Charlton.","Tony Pulis' team beaten in pre-season friendly at Brentford .

"A millionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur gave her son a lethal cocktail of pills after the autistic eight-year-old boy suggested they took their lives together, she has claimed. Gigi Jordan, who is on trial in Manhattan for the 2010 killing of Jude Mirra, testified that she gave the boy pills after he wrote messages on her BlackBerry suggesting the suicide pact - as the jury rolled their eyes, the New York Post reported. Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn, deluxe Manhattan hotel room in February 2010. Jordan, who had also taken pills, was found on the floor nearby. She claims she tried to revive her son after he took the pills. Suicide pact: Gigi Jordan, right, pictured in court in 2011 with her attorney Alan Dershowitz, claims that it was her eight-year-old non-verbal son who suggested she kill him with 'a lot of drugs' Even though the second grader was unable to speak, she claims he urged her to take their lives by typing messages on her phone, the Post reported. She claims they both feared that her ex-husband, Raymond Mirra, would kill her after she learned he'd allegedly stolen millions from her. She said she did not know what would become of her son. 'Let's just get out while we can,' she claims Jude wrote on January 26, 2010, days before his body was found in the Peninsula Hotel. 'We r going to die anyway let's do it ourselves instead of them. 'We need to leave in a way we want to, not their way. Get the pills and try to do it.' She claims he wrote other messages claiming it wouldn't be murder and urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully. Mother and son: Jude Mirra (left), was found dead in the $2,300-a-night hotel suite next to his mother . Standing trial: Jordan claims that the boy urged her to take their lives because he feared his father would kill them. She claims she feared for her life after learning her ex had stolen money from her . 'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.' She testified that she was in a place of desperation because she lived in fear of her ex-husband, who had legally adopted Jude. 'I felt numb, defeated, I felt like it was over, it was done,' she said. 'There was nothing I could do.' In court on Thursday, she explained that she deliberately gave her son a lethal dose of prescription drugs and exchanged goodbyes but later tried to revive him. When she heard him struggle to breathe, 'my heart started pounding,' she testified. 'I raced over to him. I was crying and sobbing,' she said. 'I was crying and calling, 'Jude! Jude! Jude!' And then I started to attempt CPR.' Her tearful account provided a stark contrast to the prosecution's portrayal of her as a dark woman coolly killing her only son. Emergency responders' accounts of her condition have varied from incoherent to composed. Scene of the crime: Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue as a 'mercy killing'. Above, the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue . Devastating: Prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her  lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Above, emergency crews take away Jude's body . Jordan says she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons: Some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed to keep her from raising allegations of financial malfeasance, and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him. Killed: The boy was non-verbal, had PTSD and immune system abnormalities, his mother claims . 'I couldn't see any way out of the situation,' she said. Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime. Prosecutors say Jordan had no right to kill Jude, whatever her reasoning. They say Jordan climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open - so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest - and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe. Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos has said. She also wrote a suicide note. She has denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him. The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to Jordan. Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm. Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days.","Gigi Jordan, 54, is on trial in Manhattan for allegedly force-feeding her son, Jude Mirra, a fatal dose of pills in their luxury hotel suite in 2010 .

"Have you enjoyed a holiday romance? You're not alone. More than half of Britons have had a fling while travelling, and many of them more than once. But despite two thirds of British holidaymakers believing that 'what goes on tour, stays on tour,' a surprising number of romances survive post-holiday, according to a recent survey. Holiday fling: More than half of British travellers say they have enjoyed a romance while abroad . Going the distance: One in five of flings last more than a year after the holiday - and 1 in 10 result in marriage! Research by online travel agent LoveHolidays.com reveals that a staggering 30 per cent of flings continue once holidaymakers are back on home soil. Further, one in six relationships last more than a year, while one in 10 result in marriage. And though the numbers suggest that many Britons are finding true and lasting love abroad, there are many more amorous travellers enjoying some more short-lived fun. Misbehaving Britons: It's not all hearts and flowers though... 13% kiss more than three people in one night . 'Good morning... beautiful': One in five forget their holiday romance's name the next morning . According to those surveyed, 13 per cent of British holidaymakers have kissed more than three people in one night, while 11 per cent would sleep with a holiday romance on the first night they met.

"Ukip has been condemned as 'absolutely vile' by Labour rising star Chuka Umunna, who accused Nigel Farage of trying to blame foreigners for all of Britain's problems. In his most outspoken attack yet, Mr Umunna said Ukip was 'sowing the seeds of division' by accusing 'that bunch over there' of being responsible for a shortage of housing, GP appointments and well-paid jobs. The shadow business secretary attacked Ukip's 'abhorrent' language about immigrants and the 'distasteful' spectacle of the Ukip Calypso song performed by DJ Mike Read in a mock Jamaican accent. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna condemned the 'abhorrent' views of Nigel Farage's Ukip which he claimed often go unchallenged . Mr Umunna has been a leading critic of Ukip's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and has stepped up his attacks in recent weeks after Labour appeared to be losing ground to the Eurosceptic party. In his latest broadside, he warned that Ukip is now part of the political mainstream but is not judged by the same standards as other parties. He accused Mr Farage's party of using the same language about Eastern European immigrants as once was used against black and Asian people who moved to Britain. He told LBC radio: 'They are asking people to give them the benefit of the doubt when a stream of Ukip candidates and supporters have come out with the most offensive and racist things over the months. 'What really worries me about this is there is not more of a row about the things we see coming out of Ukip. It's almost as if people price this in. 'They are now arguably one of the main parties, and a lot of this stuff is vile, is absolutely vile, and it's not in keeping with our British values of respect, tolerance and fair play.' A new racism row erupted this week with the release of Ukip Calypso, in which Read sang in a Jamaican-accent warning of 'illegal immigrants in every town. Read himself has insisted it was just 'a bit of fun', adding: 'I don't have a racist bone in my body. I work across all cultures and creeds, I travel the world. I've got so many chums out in the Caribbean. I've spent a lot of time out there.' But Mr Umunna, the son of a Nigerian migrant, said the song 'distasteful', adding: 'A lot of people have said they think it's racist. I don't know whether his intention was to be racist.' The rise of Ukip has led to a growing debate about the need to control immigration, with David Cameron promising curbs on freedom of movement within the EU. But Mr Umunna accused Ukip of using attacks on migrants to blame them for problems in Britain. 'What I find really awful is this notion that somehow all the problems in our country are caused by immigration. 'All the problems that you have, whether it's a getting an appointment at your GP, the fact you aren't earning enough at work, the fact your child can't get a house round the corner from you, is down to Eastern European immigration. It isn't. It's a con. It is misleading and wrong. 'Seeking to blame it on ""that bunch over there"" is a complete con.' Ex-Radio 1 DJ Mike Read has launched a bid for chart success with a song singing the praises of Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage . Mr Umunna went on: 'The reason I find it abhorrent – I'll be frank, my name is Chuka Umunna, clearly I'm of immigrant stock - is the kind of things you hear people saying about eastern Europeans these days is exactly the kinds of things they were saying about black and Asian people when they first arrived in this country. 'We can't have any truck with that. That is not what we are as Brits.' Mr Farage has repeatedly denied Ukip is racist and vowed to root out members and candidates with offensive views. But he faced fury from Jewish community leaders yesterday after he formed a pact with a Polish MEP whose party leader has been accused of denying the Holocaust to get EU funding. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was 'gravely concerned' by Ukip's deal to accept a member of the Polish Congress of the new Right (KNP) into its grouping in the European Parliament. Robert Iwaszkiewicz's decision to join the Eurosceptic EFDD (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) group headed by Mr Farage means it has enough members to increase its funding and standing in the parliament.","Shadow business secretary hits out at 'abhorrent' anti-migrant rhetoric .

"Perhaps all India’s batsmen should have spent their first practice day studying policing skills instead of preparing for the final Test. It certainly did not appear to do their captain any harm as MS Dhoni stood firm against England. Dhoni can appear a detached, uninterested figure when things are going badly for his side, as in the last two Tests, but there was no doubting his commitment to the Indian cause while all around him collapsed at the Kia Oval. If it were not for Dhoni, who spent Wednesday at a police training centre in Kent rather than training at the Oval, India would already be all but beaten, with England’s recovery from a 1-0 deficit to a 3-1 series triumph near complete. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reaction after day one from Chris Woakes . Howzat! England bowled out India for 148 before tea in the Fifth Test . High fives: Chris Woakes (C) celebrates after taking his third wicket of the afternoon . Panda face: Stuart Broad played despite breaking his nose in the previous Test . As it is, despite the India captain bristling defiance while scoring 82 of his side’s 148 all out, England are very much in control of the fifth Investec Test, Alastair Cook and Sam Robson reducing the deficit by 62 by the close. This was the bowling performance England badly wanted after naming an unchanged side, with Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes vindicating the faith placed in them by playing a full role in support of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Between them England’s attack were far too hot for a deflated India to handle on a greener than usual Oval pitch and with conditions very much in the bowlers' favour after Alastair Cook had won an important toss. Even though England took nine wickets in that last session at Old Trafford to hurry India to defeat they were disappointed Jordan and Woakes could not fully grab the chance presented to them by injury to Broad and illness to Anderson. They could have easily decided the time was right for the re-introduction of Steven Finn or the return of Ben Stokes but instead were conscious of the need to provide proper opportunities for emerging players to establish themselves. Jordan in particular seemed to benefit from a longer run than his first in Test cricket, which ended abruptly after two Tests against Sri Lanka, as he looked much more like the man who made such an impression in one day cricket. It was here in south London this time last year that Woakes made an unexpected debut in the last Test against Australia and the jury has been well and truly out on him during three Tests where he had taken just two wickets. This, however, was much more like it, the frailties of an Indian batting line-up who seem to think their job was done after they took the lead at Lord’s helping Jordan and Woakes to six wickets between them as England made hay. With Anderson taking two of the eight wickets he needed to overtake Sir Ian Botham and become England’s leading wicket-taker and Stuart Broad proving his fitness with two victims of his own Cook was very much in control. Bowled over: Stuart Broad appeals for an England wicket at the Kia Oval . Pace man: James Anderson bowls to Stuart Binny in the final Test of the series . Last stand: India batsman MS Dhoni scored 82 but could not prevent the collapse . Great shakes: Ishnat Sharma congratulates MS Dhoni on reaching his half century . India assisted the England captain, too. It is difficult to over-estimate the transformation in this series since England collapsed in a heap on the last day of the second Test and Cook’s captaincy appeared to be hanging by a thread. MS Dhoni’s side had a wonderful chance to make history in winning a five-Test series in England but they have fallen apart ever since while losing focus over their obsession with the spat between Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja. England were excellent on Friday but India were woeful, no-one other than Dhoni, and his partner in a last-wicket partnership of 58 in Ishant Sharma, showing any sort of application or stomach for the fight. The tone was set when Anderson removed Gautam Gambhir, trying to leave a brute of a delivery, with the fourth ball of the match and it was reinforced when Broad removed another brick in the wall that was Cheteshwar Pujara. Enter Jordan who continued where he left off at Old Trafford, where he ended the Test with two wickets in successive balls, with two wicket maidens here to remove both Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. At which time, across the two Tests, Jordan had taken four wickets without conceding a run in 14 balls. And so it continued until Ishant, badly missed by India in the last two Tests, joined his captain and held England up in yet another productive last-wicket stand, even though India should never have reached three figures. Watch the birdie: Chris Woakes bowls while pigeons feed on the square . Early shower:James Anderson is congratulated after taking the wicket of Gautam Gambhir . Working up an appetite: England captain Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad walk of for tea . Flying high: Alastair Cook led England to 62-0 with Sam Robson before play stopped for the day . There was a suspicion Dhoni had edged one early in his innings that England failed to appeal for while Ian Bell spoilt an otherwise perfect day for the new-look slip cordon by spilling Ishant off Jordan when India were on just 95. Yet it was only a mild irritation for an England side who maintained the initiative they first claimed in Southampton and maintained in Manchester under a captain in Cook who has come through such a searching examination. Cook’s luck changed when he was dropped on 15 by Jadeja before going on to 95 in Southampton and he received another slice here on nine when England replied as Paul Reiffel turned down an lbw appeal from Bhuvneshwar Kumar that Hawk-Eye suggested was plumb. The England captain lived to fight another day and if his side bat all day on Saturday then they really will be almost home and hosed.","England bowled India out for 148 in the Fifth Test at the Kia Oval .

"She is the 'happiest kid ever', her mum says. A cheeky bugger who loves to play in the water. But when some people see little baby Marley, aged sixteen months, they shoot dirty looks at her Brisbane mother and family. That's because Marley has what appears to be a big, blue bruise on her chest and right arm, leading some strangers to wrongly assume the worst - even abuse - has happened. The judgemental attitudes of some strangers have come as a shock to Marley's mum, Simone Johns. The blue 'bruising' - which is not a bruise at all, but a 'port wine stain' - is actually caused by an extremely rare and incurable medical condition, known as KTS, or Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome. Cheeky girl: Adorable baby Marley has a rare and incurable medical condition, Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome Syndrome, which has caused the blue mark on her right arm and chest . Mum Simone Johns with her playful baby girl Marley, aged 16 months . Little princess: Baby Marley is sometimes required to wear a compression suit to ease her condition . 'I'm kind of a bit surprised that people jump to that conclusion so quickly,' Ms Johns told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you see the way I interact with my children I would hope people wouldn't think I was an abusive parent -  by any means - playing in the water with my daughter. 'You wouldn't think we were the family where that happened.' An incident at the beach at the weekend has moved Ms Johns to call for greater awareness about Marley's condition. Ms Johns and her partner were stunned by another family's reaction when they went to frolic in the water at Southbank Beach. Her partner noticed them staring and whispering, Ms Johns recalled. 'He said, ""did you see the way they were looking and Marley and they were talking?"" 'He was quite put out by it,' she said. ''As any parent would (be), I was pretty upset about that.' 'The first thing I thought was, ""of course - they're looking at my baby she's cute as"".' Adventurous baby Marley is pictured wearing her compression glove (left) and a favourite outfit of many little girls - a ballerina's tutu . Little baby, big turtle: Marley's mum has described her as 'pretty much the happiest kid ever' But then she realised the dangerous assumptions they were making. Marley's disorder affects around one in 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Library of Medicine. KTS is so rare in Australia it took months for Ms Johns to find a specialist who could diagnose Marley. The condition often causes a 'port wine stain', a type of birthmark which Marley has on her chest and right arm, which is caused by bundles of tiny blood vessels near the surface of her skin. KTS has also led Marley's arm to swell to twice its size, and while she will be able to live a happy life, she has suffered some complications with her compression suit in the past. This weekend's incident drove Ms Johns to take to Facebook with an informative post about Marley and her condition. 'Rather then get upset about people (staring) at her and wondering, why not take the opportunity to raise some awareness,' she wrote, before explaining the condition. Little legend: Mum Simone says it can be a little 'emotional' for her contending with Marley's medical condition . Viral: The response to Simone's Facebook post was overwhelming . She was astonished by the overwhelmingly positive reaction it has received. At last count, it has been shared more than 45,000 times. Ms Johns had only ever wanted her message to reach local mums, and she's blown away by how far it her message of acceptance has travelled. 'Everytime I get up in the morning and look at my laptop I say ""holy crap!""' 'I can't believe how many people have shared it,' she said. 'It's just gone out of control.' Marley and her family are far from alone when it comes to facing unwarranted stigma. Blogger and appearance diversity activist Carly Findlay has ichthyosis, a condition which causes her skin to appear red and scaly. 'I know that when i was little my mum and my dad used to get asked a lot about whether they'd left me out in the sun,' she said. In July 2013, a Melbourne cab driver told Ms Findlay to get out of his cab and told her 'you smell'. And in December, a photo of hers was ridiculed in a Reddit forum. Ms Findlay said coming forward and telling her story had been rewarding. 'It's certainly empowered a lot of people to come out and tell their's,' she said.","People sometimes stare and whisper at baby Marley because she has a big blue mark on her chest .

"More shocking details were revealed by Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell in the continuing here Comes Honey Boo Boo saga. Cardwell, 20, told E! News that fears her husband Michael could one day get deadly revenge on Mark McDaniel are among the many things involving the molester that continue to haunt her. 'Michael would probably kill him,' if given the chance, said Cardwell of her husband of six months, who she says carries a gun wherever he goes. 'Michael would probably kill him': Anna Cardwell fears a situation could one day arise in which her husband of 6 months Michael would shoot her accused molester Mark McDaniel . Cardwell says McDaniel repeatedly sexually assaulted her in 2002 while her mother--who was dating the now 53-year-old--was working at a McDonough, Georgia McDonald's. Ironically, that's where Mama June first met up with McDaniel after they met online. 'She found him online, they met at Mcdonald's,' Cardwell told E!. Cardwell detailed the abuse she suffered, unbeknownst to Mama June, before McDaniel was put away for 10 years following a 2004 aggravated child abuse charge. 'Mama was mainly at work,' Cardwell said. The abuse happened in the car sometimes but mostly at Chickadee's home. She said some of the abuse even happened in her mother's bed. All the while, Cardwell says McDaniel begged her not to tell anyone--especially the police. Cardwell has a 2-year-old daughter with Michael, but says sometimes she has to remind herself to be strong in the face of her demons . So she didn't. 'I never wanted to hurt my mother,' she said. But now that Cardwell has opened up about the abuse she says she suffered, she's the one who continues to be hurt. Cardwell claimed Monday her mother siphoned off her $30,000 trust fun to buy McDaniel a car. Chickadee told E! News in a revealing interview that she checked with the bank on a hunch and discovered the money had somehow dwindled to just $17.90. Abuser: Mama June's ex Mark McDaniel, 53, served 10 years after repeatedly molesting Anna Cardwell in 2002 . 'I have a feeling mama used that to buy a car and buy him what he wants,' 20-year-old Cardwell said, referring to Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation. Cardwell also claimed Monday that the 'united front,' as TMZ calls it, that Mama June and ex Sugar Bear are putting on in the face of claims they could lose custody of star Alana is just that: a front. 'Mama's using sugar bear to cover her ass,' claimed Cardwell. Meanwhile, Mama June denied claims about the car completely to E! News, saying, 'I never bought him a car.' With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life. 'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin stated. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.' However, TMZ reported October 26 that Mama June was spotted at a Georgia car dealer, where she plunked down $25,000 cash to purchase two used Nissan Altimas. One was for a family member, while the other was delivered to a 'friend' in Decatur--to the very address McDaniel listed on his sex offender registry, TMZ claimed. Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago. She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'. Living the single life? Cardwell claims her mother's recent outing with ex Sugar Bear was just to keep up appearances . TMZ claimed in late October that Mama June had plunked down $25,000 for two Nissan Altimas (file photo pictured), one for a family member and another for a 'friend.' The site claimed that friend is Mark McDaniel . Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with Alana. After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons. Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch. Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'. The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell.

Saido Berahino's double had fired Irvine to within five minutes of victory after Lee Cattermole's stunning opener for the visitors.

Goal: Cattermole 5, Larsson 85 . Referee: Neil Swarbrick . But, with West Brom still readjusting following Irvine's changes, Seb Larsson pounced to earn a deserved point for Gus Poyet's side. 'I'm disappointed really,' said Irvine, a surprise appointment at the Hawthorns during the summer. 'I felt there were a lot of good things. It was a great response to going behind. We controlled the first half and we had a lot of momentum, we didn't want half-time to come. 'But having got ourselves in front I hoped – and expected – us to stay in front.' Irvine's double change saw former Sunderland midfielder Craig Gardner and Graham Dorrans replaced by Chris Baird and Stephane Sessegnon. And Irvine explained: 'Craig had cramp and that comes because of nervous energy playing against Sunderland in his first game and so forth. 'Dorrans had done an awful lot of work and looked as if he was beginning to struggle. 'So those were the reasons (for the changes).' Cattermole's strike arrived after just four minutes. West Brom could only half clear from a set-piece and the ball bounced invitingly to his feet 30 yards out. With one touch to set himself, the anchorman took aim for the top corner and duly located it in stunning fashion. It was his second goal in six years having only broken that duck at Spurs in April. The hosts were awarded what Irvine admitted was a 'soft' penalty before the break when Victor Anichebe toppled under minimal contact from Valentin Roberge and Berahino converted. Sunderland's Jack Rodwell – a £10m signing from Manchester City last week – was making his bow in an advanced midfield role but failed to impact and it was no surprise when he was withdrawn midway through the second period.

Rodwell's role was occupied by Gardner at the Stadium of Light last season and it was he who laid on West Brom's second. Vito Mannone should have done better when stooping to save Dorrans' low strike from distance and his spill allowed Gardner to dig out a cross to the far post where Berahino was steaming in to volley home. Berahino was the chief threat throughout for the Baggies and Irvine expects the 21-year-old to remain at the club beyond this month. 'I can't see anyway that this club would be interested in letting Saido go,' said Irvine. 'You can't let top, English, talented players go. This could be a very big season for him and beyond.' Poyet, meanwhile, was encouraged by the manner of his side's comeback which was secured when Patrick van Aanholt was sprung clear by Jordi Gomez and he squared for Larsson to side-foot beyond Ben Foster. 'We had a great start and it was a great goal,' said the Uruguayan. 'Then we had 25 minutes which were a technical disaster. We couldn't pass the ball. 'We were much better in the second half and more aggressive. 'Maybe last year, after conceding the second goal, we would have collapsed and conceded three or four but we have a better and stronger mentality in the team. 'That's a good sign for the future.'

"Scientists have hailed stem-cell research into a cure for diabetes as potentially the biggest medical breakthrough since antibiotics. It could result in an end to insulin injections, and to the disabling and deadly complications of the disease, such as strokes and heart attacks, blindness and kidney disease. The treatment, which involves making insulin-producing cells from stem cells, was described as a 'phenomenal accomplishment' that will 'leave a dent in the history of diabetes'. Scroll down for video . Scientists yesterday hailed stem-cell research into a cure for diabetes as potentially the biggest medical breakthrough since antibiotics . Harvard University researchers said they had made a 'giant leap forward' in the quest to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. This form affects 400,000 Britons, including almost 30,000 children. It occurs when the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin we need to turn the sugar in food into energy. Unable to make any insulin, type 1 diabetics need regular injections to stop blood sugar levels from fluctuating wildly. But the research also offers hope to the three million Britons with type 2 diabetes, in which the body doesn't make insulin or the insulin doesn't work properly. This version is fuelled by obesity, rather than the immune system and eats up a tenth of the NHS budget. As with many recent medical advances, this one is based on the potential of stem cells, the 'master cells' that can turn into other cell type and are widely seen as a repair kit for the body. A pump administering insulin continuously through catheter can be used as a treatment for diabetes . Harvard researcher Doug Melton, who has two children with diabetes, found a way of making insulin-producing cells. Dr Melton promised his children he'd find a cure. In some cases the stem cells came from human embryos. But he was also able to turn human skin cells into ones that make insulin – something that would be much more ethically acceptable. Grown in the lab and transplanted into a mouse with diabetes, the cells made insulin and cured the animal, the journal Cell reports. Importantly, if this is ever to help humans in large numbers, Dr Melton can make billions of cells. The lab-grown cells are just one step away from being trialled in people. Other researchers have made insulin-producing cells but these are the first that seem to work as well as the real thing. Dr Melton, who dedicated his career to finding a cure for type 1 diabetes 23 years ago when his son Sam was diagnosed with the condition, said: 'We are now just one pre-clinical step away from the finish line. People with type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injections to control their blood sugar levels. It has to be injected because if it were taken as a tablet, it would break down in the stomach and be unable to enter the bloodstream where it acts to reduce the amount of glucose. Either a syringe or an injection pen can be used, with most people needing two to four injections a day. An alternative to injecting insulin is a portable pump. About the size of a pack of playing cards, the pump is attached to a long, thin piece of tubing, with a needle at the end, which is inserted under the skin. Most people insert the needle into their stomach. It delivers constant amounts of insulin during the day. 'It was gratifying to know that we could do something that we always thought was possible. If we had shown this was not possible, then I would have had to give up on this whole approach. Now I'm really energised.' Dr Melton said he hoped to have human trials under way within a 'few years'. Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said it was 'potentially a major medical breakthrough'. He added: 'If this scalable technology is proven to work in both the clinic and in the manufacturing facility, the impact on the treatment of diabetes will be a medical game-changer on a par with antibiotics and bacterial infections.' Jose Oberholzer, a diabetes expert at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the research 'will leave a dent in the history of diabetes', adding: 'This is a phenomenal accomplishment.' Dr Richard Insel, of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which part-funded the research, cautioned that it had so far proved its worth only on mice. But he added: 'If you could get people off insulin completely, it would change their lives.' Dr Melton said his children had taken the news in their stride, adding: 'I think like all kids, they always assumed that if I said I'd do this, I'd do it.'","Research into a cure for diabetes could result in an end to insulin injections .

"Thibaut Courtois wants Petr Cech to stay at Stamford Bridge - despite nicking the Chelsea No 1's spot between the sticks under Jose Mourinho. Courtois was selected ahead of long-standing first choice Cech for the season-opening win at Burnley after a summer of speculation over which 'keeper would come out on top. The 22-year-old Belgian made a series of smart saves in the 3-1 victory and is likely to continue for the visit of Leicester on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say he wants Petr Cech to stay at the club . Rivals: But Petr Cech can still help out at Chelsea, says new first choice 'keeper Thibaut Courtois . The situation has led to speculation Cech, 32, who joined the club a decade ago, could move on before the transfer deadline at the end of this month. But despite being rivals for one place in the side, Courtois wants to keep the threat of another world class 'keeper at the club. 'I want him to stay,' Courtois said. 'Even if he doesn’t play he can be a lot of help to me in training. 'I can still learn from him because he has a lot of experience, he can give me good tips about the Premier League, things I might not know at the start. 'He is nice to me. We are training very well and he is still proving he is a great goalkeeper. 'For the team it is better for us to have two good goalkeepers. I don’t have a problem if he stays.

'Otherwise, it would maybe have been better for me to go to another team. 'It is nice that he put faith in me and it is for me now to prove his faith is right.
