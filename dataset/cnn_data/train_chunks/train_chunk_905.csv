"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . Taken in the darkness of night, a Western Australian photographer has managed to capture the stunning stars along the state's coast line. Michael Goh - a self-taught astrophotographer - travelled to Namburg National Park, almost 200km north of Perth, to capture his award-winning pictures. One of the photos show the movement of the stars in the sky as the earth rotates, creating a concentric circle effect above the national park's limestone formations called The Pinnacles. The light from the moon and stars casts haunting shadows over the natural rock structures. In one image a lone man stands with a single illumination source and highlights his singularity, casting a shadow across the sandy grounds of the park. Goh, a Perth father-of-two, specialises in astrophotography and often spends the whole night out in in the elements trying to get the perfect shots of the shifting night sky. And his efforts have paid off, with his photographs winning a number of accolades at Australia's photography festival Astrofest held at Curtain University. 'It is important to enjoy the moment as well as take the pictures and luckily a lot of my astrophotography lets me sit back while I capture the shots,' Goh said. He said he was constantly competing with the weather to grab the perfect shot, so he was always ready to go with his camera at the first sign of a clear night sky.

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . A visit to the zoo and climbing Australia's tallest building - that is how New Zealand's Warriena Tagpuno Wright spent her last days alive before plummeting to her death from a high-rise building in Surfers Paradise. The 26-year-old woman fell to her death from the 14th floor of Avalon Apartments on Queensland's Gold Coast on Friday at 2.20am while she visited a man she had met on a mobile dating app. Ms Wright, from Lower Hutt - north-east of Wellington, was seen with a 28-year-old man on the balcony at the Wahroonga Place apartment he was living in by witnesses before tragedy struck. Scroll down for video . The woman who fell from a high-rise building in Surfers Paradise in Queensland has been identified as New Zealand's Warriena Tagpuno Wright . The 26-year-old woman plummeted 14 storeys from Avalon Apartments at Wahroonga Place on Friday morning . But Ms Wright's Facebook page showed the great times the New Zealand woman had visiting Australia for a friend's wedding. She had travelled to the country alone on July 29, according to Nine News. In one photo she is seen holding a python while laughing in a posed photo in front of rocky backdrop at an Australian zoo. Savana Lesa was with Ms Wright during her two-week stay in the country. Posting a tribute to her friend, Ms Lesa said she would never forget the animal lover whose page was filled with photos of animals. The 26-year-old woman was visiting Gable Tostee (left) at his Avalon Apartments unit after meeting him on Tinder (right) 'It was just like a few days ago we were hanging out, taking selfies relaxing on the beach, visiting the tallest building in Australia, cruising around and talking about the good times we had together as buddy ol pals making the best of our time together,' Ms Lesa wrote. 'Though my heart aches for you and my mind is still adjusting to the fact you are gone I will always cherish the best moments I have had with you while you were here. 'I will never forget you my dearest friend who I love and keep close to my heart forever.' Ms Wright smiling and posing a python just days before her death on the Gold Coast . Police are continuing their investigations into the circumstances surrounding Ms Wright’s death. The 28-year-old man, who was seen with Ms Wright before she died, was computer expert Gable Tostee who met her through mobile dating app Tinder, according to The Courier Mail. He turned himself into Queensland police at 11am on Friday and was questioned for more than two hours at the Surfers Paradise station, accompanied by his lawyer, but was released without charge. It is believed Tostee - who was found guilty of supplying fake IDs to underage Schoolies with two of his friends which made them $30,000 eight years ago - had been drinking with Ms Wright. Police were almost immediately on scene when a man raised the alarm but on arrival at the unit she had fallen from, nobody was inside. They are investigating if someone had been there but fled the scene when police came knocking. Forensic officers have scoured the apartment building from the 14th floor to the ground. On Friday, Queensland police were almost immediately on scene after a man raised the alarm. 'Voices were heard and noises were heard coming from the unit,' Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson told media. Witnesses said they had heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from the 14th floor. 'I heard her screaming once, then she stopped. Then she screamed and then she stopped again. I think she screamed a third time and after that I heard a bang,' a witness - only identified as Tania told Nine News. 'Very upsetting, very upsetting, I couldn't believe it.' It is believed Tostee and the woman who is yet to be identified were drinking and witnesses heard yelling coming from the unit on Queensland's Gold Coast (pictured) Another witness, Adam, who lives on the 17th floor said: 'By the sounds of things it's happened on my side of the building, right by my bedroom window.' Charges in relation to the 26-year-old's death have not been laid and it is possible no charges will come about at all. The 26-year-old's death is being treated as suspicious by police and are appealing to the public for information. Detectives want to speak to anybody who has been in contact with Ms Wright since she arrived or know of her activities in Australia.","Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, has been identified as the woman who died .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The mother of a girl, who was abducted by a couple desperate to conceive and then dumped her two days later in a derelict house, has spoken out about her 'special bond' with her child. A decade ago on August 7, 2004, Anita Ciancio experienced every parent's worst nightmare. Her three-month-old baby, Montana Barbaro, was snatched during their first outing together as mother and daughter in a shopping centre carpark after she was assaulted by Mark and Cheryl McEachran. On the tenth anniversary of her daughter's abduction, Anita Ciancio has opened up about how it has affected their life . Montana was found by a jogger who heard her cries from inside a rundown North Melbourne home after the couple spent two days treating her as their own child and cutting her hair. Marking the tenth anniversary of the abduction of Montana, Ms Ciancio - who also has a 11-year-old daughter and two sons aged seven and one - opened up about her relationship with her daughter, who is now 10, and how it had impacted on their life. The mother-of-four said it had changed the way she had raised her children and how they had lived. Ms Ciancio said they never went out to play in the park like other children and their childhood had been 'robbed. Two days after Montana Barbaro - then three-weeks-old (pictured here in Ms Ciancio's arms) - was abducted she was found dumped in a derelict home in North Melbourne . Ms Ciancio (pictured here with Montana's father, Joe Barbaro, in 2004) said she and her daughter shared a special bond . Ms Ciancio said the only good thing that came out of Montana's abduction was the effect it had on their relationship. 'I feel Montana’s heart when she’s not with me,' she told the Herald Sun. 'It is…like someone’s got a string with our hearts and it’s like pulling it and tearing it, and she hurts and I hurt. 'We feel it at the exact same time and I feel like I know when she’s crying or she’s upset if she’s not with me.' A married couple, Mark and Cheryl McEachran snatched Montana from Ms Ciancio (centre with supporters in 2005) a shopping centre on August 7, 2004 . The McEachrans were sentenced to 12 years in total in 2005, a year after the abduction . Montana said she loved how protective her mother was of her and that their relationship was 'any other mother and daughter relationship'. Despite the pain her kidnappers caused, Montana told the Herald Sun she wanted to meet the McEachrans. 'Because they’re very sick people and you shouldn’t take away another mother’s child just because you want another child, because you’re ruining their time with [their] child,' she said. 'Why would they take me away, why would they ruin my mum’s chance with me when I was a baby?' Cheryl McEachran was sentenced to four and a half years' jail in 2005 at Melbourne's County Court, while Mark McEachran got seven and half years.","A decade ago Anita Ciancio's three-month-old daughter was abducted .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The teacher who leaked information about Frances Abbott receiving a $60,000 scholarship to a Sydney design school has spoken out for the first time, saying he does not believe the Prime Minister's daughter deserved the money. Melletios Kyriakidis was revealed as the employee who exchanged emails with a librarian who has been charged with hacking computer files at Sydney's Whitehouse Institute of Design on May 20. He was investigated for breaching student privacy but in June he resigned before the review was completed. In May, it was revealed Frances Abbott had received a $60,000 scholarship to attend Whitehouse Institute of Design . Mr Kyriakidis, who taught Ms Abbott for three years, has lodged a complaint with the Fair Work Commission, claiming he was constructively dismissed and that he was treated differently because of his political views, according to Australian Financial Review. The design academic told AFR he did not access any records illegally, but did contact journalists and politicians on May 14 while he was still working at the institute asking them to look into why Ms Abbott did not have to pay any tuition fees. Mr Kyriakidis also added that even though he thought Ms Abbott was a 'lovely person', he said there were 'a lot more people' who deserved the scholarship over her. Melletios Kyriakidis was the former employee who leaked information to the media about the controversy . 'Even from her class I could name 10 people more deserving either for merit or financial need or both,' he told AFR. Last week, Whitehouse Institute of Design's chief executive officer Ian Tudor confirmed to the Daily Mail Australia that an 'adverse action case' by a former employee was to be heard by the workplace relations tribunal. Mr Tudor told the Daily Mail Australia the institute was 'confident that the adverse action case is without merit and has no prospect of success'. 'The former employee  (Kyriakidis) concerned was subject to an internal disciplinary review and resigned before that review was complete,' he said in a statement. 'Given that the matter is currently before the Fair Work Commission, we will be making no further comment.' Mr Kyriakidis said he did not think Ms Abbott (pictured far right with her family and Prince Harry) deserved the scholarship . Daily Mail Australia contacted Mr Kyriakidis but he said as the matter was before the tribunal he was unable to comment. His representative is yet to respond to questions. Mr Kyriakidis is being represented by the same firm who handled James Ashby's sexual harrassment case against former speaker Peter Slipper, Harmers Workplace Lawyers. Mr Abbott has also been added as a respondent on Mr Kyriakidis' legal claim against Whitehouse Institute of Design. When it was revealed in May Ms Abbott had received the scholarship, it caused widespread student protests because Mr Abbott failed to declare the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, including gifts awarded to their children. The tribunal will hear Mr Kyriakidis's case on Tuesday in Sydney.","Former employee Melletios Kyriakidis leaked information to the media .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . More than 10,000 people have been affected by an app spreading a virus under the guise of letting users change the colour of their Facebook profile. Researchers at China-based company Cheetah Mobile have detected the Facebook color changer app was infecting customers' phones and computers with malicious software. It has affected people in a number of countries but this is not the first time it has happened before, according to Cheetah Mobile. More than 10,000 people have been affected by a Facebook colour change app spreading a virus . The app has made several appearances over the past couple of years, including in 2012 and 2013. Phone users are reporting is claiming it can change the colour scheme of their Facebook profiles and then they are redirected to a phishing website. 'Cheetah Mobile researchers have found this issue to be happening due to a vulnerability that lives in Facebook’s app page itself, allowing hackers to implant viruses and malicious code into Facebook-based applications directs users to phishing sites,' the telecommunications company's website said. 'The code...takes users who believe they are visiting the URL ""apps.facebook.com/themsandcolors"" and automatically reroutes them to a malicious phishing site.' The app asks people to change the colour scheme of their Facebook profile . On Android phones, the virus works by a warning popping up and telling users to download a suggested app (left) but to prevent the problem users should download a security app (right) There are two ways phones or computers can be infected. The first is by stealing information through access tokens, which allows hackers to connect with the users' Facebook friends. If this tactic does not work, consumers are then asked to download a malicious application, while PC users are lead to a site to download a pornography video player. On Android devices, a warning pops up telling users that their phone has been infected and then asks them to download a suggested app. But those already infected should uninstall the app straight away and change their passwords. To prevent further problems from happening, Cheetah Mobile also suggests turning off Facebook's apps platform, and for those who have not been infected install a security app.","The app claims to change the colour of people's Facebook profiles .

"By . Brian Viner . Never mind Mr Selfridge, the hit series chronicling the early years of the great department store. Another retail empire, which began further along London's Oxford Street from Selfridges, and much earlier, has an even more beguiling story. John Lewis is 150 years old this year, and its rich history is celebrated in an exhibition at the flagship Oxford Street store. John Lewis celebrates 150 years of business this year . Were anyone to make a TV drama about John Lewis, it might include the aviator Amy Johnson, the murderer Dr Crippen and the wartime code-breaker Hugh Alexander. They all feature in the fascinating tale of how a single draper's shop grew into a high street institution that is part and neatly wrapped parcel of Britain's consumer culture. The middle classes in particular have for generations been reliant on the John Lewis Partnership, as it became, and of course on Waitrose, the string of grocer's shops that were gathered into the John Lewis fold in 1937. Many of us were almost literally weaned on John Lewis. In the exhibition there stands a handsome Silver Cross pram, which might be a replica of the one that transported me 50-odd years ago. My elderly mother still recalls going to John Lewis, in the form of its Liverpool outpost George Henry Lee, to buy a Silver Cross for me. And the great childhood treat for my Yorkshire wife Jane, brought up in Barnsley, was being taken for fancy afternoon teas at Sheffield's branch of John Lewis, Cole Brothers. Maybe it helps to be over 50, but there must be millions of Britons for whom memories of John Lewis . John Lewis aged 70 in 1910 . and its grand provincial outposts offer such stabs of nostalgia. The story begins with John Lewis himself, born to a baker and his wife in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in 1836. He was apprenticed to a draper in nearby Glastonbury, but made his way to London and found a job in Oxford Circus with another draper, Peter Robinson, whose name would also become familiar to generations of British shoppers. In time Robinson offered Lewis a partnership, but Lewis declined and, in 1864, aged 28, he set up his own draper's shop, also on Oxford Street. He crammed his shop window with silks, laces, ribbons and bows, which he'd bought cheaply so he could sell cheaply. That was his simple retailing philosophy. He reduced his overheads further by opting not to advertise, and the empire he founded would largely eschew mainstream advertising for more than a century. Now, of course, John Lewis campaigns, such as the charming 'The Hare & the Bear' commercials last Christmas, have themselves become iconic in their own right. There were other ways in which old man Lewis kept his costs down. The exhibition is on the third floor of the flagship store, to which I ascended by lift. But not all Victorian shoppers were so fortunate. The company's archivist, Gavin Henderson, told me that when the first lift was installed in 1893, Lewis used to stand nearby, mindful that it cost him a penny-farthing every time the new apparatus carried customers up or down. 'So he would assess their physical state, and if he thought they were fit enough, he'd send them up the stairs.' By the 1890s the shop had become much more than a draper's, but in 1906 Lewis bought an established department store, Peter Jones in Chelsea. Jones, another enterprising provincial draper, had died the year before and Lewis seized his chance, walking the couple of miles from Oxford Street to Sloane Square with 20 £1,000 notes in his pocket to make the purchase in cash. In that same year, 1906, Lewis gave his 21-year-old son John Spedan Lewis a quarter share of the business. Spedan (he was always known by his middle name) had many radical management ideas - such as cutting hours and introducing tea-breaks - that were at odds with his father's unyielding Victorian principles. 16s 4d . John Lewis's takings on his first day in  his new store on Oxford Street . 1.1bn . Pounds in sales made on the John Lewis website last year, up 19.2 per cent on the previous year . 43 . John Lewis stores can now be found nationwide,  along with 300 Waitrose stores . He was grudgingly allowed to put some of them into practice at Peter Jones, where he was made chairman. But Spedan was not the only enlightened retailer in London. In 1909 the American Harry Gordon Selfridge opened his own department store, and allowed customers to wander round his magnificent premises unguided. This was revolutionary: at other department stores shoppers were escorted by floorwalkers who would introduce them to a sales assistant. Old Mr Lewis would not countenance Selfridge's way of doing things, and he had similarly old-fashioned ideas about employment practices. In 1920, 400 of his staff went on strike for better pay and conditions, but Lewis simply sacked and replaced them. When he died in 1928, aged 92, his son took the reins. It was no coincidence that the John Lewis Partnership was inaugurated the following year, where profits were divided between the entire workforce, now known as 'Partners'. Spedan also introduced one of the first graduate training schemes. He liked to recruit 'learners' himself according to their chess skills, and one of the finest players he recruited, Hugh Alexander, was later seconded to Bletchley Park to help break the Nazi Enigma code. Another of Spedan's young graduates was Amy Johnson, taken on in 1928 as a sales assistant and later to gain fame as a record-breaking aviator. Due to Spedan's clever recruitment the John Lewis Partnership prospered even while the rest of the nation's economy suffered terribly in the 1930s. Spedan planned a chain of John Lewis hotels, and in 1937 bought a string of ten grocery shops in the London area to supply them. This was Waitrose, which had been founded by Messrs Waite, Rose and Taylor in 1908; Taylor bailed out of the partnership early, denying himself a place in the annals of British food retailing. Arthur Rose was the accounts man. The visionary was Wallace Waite, a self-made grocer who by coincidence had been a pupil at Shepton Mallet Grammar, like John Lewis before him. Waitrose quickly added to the Partnership's success, although there was a setback in 1940 when the flagship John Lewis store was all but destroyed by German bombs. Spedan's expansion plans continued unabated however, and that same year the Partnership acquired a controlling interest in the ailing Selfridge Provincial Stores, a group of 15 department stores Selfridge had set up in the 1920s - they included George Henry Lee, Jones Brothers on Holloway Road, north London, and Caleys of Windsor, where 'Madame' Caley herself once made hats for Queen Victoria (and which remained milliner by royal warrant until it closed eight years ago). In 1910 Jones Brothers helped seal the conviction of Dr Crippen, on trial at the Old Bailey for murdering his wife. Human remains had been found at his home in north London, but he claimed they dated from before he lived there. However, they were found buried with pieces of a man's pyjama jacket bearing a Jones Brothers label, and the shop's menswear buyer testified that those pyjamas had not been introduced until 1908, well after Crippen had moved in. Today we're all familiar with the white and green company colours, chosen it's said because Spedan wrote his thousands of memos in green ink. He was also said to be domineering and autocratic, but nevertheless he remains, like his father before him, an authentic hero of the British high street.

"By . Ruth Styles . When animal-loving zookeeper Scott Adams, 31, from Telford, proposed to his long term love Verity Clarke, 26, he had already decided that only a wildlife themed wedding would do. Much to his surprise, his paramedic bride-to-be agreed - and even allowed him to take complete control over planning for their nuptials. But with £1,800 spent on life-size plastic animals for the reception and just £96 on the dress, the results weren't quite what she bargained for. Big day: Scott and Verity's big day involved plastic zoo animals and a pair of very real pygmy crocodiles . Happy couple: Romantic Scott decided to make Verity's bouquet a tropical one . 'All I could think was how can he be given so much money and yet not pay out for a proper wedding dress!' she laughs. The couple married this summer in a wildlife-themed wedding, complete with sharp-toothed special guests in the shape of a pair of pygmy crocodiles. But Verity, who will appear with Scott on BBC3 show Don't Tell The Bride, says dress notwithstanding, she would be happy to let her new husband do it all over again. 'I was happy for Scott to make the . decisions because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and we would . never have been able to afford such a wedding if we hadn't have been on the . show,' she confesses. 'Obviously, I trust him. He always does great little surprises . for me so I thought he would do a good job, although I didn't trust him . with the dress. 'He doesn't always have the best taste in clothes though, . but I hoped he would get some inspiration from somewhere and choose . well.' Unfortunately for Verity, Scott's inspiration came from eBay instead. 'On eBay, I had 14,000 dresses to choose . from,' he protests. 'I had more choice than any dress shop could have ever offered so it was exactly what I wanted.' He adds: 'I would totally . recommend an eBay wedding dress.' Scott, who describes his ideal wedding as 'crazy, memorable and nothing normal - just like my whole life so far', says he loved the experience of planning his big day and says more grooms should get involved. Precarious: Zookeeper Scott is used to handling sharp-toothed wildlife, but it's all new to paramedic Verity . Perfect venue: The couple married within Cornwall's Eden Project - a series of domed biospheres . 'I guess I should say don't do it,' he says, 'but . looking back, it was a once in a life time experience and it you can take . the pressure then just go for it and do it large.' He also reveals that he was the one who first came up with the idea of getting married on television and says that too was 'very me'. 'I knew Verity would love what I planned . as long as it came from the heart and she she did,' he adds. 'I'm good at planning . things, although it isn't so easy with a film crew breathing down your neck.,' For her part, and in spite of the eBay dress, Verity says she had a wonderful day that ended just as she had imagined it - married to the man she loves. 'The best part of the wedding was seeing . Scott and knowing we were there to take the biggest step of out lives . together,' she says. 'And seeing all our family and friends gathered together was . wonderful.' Smart choice: Verity looked lovely in her eBay dress and Scott says he would recommend it to anyone . What's more, despite not getting the church ceremony she had hoped for and having to share centre stage with a squad of plastic animals, she says she does think grooms should get more involved in wedding planning. 'The big day was really important to me . as I wanted it to be a big coming together of all our friends and family,' she says. 'I wanted it to be somewhere traditional . that was really picturesque and hoped for a church ceremony . although I knew Scott would never go for that.' She adds: 'I . definitely think it proves that brides should give more thought to their fiance's thoughts when planning a wedding, even if something doesn't sound . like a great idea.' Scott himself says he wouldn't change a thing. 'I did everything I could to make the wedding perfect and very us, even though some of it might seem crazy,' he says. 'It was memorable and personal - just the way i imagined it.'

"By . Graham Smith . Updated: . 21:10 EST, 21 December 2011 . Acupuncture reduces levels of a protein linked to chronic stress . Acupuncture really does reduce stress levels, say scientists. In the first study of its kind, a team found the ancient Chinese therapy reduces levels of a protein linked to chronic stress. Although the research was carried out on rats, researchers say it might help explain the sense of well-being many people receive from the therapy. If their findings are replicated in human studies, it could offer a proven treatment for stress. The U.S. study tested the effect of acupuncture on blood levels  of the protein neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is secreted by the sympathetic nervous system in humans. This system is involved in the ‘flight or fight’ response to acute stress, resulting in constriction of blood flow to all parts of the body except to the heart, lungs and brain (the organs most needed to react to danger). Chronic stress, however, can cause elevated blood pressure and cardiac disease. The study used four groups of rats for a 14-day experiment: . Lead author Dr Ladan Eshkevari, of Georgetown University, allowed the rats - animals which can mount a stress response when exposed to winter-like cold temperatures for an hour a day - to become familiar with her. She then encouraged them to rest by crawling into a small sock that exposed their legs, and gently conditioned them to become comfortable with the kind of stimulation used in electroacupuncture - an acupuncture needle that delivers a painless small electrical charge. This form of the therapy is more intense than manual acupuncture and is often used for pain management. Many people receive a sense of well-being from the therapy . She selected a single acupuncture spot to test - Zuslanli, one of the most frequently used acupuncture points and said to help relieve a variety of conditions including stress. As with rats, the point lies on the leg below the knee. Dr Eshkevari found NPY levels in the experimental group came down almost to the level of the control group, while the rats that were stressed and not treated with Zuslani acupuncture had high levels of the protein. In a second experiment, she stopped acupuncture in the experimental group but continued to stress the rats for an additional four days, and found NPY levels remained low. She said: 'It has long been thought that acupuncture can reduce stress, but this is the first study to show molecular proof of this benefit. 'I used electroacupuncture because I could make sure that every rat was getting the same treatment dose. 'We were surprised to find what looks to be a protective effect against stress.' The study is published online in the journal Experimental Biology and Medicine.","Acupuncture 'reduces' levels of protein linked to stress .

She made her acting debut in Harry Enfield's comedy series Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul before going on to star in Enfield's tribute to BBC2, Harry and Paul's Story of the Twos, in May. And Fifi isn't the only member of the Hart family with designs on an acting career. Her older sister Mimi, 11, has enjoyed a varied career with appearances on radio and on TV with Vernon Kay among her credits. She is also to star in Where the Land Meets the Sea, a short film by acclaimed director Christina Hardinge, whose credits include music videos, theatre and a series of live performances at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. By contrast, Oliver and Zac Barker are completely unknown although both bear an uncannily close resemblance to their on-screen father, the late Matthew Crawley. As you were: Twins Cole and Logan Weston played Master George in the last series of Downton Abbey . New series: Filming for season five has taken the cast to Northumberland and the majestic Alnwick Castle . Whatever their pedigree, all three are set to play a . central part in the action during season five, with ITV promising 'touching scenes' between little Sybiie and her on-screen father, former chauffeur Tom Branson. Speaking ahead of the new series, Allen Leech, who plays Branson, said: ‘Tom’s place is now at the Abbey – even he would admit that.’ Like his cousin Sybbie, heir apparent to the Earldom, Master George, also has a parent struggling to come to terms with the death of the other one. According to producers, Lady Mary will spend the next series battling to put the death of her husband Matthew Crawley behind her in order to do the best for her son. What does it all mean? Cast members Laura Carmichael (Lady Edith) and Lily James (Lady Rose) at Alnwick . It's not quite Downton: Alnwick Castle is more famous for its starring role as Hogwarts Castle in the Harry Potter films .","Four-year-old Fifi Hart from the Isle of Wight will play Sybbie Branson .

"By . Ruth Styles . She might have been spending the day in the mountains but that certainly didn't mean letting her sartorial standards slip. Spain's Queen Letizia was with her husband King Felipe and two adorable daughters and managed to look every inch the yummy mummy in a pair of casual chinos and a pretty printed T-shirt. The royal couple and their daughters are currently on their annual holiday to the Balearic party isle, and have been spending much of their time relaxing in the Marivent Palace just outside capital Palma. Scroll down for video . Family day out: Queen Letizia, King Felipe and their daughters arrive at the World Heritage Centre in Bunyola . Stylish: Letizia was chic in a pair of khaki chinos and a pretty floral print t-shirt for the visit . While the infamous resort of Magaluf is less than 12 miles away, royal holidays on the Spanish party island of Mallorca tend to be more sedate. Instead of lines of jager bombs and drunken fumbles on balconies, the Spanish royals spend most of the time on their yacht, Fortuna, and the rest enjoying private dinners interspersed with the occasional official visit. But there's more to Mallorca than relaxing on yachts and avoiding Magaluf as the royal couple and their daughters discovered this morning. The striking Serra de Tramuntana were recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in recognition of the extraordinary agricultural techniques used on its precipitously steep slopes, and the royals began their day with a visit to the newly opened visitor centre in Bunyola. Afterwards, the quartet were taken to see something of the mountains themselves before enjoying a lunch at a pretty country house in Raixa.

Queen Letizia and the two princesses try out one of the interactive displays . Hot work: The royal family head to Raixa for lunch following their visit to the World Heritage Centre . Afterwards, the family returned to the Marvient Palace to continue their holiday, which is expected to continue for another week. Like the Queen, whose annual trip to Balmoral combines family time with official visits, the Spanish royals spend part of their holiday meeting well-wishers and conducting engagements. Unlike the British monarch, however, the Spanish royals rarely host visiting heads of state at the Marvient, although some well-heeled visitors do get to see inside. One . group of visitors who did were the Prince . of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined the Spanish royals for a . holiday in Mallorca in 1988. Like Queen Letizia and King Felipe who posed for photos on the steps of the palace on the day they arrived, the British royal couple joined former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sophia for pictures along with their children - a three-year-old Prince Harry and a five-year-old William. The British royals also spent time on Fortuna, with Prince Charles photographed teaching Harry how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest, King Constantine of Greece.

"By . Ruth Styles . The sun was shining and the ensembles colourful, as racegoers, joined by a glamorous Zara Phillips, arrived for Ladies Day at the Glorious Goodwood race meeting in Sussex today. But for once, all eyes weren't on the brightly dressed ladies - all thanks to an unexpected appearance from Hollywood star Tom Cruise who arrived with Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara, and his wife, Janet. Zara, meanwhile, slipped into the racecourse with a minimum of fuss, although not before impressing fashion fans with her chic cream dress and matching cocktail hat, and was later seen enjoying a chat with the actor from the comfort of a box. Scroll down for video . Watch out Mike! Olympic silver medallist Zara and the diminutive actor appeared to be getting along famously as they chatted in a hospitality box . New hobby? Although not known for his love of racing, Cruise appeared to be enjoying the experience and had Zara on hand to pass on a few tips . Enjoying . herself: Zara was spotted enjoying the sunshine as she watched the . first race of the day, a huge pair of sunglasses firmly in place . Stylish: Zara was joined by a friend for her day at the races but husband Mike Tindall, 36, and baby Mia Grace both stayed at home . Looking good: Zara showed off her stylish side in a cream dress and black patent shoes as she took a day off from preparations for the World Equestrian Games . And she's off! Zara and her friend make their way into the paddock ahead of a day's racing at Glorious Goodwood which kicks off with the Fairmont Stakes . Day out with friends: Zara joined Natalie Pinkham, Lord March and Georgie Thompson in Goodwood's manicured Richmond Enclosure . Beaming broadly at other racing fans, the Olympic silver medallist, 32, appeared to be on top form as she arrived with a friend for a rare day off from the intense training schedule she is following ahead of World Equestrian Games in Normandy next month. Earlier this month, Zara took to the field at the Barbury Horse Trials near Marlborough and also enjoyed a successful day at the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire in late June. But successful though most of her outings have been, it is the World Equestrian Games that are at the front of her mind, particularly as Team GB selectors for Rio 2016 will be in the crowd. Competing alongside Zara in Normandy will be the rest of the current Team GB, among them world number one William Fox-Pitt and fellow Olympic medallist Tina Cook. Despite the prospect of an imminent brush with the selectors, Zara looked relaxed and ready to enjoy a day's racing which kicked off with the Fairmont Stakes, which was won by three-year-old colt Lyn Valley. Enjoying . himself: Tom Cruise certainly appeared impressed with his experiences . of the quintessentially British event and was seen laughing with Lord . March . Hello ladies: Clearly on charming form, Tom Cruise also proved a hit with the colourfully dressed ladies who were sharing his box at Glorious Goodwood in Sussex . You win some...

Lily Atkinson, daughter of Rowan, looks grim as she watches the races with Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, Lord Settrington - the son and heir of Lord March . Although neither Tom Cruise nor Zara Phillips managed to back him, TV star Carole Vorderman, who was chic in a demure navy blue jumpsuit, was left celebrating her first win of the day. Also left less than impressed was the Queen, whose Gold Cup winning filly Estimate was left to bring up the rear in the Artemis Goodwood Cup - much to her jockey Ryan Moore's distress. Estimate, who was recently caught up in a doping scandal that led to her being accidentally fed morphine-tainted feed, was left far behind the eventual winner, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's horse Cavalryman. Off the course, things hotted up in the style stakes too, with racegoers plumping for demure shift dresses and eye-catching hats of the type that wouldn't look out of place at Royal Ascot. Although it doesn't quite hit the sartorial heights of the Berkshire meet, Glorious Goodwood is . catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the . opportunity to dress up for the occasion. Like Ascot, Goodwood operates a strict dress code . that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their . shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress. Instead, . the style guide suggests 'jackets and either ties, cravats or polo neck . sweaters' for gentlemen and 'smart casual' for ladies, adding that 'due . to the terrain and areas of decking at Goodwood, flat shoes are . recommended'.

Final . touches: A group of racegoers put the finishing touches to their . ensembles, with delicate floral corsages proving particularly popular . Floor sweeping: Several racegoers plumped for unusually long gowns, including one that looked like a wedding dress (left), while others picked flowing and summery . While Cheltenham is famous for pearls and fur, and Aintree for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels, Glorious Goodwood's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes. Delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers, as are Sloaney ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls, comfortable loafers and deck shoes. Nevertheless, the meeting isn't short of glamour with plenty of the big, bold, be-plumed hats of the sort seen at Berkshire's Royal Ascot and neat, nipped-in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock. As at Ascot, racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart-casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress.

"By . Ruth Styles . Revelling in the sunshine and with the prospect of a good day out ahead of them, the scene as racegoers arrived for the first day of Glorious Goodwood couldn't have been more quintessentially English. And in true race day style, the hats were big and the dresses colourful as cheerfully dressed ladies made their way into the Sussex racecourse for their day out at the races. Among the most spectacular were the hats worn by guests Charlie Elmy-Britton and Layla Leigh, who had both splashed out on super-sized titfers made from iridescent peacock feathers and delicate grey marabou.

Racegoers certainly appeared to be taking those strictures to heart, with no sign of the wacky hats, skintight frocks and skyscraper heels that characterise other meets, most notably Aintree. On the course, racing action got underway with the bet365.com Handicap which was taken by Irish bred gelding Stomachion, with Sir Alex Ferguson's I'm Fraam Govan in second place and the Queen's horse Sea Shanty in third.

"By . Ruth Styles . He's spent weeks surviving on nothing more than cow's blood and milk, faced down great white sharks and lived for months in the Amazon jungle. But despite his dark good looks - and impressive survival skills - TV explorer Hazen Audel, 40, says none of it is anywhere near as difficult as finding lasting love, even if he does admit that his constant travels don't always help. 'A great white has the ability to tear your arms off,' chuckles Hazen, who is currently starring in National Geographic's Survive the Tribe. 'But I understand sharks a lot more than women!' Scroll down for video . Shark hunt: During his trip to the Solomon Islands, Hazen hunted Great White sharks in a flimsy canoe . Nevertheless, he says he is ready to find someone new - even if things haven't always gone to plan in the past. 'I’ve been giving this love stuff a . pretty good shot - my last relationship lasted for six years,' explains Hazen. 'And I loved . being crazy in love. The problem was, it was crazy - it had an uncanny . resemblance to Fatal Attraction! 'I barely came out of that alive and I was lucky my cat didn’t get boiled! At least I . know where never to venture again.' While boiling cats is a definite no-no, Hazen, a regular consumer of gruesome foods, says cooking is a sure way to his heart, although you don't have to be good at it. Don't hurt my cat! Hazen says he likes a girl who can cook, although he'd prefer that his cat doesn't get boiled . Tough guy: Hazen spends much of his time travelling, in this case in the Kalahari with the Ju/'hoansi San people . 'I rarely complain about the cook’s abilities,' he explains. 'Being able to cook is a major turn on but she doesn’t have to a good one.' Being able to put up with a night in a tent and a penchant for travel to off-the-beaten track destinations also help, as does being able to shin up a tree - a favourite first date test of Hazen's. 'I have been known to assess a date on whether they climbed a tree with me or not,' he confesses. 'But the best dates I have had are . the ones where there are sparkles by the end and that just . plain doesn’t happen that often.' Part of the reason for that, of course, is Hazen's passion for travelling. Filming Survive the Tribe took him to six different countries and he's currently in Costa Rica working on his other career as a biologist. Survival skills: Hazen says he likes a girl who doesn't mind roughing it in a tent in the wilderness occasionally . Holiday trip: Hazen says he would take a girl to the Solomon Islands - definitely not Canada's chilly wilderness . Nevertheless, . he says he would eventually like someone to come home to - and in . return, would occasionally swap remote wildernesses for 'sand and palm . trees type places' for the right girl. 'Of course I enjoy travel but if I know it wouldn't be the sort of trip that would be a recipe for . disaster, then I'd love to share my experiences with the girl of my dreams. 'For this type of travel I prefer beaches with palm trees, white sand . and tropical fish. Even better would be with a hut in the village I filmed in the Solomon Islands. Regardless of the sharks, I’d like . to go back there, hopefully with a lovely girlfriend.' So what else does it take to impress the intrepid explorer? According to Hazen, looking good and smelling nice are important, although you don't necessarily need to brave tribal living. 'I need a woman that is certainly strong . enough to rough it camping and loves getting dirty,' he adds. 'But a girl who is . feminine and smells really nice - yeah! I like that!' Helpful: If you're looking for a man who knows how to see off a (gigantic) spider, Hazen is the one for you . British beauty: Hazen admits to a fondness for 'smart and feminine' British women - ideally from Bristol . British . women get the thumbs up too, although it's to the West Country rather . than London that Hazen is looking to for a British love. 'Some of those British women have stolen . my heart,' he chortles. 'One of the main things that impresses me about British . women is that they embrace being smart. 'They celebrate being intellectual . and are not afraid of having educated original thoughts and . conversation but they also have a refined femininity which I like. 'The problem is, I don’t know many well enough . to know if they like getting dirty and embracing the rugged. I think I . need more experience to give a better assessment. 'London . is amazing,' he continues, 'but in all honesty, it’s too big and crazy for me.  I love it when I visit but I love the smaller towns and countryside too. Comfort zone: While he is happy to be in remote Mongolia, he says he can only handle small doses of London . Tough guy: Hazen's travels have included a stint with Kenya's blood-drinking Samburu people . 'As . far as cities go, I'm in love with Bristol. I can't wait to get . back to the UK and I'm hoping to get back as soon as possible.' In . the meantime, smart British girls looking for a rugged adventurer will . have to content themselves with watching Survive the Tribe for Hazen is, . for now, deep in the Costa Rican jungle. 'I . help lead trips over there whenever possible,' he explains. 'This time, . I'm on a two-week adventure with biology teachers from all over the . world to teach them about the . tropical rainforest and to discuss new ways of teaching . science. 'It’s like camp for a bunch of adventurous, science-obsessed, nerdy, adults - we all have quite a blast.' When he returns, he says it might be time to start his search for love in earnest, although he adds that he has no intention of putting up with a girl with plans to play games. 'I’m not interested in . playing games,' he sniffs. 'I am impressed by a woman that does what she says she is . going to do and knows how to be a good person for herself and others. 'Those are the only kind of women that know a good man when they see it.' Presumably, you imagine, one like Hazen himself.

"By . Ruth Styles . With bright pink and orange garlands of hibiscus flowers draped over their shoulders, bouquets of jasmine and, bizarrely, crowned with palm fronds, Calcutta's flower sellers are a colourful bunch. Now a selection of the men are starring in a set of incredible new photos by Danish photographer Ken Hermann, which aim to shed light on a little known side of life in India's oldest port. Shot in the Mallick Ghat Flower Market, a huge warren of stalls sprawled along the banks of the Hooghly River, the project, entitled Flower Men, sees vendors pose with their blooms while looking impassively out at the camera. Spectacular: A man appears to be wearing a crown of palm frond (left) while another flower seller's body is almost completely hidden by his hibiscus garlands . Wonderful: A Calcutta flower seller stands with a neatly tied bunch of sunflowers (left) while birds swoop over the river while another vendor has his photograph taken . It was this stoicism, says Hermann, that first inspired him to start snapping pictures - that and the quirky contrast between the delicate flowers and their masculine owners. 'I first went to . the flower market during a visit to Calcutta three or four years ago and have wanted to do something on it ever since,' explains Copenhagen-based Hermann. 'It's a beautiful and, at the same time, very stressful . place but I was fascinated with it - and the flower sellers in particular. I really like the way they carry their flowers,' he continues. 'Sometimes it almost looks like they are wearing big flower dresses. I . like that you see these strong and masculine men handling the flowers . with so much care as if they were precious jewels.' Hermann, whose work usually takes him into the grimier side of Indian life, was also enchanted by the flowers themselves, even if there were a few that he wasn't allowed to photograph. Popular: Hibiscus is one of the most popular flowers and comes in a huge range of hues whether yellow (left) or a deep saffron orange (right) Gentle: Hermann says he was fascinated by the gentle way the men handled their flowers -  a fact especially apparent in the photo on the right . Striking: A vendor appears proud of his gorgeous bunch of crimson roses (left) while another is almost completely hidden behind a huge bundle of palm fronds . 'There are a lot of superstitions and religious belief in flowers in India,' he explains. 'I wasn't allowed to . photograph some of them because they were considered to be holy flowers and they would lose their power if I had.' Among them are the blood-red hibiscus beloved of Kali, Lakshmi's fragrant lotus flowers, Saraswati's champa (Indian magnolia) and the wonderfully named Flame of the Forest (yellow palash). The men themselves, however, proved to be willing accomplices. 'Most of the people didn't mind having their photo taken - provided it didn't take too long,' says Hermann. 'All of the flower . sellers were busy working and didn't want to lose any business.' He adds: 'Hopefully, people find the portraits . interesting: even though some of the flower sellers are poor, they are . still very proud of what they do and I hope . people can see that.' For more of Ken's work, see kenhermann.dk . Incongruous: Herman was struck by the contrast between the masculinity of the vendors and the delicate beauty of the flowers they sold . Curious: A dog sneaks into shot behind this colourfully dressed flower seller (left) while right, another has his photo taken in front of an interested audience .","Calcutta is home to the Mallick Ghat Flower Market which is sprawled along the banks of the Hooghly River .

"By . Ruth Styles . For the majority of us, slimming down means counting calories and maintaining strict control over what foods you eat and when. But now a diet expert has revealed the secret to losing weight might not be calorie counting after all and says that talking to yourself is what really makes a difference. Dubbed the 'self-chatter diet', the unusual eating plan claims to help users beat the bulge by eradicating fattening behaviour. Slimming solution: According to Richardson, tackling your behaviour is key to sustained weight loss . Plan: The diet insists on eating when your body needs it and ending bad behaviour through talking . 'There are lots of reasons why people are struggle to lose weight but the main reason is that . most weight loss systems are based on restrictive diets,' explains the man behind the plan, diet expert and hypnotherapist John Richardson. 'Until obesity is accurately diagnosed and is re-labelled as a behavioural condition - and is therefore . treated as such - no solution will ever be found. 'It's not food that . makes us overweight but way in which food is eaten. Beliefs, behaviours and associations are the fundamental reasons for the obesity epidemic.' Top of Richardson's hit list are eating by the clock, assuming that all three main meals have to be eaten and seeing sugar and fat laden foods are a treat. 'Treating being overweight with restrictive diets . is no different to treating a broken leg with a painkiller,' he adds. 'For someone to achieve their ideal weight, the only way is to identify, question, challenge and change . the detrimental behaviours responsible.' To do this, Richardson has devised a system which he dubs the 'self-chatter' diet which involves being aware of bad behaviours - and telling yourself off when you try and do them. 'Self-chatter is your inner-voice and often, this . self-talk happens so automatically you are barely aware of it, ' he explains. 'However, what you say to yourself can have a profound effect on the way . that you feel and what you can achieve.' All natural: Along with talking your way out of bad behaviour, Richardson says natural eating is the way forward . In the case of weight loss, that means being aware of the behaviours that lead to weight gain, for instance raiding the fridge at midnight or insisting on a late dinner, and stop yourself before you do it. 'With time and effort, and by following . the body’s hunger and satiety signals as opposed to environmental cues, you'll reignite natural instinctive eating habits,' adds Richardson. 'As a . consequence, eating . smaller portions and consuming less will become a normal practice.' But while talking to yourself is one thing, even Richardson admits that self-chatter won't do much for you if you still fill up on junk food. 'You need to give your body more fresh, natural food and plenty of water,' he adds.'Eating in moderation, choosing nutritious food and being vigilant about what you eat will all help.' Don't, he adds, expect the weight to drop off overnight. 'A no effort, . easy to achieve weight loss system is still yet to be found and probably never will be,' Richardson explains. 'Any system that promises a no effort, easy to . achieve, solution to being overweight is a manipulative one and not true. 'The only way to lose weight is to take responsibility for it yourself. The road to weight-loss success isn't easy but it's something that everyone can achieve and that is a fact.'

Laughing and joking with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Kate looked relaxed in her £79.99 double-breasted Zara blazer and trusty J Brand skinny jeans.

"By . Ruth Styles . Bizarre rubber 'beauty masks', gruesome artworks made from dried human skin and a porcelain fruit decorated with sexual scenes are among an eclectic array of pieces set to go on display in London from this month. Part of a new display at the Wellcome Collection in London, the A to Z of the Human Condition begins with 'Acts of Faith' and ends with 'Zoonoses' - diseases transmitted to humans by animals. But unusual though zoonoses are, what really catches the eye are the alternatively touching and revolting snapshots into human life through the centuries, starting with a beauty treatment that no modern woman would want to try - rubber beauty masks. Beauty: These rubber 'beauty masks', seen in a photo taken in 1921, were thought to remove wrinkles . The masks, a British invention, peaked in popularity during the 1920s thanks to the belief that they helped remove wrinkles and blemishes. Equally popular at the time was another British invention, the Claxton earcap, which was patented by inventor Adelaide Claxton in 1925 and was thought to correct 'outstanding ears'. But unpleasant sounding beauty gizmos weren't just the preserve of the British: The exhibition also includes a pair of tiny shoes made to be worn by Chinese women with bound feet. Once common in China, the practice - also known as 'Lotus Feet' - involved bending the toes backwards and breaking the arch of the foot before binding them in a bid to create attractively tiny extremities. Uncomfortable: The Claxton Earcap was patented in 1925 and was designed to cure sticking out ears . Tiny: These shoes, which were made circa 1870, were designed for a wearer with bound feet . Uncomfortable: Another dodgy U.K beauty gizmo, this brass corset was worn in a bid to whittle down the waist . Although binding began to lose ground among the elite from the mid-1800s onwards, it took until 1949 and the advent of Communist rule for the tradition to be banned entirely. But the exhibition isn't all foot binding and beauty masks. Among the more gruesome exhibits is a pair of sandals featuring a thicket of iron spikes that point up towards the foot. The shoes, which were worn by Indian fakirs (Muslim Sufi ascetics), were designed to cause maximum pain, with wearers believing that mastering the agony was a route to achieving enlightenment. Even more revolting is a set of preserved tattoos on human skin which date from the 1950s and feature a series of jolly motifs. Excruciating: These sandals, made circa 1871, were worn by Sufis in a bid to gain enlightenment through pain . Revolting: This French-made 'Souvenir du Sahara' was made using dried human skin circa 1850 . Vast: 50st Daniel Lambert was born in Leicester in 1770 and became the Britain's 'most corpulent' man . 'Rather than attempt to define the human . condition, this A-Z gives an imperfect and impressionistic presentation,' comments curator Danielle Olson. 'As meaning-seeking and empathetic creatures, I hope visitors will enjoy . the opportunities it offers to pause for thought, to wonder and to . share experiences. 'Although the exhibition doesn't reveal the meaning of . life, it grapples with many of its questions and offers glimpses of how . others have done so before.' The exhibition, which runs until 12th October, also includes paintings by Hieronymus Bosch and a porcelain fruit decorated with graphic sexual scenes. In a nod to modern lifestyles, also on display is a 19th century oil painting of Daniel Lambert who, until recently, was immortalised in the Dictionary of National Biography as 'the most corpulent man of whom record exists'. Weighing 50st when he died, Lambert, who was born in 1770, claimed he ate and drank moderately but cashed in on his corpulence with circus appearances. The A to Z of the Human Condition runs until 12th October at the Wellcome Collection. For more information, see wellcomecollection.org . Risque: This porcelain fruit, thought to date from the Edwardian period, depicts graphic sexual scenes . Fascinating: This incredible photo, taken in 1904 by Edward S. Curtis, shows the Navajo dressed as war gods .","The A to Z of the Human Condition includes art made on human skin .

"By . Ruth Styles . He might be celebrating his first birthday today but when it comes to style, Prince George has the sort of selling power that far outstrips his years with even his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, left trailing in his wake. Dubbed 'the world's most influential toddler' by Forbes magazine, anything the infant royal wears sells out instantly as mothers rush to add a shot of royal style to their children's wardrobes. With a mother famous for her sartorial nous, Prince George was always going to have a stylish wardrobe. But what few could have imagined is just how quickly the 'George Effect' would kick in. Scroll down for video . Adorable: Prince George, who turns one today, wore sailcloth Petit Bateau dungarees for the birthday portrait released on Sunday. They have since sold out . Adorable: Prince George's Les Abeilles rompersuit (left, beneath cardigan) and his Rachel Riley shorts and t-shirt (right) all sold out within hours of being worn . In the event, it took less than 48 hours with the white receiving blanket in which he was wrapped as he was carried from the Lindo Wing selling out almost instantly. Costing £44.95 and made by Aden + Anais, a US label run by an Australian, more than 7000 Jungle Jam swaddling wraps were sold in the first nine days of George's life, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent. And so it has continued, with the latest to benefit from the George effect being Petit Bateau, the French brand behind the striped sailcloth dungarees worn by the third in line to the throne for the birthday portrait released on Sunday. Costing just £27.50, the all-in-one sold out within hours of the photograph's publication with a £31.50 red version also selling well - much to the delight of CEO Patrick Pergament. 'Petit Bateau is extremely honoured that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose our brand to dress Prince George for this official photo,' he told MailOnline. Starting early: Aden + Anais sold more than 7,000 white receiving blankets in the first nine days of George's life after the baby was carried from the Lindo Wing in one . Can't copy this one: One of the few outfits not to sell out, if only because it is unique, Prince George's Victorian style lace Christening gown did spark a wave of imitations . 174280 . 71145 . 37920 . 137602 . 69101 . 26820 . 97455 . 'We are surprised and delighted and we could not imagine a better ambassador than this little boy full of life. We take this opportunity to wish him a very happy birthday.' And Pergament isn't the only CEO to have been left rubbing his hands in glee following a royal appearance. Designer Rachel Riley, almost unheard of until Prince George wore her sailboat smocked dungarees for a 'crawl-about' in New Zealand, says that the George Effect has transformed her business. 'He is such a high profile baby and he’s brought lots of attention and excitement to the brand,' the London-based designer said in an interview with Forbes magazine. 'It’s been phenomenal for the business to have Prince George wearing pieces from the collection. Personally, as a British citizen, if there’s one child I’d want to dress it’s the heir to the throne.  I’m absolutely thrilled.' Others to . benefit include little known Belgian label, Les Petit Abeilles whose . white romper suit emblazoned with sailboats was worn as George arrived . in Australia, and Spain's Neck & Neck whose website crashed after . the baby royal was photographed in its pinstriped dungarees during a day . out at the polo. 'Prince . George wore the sailboat romper by Les Petites Abeilles on two . occasions, at the Dukes arrival in New Zealand (with a white cardigan) and in Australia,' remembers Les Petit Abeilles founder, Désirée von Hohenlohe. Popular: This Johnstons of Elgin cashmere jumper worn in March's Mother's Day portrait was a gift from George's doting grandfather, Prince Charles . Adorable: This pair of £33.99 Neck and Neck dungarees sold out within hours of being spotted on George at a polo match and even crashed the brand's website . 'It was a great surprise and honour to see it worn by Prince George. We had a significant increase in sales afterwards and people emailed us from all over the world to order the romper.' And it isn't just Les Petit Abeilles sales figures that have felt the Prince George effect. As Ms von Hohenlohe explains, the increased scrutiny has resulted in a makeover for the business itself., . 'We had the idea of developing our business by launching a web shop,' she explains. 'With all the publicity we received, we had to speed up setting the shop up. 'It also motivates us for our future projects. Now there are big expectations and people are following what we are doing. A fashion magazine even contacted us to photo shoot of our autumn winter collection; this has been very encouraging for us.' Most of . all though, Ms von Hohenlohe says she is thrilled by the simple fact . that the Duchess of Cambridge liked her work enough to buy it for her . baby son. 'We . are of course thrilled with such an honour and we have great admiration . for the royals,' she beams. 'The fact that they liked our sailboat . romper means a lot to us, regardless of whether the current sailboat . romper frenzy continue or not. 'We . will always remember the  moment we saw the little Prince wearing our . romper, and the excitement we felt. We feel great about the fact that . Les Petites Abeilles can dress little boys all over the world like . little Princes.' Trendsetter: Prince George's Neck and Neck . dungarees were also worn in Canberra (left) while this pair of Rachel . Riley dungarees (right) were seen in Wellington . And dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog, What Prince George Wore, dedicated to all things baby style. The blog even has a . sister site in the shape of What Kate Wore - a website devoted to the . Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe - although Prince William is yet to find . similar favour with the fashion set. But . while the Duchess of Cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out . whatever she wears, even she cannot compete with her son when it comes . to sheer selling power. From . £44.95 swaddling wraps to sailcloth dungarees, the George effect shows . no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear . designers contemplating another decade of buoyant sales to come.","Prince George was less than 48 hours old when the 'George effect' first kicked, selling out Aden + Anais blankets .

"By . Ruth Styles . She's famous for her relaxed approach to royal walkabouts but even the Duchess of Cornwall couldn't hide her surprise when offered a perch on a well-wisher's knee during a visit. After bursting into fits of laughter, Camilla delicately took up Anthony Laing's offer as she took her place at the centre of a group photo with staff at the Shortbread House of Edinburgh. Mr Laing, the business' managing director, looked thrilled by his usually close brush with royalty, as did the chuckling staff members. New throne: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, perches on the knee of Anthony Laing (left) during a visit . Camilla was visiting the bakery as part of the annual royal tour of Scotland which kicked off yesterday with a visit to a jazz festival. But it was the bakery trip that proved the highlight of the week so far, with Camilla cheerfully donning a white coat and hat over her pretty navy and white patterned dress for the tour. Later, she tried on some clothes of an entirely different sort as she visited the Edinburgh International Fashion Festival sporting her favourite taupe coat and white pleated skirt. There, she was treated to a catwalk show and inspected pieces by some of Scotland's hottest young design talent before being presented with a tiny teddy for her grandson Prince George. Taking her seat: Camilla giggles as Mr Laing makes the offer before sitting down on his knee .

Stylish: The Duchess wore a white pleated skirt and taupe jacket for her visit to the Edinburgh Fashion Festival . She was also confronted with a set of risqué mannequins but appeared none the worse for the experience. Charles, however, was nowhere to be seen and instead of joining the Duchess at the bakery, travelled to the Glendelvine Estate in Perthshire . where he found himself face-to-face with a huge fluffy red squirrel. Happily . for the environmentalist prince, this one was a toy gifted to him as he . was brought up to speed with efforts to save the red squirrel, an . endangered native species. Once . common to the whole of the UK, the red squirrel is threatened by the . increasing numbers of grey squirrels, with the alien species forcing the . native reds north. Keepers at the Glendelvine Estate have hit upon a novel solution to the problem - trapping any greys spotted on the land.

Enjoying the tour: Despite being forced to don a white cover-all and hat, Camilla enjoyed her visit to the bakery .

"By . Ruth Styles . With their necks encircled with beads, their chins painted red with ochre and massed bracelets jangling on their wrists, the women of Kenya's Samburu and Rendille tribes are a colourful sight. But while the beads might look pretty, as photographer Eric Lafforgue explains, the elaborate jewellery is more than mere decoration. For not only does it denote wealth, it also reveals subtle clues about status as well. 'Beads are worn mainly for their beauty, but they also tell you about relationships and special events,' explains Lafforgue. 'Marnay bracelets are worn by everybody and are made of beads and bits of old tyres. Most wear brass anklets too.' Spectacular: Both Samburu and Rendille women wear elaborate beaded collars, decorative headdresses and, once married, heavy brass earrings . Beginning: . Girls get their first necklaces from their father - crimson strings of . beads that indicate the girl in question has had a husband chosen for . her . Engaged: . This girl's crimson collar tells onlookers that a husband has been . chosen for her but that she is yet to find a boyfriend. When she does, . the collar will come off . Although . separate tribes, the Samburu and Rendille are related and share several . similarities, among them a passion for beads. Both are semi-nomadic . pastoralists living in northern Kenya's Rift Valley and both make their . living from cows. Rather . gruesomely, their staple food is cow's blood, drawn using a special . arrow that pierces the vein without killing the animal, mixed with milk - . a protein-heavy diet that helps them survive in one of the harshest . environments on the planet. But . a penchant for blood shakes and cattle herding notwithstanding, both . Samburu and Rendille are famous for their bright beads with women in . particular wearing them every day. 'Samburu . girls are given strings of beads by their fathers from a very young . age,' explains Lafforgue. 'The first layers of necklaces are usually . red, as it means the girl is engaged which takes place at a very young . age. Striking: . The biggest collars are worn by teenage girls, who are given them by . their boyfriends. When they marry, they have to return the elaborate . necklaces . Status symbol: Collars are not merely decorative: They also reveal much about a woman's status and whether she is married or not . New addition: Thanks to the cheap Chinese goods that have flooded African markets, many Samburu headdresses now also include plastic flowers . Beautiful: Both of these women are from the Rendille tribe, a group closely related to the Samburu who inhabit the Kaisut Desert in northern Kenya . Modern: 16-year-old Elizabeth is one of the few Samburu to go to school and as a result, she has ditched most items of traditional dress with the exception of her collar . Grisly: . Both tribes drink cow's blood and milk 'smoothies'. Blood is taken with . the help of a specially made arrow that pierces the vein without . killing the cow . 'Before . getting married, teenagers enjoy a degree of sexual freedom and wear . heavy beaded necklaces given to them by their boyfriends - a Moran . (warrior) usually from her clan or even her family.' Each . girl is given a house by her parents where she can entertain her . warrior openly, while the men spend up to $100 (£58) - a huge amount of . money for the Samburu - on elaborate necklaces for their 'nekarai'. As a result, scraping together the cash to pay for a necklace can include some illegal business. 'To show my love for my girlfriend, I need . to buy her a huge necklace,' says 18-year-old warrior Namusungu. 'But the price is too high for me, so I . have to conduct a raid with my friends on the neighbouring . tribes to steal some cows. Then I’ll sell the cows to get some . money'. 'Once . I get married, I will have to remove the necklace offered to me by my . boyfriend,' adds 15-year-old Lariyon. 'I will have to give it back to . him, and I will need to forget him as my parents have already chosen . another man for me, from another clan.' Engaged: . 15-year-old Lariyon is engaged to a man who isn't her boyfriend and . will have to return this elaborate collar to him when she gets married . Married: Women who are married wear elaborate brass earrings and layer on necklaces, the colours of which have different meanings and reflect her status . Pastoralists: Both Samburu and Rendille tribes are semi-nomadic pastoralists who rely on their livestock, including huge flocks of goats, to survive . Similarities: As well as being pastoralists, both Samburu and Rendille live mostly on cow blood and milk 'smoothies' and adore colourful beads . Symbolic: Women whose first born child is a son wear extra earrings as do those who have managed to add several boys to their clan . Spectacular: . Like the Samburu, Rendille women wear elaborate beaded collars, . decorative headdresses and, once married, heavy brass earrings . Camps in Samburuland include Sasaab, which is situated on a rocky ridge . above the banks of the Ewaso Nyiro with remarkable views across the Laikipia . Plateau toward Mount Kenya. Rates . at Sasaab start from $648 per person per night based on two sharing on a . full board basis. For more information, see thesafaricollection.com Kenya . Airways (kenya-airways.com) operates daily overnight . flights from London Heathrow to Nairobi from £732.41. For more information on visiting Kenya, see magicalkenya.com . When Lariyon does marry, she will trade her huge, elaborate necklace for a pair of brass earrings, which symbolise marriage in Samburu culture. Should she have sons, she will add another: the Nkaiweli. Married women also wear elaborate headdresses made from entai (buttons), ntarangrang (sequins) and sayen (beads) to show off their status and their husband's wealth. 'Rendille women also wear the Mpooro Engorio or wedding necklace for ceremonies,' adds Lafforgue. 'They used to make them from giraffe or elephant tail hair but because hunting is banned, they use fibre from doum palm fronds to make them instead.' Rendille women are also famous for their elaborate doko hairstyles; an ochre daubed crest that tells anyone looking at them that their first child was a son and which they wear until their son or his father dies. 'The doko was made with the own hair of the woman so they couldn't remove it,' adds Lafforgue. 'Today, they wear an removable version made using palm fibre, red ochre and butter.' But it's the beads that offer the most clues to a Rendille or Samburu woman's lifestyle, with different colours revealing different aspects of her personality, status and health. White stands for purity and good health because it represents milk which comes from a cow, black is hardship, yellow and orange melded signify hospitality because they are the colours of animal skins laid out on guest beds. Red signifies danger, bravery and unity. 'Necklaces can even have magic powers,' notes Lafforgue. 'If a woman is sterile, she must see a witch doctor who will give her a collar of pearls. She must go to the first born man in any house, tie him up with the necklace and then leave with it. 'Three months later, she ought to be pregnant, while the man that she tied up with the necklace will become crazy or sick as in Samburu culture, the fortune of one will be the misfortune of the other.' Meaningful: . Different colours have different meanings with white standing for . purity and health because of its association with cow's milk . Headdress: . Head decorations are made from entai (buttons), ntarangrang (sequins) and sayen (beads) - all of which are expensive and denote wealth . Mothers: The Samburu woman (left) and the . Rendille lady (right) both have sons - an earring denotes it for the . Samburu while the doko hairstyle is the Rendille equivalent . Home: . A group of Rendille women in their village or 'gob'. Villages are . designed to be picked up and moved, with the tribe changing location . five times a year . Colourful: . The elaborate beads are worn with brightly coloured kikoy wraps that . come in every hue imaginable from bright pink to saffron yellow . Elaborate: Beaded jewellery isn't limited to . women: Men also wear elaborate headdresses and beautifully worked . collars, as well as armfuls of bracelets . Warriors: . The Samburu tribe's young men, or Moran as they are also known, don . elaborate beaded collars and headdresses for ceremonies .","The related Samburu and Rendille tribes live in northern Kenya's Great Rift Valley and share a passion for beads .

"By . Ruth Styles . For Rojina Begum, a former garment worker from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, the nightmares continue a year after she and more than 3,000 others were trapped in the rubble of Rana Plaza. Although she survived, 1,129 people were killed, among them her younger sister, whose body was so badly damaged, it had to be identified using DNA testing. A year on from the disaster, Ms Begum, who lost an arm in the collapse, says not enough is being done to help survivors with many, herself among them, left to fend for themselves. Scroll down for video . Traumatised: Rojina Begum was trapped beneath rubble for three days and had to amputate her arm to escape . 'I don’t know what happened to my sister,' adds Ms Begum. 'We did not get her dead body. We found her grave later, from a DNA sample.' Rana Plaza, an eight-storey building that housed five factories making clothes for Primark, Bonmarche and Matalan among others, collapsed on the morning of the 24th April 2013. Despite having planning permission for just five floors, owner Sohel Rana managed to persuade authorities to turn a blind eye to a further three, which like the rest of the building, had been put up as cheaply and quickly as possible. Although a crack in a pillar had been spotted the day before, owner Sohel Rana insisted that the building was safe and instructed workers to return on the 24th. By the time the building collapsed at 8.45am, the huge tower block was crammed with workers, among them Ms Begum and her sister. 'I woke up that day and cooked,' remembers Ms Begum. 'Then I had breakfast. I fed my daughter, . then sent her to school. Then I prepared lunch. I thought I’d have it . after work.' Disaster: A rescue worker stands in front of the remains of Rana Plaza in Savar, 30km from capital Dhaka . Rescue: The last survivor was pulled out of the rubble 17 days after the building collapsed . When she arrived at Rana Plaza, it was to . find the building surrounded by worried workers, spooked by the . previous night's TV reports of a crack in the infrastructure. Under the threat of wage cuts, Ms Begum and fellow workers were convinced to go inside and begin the day's work as normal. 'After I went inside I saw the rumour was true,' says Ms Begum who had worked as a seamstress in a second floor factory. 'There was a . crack in the pillar and the rods had come out. There were cracks in the . ceiling too. It could collapse any time. I told my sister, ""We made a . mistake coming, let’s leave"".' But it was too late. As the factories of Rana Plaza whirred into life, intense vibrations from the eighth floor generators and heavy looms elsewhere proved more than the weakened infrastructure could cope with. 'Suddenly we heard a loud noise, at around 8:45am,' says Dipu Asaduzzaman, a production manager who worked on the fifth floor of Rana Plaza. 'It was like the sound of a bomb going off. It sounded exactly the same. When I heard the noise, I looked up and saw everything collapsing.' The building took just 90 seconds to collapse, leaving thousands of workers trapped inside the rubble, among them Mr Asaduzzaman and Ms Begum. 'I . regained consciousness 20 minutes later,' said Mr Asaduzzaman. 'There was a wall on both my . legs. A rod had gone through my right leg. 'I was bleeding. I was lying . on my back. When I looked up I saw the ceiling was six inches above me. I . had my phone in my hand and checked it. There was no reception, so I . could not call anyone.' 'All I could think was where is my sister?', remembers Ms Begum. 'I was worried about her and I was . panicking. I stood there and screamed and as soon as I screamed I fell . into darkness. I was calling my sister’s name.' Pain: Dipu Asaduzzaman was badly hurt in the disaster but hopes to one day open his own leather workshop . Grim: One of the 2.515 wounded survivors is carried away from the remains of Rana Plaza . Like Mr Asaduzzaman, when Ms Begum awoke minutes later, it was to find herself trapped beneath the rubble and in agony from her wounds. 'I was lying in a cramped space in darkness,' she says. 'My arm was trapped under rods, beams, machines, and tables. 'My . head hurt and I was bleeding from my ear. It was horrible. Many of the . people around me had died. Their blood rolled down my body. Everyone was . screaming. I was thinking, where is my sister?' Unbeknown to Ms Begum, her sister was already dead and it would be another 48 hours before rescuers appeared. Mr Asaduzzaman, lying trapped in the rubble with a broken leg, was also in for a long wait. 'Sometimes we were screaming, ""Save us, . save us, save us"",' he remembers. 'We could hear sounds outside but we did not know if . anyone could hear us. Then we realised they were rescuing people. I told . everyone we are alive so we will survive. They will rescue us, either . today or tomorrow. Under arrest: Four days after the disaster, owner Sohel Rana was arrested as he tried to flee Bangladesh . Horrific: Many of the victims of the disaster were women, among them Rojina's younger sister . 'Time was passing. We did not feel hungry. We did not feel anything. It was 8 o’clock. Then . we heard someone from outside call, ""Is there someone in there?"" 'We . screamed, ""Save us, save us"". One of the people said ""OK, we are . coming"". Then one guy came, a  rescuer. 'He put some trousers under me, . denim ones from the label sewing section. They dragged me out, using . those trousers. 'Two people held me from the back and two people folded . my knees from the front. My legs were fractured. I was in a lot of pain. I think of that moment sometimes. That's what I think of most.' He was lucky. For Ms Begum, her arm pinned down with a chunk of concrete for more than 48 hours, getting out of Rana Plaza meant being forced to hack off her own limb with a saw. 'I never thought that . I’d have to amputate my own arm,' she says. 'But I was forced to by the situation. The doctor tried to amputate it but couldn’t reach. 'I said , ""No matter . how hard it is, amputate my arm"". He said, ""I’m giving you a saw and . you can do it yourself"". 'At first I said, ""I can’t. I have no strength."" It was the start of the third day. He said, ""Give it a try"". I said, ""OK, give it to me"" and I cut it. I had only one thing on my mind, . to look for my sister. That’s why I could do it.' For both Mr Asaduzzaman and Ms Begum, life since the disaster has been tough. Both are still receiving treatment and neither have had much help. 'I’m having treatment in the hospital,' says Mr Asaduzzaman. ;I . don’t know for how long. It will be a long process. The doctors said so. 'But I am hoping to start a leather goods business very soon. I tell . everyone this - I ask you to pray I can do it.' Ms Begum says her future looks bleak. 'I . never imagined  in my entire life that I’d have to see my younger . sister’s grave,' she says, tears rolling down her cheeks. 'I’d hoped to do a lot of things. What will I hope . for now? I have only one hand. I can't do anything.'

Tragedy: Prince William spoke of his sadness and offered his sympathy to victims of yesterday's crash . 'In South Australia, we visited an organisation that will long live in our memory called the Northern Sound System. 'There, . we met young people – some from very difficult backgrounds – who were . turning their lives around through the power of music. 'The place was Australia at its very best: young, innovative, caring, cool … it was a truly uplifting place.' Today, with 28 Australians confirmed killed, the country is mourning its dead, among them a nun and three small children.

Duke of Cambridge had been invited to Australia House to unveil a . statue of Captain Matthew Flinders, a British explorer and navigator who . in 1801 became the first person to circumnavigate the Australian coast. But . following yesterday's plane crash, which claimed 298 lives including . those of 80 children, a sombre Duke spoke instead of his sadness at the . loss of life and offered his sympathies to grieving families. 'For . Australians, and for our Malaysian brothers and sisters in the . Commonwealth, the crash is a particularly cruel tragedy coming so soon . after the loss of MH370,' he added. The .

'Our heart goes out to them, our prayers are with them and whatever assistance we humanly can offer we will because Australians stick by each other in times of trouble.' Mr Abbott added: 'If it has been brought down by a missile that is an unspeakable crime and we should be filled with revulsion against anything that would do something horrible to innocent people.'

"By . Ruth Styles . Dressed in summery turquoise and with a broad smile plastered across her face, the Queen was on cheerful form as she arrived to open the newly refurbished Reading Station today. Waiting for her was an army of construction workers, all of whom were dressed in eye-catching orange overalls and looked almost as pleased to see Her Majesty as she was to see them.

The prince is famous for his passion for farming and owns several, among them Highgrove's Duchy Home Farm. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his penchant for all things eco-friendly, part of the visit to Eastbrook involved a talk about sustainable farming from researchers at the Soil Association and the Organic Research Lab. Both organisations were also involved in creating the programme for the Prince of Wales' summer farm school, which aims to give farmers, food producers and civil servants a grounding in sustainable agriculture. Afterwards, Charles stopped to chat with students, casually juggling a cup of tea and a shepherd's crook as he did so. The visit was the latest in a series of food related engagements this week, with the annual tour of Cornwall, which kicked off on Monday, heavily focused on all things agricultural. During the three day tour, which ended with a visit to Newquay yesterday, the prince met TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, another man with a passion for all things organic, and chefs from Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant.

"By . Ruth Styles . The teenage years are rarely easy for anyone but Kelly Smith, now 22, from Bristol, had a particularly difficult time. But it wasn't because of bad boyfriends or bullying classmates: Instead, aged 17, doctors broke the devastating news that she had been born with an unusually shallow vagina and no womb, and as a result, and would never be able to bear children of her own. 'The worst thing about the condition is . how alone it can make you feel,' says Kelly, who is one of a small . number of people to have Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. Scroll down for video . Brave: Kelly Smith, 22, was born without a vagina or womb and will never be able to have children . 'It’s very isolating and you feel like a . freak, especially when not even doctors are aware of it. It’s a lot to . take in, especially at the age of 17 when you are full of hormones as it . is.' The syndrome, which affects one in 5000 people, usually results in a missing uterus in female sufferers. Difficult to detect, it wasn't until Kelly was 16 and still hadn't begun her period that doctors realised that something might be wrong. 'I had always suffered from a lot of medical issues,' she explains. 'I had one leg shorter than the other and I still hasn't started my period at the age of 16. 'Most doctors just said to leave it and that [the lack of periods] was probably down to my other medical issues. So we left it until I was 17 and then we went back.' Raising awareness: Kelly appears on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies to discuss her condition . Difficult: Kelly says having the condition has severely affected her chances of having a normal relationship . Impossible: Because of her condition, Kelly will never be able to bear children except via a surrogate . It took an ultrasound and a visit to a specialist consultant in Bath before the diagnosis was confirmed. Kelly was devastated. 'It was very difficult to come to terms with,' she remembers. 'It is a relatively unknown condition and not many doctors have even heard of it. 'I was lucky in that I had a lovely nurse who put no pressure on me and was really supportive. Other than her there is very little support out there other than perhaps the odd Yahoo group. It’s a very isolating condition.' Making matters worse was the impact it had on her intimate relationships, in particular with men, with an embarrassed Kelly reluctant to reveal what was really wrong with her. 'It has really affected my relationships,' she says. 'I put a barrier up around myself. My friends at school would start to . get into relationships and would be talking about having sex and I would . just nod along. 'I did have a . relationship that went really well when I was 19.

'In the end I . ended it because I didn’t feel like it was fair on him, I couldn’t deny a . 22 year old man the chance to have sex and it got to the point when I just . shut myself down.' But Kelly, who appears on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies, has begun to come to terms with the condition and is currently having treatment to enlarge her vagina and make sexual relationships possible. The treatment, called dilator therapy, involves gradually stretching the vagina over six months to a year and Kelly says she is thrilled with how things are going. 'I started doing the therapy in October . last year up until about Christmas and it was really good. But then it . was a busy Christmas and I fell off the wagon,' she reveals. 'It is really effective . and it’s fantastic that it requires no surgery but it is quite time . consuming, and clinical.' Although the treatment cannot replace her missing uterus, women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome do have functioning ovaries and as a result can have biological children using a surrogate and IVF. Not that Kelly is thinking about children just yet. 'Right now I am only 22 so I’m not really . thinking about kids,' she says. 'I have a friend with the condition who’s 31 and it . is really playing on her mind. Right now for me, I’m more concerned . about having a normal relationship - I just tackle each problem as it comes.' Kelly appears on Embarrassing Bodies, tonight at 9pm on Channel 4.

It was a meeting of minds as TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall gave the famously green Prince Charles a tour of River Cottage HQ in the Devonshire town of Axminster today. During the visit, the heir to the throne was shown how to forage for food before being given a guided tour of Fearnley-Whittingstall's vegetable patch - much to Charles' delight. Scroll down for video . Meeting of minds: Prince Charles beams as he chats to TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall at River Cottage . Joining the pair was Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who was on stylish form in a cream crêpe de Chine shirt dress enlivened with a diamond brooch and her trademark pearl studs. She too appeared to enjoy meeting Fearnley-Whittingstall and at one point, was seen bursting into laughter as they chatted. The royal couple were at River Cottage on day two of their annual tour of Devon and Cornwall to hear more about one of Fearnley-Whittingstall's eco-friendly schemes - Landshare. While making his TV series River Cottage Spring which aired in 2008, the chef helped a group of Bristol families start a smallholding on derelict . council land.

Although Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's successful Fish Fight campaign is over, other issues remain. Most pressing is that of fish stocks, with seabass, razor clams and halibut among the species with perilously low numbers. Other types, among them pollock, mackerel and anchovies, are fine to eat - for now. Fishing methods have also come under increased scrutiny, with purse seine nets blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins. Fearnley-Whittingstall has now added his name to the list of advocates for low impact line fishing as well as marine conservation zones. For more information, see the Marine Conservation Society website. So inspiring did the experience prove, he decided to see if it . would work nationwide, and Landshare, which now includes more than 50,000 people, was created to bring keen growers . and landowners together. The Prince of Wales, who has long championed the merits of smallholding, and Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall share yet more common ground when it comes to farming. A keen supporter of all things organic, the prince has an eco-friendly farm at Highgrove in Gloucestershire, while Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage smallholding - which includes vegetables, pigs and hens - is run along green lines. Both men also share a passion for fishing, with Prince Charles supporting charities such as The Fishermen's Mission and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's own Fish Fight campaign. The latter, heavily promoted on TV and backed by environmental charities, was aimed at ending the wasteful practice of discarding perfectly good fish as a result of EU quotas and encouraging supermarkets and other retailers to switch to sustainably sourced seafood. Although the EU has now introduced rules that outlaw discards, other problems such as the use of dolphin killing purse seine fishing nets and plummeting fish stocks remain.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana threatened to pull millions of pounds in advertising from publisher Condé Nast over a story Vanity Fair was planning to run on their tax fraud conviction, it was claimed today. The Italian duo were reportedly so angry they allegedly rang Condé Nast artistic director and Vogue editor Anna Wintour to get her to kill the feature. Advertising revenue from Dolce and Gabbana is thought to be worth an estimated $10 million to $20 million to Condé Nast's titles, which also include Allure, Details, Condé Nast Traveler and GQ. 'Angry': Designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana (left) allegedly rang Conde Nast artistic director Anna Wintour (right) to get her to kill an upcoming story reportedly focusing on their tax fraud conviction in Italy . The Vanity Fair feature will focus on the duo's legal battle in Italy in which they were each given 18-month jail sentences for tax evasion, a source told Page Six. It is believed Wintour refused their demand. However, Page Six notes the editor-in-chief did fly to the Italian island of Capri last month to give exclusive coverage of D&G’s Alta Moda show. Sources claim she went with the aim of 'appeasing' the designers, adding: 'She went to save . the advertising.' A spokesman for Vanity Fair said: 'We don’t comment on whether we are or are not working on a story.'  Vogue declined to comment. Claims: Dolce and Gabbana (pictured at a fashion show in 2007) reportedly threatened to pull millions of pounds in advertising from Conde Nast titles over the story . A spokesman for Dolce & Gabbana refused to comment. Dolce and Gabbana have each been given 18-month suspended jail terms for tax evasion despite the prosecution arguing for the pair to be acquitted. In May, Italy's appeals court upheld a verdict issued in June last year against the pair on charges of using Luxembourg holding company Gado to avoid paying taxes on royalties of about 1billion euros (£820million). The pair had their sentences reduced from 20 months because of statute of limitations applied to certain facts in the case. A fine of up to 10 million euros was also imposed over avoidance of the payments in Italy, where corporate taxes are among the highest in Europe. Big business: The August edition of Vanity Fair (left). Advertising revenue from Dolce and Gabbana is thought to be worth an estimated $10 million to $20 million to Condé Nast's titles, which also includes Vogue (right) The designers - who have always denied any wrongdoing - are appealing the decision. The case stems from an investigation that began in 2008 when Italian tax authorities stepped up their fight against tax evasion as a global financial crisis began to bite. Fashion companies have fallen under the scrutiny of Italy's tax authorities partly due to the fact the sector has performed well during the country's longest recession since World War Two. Giorgio Armani paid 270 million euros to tax authorities in early April to settle a dispute over payments from the group's subsidiaries abroad. Prada Holding, which controls Prada, paid a reported 400-420 million euros to settle taxes in Italy after completing a process of voluntary disclosure in December.","Italian duo 'angry about an upcoming feature on their tax fraud conviction'

"By . Simon Tomlinson . With a degree in communications from one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the irony wasn't lost on Alex Harris. While packing up his belongings during a house move, his wife noticed a rather unfortunate spelling mistake on his graduation certificate that had been hanging proudly on his wall for years. Instead of the first vowel in the word 'communications' being an 'O', the document instead had a 'U' so that it read 'cummunications'. Could have done with a spell checker: Alex Harris's diploma certificate for his degree in 'communications' from the University of California which actually reads 'cummunications' because of a rather embarrassing typo . Shocked: Mr Harris said his wife noticed the error when she was packing up their belongings while moving house after the certificate had been hanging on the wall for years . Mr Harris earned his mass communications diploma in 2008 from the University of California in Berkeley, which counts Nobel Peace Prize winners among its alumni, so he was completely taken aback by the error. Speaking of the moment it was spotted, he told KLTV: 'I just heard this big laugh from the other room. 'She (his wife) actually noticed that there was this typo. 'When I saw it, it was just shock. You know, I looked at the keyboard and ""O"" and ""U"" are not next to each other.' Prestigious: University of California in Berkeley counts Nobel Peace Prize winners among its alumni . His story went viral after he uploaded a picture of his diploma to Reddit. Mr Harris said the university had plenty of opportunities to ensure the certificate was correct after he had been forced to send two earlier copies back because they were wrinkled. He admits that he thought the third one 'looked great' and hung it in his home for years not noticing the mistake. But he says won't be in a rush to send this one back because it has become so famous. 'There's no way I'm giving this up,' he said.","Alex Harris's wife spotted error while packing up during a house move .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . The Queen's cousin is calling for new laws forcing supermarkets to sell only food after blaming the closure of his 174-year-old hardware store on the opening of an Asda. The Earl of Strathmore - whose family seat is Glamis Castle, the birthplace of the Queen Mother - said he was 'deeply saddened' that his ironmongery shop was to shut later this month. He said Angus council bears 'much of the blame' for the closure for allowing the construction of an Asda supermarket nearby, along with other discount retailers in the town. The Earl bought the shop David Irons & Sons in Forfar, Angus, in 2005 from Marshall and Michael Irons, whose great-grandfather, George, established the business in 1840. 'Killed off by Asda': Earl of Strathmore holds a fork handle and four candles (a reference to the Two Ronnies sketch) outside his ironmongers shop in Forfar which is closing down due to competition from supermarkets . The Earl's third wife, Karen Baxter, whom he married in 2012, was the manager of the store. In a statement, he said: 'An array of factors have built up against us in the past eight years. 'Firstly, the inextricable rise of the internet, which I can only see going one way and that is ever upwards. 'Secondly, over the past 18 months, we have had severe staffing issues within the shop. 'Thirdly, I’m afraid much of the blame must be laid at the council’s doorstep, with the arrival of Asda and three large discount stores within the small town of Forfar. 'With the cost of renovations carried out due to fire regulations and increasing overheads, plus all the above factors taken into consideration, it is quite impossible to continue trading.' He later told the Daily Telegraph: . 'Every supermarket that arrives selling all sorts of things is bound to . make an impact on local independents. 'In . my humble view, supermarkets should be for selling food and nothing . else. They are just killing off the centre of these old towns.' Historic: Prince Charles (centre) pays a visit to  David Irons & Sons in 2012. The Earl of Strathmore said Angus council bears 'much of the blame' for the closure for allowing an Asda supermarket to be built nearby . After buying the business, the Earl said he wanted to keep the distinct charm of ironmongery, characterised famously in 'Four Candles' comedy sketch by the Two Ronnies. Now he is saddened that the store’s remarkable run must come to an end. He added: 'I realise that Forfar will lose one of its iconic retail shops and my wife and I are deeply saddened having come to this decision.' The Earl, who is one of Scotland’s richest landowners, married the current Countess of Strathmore after acquiring David Irons & Sons, where she worked. The couple married in a low-key ceremony at his historic £12million seat - the childhood home of the late Queen Mother - watched by close family and friends. The shop, which has a provisional closing date of June 27, sells a wide range of goods, from hardware and household electrical items to tableware and decorative items. It passed on through five generations of the Irons family before it was sold to the Earl of Strathmore. George Irons formed a partnership with his cousin to open the ironmongers business in 1840, but the partnership dissolved after 10 years and the shop was carried on by George until his death in 1872. His son, David Irons Sr continued the business before passing it on to his sons William and David Irons Jr. Critical: The Earl said the arrival of supermarkets like Asda (Forfar store not pictured) 'is bound to make an impact on local independents' Upon the death of David Irons Jr, the business passed to his son William and then to his sons Michael and Marshall. The store still has a water-operated lift, installed in 1908, which is still in working order today. Forfar councillor Colin Brown said he was 'shocked' to hear the news of the historic retailer’s closure.He said: 'I’ve used the shop for probably 50 years. 'Irons always had whatever you needed and I know farmers in the area used to rely on it heavily.'It’s a real shame it’s closing.' David Hutcheson, a committee member of the Tayside branch of business group Institute of Directors, said: 'It is a real shame that when a company with so much history ceases to trade. 'Shops like Irons provide goods you can’t get form the big companies. The problem is, with the growth of the internet, people who want to shop online will do it. 'Small shops have to find some way of adapting to the internet, or offering a personal service that people can’t get online.' Angus council declined to comment.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A paedophile who sexually abused a 14-year-old girl months before she killed herself has been jailed. Kevin Palmer was caught by a police officer engaging in sexual activity with Danielle Formosa in a tent. Palmer, who was 39 at the time, first met the teenager four months earlier and told her he was a 19-year-old law student. Danielle, who was in care at the time, arranged by text message to meet Palmer on June 29, 2013. Jailed: Kevin Palmer (left) sexually abused Danielle Formosa (right), 14, months before she killed herself . Robert Woodcock, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court how Danielle was a 'troubled young girl' who was extremely distressed and had been taken into foster care. Mr Woodcock said: 'They met in Sunderland and bought some cigarettes and a can of pop. 'She noticed he had a rucksack with him and that contained a tent. They went to the park, he put up the tent and they listened to music off his phone. 'When they were in the tent, an officer checked up on them and they both gave false names. 'As he walked away, he heard Danielle refer to the male inside as ""Kev"", a different name to the one given to the officer.' Another officer later arrived and told them to come out of the tent before asking for their name and age. When Danielle gave her name and age to police, Palmer quickly packed up his tent and ran from the scene. He was later arrested at his home address and interviewed in a the presence of a solicitor. In December 2013, Danielle was found dead at East Farmhouse home in County Durham, aged 14. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. Danielle attended St Anthony's Catholic Girl's Academy in Sunderland (pictured) Danielle, who went to St Anthony’s Catholic Girl’s Academy in Sunderland, was a Facebook friend of 14-year-old Sarah Clerkson who was found hanging at a house party in Spennymoor, County Durham, two weeks earlier. Palmer, now 40, was originally accused of raping the schoolgirl and appeared at Newcastle Crown Court for trial. Prosecutors made a special application for Danielle's video statement to be played to jurors. Palmer's defence team objected on the basis he could not have a fair trial if the footage was allowed . to be used as evidence. After hearing legal argument from both sides, Judge Penny Moreland ruled Danielle's video statement should be heard in court. But before a jury was sworn to hear the case, Palmer pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity in the presence of Danielle and causing or inciting her to engage in sexual activity. Nick Peacock, mitigating, said: 'This young lady obviously had troubles. 'Someone . who goes to prison for an offence like this is treated differently by . other prisoners then a normal prisoner. It is causing him a great deal . of concern. 'When I spoke to him, he does show genuine remorse. He is upset about these offences and the death of Danielle. 'He has had a difficult life. He has himself witnessed domestic violence from his mother and father. 'He has been in and out of care. It had a devastating effect on him and it is something he has never really got over.' Judge Penny Moreland told Palmer: 'In my view, what you did was groom her for sexual activity by persisting in seeing her. taking a tent. 'She has since these offences taken her own life. You can’t be taken into account for that. 'I have no doubt what you did caused distress and upset. I am not satisfied you show remorse for what you did, I find no evidence of this. 'I accept you have had your own difficulties and your own life has not been straight forward, but that is no excuse for these offences.' Judge Moreland sentenced Palmer, from Sunderland, to four-and-a-half years in prison. He will also appear on the sex offences register for life and will be banned indefinitely from having contact with children under 16 without the presence of social services.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Lucy Crossley . Banned: Gosport mayor Wayne Ronayne and his partner Paula Carter have been banned from the town's pubs following alcohol-fuelled celebrations just hours after they were sworn in to their new roles . A new mayor and mayoress have been barred from all the pubs in their town following alcohol-fuelled celebrations just hours after they were sworn in to their new roles. Tory councillor Wayne Ronayne and partner Paula Carter were ordered out of one pub and barred entry to a second in Gosport, Hampshire. Ms Carter, 54, is alleged to have shouted ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ and threatened to use her new powers to shut down the first pub as she was escorted out. Both pubs complained and Mayor Ronayne, 54, has now been given a six-month ban by the town's Pub Watch from 36 establishments in Gosport. Ms Carter has been barred for 12 months. Police were called to the Wetherspoons Star pub in Gosport just hours after the couple had been sworn in to their new prestigious public roles. It is thought an argument broke out when staff asked the boozy party to leave. As they were being removed Ms Carter allegedly threatened to get the pub closed down. The group left and tried to enter the nearby Nelson's Bar but were refused and the mayoress reportedly made a similar threat to bouncers - and even asked 'do you know who I am?' Stephen Brown, duty manager at Nelson's, said: 'She said to me ""do you know who I am?"". 'I said ""no, I don't"" and she said ""I'm the mayoress of Gosport I can have you closed down"". 'I politely said she still wouldn’t be coming in, she was clearly drunk and then continued to be rude and had to be dragged away by one of the other members.' Nelson's owner, Arthur Caraccio, has released CCTV footage of Ms Carter arguing with staff and doormen. He . said: 'We’ve just spent a lot of money making this place nice, and I’m . not having anyone come and threaten my business, especially not some . jumped-up Mayor’s wife. 'It’s the sort of behaviour we wouldn’t tolerate from anybody, let alone public servants. 'They’re meant to hold themselves up as a standard for the type of behaviour they want to see. 'If the Mayor of Gosport is a drunk, that says a lot about the town.' Drinker Richard Horn, 34, saw police arrive and ask the group to leave. He said: 'Gosport’s got a bad enough reputation through historical things without this making it even worse.' Gosport Pub Watch are now going to speak to the borough council about the shocking incident. Chairman Phil Cox said: 'Everybody is treated the same. 'People need to be treating licensees and staff with respect. Scene: The group were refused entry to the nearby Nelson's Bar, when the mayoress reportedly asked 'do you know who I am?' 'But we don’t expect the mayor of Gosport, who represents our town, to be involved in incidents like this.' Mayor Ronayne has branded the claims 'absolute nonsense', and said he was not aware that any ban had been put in place. He did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment today, but said at the weekend: 'I’m not aware of that at this point of time. 'I’m unaware of anything that happened.' Gosport's Lib-Dem leader Cllr Peter Chegwyn said: 'It’s unbelievable. He should resign as mayor and from the council.' Tory leader Cllr Mark Hook said Pub Watch had acted as 'judge and jury' but believes the mayor and mayoress need 'to do a lot of soul searching' over their future. Gosport Borough Council has declined to comment on the allegations. Former serviceman Mayor Ronayne worked in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) of the Royal Navy for 34 years before being elected to local council in May 2010 and becoming deputy mayor last year. In the May 22 election, he narrowly retained his seat in the Christchurch Ward, by just 16 votes. 'We’ve just spent a lot of money making this place nice, and I’m . not having anyone come and threaten my business, especially not some . jumped-up Mayor’s wife' Pub owner Arthur Caraccio . Mayor Ronayne bills himself as a 'family man' with three sons on the Gosport Conservatives website, and reveals he has a Masters in Leadership and Management. He adds: 'My main field of expertise is the development, leadership and management of ""people"". 'This being gained from my long experience of maintaining and improving the morale and effectiveness of naval personnel. 'My current mission is to fully utilise the superb training and experience I gained as a servicemen to improve and maintain the quality of life for the people of Gosport in all areas of the community.' The Mayor of Gosport website, Mayor Ronayne’s personal Facebook page and his partner’s Facebook accounts have been taken down following the incident. Locals took to social media to blast the Mayor and his partner for 'dragging down' Gosport, after last Wednesday’s behaviour. In a post on the Star's Facebook page Mr Horn said: 'It’s so disappointing to see people who represent Gosport, who should be setting an example, drag it down.' He added: 'Everyone desires to let they hair down and relax - I agree, but people should not be abusive to staff who are just doing a job. 'People in public office, or in the public eye, need to have a private life too - I agree, but when you mention who you are and your title then you are back “on duty” and in this case representing the Mayor of Gosport’s office. 'I sincerely hope that the actions of these representatives of Gosport Borough Council do not take away from the hard work that a lot of local civil servants do. 'I’m sure JD Wetherspoons will back they staff 100 per cent and congratulate them for having to deal with this incident in the professional way they did.' Jason Searle wrote: 'Need him gone for sure!' Brian Grimmet added: 'After the disgraceful behaviour of the Mayor and Mayoress. 'These people are not fit to hold office.'","Wayne Ronayne given six-month ban by Pub Watch from 36 pubs in Gosport .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A former Playboy model has reportedly been accused of embezzlement by a jailed fraudster. Brande Roderick, a former Playmate of the Year and Baywatch actress, and her husband Glenn Cadrez are facing allegations from Michael Prozer III. Prozer, who was jailed for eight years in 2012 for fraud, claims the couple asked him to invest £150,000 in their company Financially Hung, a networking group for business people seeking exclusive parties. But he claims the pair instead deposited the cash in their personal accounts and never used it for the business, it was reported by TMZ. Allegation: Former Playmate of the Year Brande Roderick (pictured, left, with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner in 2001 and, right, in 2009) has been accused by a jailed fraudster of embezzling £150,000 of his money . Star of the small screen: Roderick starred as Leigh Dyer in Baywatch in 2000 . Roderick has not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline. Prozer was jailed for eight years in August 2012 after pleading guilty to multiple counts of bank fraud totalling $3million. He once lied his way onto the TV show Millionaire Matchmaker, a dating show for wealthy people, by claiming he owned the South American PayPal, was worth $400 million, flew by private jet and lived in a mansion on Davis Island in Tampa. However, it was all a facade created using wire, bank and mail fraud on a multi-million dollar scale, leading to the 38-year-old using his appearance on the Bravo show to convince those he robbed that he was in fact a genuine millionaire. Accuser: Michael Prozer once claimed to be worth $400 million and that he owned a private jet. In reality, he was a conman who had fraudulently scammed $3 million from a bank . Fraudster: Prozer appeared on the Bravo television show Millionaire Matchmaker. He is pictured here with his date, Elana, which ended in failure. He claimed on the show that he was worth $400million . During his appearance on the show, Prozer, who is father to two young boys, told the audience that he was the multi-millionaire CEO of Xchange Agent Inc, an online payment service for people in South America. Viewers saw his 33,000 square-foot home set on 26 acres and discovered that despite all his apparent wealth he could not find a wife to share it with. His appearance on the show was not successful after Prozer upset his date Elana by showing off on a jet ski. However, a federal indictment in April of 2010 exposed the fact that Pozer took a loan from the Park Avenue Bank based on fake, non-existent collateral after asking a man named Fedor Salinas, a Wachovia Bank employee, to falsify documents verifying the existence of these funds. His set to be released from prison in 2019.","Ex-Baywatch actress facing allegations from Michael Anthony Prozer III .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Former Chancellor Lord Lawson has dismissed David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels - and suggested he may have to call for the UK to leave. The Conservative peer warned that the Prime Minister would have to consult – and ‘persuade overwhelmingly’ - Tory MPs before deciding whether to recommend an In or an Out vote in a future EU referendum . He added that the ‘logic’ of the PM’s position was that if he can’t get ‘major changes’ in the EU, the UK will have to leave. Lord Lawson also predicted that Mr Cameron would get ‘nothing of any significance’ from the EU. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said David Cameron would not be able to win back anything substantial from Brussels and may have to recommend withdrawing from the EU . The comments, in an interview to The House magazine, come after the new EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker dismissed the notion of restricting Eastern European immigration to the UK. The former Luxembourg leader said 'freedom of movement' within the EU was not up for negotiation. Mr Juncker, the nominee to be the next European Commission president, met MEPs from Nigel Farage's eurosceptic group in the European Parliament ahead of his coronation next week. He was asked directly if he would support any restrictions on free movement of workers within the EU. According to UKIP MEPs at the meeting, he replied: 'No.' Mr Juncker also raised the prospect of 'harmonising' tax rates - which would be fiercely resisted in Westminster. In light of Mr Juncker's intervention, Lord Lawson's remarks will pile pressure on the Prime Minister to reveal what powers he wants to see returned to Westminster. Lord Lawson said he was 'convinced' that Mr Cameron would not be able to win anything back from Brussels of any worth. He said: 'I may be wrong, but from my knowledge of the European Union - that nothing of any significance is negotiable. 'Not least because anything of significance requires treaty changes and treaty changes have to be agreed unanimously so it’s no good just getting one or two countries onside, so I don’t think it’s on. But we shall see.' David Cameron has vowed to win back powers from Brussels before putting Britain's membership of the EU to an in-out referendum in 2017 . He was also asked what the PM should do if Tory MPs were unhappy with whatever deal he gets from Brussels ahead of any 2017 EU referendum. Lord Lawson said: 'I think he will take that into account.' The Tory peer added: 'Although as of now his position is that he’s firmly committed to recommending an ‘In’ vote - he’s a great optimist and he thinks he can negotiate all these changes - but I think he will have to reconsider his position in the light of what he is able to secure. 'He will know too that he has either got to persuade the Parliamentary party overwhelmingly (there will always be dissent)…or else he’s got to reconsider his own position on this issue. 'Because the logic of his position is clear. He has said the European Union as it exists at present is seriously unsatisfactory, therefore some major changes need to be made. 'The logic of that position is that if you don’t secure these major changes, you leave the European Union. Not in any hostile frame of mind. As you know I live in France and I have nothing against Europe as such. 'But you just have to say it is not in Britain’s interest to remain there. And of course it is made all the more likely by the creation of the eurozone and they are also changing the qualified majority voting rules. 'We will find ourselves outside the eurozone…our influence on European Union law is bound to be less than it has in the past. There will be a solid eurozone bloc vote. If we oppose anything we will be overridden.” Nigel Farage held talks on Wednesday with the proposed new head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker . Asked if he envisages the PM consulting the Parliamentary party on the In-Out decision in 2017, just as it appears the 1922 Committee will be consulted in 2015 in the event of any plans for another Coalition, he said: 'I think you’re right to draw parallels between the two. I think he will. Whether he does it through formal consultation or informally, I think he will need to do that.' Lord Lawson also said it would be ‘excellent’ for the Tories if Boris Johnson was to return to Parliament and called on the Tories to form a minority government if there is a hung Parliament .","Conservative peer says Brussels will not allow substantial return of powers .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A team of police disaster specialists will be sent to Ukraine to bring back the nine tragic Britons killed in the Ukrainian air disaster, Downing Street announced today. The Scotland Yard experts will join a Dutch-led emergency team after a request from the country's prime minister Mark Rutte. A separate team of air-accident investigators have been put on standby to help an international investigation into what caused the crash. Both operations depend on the pro-Russian separatists granting international access to the crash site. 'That’s why we are pushing so hard internationally to make sure that there is the access,' Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said today. Britain is pushing for a UN resolution granting access to international investigators to discover what happened . The plane came down in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists around the city of Donetsk . Number 10 this morning said getting to the site of the disaster was the Government's first priority. The UK has called an emergency session of the UN Security Council  to get international agreement for access. Moscow and the Russian rebels have both said they will back an investigation, but Downing Street said they needed to back up their words. A spokesman for Mr Cameron said: 'President Putin has said on this there should be an investigation. 'That is why we said very clearly that people should do all they can to enable that to happen - not just words.' At least nine Britons are believed to be among 298 passengers and crew who were on board the plane, which was apparently shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Mr Cameron chaired an emergency meeting of the Governent's crisis committee Cobra this morning to agree how to respond to the crash. A team of Scotland Yard specialists has been put on standby to help recover the bodies of the nine Britons killed in yesterday's crash . He was joined by the new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and new Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The Prime Minister's national security advisor Sir Kim Darroch and representatives from the secret services also attended. Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said this morning’s emergency meeting focused on the need for a 'swift and independent investigation' into the causes and securing access to the crash site for international experts. Mr Cameron spoke with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte, the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, and sent messages of condolence to Malaysian PM Najib Razak. The Prime Minister's spokeswoman said: 'Clearly it will be the Ukrainian government that are in the lead on this. We are keen to work with them closely and we think there needs to be an independent international investigation. 'So that would look to the role of people like ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or looking into Air Accidents Investigation Branch. 'The point I would make is that the crash site is in a separatist-held area and therefore part of the work we are doing is talking closely to the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe], who are clearly the ones that have the monitoring mission in the broader region, about how we can work together and access [the site]. 'And it is also why we are pushing for a clear statement at the UN on the need for access.' Mr Cameron's spokeswoman added: 'The focus was on the huge tragedy that this is for the Netherlands, the need to have an independent investigation. 'It is true that this crash has taken place in the context of a wider crisis in Ukraine and one element of that [is] we have been sending a very clear message to the Russians, along with our European partners and the US, for several weeks now about the need for them to exert their influence on Russian separatists and stop the flow of weapons across the border. Will we keep reiterating that message in the days ahead? Yes.'","Prime Minister orders specialist Metropolitan police team to Ukraine .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Tory peer Lord Patten has become a spin doctor for the Pope - just two months after stepping down from the BBC for health reasons. The former Cabinet minister will advise the leader of the world's Catholics how to use the internet to get his message across - including sites like Twitter and Facebook. Lord Patten said the part-time role was 'important and challenging' - despite leaving the BBC in the lurch in May after having major heart surgery. Pope Francis wants to reach a younger audience around the world and has brought Tory peer Lord Patten in to the Vatican to be a media advisor . The 69-year-old was admitted to hospital with serious chest pains and underwent a successful bypass operation that saved his heart from major damage. At the time, Lord Patten said he had to stand 'on the advice of my doctors'. He said: 'I have concluded that I cannot continue to work at the same full pace as I have done to date, and that I should reduce the range of roles I undertake.' Lord Patten will now chair a Papal committee over the next year which is expected to report in the summer of 2015. He said the post was unpaid. Their goal is to re-vamp the Holy See's online presence and communications strategy in an effort to reach a wider and younger audience. Former BBC Trust chair Lord Patten will help the Pope's spin chief . The Vatican already has a number of websites and Twitter accounts, including that of Pope Francis (@pontifex) in nine different languages. The Pope also has six separate communications departments, including a press and internet office and a communications council. It also has a newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, and a radio station, Vatican Radio, which broadcasts in 40 languages. The appointment is the latest high profile move by Pope Francis to shake-up the Vatican since he was elected to succeed Pope Benedict last year. The Argentinian pope has vowed to overhaul the Vatican's tarnished institutions after decades of corruption and scandal. Lord Pattern said: 'This is an important and challenging part-time assignment over the next year. I’m looking forward to beginning work in late September.' The Oxford university chancellor, a leading British Catholic, is said to be easing himself back into work and will hold his first Vatican meeting this autumn. According to the Financial Times, Lord Patten has said the committee wants to develop a 'digital strategy' and ways for the church to speak to those already committed Catholics. Lord Patten also wants to expand the range of Vatican’s range of media outlets, which include a newspaper, television and radio station. During his time at the BBC, he was criticised for the number of positions he held including serving as Chancellor of Oxford University and Co-Chair of the UK-India Round Table.","Former Cabinet minister will advise the Vatican on how to use the internet .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Mahatma Gandhi, pictured in 1940, was the leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India. He used the tactic of nonviolent civil disobedience to win independence . A statue of Indian independence hero Mahatma Gandhi will be erected outside Parliament, George Osborne has announced today. The Chancellor,  in New Delhi with Foreign Secretary William Hague, said it would be a fitting tribute to the 'father of democratic India'. But the decision to honour the 20th Century's most famous pacifist came just 24 hours after the Government announced a £250million arms deal with India. Mr Osborne confirmed a deal to provide air-to-air missiles for the Indian Air Force in a joint venture between BAE Systems, the Franco-German group Airbus and Finmeccanica of Italy. The two Cabinet ministers are also promoting the sale of the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, which is partly built in Britain. India is looking to buy 126 fighter jets and had identified the French Rafale as its preferred choice. Yet repeated delays on signing the deal have left Britain hopeful that India may yet opt to buy the Typhoon. Tushar Gandhi, a social activist and the great-grandson of the independence leader, said it was ironic the ministers had announced plans for the statue during a visit partly taken up with promoting weapons sales. He said: 'It’s a nice way to apply a soothing balm to their consciences, to raise a statute. How can anybody say they approve of this?' But Mr Osborne wrote on Twitter: 'Gandhi was father of democratic India. Can announce we'll honour his memory with statue in front of mother of parliaments in Parliament Sq.' The statue will stand alongside monuments to other statesmen including Nelson Mandela, Sir Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln in the square. The Government hopes the statue will be erected next year, funded by charitable donations and sponsors, with leading sculptor Philip Jackson approached to take on the project. Mr Hague said: 'Gandhi's view of communal peace and resistance to division, his desire to drive India forward and his commitment to non-violence left a legacy that is as relevant today as it was during his life. 'He remains a towering inspiration and a source of strength. We will honour him with a statue alongside those of other great leaders in Parliament Square.' Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who is leading a special advisory group to support the project, said: 'My parents were born in British India with first-hand experience of partition. The effect it had on millions of people contributed to my decision to take up public service. 'Celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's reverence and greatness, a man who fought equally for everyone, in the form of a statue in Parliament Square is a fitting tribute. No matter what your background, history or religion, this statue will allow people from around the world to look upon him and appreciate his endeavour and successes for humanity.' The Chancellor and Foreign Secretary are in India meeting key players in the administration in New Delhi - including recently elected prime minister Narendra Modi - as well as leading business figures. They are following in the footsteps of a series of foreign visitors - including the French foreign minister and the Russian deputy prime minister - who have arrived to pay court to the new premier since his landslide victory in May. Parliament Square in London is home to a number of statues of politicians, including Sir Winston Churchill (above), US President Abraham Lincoln and former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George . Foreign Secretary William Hague and the Chancellor George Osborne, pictured in India yesterday, praised Gandhi as a 'towering inspiration' Mr Osborne said India was 'on an exciting journey of reform' under Mr Modi's new government. 'I believe there to be no more reliable companion on that journey than the UK,' he said. Speaking in Mumbai yesterday, he said: 'To adopt a phrase from Prime Minister Modi: good days are coming for the India-Britain relationship. 'Good days are coming for the investment we make in each other's economies. 'Good days are coming for the trade between our two trading nations. 'Good days are coming for the financial partnership we can forge to build, literally, the infrastructure of the future."" He set out ambitions for London to play a leading role as a gateway for Indian firms to access global capital markets.","Statue of Gandhi a 'fitting tribute to democratic India' says Osborne .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Mocking short people is as bad as racism, the Commons' Speaker John Bercow has suggested. Mr Bercow, who stands just 5ft 6in tall, said it was 'somehow acceptable' to criticise people over their height when attacking someone for their skin colour or sexuality was widely accepted as being wrong. The Speaker has been widely ridiculed in the Commons over his height - with both Tory backbenchers and even the Prime Minister poking fun at his stature. Commons Speaker John Bercow  - pictured with his wife Sally - has criticised the public acceptance of mocking short people. But he said he was 'never bothered' by people ridiculing his height . In 2010 the Conservatve MP Simon Burns referred to the Speaker as as a 'stupid, sanctimonious dwarf'. He later apologised to all dwarves for his comments. David Cameron also joked that Mr Bercow was one of the seven dwarfs at a lunch with journalists in Westminster. Now Mr Bercow, who is only three inches shorter than the UK 5ft 9in average height in Britain, has attacked society’s acceptance of derogatory remarks relating to people’s height. Speaking to The Times Magazine, Mr Bercow said: ‘Whereas nobody these days would regard it as acceptable to criticise someone on grounds of race or creed or disability or sexual orientation, somehow it seems to be acceptable to comment on someone’s height, or lack of it.’ Sally Bercow, who caused controversy after posing in just a bed sheet in front of Parliament, said her husband's job had made him more sexy . Mr Bercow claimed the issue doesn’t affect him personally, however he described rude comments about height ‘intellectually substandard and schoolboyish’. Mr Bercow, 51, said he was 'never bothered about being short'. In the same interview, Mr Bercow rejected claims from his wife Sally - who stands at 5ft 10in - that his powerful Commons' had made him more attractive. He said: 'I have most certainly not become a sex symbol. She [his wife] does have a very good sense of humour.' In 2011 Mrs Bercow sent ripples around Westminster when she appeared in a newspaper wearing nothing but a bedsheet. She also spoke at the time of the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster. Mr Bercow said the couple are not fazed by scrutiny of their marriage, which has made headlines on a number of occasions. 'Sally and I have our own approach to marriage and we are perfectly comfortable in our own skin,' he said. 'And, in the politest possible way, I think I would say: if other people disapprove of it or think it should be otherwise, that’s their problem, not ours.'","Bercow said jokes about his height had 'never bothered' him personally .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Margaret Thatcher is to blame for the growing popularity of UKIP, Tory Cabinet minister Eric Pickles has claimed. The Local Government Secretary said the former Tory Prime Minister was 'such a phenomenal leader' that today's leaders are just 'shades of monotone'. He said Nigel Farage's party were just 'a mirror image' the the main political parties - and should not be treated as radical outsiders. Nigel Farage has benefited from today's politicians all having to accept Thatcher's legacy, claims Eric Pickles . Mr Pickles' comments are likely to cause anger in Number 10 over the suggestion that Mr Cameron does not have the pulling power of the late Lady Thatcher. The Communities Secretary was asked in an interview with Total Politics magazine about the rise of UKIP. He said: 'In many ways it's Mrs Thatcher's fault. She was such a phenomenal leader. She affected not just the Conservative Party but the Labour Party and the Lib Dems. She brought the middle ground to the right. 'What's the difference between what Blair was trying to do and the difference between Major and Blair? It becomes shades of monotone. He added that the way to tackle UKIP was to 'connect with the man on the street'. Mr Pickles said: 'It's always tempting for a political party to say ""well, if we just do this, if we just have this policy, if we just make this pledge, it will shoot their fox"". No. 'You've got to see these things in context. I don't doubt the next election is really a choice between 'do you want to see David Cameron or Ed Miliband through the door of Number 10'. 'I think people will make that decision, but it isn't enough for us to do that. The reason why UKIP has done well is something that we need to understand about the way we connect.' Mr Pickles added: 'They're kind of a mirror image of us. I don't believe that UKIP is different from any other political party. 'It will have some very nice people within it; it will have some less nice people within it. I've always been of the view that there isn't a silver bullet about UKIP. 'It's not about Europe and it's not about immigration. It's about us. It's about the political system. And it's a rage against the machine. 'The only way you can beat UKIP is be good councillors, be good MPs, connect with the population, the man on the street, talk to folks and do all of the types of things you would do if you were fighting a Liberal.' Thatcherite cabinet minister Eric Pickles said Mrs Thatcher had been so 'phenomenal' that other leaders paled in comparison . But he suggested the party's rise could actually benefit the Tories. He said: 'I saw something on the doorstep this year which I hadn't seen before. I'm talking about Newark. 'It was, I think, in Bingham, in a sort of housing estate, a very traditional Labour voter, and they said they were going to vote Tory for the first time to keep UKIP out. 'That's very unusual. In all the years of fighting Liberals and the protest vote, I've never come across somebody who wanted to actually stop the protest vote. 'I thought that was really interesting. I haven't entirely got my mind round it but I think it offers us some possibilities.","Communities Secretary said she was so 'phenomenal' others can't compare .

"By . Lydia Warren For Mailonline . A 15-year-old boy posted a rap video online boasting about killing a 19-year-old man just two days after he gunned him down, authorities have claimed. After police saw the video, Tommy M. Canady was charged with first degree-intentional homicide in the death of Semar McClain, whose body was found in a backyard in Racine, Wisconsin on July 29. McClain, who was visiting from Minnesota to attend a friend's funeral, had been shot in the head and his pockets had been emptied, according to authorities, the Racine Journal Times reported. Two days later, Canady allegedly uploaded a rap song showing him singing: 'I'll kill a (expletive) real quick and snatch his gold.' Accused: Fifteen-year-old Tommy Canady, pictured left in his mug shot, is accused of murdering 19-year-old Semar McClain, right, and then posting a rap video online describing how he gunned him down . Other lyrics, according to CBS58, added: 'Get Semar slipping, walking through the alley, gangly a** tried to run like an athlete but bullets catch n*****, bullets run track meets, bullet hit the n***** head and he falls to his toes, he thinks he's the s*** now he getting exposed.' The song has since been removed from the website. McClain had been seen discussing trading guns with Canady near a stairwell in a building on July 29, and both men were holding guns as they left the area of Jackson Street on bikes. The older man was later found dead with a gun wound to his head in a backyard. Investigators found that his pockets had been pulled out, suggesting he had been robbed, and they did not find any money on the body. 'Caught': Canady, pictured, allegedly uploaded the rap to his SoundCloud page two days after the death . Arrest: Canady faces life in prison if he is found guilty of first-degree murder.

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . The last time the England team had an aura about them was at the World Cup in 2006. They were a bloody difficult team to beat. When that team stood in the tunnel, the opposition knew that they would be in for a game. There was a presence about Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney and captain David Beckham when they took to the field. Going home: England's players applaud their travelling supporters after drawing 0-0 with Costa Rica in their final World Cup group game . Bright future: England boss Roy Hodgson believes the country's young players can develop ahead of Euro 2016 . Final farewell: England's players were given a rousing reception by fans in the Estadio Mineirao . At the 2006 World Cup, the starting line up had 25 top level league titles between them and hundreds of Champions League appearances - Neville (6), Ferdinand (1), Terry (2), Cole (2), Beckham (6), Lampard (2) and Owen Hargreaves (4 Bundesliga titles). Michael Owen had never won a league title at the time, but he had been named European footballer of the year in 2001. That squad had unquestionable pedigree and a wealth of experience playing football at the very highest level. How England’s head coach Roy Hodgson could do with some of that. Take his full strength team for the 2-1 defeat against Uruguay and there are only 10 Premier League titles between them: Joe Hart (2), Glen Johnson (1), Wayne Rooney (5), Danny Welbeck (1) and Daniel Sturridge (1). It is evidence of some success, but Johnson, Welbeck and Sturridge were not influential members of their respective teams when they won the league. Sven-Goran Eriksson’s squad was different, with powerful names playing significant roles at Manchester United, Chelsea and Bayern Munich. They were serial winners with their club sides, putting domestic rivalries to one side when they pulled on the England shirt under Eriksson. They didn’t like losing. Solid: Ashley Cole, pictured here in action against Ecuador at the 2006 World Cup, was a key part of Sven-Goran Eriksson's defence . Unfortunate: Eriksson (right) and David Beckham (left) fell at the quarter-final stage in Germany eight years ago . Experienced: John Terry and Rio Ferdinand, pictured against Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup, gave England a solid foundation . Eventually they were beaten by Portugal in the quarter-final in Gelsenkirchen, knocked out of the tournament on penalties after playing for an hour with ten men. They were a stubborn bunch. England had already qualified from the group after opening victories against Paraguay and Trinidad & Tobago. They drew with Sweden and slipped past Ecuador before they went on to play Portugal. England could be beaten, like any other team could be beaten, but you would have to work hard for it. Eriksson’s team played tournament football, keeping their opponents in the group games in Germany at arm’s length as they made their way through to the last eight. It wasn’t particularly attractive or pretty to watch, but England were resilient and stubborn. They are pre-requisites at this level. What Hodgson would give for that after this dismal, depressing World Cup in Brazil. The top teams play on the fear factor, growing in stature and intimidating their opponents with this air of invincibility. On the spot: Owen Hargreves had won titles with Bayern Munich before anchoring England's midfield . All smiles: Beckham and Cole celebrate the midfielder's winning goal against Ecuador in the last 16 in 2006 . Turning point: Wayne Rooney's red card against Portugal in 2006 contributed towards England's exit on penalties in Gelsenkirchen . Spain fed off it for six years, twice winning the European championships and the World Cup while everyone attempted to catch up. They won a psychological war, too, convincing people that they had redefined the game and invented a new way of playing football with the principles of tiki-taka. Their opponents believed they hype. Spain created an aura and people got carried away with the idea that they had reinvented the wheel.What they really had was a highly-talented group of players who flourished under the stewardship of Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque. When they were together, they ticked. When Hodgson reflects on a World Cup that he admitted he ‘under-estimated’ before Tuesday’s final group game with Costa Rica, he must revert to a more pragmatic approach. England will sail through a qualification campaign that includes Estonia, Switzerland, Lithuania, San Marino and Slovenia to qualify for Euro 2016. It's over the next two years, in the slog around Europe, that Hodgson must carefully prepare for his third tournament in charge of the national team. Champions: Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas holds the World Cup trophy aloft after beating Holland in 2010 . Repeat performance: Spain continued their dominance by winning Euro 2012 in convincing fashion . Since some encouraging friendly results under Hodgson, with victories over Italy and Brazil (at Wembley), England’s results have been on the slide over the past year. The World Cup warning signs were there when they were beaten easily by Germany and Chile at Wembley in the build-up to the tournament. Draws with Ecuador and Honduras in Miami felt insignificant at the time, but few believed that this squad could make an impact at an international tournament. When you look at England’s defence, their most vulnerable area going into the tournament, they have little experience of playing Champions League football. Everton duo Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, who started both of England’s group games, have never played in the competition. Missing out: Everton defender Phil Jagielka (right) has never experienced Champions League football .

With the exception of Gary Cahill, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012, the rest of England’s defence has never gone deep into the competition. Glen Johnson made 15 appearances for Chelsea and three for Liverpool; Joe Hart has made 19 for Manchester City and Cahill also has the same number of appearances. To bring this team together in two years’ time and bind them together into a formidable attacking unit will take something special. The first step is to make England difficult to beat again at the very highest level. Once that has been established, Hodgson can start thinking about adding the finishing touches.","England only collected one point throughout this World Cup campaign .

"By . Julian Robinson . Adolf Hitler's birthplace is set to become an integration centre for immigrants while the Berlin bunker where he died has already become a booze shop . The birthplace of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler is to be turned into an integration centre for immigrants as it was revealed the bunker where he met his end has become a booze shop. Austrian officials keen to end a growing row over the future of the house where the infamous chancellor was born in the town of Braunau am Inn and are close to a deal with the owner to convert it for its proposed new use. The move comes after it emerged that the air raid bunker where he ended his life and where the Third Reich came to an end has been turned into a beer emporium. The City . Service Berlin booze store is just yards from the bunker where on April . 30, 1945, Hitler and his new bride Eva Braun ended their lives with . gunshots and cyanide thirty feet underground. Hitler spent the first three years of his life in what was then a local pub in Braunau am Inn during the 1890s. His parents rented rooms so that his father could carry out his job as a customs official at the nearby Austrian German border. The Hitlers left three years after Adolf's birth and in 1938 it was bought by the Fuhrer's private secretary Martin Bormann. After World War II, the building was rented by the Austrian Republic in 1952 and until 1965 it was the home of the public library and later a bank. The current row over the house started when the Mayor of Braunau Hannes Waidbacher from the conservative People's party (OeVP) said publicly that they didn't need another monument to the evils of war. He had added that the Fuhrer had 'only lived there for three years anyway'. The . mayor added that there was already a memorial stone outside the . building and said he felt that the local community had already done . enough to remember the past, and there was therefore no need to feel . pressurised to turn the property into something similar. Adolf Hitler's birth place in the northern Austrian city of Braunau am Inn could be turned into an integration centre for immigrants . In Berlin, a beer emporium has opened up close to the spot where Hitler died in a bunker in 1945. A plaque has been installed nearby informing passersby about the area's history . But after the international headlines that it generated the council partially backed down and said it had backed the idea of turning the house into a place where minorities would be helped to integrate which included language courses for children who were not native German speakers, and other community integration projects. The council confirmed that the humanitarian aid organisation Volkshilfe had been asked to take over managing the integration and language courses that will be offered to immigrants. After that a Russian MP said he was planning to put in a bid to buy the house so that 'every trace of fascism is wiped off the planet'. MP Franz Klinzevitsch from the ruling United Russia party said he had even started collecting the £1.7 million that he estimates he needs and is being supported in the project by the Russian Communist Party. But the house is not for sale, and the current owner who gets a monthly rental from the Interior Ministry had reportedly been difficult over exactly what use the property could be put to. But there is now optimism that the latest proposals will be accepted ahead of a deadline on Friday. Meanwhile, a beer emporium owner in Berlin says he intends to put up an informative plaque outside his store - next to the bunker site where Hitler and Eva Braun ended their lives. Bernd Herbrich, manager of the beer emporium, intends to put up his own to inform customers that they are buying a slice of history along with their beer . The City Service Berlin booze store, run by Bernd Herbrich, is just yards from the bunker where on April 30, 1945, Hitler and his new bride Eva Braun ended their lives with gunshots and cyanide thirty feet underground . Hitler's bunker was reduced to rubble in 1945. In the years that followed it fell under the death strip of the Berlin Wall during the years of the Cold War and later a car park was built over it having been filled with concrete by the East Germans . Bernd Herbrich said: 'Although tourists . find their way here, not everyone in the city knows that the bunker was . here. 'I . was born after World War II but I have heard the stories from my . parents and grandparents. 'I imagine what happened 70 years ago, and . there is much blame, but I cannot be responsible for those events. 'I'm a . man of another generation, I see no problem to talk about the history, . and cannot see why other Germans have.' The bunker . was the air raid shelter for Hitler's chancellery which he had to . retreat to in early 1945 as the Soviet Red Army advanced on land towards . the capital and the bombers of Britain and America pounded it into . brickdust from the skies. The bunker was the air raid shelter for Adolf Hitler. He retreated there in early 1945 as the Soviet Red Army advanced on land towards Berlin . The bunker was overrun by Russians days . after Hitler's suicide and the charred corpses of him and Eva were found . in a shell hole in the garden outside. Stalin ordered that the corpses . be secretly removed and buried in East Germany. They had several . secret burial places over the years before being dug up one final time . in 1970, the bones burned and crushed, and the ashes dumped into a . river.

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . Estadio Mineirao represented Dante's very own circle of hell in Belo Horizonte, as his Bayern Munich team-mates ran riot during Germany’s crushing victory over Brazil. The centre-back, who was standing in for suspended captain Thiago Silva, will dread returning to Bavaria for pre-season after Germany’s Bayern contingent - particularly Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos - tore through Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side, who were also without star forward Neymar. Below, Sportsmail takes a closer look at where and when it all went wrong for Dante and his team-mates against Joachim Low’s ruthless team... VIDEO Scroll down for Brazil fans devastated by Germany's 7-1 semi-final victory . Crestfallen: The Brazilian could do nothing as Germany swept past their opponents at will . 8mins - Dante shepherds Muller away from goal well after the German received the ball on the right-hand side. It was the second time in quick succession Muller lost the ball, having been tackled by Oscar on the halfway line not long before. 9mins - Marcelo nicks the ball from Muller on the edge of the Brazil box and the German resorts to a cynical foul to stop Brazil breaking, by pulling on the Real Madrid full-back's shirt. 11mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-1 GERMANY - After a poor start Muller notches his fifth goal of the tournament, sweeping home at the back post after a corner from Kroos was allowed to bounce all the way through to him. David Luiz, who was supposed to be marking him, was nowhere to be seen. Acres of space: Muller sidefoots home to put Germany ahead after 11 minutes in Belo Horizonte . Goal bound: Muller's right foot shot bounces towards the bottom right corner of Julio Cesar's goal .

Dante was partly to blame in the build-up, as he raced out of defence to try and dispossess Kroos. 24mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-3 GERMANY – This one was made on the Bayern training ground. Lahm whipped a teasing ball across the box that Muller missed but Kroos was there, waiting at the edge of the box, to ping a fierce effort past Cesar with his left foot. Record-breaker: Klose surpassed Ronaldo's tally of 15 with his calm finish in the first half . Record-breaker: Klose's calm finish made him the all-time top goalscorer in World Cup tournaments .

HALF-TIME: BRAZIL 0-5 GERMANY – The pre-tournament favourites are booed off at the break by their own fans after an abject half that saw them ship five goals in the space of 18 minutes. Brazil’s defence was all over the place without suspended skipper Silva, with Luiz in particular at fault on a number of occasions. Bayern provided three of Germany’s goals, with Kroos netting twice and Muller grabbing his fifth of the tournament. 51mins – Brazil force Neuer into a string of impressive stops, as Ramires, Oscar and Paulinho pepper the Germany goal at the start of the second half.

He pulls a pass back to the onrushing Andre Schurrle, who makes no mistake from close range. 79mins – GOAL: BRAZIL 0-7 GERMANY – It’s Schurrle again! The Chelsea forward grabs his second of the evening with a thumping finish in off the crossbar from a tight angle on the left side of the penalty area. Hit for six: Schurrle scores from close range shortly after being introduced in the second half for Germany . Seventh heaven: He then added another with 11 minutes left, crashing a left foot shot in off the crossbar . How many more? Dante looks on after Schurrle made it 7-0 to Low's side in the 79th minute . 90mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 1-7 GERMANY - Oscar scores a consolation goal for the hosts after cutting inside and calmly finishing past Neuer.

"By . Rob Draper, Mail on Sunday Chief Football Writer . Wayne Rooney remains the main man, for now at least. However, the days of being the overwhelming, dominant force of this England team may be over for good. In 2006, a nation seemed to have a  collective manic episode over the state of Rooney’s metatarsal and when he arrived back at the World Cup camp in Baden-Baden having been cleared to play, he was reported to have said: ‘The big man is back in town.’ It doesn’t feel like that any more for England. He does appear to be on an upward curve of fitness and his performance on Friday night against Peru demonstrated that he will do his share of work for the team. In doubt: Wayne Rooney is still England's main man but his days in that role could be numbered . Industrious: Against Peru, Rooney put in a good shift and worked hard for his team-mates without scoring . Early finish: Rooney was replaced by Raheem Sterling in the 66th minute of the game . But after the 3-0 win, Gary Lineker . was moved to write on Twitter: ‘Headline from this game is ‘‘What does . Roy do with Rooney?’’ Now Sturridge is lead striker, where does he play . him, if at all. Good problem.’ Roy . Hodgson himself is protective of the Manchester United striker while . also dismissing the idea that there is something sacrosanct about . Rooney’s place in this team. ‘I . think it’s a bit sad that the country is so Wayne Rooney-obsessed,’ said Hodgson. ‘I don’t think Wayne sets himself up to be anything other . than a very, very important member of the squad, someone who does his . best and tries his best at all times. ‘As . far as I’m concerned, talk about combinations doesn’t interest me. All I . want is for Wayne Rooney to play well and for Daniel Sturridge to play . well, to score goals and to create goals. ‘That’s . what they’re in the team for and that’s what we work hard to help them . to do as a team. But certainly we don’t have the same obsession with . Wayne or Daniel. ‘We also . think that people like Danny  Welbeck, Raheem Sterling, Ross  Barkley . and Adam Lallana, they’re in there to help us play well and score goals, . too. That’s what the squad’s about. ‘Obviously . Daniel and Wayne would like to be the first two names on the list and . to do that they’ll have to continue to do well.’ New crop: Roy Hodgson has earmarked Danny Welbeck as one of many players able to score for England . Next generation: Raheem Sterling has broken into the England squad after impressing for Liverpool . On the rise: Ross Barkley's form for Everton meant Roy Hodgson couldn't ignore him . In demand: Adam Lallana's starring role for Southampton has earned him a starting place for England . Lineker . did later mitigate his tweet, adding: ‘Worth remembering this was . Rooney’s first game for a while. He’s scored bags of goals for England . and can play out of customary position.’ The . reality is that Rooney, who missed the last three games of United’s . season with a groin injury, is still likely to start in Manaus against . Italy on June 14, though he must be aware that he is no longer seen as . untouchable. Seasoned Rooney observers know that if he is not up to . speed in the first 15 minutes of a match, he is not the kind of player . to grow into his game. Poland . away during World Cup qualifying would be an example of when the . England bench could have reasonably substituted him at half-time, rather . than after 73 minutes. In . South Africa 2010, the possibility of dropping Rooney was raised but . Fabio Capello would not countenance it. In his mind, England were so . bereft of world-class players that to ditch one of the few was madness. No chance: Fabio Capello wouldn't countenance dropping Rooney for England . Change of plan: Unlike past managers Hodgson may consider Rooney's place for England . The . problem was that while his performances four years ago did not merit . inclusion, the options were limited in Emile Heskey, Peter Crouch and . Jermain Defoe, all of whom had good Premier League records without . troubling the world’s best. This . time it feels there is greater flexibility, though the alternatives, . in Sterling, Barkley and Lallana, are incredibly raw. This management . team will be more focused on what works for the team rather than . soft-pedalling the star names. One of the frustrations for Gary Neville, . now Hodgson’s assistant, during the 2006 World Cup was Sven Goran . Eriksson’s indulgence of players with the biggest reputations. ‘Sven . was clearly worried about leaving out one of his big players, whether . that was Beckham, Lampard, Gerrard or Owen’, wrote Neville in his . autobiography. ‘But it had to be done if it would benefit the team, and I . definitely believed it would help keep the side on their toes. But . because we’d become so used to this first XI playing all the time, to . leave out one of the stars had become a big deal.’ Ruthless: England coach Gary Neville has spoken about not playing the best players but the best team . Hodgson . is clearly still considering the possibilities for Italy, saying there . are ‘too many options’ in the front five positions to have settled on a . team yet. ‘Obviously we have . a fairly clear idea of what we want in the back positions,’ said the . manager. ‘But once you get past Steven Gerrard in the midfield, there . are five positions to fill and I think there are a lot of options . there.’ Hodgson was . irritated that the wave of enthusiasm for the likes of Barkley and . Sterling came at the expense of Rooney on Friday night. ‘It’s . a little bit infuriating to see players who come on in the last 10 or . 15 minutes, when the game is over and there are lots of spaces and the . opposition are on their knees, compared to players who have had to go . out for the first 15, 20 minutes of the game when the opponents are 100 . per cent fit, very, very determined to keep you at bay, throwing . themselves into challenges and getting 10 men behind the ball.’ But . that point could equally be turned into a positive. Bringing on . Barkley, who was clearly keen to impress in his 10 minutes against Peru, . could be an option for the final 20 minutes in the humidity and heat of . Manaus. The extra work . Rooney must do, tracking back as a secondary striker, will come at a . physiological cost in the heat and humidity of the Amazonian jungle. Taking him off would mean he would remain fresher for the games England . really have to win, against Uruguay and Costa Rica. Barkley . for Rooney, along with Sterling for Welbeck, may just jolt the . Italians and ensure they endure a  nervous final quarter of the match. No tired, drained defender would relish facing those two, fresh in the . final minutes of a crucial game. Taking Hodgson at face value, that is . an option he is prepared to consider. He purports not to understand the . fuss about Rooney or players of the ilk of Gerrard. On the up: Rooney missed the final three games of the season for United but his fitness isn't in doubt . ‘I’m . not focusing on one individual. I don’t come to press conferences . thinking: “What am I going to say about Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard . today?” ‘I think about: . “What am I going to say about the game? What am I going to say about the . team’s performance? And what am I going to say about any of the 11 . players”. For me, Steven and Wayne have never asked to be elevated to . the position where they are now. They got there because they’re good . footballers and they deserve to be there. ‘They . know full well, as senior players with a lot of caps, there’s a bit . more responsibility resting on their shoulders than for a Raheem . Sterling or a Ross Barkley, who have hardly played a game. But they also . know that I’m fully aware of that and that I don’t expect any more of . them than what they can give. ‘I . selected Rooney for his skills and I selected Gerrard for his skills. All I want is for them to bring those skills, that I see in a Manchester . United shirt and Liverpool shirt, to an England shirt and if they do . that I’m more than happy.’ The . age of the individual appears to be over. If so, it is good news for . England. And it is good news for Rooney, too. Released from unrealistic . expectations, he may have his best World Cup yet. Freedom: Hodgson's refusal to rely on individuals could result in Rooney finally hitting form for England in a World Cup . Yet to make a mark: The 28-year-old hasn't scored for England at a World Cup and time could be running out .","Wayne Rooney is no longer untouchable due to emergence of new players .

Sportsmail's Adam Crafton gives his verdict on the United players... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . Hot to Scot: Darren Fletcher celebrates after scoring United's opening goal in the second-half . Parting shot? Subsitute Marouane Fellaini came on to score a late winner . Take a bow: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal took charge at Old Trafford for the first time . David De Gea - 6 . Little to do but left exposed for the goal. No question that he is United's first-choice after a superb campaign last time out. Phil Jones - 7 . Better in possession and made one outstanding recovery tackle as Rodrigo Moreno bore down on goal. Still prone to a lapse of concentration but the potential is there. Chris Smalling - 6.5 . Smart on the ball and robust in the challenge. Some at Old Trafford had their doubts last season but looks the part in the 3-5-2 system. Tyler Blackett - 6.5 . Favoured ahead of Michael Keane and impressed again at centre-back. Marcos Rojo will increase competition in the left centre-back position but Blackett deserves some opportunities this season. VIDEO Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . On the spot: Wayne Rooney was made captain for the evening but missed a first-half penalty . Ashley Young - 6 . Hard-working at wing-back and impressive delivery. Still has his limitations but cannot fault his dedication or work ethic under Van Gaal. Darren Fletcher - 7.5 . An inspiring tale of courage is having a happy ending. Fletcher looks back to his dynamic best and is forming a good understanding with Herrera. Well-taken goal. Little P-45? Javier Hernandez was given a rare start despite being linked with a move away from United . Ander Herrera - 7 . Some brilliant passing in the midfield and athletic work in recovering position. He will be vitally important to United this season. Reece James - 6 . Two years ago, he'd been released by Preston. Now he's playing at Old Trafford for Manchester United. James is only 20 and getting improving rapidly. Reliable back-up for Luke Shaw but Daley Blind remains on the United horizon. Play maker: New signing Ander Herrera (R) helped dictate the tempo of the game from midfield . Juan Mata - 5.5 . Quiet in the hole behind the forwards but linked up well on occasion with Rooney and Herrera. Needs to influence the game more but nobody can question his talent. Wayne Rooney - 5.5 . Frustrating evening. Exaggerated the fall to win a penalty and then lashed it against the post. Touch also let him down a couple of times in front of goal. United captain on the night did not stop running and working for his team, though. Change of system: Ashley Young was given another opportunity to impress in the wing-back role . Javier Hernandez - 5.5 . Typically effervescent and sprightly in the final third but unable to convert with one header from close range. Admittedly the service could have been better. SUBSTITUTE RATINGS . Lingard (for Smalling 62) - 6 . Industrious and brought energy at a time United looked a little rattled. Kagawa (for Young 62) - 5.5 . Like Mata, barely featured as a link between midfield and attack. Eastern promise? Shinji Kagawa failed to impress after coming on for Juan Mata . Cleverley (for Fletcher, 62) - 5.5 . Sliced clearance handed the goal to Valencia. Has enjoyed a good pre-season but not the Old Trafford homecoming he'd have hoped for. M.Keane (for Mata, 62) - 6 . Talented youngster but doesn't quite look ready. If United bring in the defenders they are chasing, expect him to leave on loan to a Championship club. Blackburn and Cardiff lead the chase. Fellaini (for Herrera, 76) - 7 . Cruel treatment from United supporters, ironically applauding every touch. Classless from the fans and good on him for responding with a goal. Even if there may have been a foul on the goalkeeper... Fancy a slice? Tom Cleverly played a part in Valencia's equaliser after a decent pre-season . Januzaj (for Hernandez, 76) - 6.5 . The Belgian showed glimpses of the qualities that lit up Old Trafford last season. Interesting to see how Van Gaal finds room for him in the 3-5-2. Too good to leave out, really.

Over in Group B, leaders Liverpool face AC Milan in North Carolina in a repeat of the 2005 and 2007 Champions League finals in North Carolina, while Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City take on Olympiacos in Minnesota. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal closely supervising United training . On tour: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are one win from the Guinness International Champions Cup final . On the march: United are top of Group A after beating Inter Milan on penalties at FedEx Field . All four games take place on Saturday and the winners of each group will meet in the final at Miami's Sun Life Stadium on Monday. Despite the television coverage around the world, large crowds in big stadiums and the tournament format, this competition is just a part of new-season preparations for the eight European teams involved. And while the prospect of a Liverpool-United showdown or a Manchester derby in Miami looms, new Old Trafford boss Van Gaal wouldn't mind a defeat by Real Madrid at 'The Big House' in Ann Arbor. Rivals: Either Liverpool or Manchester City could face United in the final in Miami on Monday . VIDEO Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City (Liverpool win 3-1 on penalties) Setting: The tournament has been played at some of America's best venues - including Yankee Stadium . Should United beat the Champions League winners, they will top Group A, face another long flight from the north America to the south east for the final, be forced to stay Stateside for a few more days, and play another match on this pre-season tour which Van Gaal has dismissed as a 'commercial activity'. After two games, United sit top of Group A with five points. They were awarded three for their 3-2 win over Roma in Denver, and two for a penalty shoot-out victory against Inter at FedExField. A draw will probably be good enough to see United into the final, but either Roma or Inter could still pip them to top spot in Group A. Both Italian teams have three points, Roma through more conventional football methods with one win, 1-0 over Real Madrid, and one defeat, 3-2 by Manchester United. Inter, meanwhile, picked up two points after beating Real in a shootout, and one for a loss on penalties against United. Showdown: AC Milan's Mario Balotelli (left) and  City's Scott Sinclair (right) during their Pittsburgh clash . Historic: The Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas during the game between Roma and Real Madrid . Effectively, United need two points to be certain of their place in the final, which means they could afford a draw against Real Madrid in Michigan so long as they win the penalty shootout. Meanwhile, in Group B, only AC Milan are out of the running for a place in the final as Liverpool and Manchester City sit best placed to make the final. Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side are top of the group with five points, three for their 1-0 win over Olympiacos in Chicago and two for their shootout win over City at Yankee Stadium. But with City just one point behind with a much better goal difference, Liverpool need a win to guarantee themselves a place in the final.

FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer said: 'The ban relates to all football-related activity. He cannot be in a football-related public event irrespective of the venue. 'He cannot even be involved in a football-related charity event.' Suarez, 27, had his appeal against the four-month ban, plus a nine-match international and an 100,000 Swiss franc (£66,000) fine, rejected outright by FIFA's appeals committee. He is expected to take his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that, as they stand, will keep him out of club football until the end of October.

The player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the FIFA appeals panel. Suarez's lawyer claimed the punishment was 'blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist'. Alejandro Balbi told Spanish radio station Cope: 'The right of a footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried about that.

Love him or loathe him, Luis Alberto Suarez Díaz, to give him his full name, has had an incredible impact on life in the Premier League since he arrived on these shores in February 2011. Put aside all his controversies: the biting, the suspension for racist abuse, the diving and the petulance (that is well covered elsewhere on MailOnline), for a brief moment let’s remember his best strikes for Liverpool. Magician: Luis Suarez's stunning goals and trickery made him a hero at Anfield . 10. Sunderland, 20 March 2011 . Suarez made an instant impact by coming off the bench to score on debut against Stoke at Anfield, but his first strike away from home was a peach. After a neat interchange with Dirk Kuyt from a throw-in, Suarez got to the byline and, instead of crossing, lashed the ball in from the tightest of angles. Lethal: Suarez smashed home his first away goal for Liverpool from the tightest of angles against Sunderland . 9. Manchester City, 26 August 2012 . In one of Brendan Rodgers' first games in charge of Liverpool, his team dominated Manchester City, but stumbled to a 2-2 draw at Anfield. After a defensive mix-up allowed Yaya Toure to equalise for City, Suarez responded minutes later with a free-kick that was perfectly placed into the bottom corner beyond the out-stretched hand of Joe Hart. 8. Everton, 28 January 2014 . Liverpool simply ripped Everton apart in the Merseyside derby at Anfield with pace and penetration. With the visitors pushing for a way back into the game, Suarez pounced by winning the ball in his own half and running all the way down the field before slotting past Tim Howard. Rout: The Uruguayan scored Liverpool's fourth goal in their dominant win over Everton at Anfield . 7. Cardiff, 21 December 2013 . With Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge both injured, Suarez really stepped up in December to keep Liverpool in the title hunt. His second goal against Cardiff at Anfield was a beautiful first-time strike into the bottom corner on the stroke of half-time. Suarez had already scored one and set up another, and this third goal saw Liverpool top the league at Christmas. No 1: Suarez's man--of-the-match display against Cardiff took Liverpool top of the Premier League at Christmas . 6. Norwich, 4 December 2013 . The Uruguayan was simply unplayable in this game. He ended up with four goals and an assist as Liverpool recovered from their 3-1 defeat at Hull by smashing Norwich 5-1 at Anfield. This was a game I was lucky enough to see live, and I doubt I will see a better hat-trick. His third goal was a venomous strike into the far corner in the 35th minute. Strike: Suarez scores his third goal in a 5-1 win over Norwich at Anfield last December . 5. Stoke, 26 October 2011 . With Liverpool trailing at the Britannia Stadium heading into the second half of this Capital One Cup tie, Suarez came up with a moment of magic to get Kenny Dalglish's side back on track. Suarez nutmegged Ryan Shotton before curling his right-foot shot into the far corner beyond the helpless Thomas Sorensen. The Uruguayan would go on to score an 85th-minute winner, and Liverpool went on to win the Capital One Cup at Wembley. Sealed with a kiss: Suarez scored both goals as Liverpool beat Stoke in the Capital One Cup . 4. West Brom, 26 October 2013 . Another of the many games where Suarez was simply unplayable. He finished with a hat-trick in this game, the second goal of which was a header into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. This came five minutes after his first goal, where he jinked his way through three defenders before firing into the bottom corner. Rising high: Suarez scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 win over West Brom at Anfield in October . 3. Newcastle, 4 November 2012 . Liverpool were struggling to create chances against a stubborn Newcastle team, who were protecting a 1-0 lead at Anfield. But, in the 67th minute, Suarez stole half a yard on the Newcastle defence and controlled Jose Enrique's long ball on his shoulder, before rounding Tim Krul and tapping in. Head and shoulders: The Liverpool striker controls a long ball over the top from Jose Enrique . Rounded: Suarez leaves Fabricio Coloccini and Tim Krul for dead before tapping in . 2. Norwich, 4 December 2013 . Another goal from that hat-trick I saw live, and this one I was right behind the line of. It was a fairly uneventful first 15 minutes, but one moment of magic changed that. After John Ruddy's goal-kick bounced around in midfield, Suarez ran onto the ball and hit a first-time shot from 40 yards over the goalkeeper's head. Distance: Suarez scores from 40 yards against Norwich, his first of four goals in the Premier League game . 1. Norwich, 28 April 2012 . There are few sights that Suarez enjoyed more than seeing Norwich on the other side of the scoreboard. He simply came alive against them, and his hat-trick at Carrow Road at the end of the 2011-12 season was rounded off with a sublime finish from the halfway line.

The spine of their back-to-back championship winning team are now exploring other avenues. What's brought about this change? Losing to the San Antonio Spurs in such a one-sided NBA Finals series, and the realisation that the Heat were no longer top dogs.

One possible scenario could be that James, Wade and Bosh agree between themselves what contracts they want next season, and how much of the salary cap that NBA teams have to abide by (which will rise to around £37million next season) they chew up. But, LeBron might choose another avenue in a quest for more titles. In 2010, he had the big decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team that drafted with the No 1 overall pick in the 2003 draft, to join Miami and it has turned out to be the right decision. But James wants to be able look back at his career with more than two NBA titles to show for it. The great Michael Jordan won six titles with Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant is a five-time champion with the Los Angeles Lakers. Those are players that James compares with but, at the moment, his trophy cabinet is considerably smaller.

Will the city be big enough for . both him and Bryant? Then there's Chicago, who are looking to rebuild their franchise, the opportunity to link up with fellow free agent Carmelo Anthony at whichever franchise they feel like, or maybe even return to his first team and go home back to Ohio by rejoining Cleveland. Teams can officially negotiate with James from July 1, and not sign him before July 9. Just imagine if the summer transfer window opened, and Messi had a choice of any club in the world. That is the situation James finds himself in. He is an athlete at the peak of his powers both on the court and in terms of financial power (he was rated as the third highest paid sports star behind Floyd Mayweather and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013), and now he has his future in his own hands.

Having lost game two at home on Sunday, the Spurs responded with an emphatic statement to record a 111-92 victory on the road and take a 2-1 lead in the series. The damage was done for San Antonio in the first half as they racked up 71 points, and a 21-point half-time lead. Up and down: LeBron James scored 22 points but couldn't prevent Miami Heat losing to the San Antonio Spurs . Dunking: Kawhi Leonard scored 29 points and was one of five Spurs players to end in double figures . Tricky business: Not even the prowess of 22-point Dwyane Wade was enough for the Heat on Tuesday . The Spurs made 25 of their 33 shots in the opening two periods, a percentage of 75.8 per cent that ranks as the best seen in a single half in NBA Finals history. Miami threatened a comeback in the third quarter as they closed the gap to seven points, helped by their raucous home crowd at American Airlines Arena. But, after being held to 15 points in the third quarter, San Antonio regained control in the fourth and began to pull away once more. After scoring just 18 points in games one and two combined, Kawhi Leonard exploded into life for the Spurs with 29 points including three 3-pointers.

"By . Wayne Gardiner, Press Association . Hull unveiled a new club crest on Friday morning, with the design not incorporating the team name. The fresh logo features the tiger's head which has been depicted on four of the club's seven previous badges, but does not have the club's name on it. That is sure to spark debate among supporters who earlier this year successfully lobbied against a name change. Update: Hull City reveal their club crest for the 2014/15 season . Chairman Assem Allam wanted to rebrand the club from Hull City AFC to Hull Tigers, citing the word city as 'common' and claiming the club would be more marketable on the continent if known as 'Tigers'. His wish was not granted by the Football Association but the club continues to use the name Hull City Tigers in statements and commercial operations. Allam had said he would appeal the decision - which came in April - but there has been no official comment since. Allam's son and vice-chairman, Ehab, said the new crest, which has the club's formation year of 1904 on it, helps celebrate Hull's history as they head into European football for the first time. Brander: Chairman Assem Allam has been fighting a long battle to change the name of the club to 'Hull Tigers' Heartache: Manager Steve Bruce and Hull players on the pitch after their FA Cup Final loss to Arsenal in May .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Tiger Woods will not be in the United States team for the Ryder Cup next month after withdrawing himself from consideration for a captain's pick due to injury. The 38-year-old failed to qualify for the team outright and has now informed the PGA of America and Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson that, after playing just four tournaments on his return to action following back surgery, he does not wish to be considered for one of the three remaining places. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watson claiming he will pick Tiger if he is fit . Blow: Tiger Woods does not wish to be considered for selection for United States team . Down and out: Woods, without a major win since 2008, said: 'I'm extremely disappointed' VIDEO Tiger Woods pulls out of Ryder Cup . Woods has struggled with personal problems and a series of injuries since winning his most recent major championship at the 2008 US Open, with a back injury the latest to disturb his career. Woods underwent back surgery on March 31 and has now admitted he will not be fit to participate at Gleneagles. 'While I greatly appreciate Tom thinking about me for a possible captain's pick, I must take myself out of consideration,' Woods said in a statement on www.pga.com. 'I've been told by my doctors and trainer that my back muscles need to be rehabilitated and healed. They've advised me not to play or practice now. 'I'm extremely disappointed that I won't be ready for the competition. 'The U.S. Team and the Ryder Cup mean too much to me not to be able to give it my best. I'll be cheering for the U.S. Team. I think we have an outstanding squad going into the matches.' After his surgery, Woods did not return to action until the end of June, missing the cut in the Quicken Loans National and then finishing 69th in the Open at Royal Liverpool, his worst 72-hole finish in a major in the paid ranks. He withdrew after hitting his tee shot on the ninth hole of his final round at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational 11 days ago and was a major doubt to even take part in the US PGA Championship last week. Concern: Woods has played just four tournaments on his return to action after back surgery . Risk: Woods arrived for the US PGA Championship despite concerns over his condition . The 14-time major winner missed just his fourth cut in 66 majors as a professional after suffering yet more back trouble at Valhalla but Watson insisted he was still in his thoughts and that he trusted Woods to be honest about his physical condition. And the captain now knows Woods will not be an option when he makes his three picks on September 2. 'My primary wish is for Tiger to be healthy and competitive, and I hope that he'll return to the game very soon,' said Watson. 'Of course, I'm disappointed that Tiger Woods has asked not to be considered for the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, and that his health is not where he would like it to be. 'However, I think we can all agree that we need Tiger Woods in this great sport, and he has taken the high road by informing me early on in the selection process. 'My focus will remain on identifying three players to join the U.S. team and give us the best chance for success at Gleneagles.' Fallen: Woods eventually missed the cut at the US PGA Championship, which Rory McIlroy won . Setback: US captain Tom Watson had hoped to pick Woods for Gleneagles showdown . VIDEO Watson claiming he will pick Tiger if he is fit . Woods would not have been a certainty for a pick even if he had been fit with Watson also admitting that form would have to play a major part in any decision. Woods had played in every Ryder Cup since 1997, winning at Brookline and Valhalla in 1999 and 2008, and had a record of 13 wins, 17 losses and three halves. Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson are the nine automatic qualifiers for a place on the 12-man American team. Keegan Bradley looks to be the most likely candidate for a wild card given his three wins from three matches with Phil Mickelson at Medinah in 2012, but Watson has injury concerns over Kuchar and prospective pick Jason Dufner. Kuchar withdrew from the US PGA before the start with back spasms, while Dufner's title defence lasted just 10 holes with a long-standing neck problem and he dropped out of the qualifying places.","Tiger Woods says his back muscles need to heal following surgery .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Jailed: Jeffrey Lake, 78, was arrested at his home in Australia to stand trial on the historic offences . A retired police sergeant who was extradited from Australia and convicted of child sex abuse committed in the UK was jailed today for 18 years. Jeffrey Lake, 78, was arrested at his home in Queensland, Australia, to stand trial on the historic offences - the vast majority of which were committed when he was a serving police officer in Accrington, Lancashire, and Liverpool. The defendant emigrated in 2002 and had been living there for seven years when one of his two victims walked into a police station in Lancashire and said Lake had sexually and physically abused her as a child. The woman was interviewed at length and when the investigation widened a man came forward and said he too had been abused by the defendant, Preston Crown Court was told. He was arrested in Peregian Springs earlier this year and brought to the UK where he denied the allegations against him, said to have taken place in the 1960s and early 1970s. Last week a jury unanimously found him guilty of 20 charges of historic abuse including rape, buggery, indecency with a child, indecent assault and child cruelty. Sentencing him, Mr Justice King said each offence was a ‘serious example’ of sexual and physical abuse which was committed in a sustained way. Each of the two complainants had been deprived of achieving their full potential in adulthood as a consequence, he added. The judge continued: ‘Each has suffered from deep depression over the years. Each has felt suicidal and attempted suicide. I have no doubt that the major cause of all their lifelong problems is the abuse each suffered at your hands.’ He observed that Lake had shown ‘no contrition’ and ‘no remorse’ for the ‘deep and long-lasting’ effects he had caused. Sentencing: Preston Crown Court (file picture) was told one of the women was interviewed at length and when the investigation widened a man came forward and said he too had been abused by the defendant . Lake was sentenced to 18 years in jail for the rape of the female complainant when she was a child. He received concurrent sentences of the same length for two other counts of rape and received concurrent terms of between 18 months and 13 years for the remaining offences. Both complainants gave victim impact statements which were partly read out in court. The female victim said Lake had enjoyed making her terrified of him and as a result she had not become the person she ought to have been. ‘I feel I have wasted my life,’ she said. ‘I have never achieved my true potential and I never will. I am so angry.’ The male victim said he had less confidence because of the abuse inflicted. As an intelligent man, he should have gone to university but did not, and his adult relationships have been ‘virtually non-existent’ because of his fear of anyone getting too close to him emotionally. He said he thought Lake would not be happy in custody but added: ‘He will be happy that two lives will be ruined as a result of what he has done.’ Mitigating, Matthew Lawson asked for his client’s age and his ongoing problems with diabetes to be taken into account in fixing the jail term. A lengthy sentence would mean it was likely he would die in prison, he argued. Mr Justice King told the court that the 18-year term would have been ‘justifiably longer’ if Lake had been younger. He took into account that he was a man of previous good character and had an unblemished record in the police force. Lake was also disqualified from working with children and cannot have any unsupervised contact with children except with the permission of a youngster’s parent or guardian and the express approval of social services in the area. Abroad: Lake was arrested in Peregian Springs (file picture) in Queensland earlier this year and brought to the UK where he denied the allegations against him, said to have taken place in the 1960s and early 1970s . Opening the case, prosecutor Louise Whaites said the female victim went on to suffer from depression and anxiety from the ‘quite appalling’ abuse she suffered at his hands. ‘She was clearly unable to cope with what happened to her,’ she said. In the mid-1970s she wrote to the defendant and told him how she felt about what he had done to her, the jury was told. She received no response or acknowledgement from Lake. Physical abuse: The female victim denied the abuse was a figment of her imagination gleaned from reading books such as Dave Pelzer's A Child Called It . Following his emigration, she wrote more letters to him in which she said she was concerned that he had not changed and would go on to commit similar offences. She said her death ‘wouldn’t bring matters to a close for him’ because she had told her GP, her husband and also her children about the abuse. Today, the judge said Lake had chosen to stay silent when receiving the letters and ‘undoubtedly called her bluff’ when she threatened to disclose matters. In December 2009 she finally made a complaint to the police. Giving evidence, Lake denied all the charges against him and said he was ‘not of the persuasion’ of someone who sexually abuses children. He said he had never thought of returning to Britain since his move because he had no reason to do so and because of the expense of travelling. Lake claimed illness prevented him flying over for his son’s wedding. It was suggested that his accusers had a personal hostility towards him which led them to give false evidence to the court. Under cross-examination, the female victim denied the abuse was a figment of her imagination gleaned from reading books such as Dave Pelzer’s A Child Called It. She denied that the book, which details the physical abuse of a child by his mother, had influenced her in any way to believe she had been abused herself.

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . Leeds boss David Hockaday has jumped to the defence of club president Massimo Cellino - despite the Italian owner seeming to marginalise his manager in the lead up to their Championship opener away at Millwall. Cellino’s quirky leadership style has come under close scrutiny since he completed his takeover of the club in April - and this week has seen him quoted in the press with comments that haven't always painted his manager in the best light. The Leeds owner told Sportsmail about his frequent disagreements with coaches and even said on one occasion he had told Hockaday to 'shut the f*** up', before the season had even begun. Defending the owner: Leeds boss Dave Hockaday says Massimo Cellino is 'great to work with' Thanks for coming! Cellino sacked Brian McDermott shortly after taking over at Elland Road . Hockaday, however, believes Cellino will bring the good times back to the club and insists he has enjoyed a healthy relationship with the colourful Italian since being installed in the role in June. Cellino has made wholesale changes and has delivered financial stability, but his unconventional methods, including superstitions about the colour purple and number 17 - both banned from Elland Road - remain central to the debate over whether he will be successful. 'It’s been great,' Hockaday said. 'I know there will be a bit of conjecture, but we get on fine. Controversial: Cellino has told players to bring own sandwiches to training and demanded they live in Leeds . And he's gone! Leeds sold star striker Ross McCormack to Fulham at the beginning of the summer . 'The superstitions? I don’t wear number 17 on my back or purple! Again, there’s a lot of stuff going out there which I appreciate you media guys have got stories to write and papers to sell or whatever. 'But don’t read into to it too much. Don’t believe everything that you read and hear on the grapevine. 'He’s great to work with because he’s so passionate about the football club.' Cellino and director of football Nicola Salerno, not the head coach, identify all new signings, but Hockaday insists he has no problem with his limited role in player recruitment - despite having any player requests rejected by the owner because of his previous time at Conference level. Cantankerous: New owner Massimo Cellino is one to take swift decisions and doesn't suffer fools . New arrival: Leeds signed striker Nicky Ajose from Peterborough on a three-year deal ahead of the new season . In action: Scott Wooton of Leeds challenges Dundee United's Mario Bilate during a pre-season friendly . 'If there’s somebody I don’t particularly like then I’ll voice my concerns and they’ll go and get the best one they can for Leeds United,' Hockaday said. 'That makes sense to me. 'I think the media have had a bit of fun at Leeds’ expense over the last few weeks and now we’re at the business end, so let’s concentrate on Millwall on Saturday.'

Taunt: Pepe (second right) smirks back at Keita (bottom) after that bottle falls to the floor behind him . It was also claimed that Pepe had spat at Keita at some point during proceedings but that does not seem to have been caught on camera. The came about ahead of the Roma's 1-0 win over the European champions on Wednesday morning in the Guinness International Champions Cup in Dallas. Pepe and Keita have had their battles down the years in El Clasico games and those ill feelings seemed to come to a head. The pair have history: Keita accused Pepe of calling him a monkey during a Supercopa Clasico clash in 2011. History: Keita and Pepe aren't the best of friends - with the former once accusing the latter of racism . This time, after the Mali man refused to shake his opponent's hand in the pre-match pleasantries the pair had to be separated by team mates, with Iker Casillas and Xabi Alonso acting as chief peace-makers. But that wasn't all - the 34-year-old midfielder then decided it was a wise idea to throw a bottle of water at the notorious Real hard man's head. Fortunately the usually hot-headed Pepe appeared to laugh it off - but the fourth official claimed he had spat at his counterpart at some point during the scuffle, although it was bizarrely not deemed worthy of a red card. Angry: Keita still seems to be wound up as he takes issue with Real's Isco after the incident . It's only a friendly!

In February 2012, Luis Suarez refused to shake the hand of Manchester United defender Patrice Evra after being found guilty by the FA and banned for eight matches for racially abusing the Frenchman the previous October. Evra offered his hand but the Uruguay star, then of Liverpool, ignored it (below) and moved on down the line of United players. This sparked off even more controversy and prompted Sir Alex Ferguson to call Suarez 'a disgrace'. A month earlier, in January 2012, the Premier League took the unprecedented step of cancelling the pre-match handshakes between Chelsea and QPR in the wake of the John Terry-Anton Ferdinand affair. Terry had been banned for four matches and fined for racially abusing Ferdinand the previous November and the PL decided to dispense with the handshakes to avoid embarrassment. That was not the first time Terry had been involved in a handshake gate.

In fact, when added to Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo's £86m and £80m deals, Real can now boast an attacking midfield that costs more than the transfer spend of Dutch giants Ajax in their entire 114-year history. The four-time European Cup winners have spent just £183million on transfers - £43million less than the Real cash splashed out on the expensively-assembled trio.

Reach for the stars: James Rodriguez is the final piece in the most expensive team in world football .

While Ajax's record signing was £13million Miralem Sulejmani, only Marcelo (£5m, signed aged 19), Raphael Varane (£8m, aged 18), Daniel Carvajal (£4m, aged 21) and Diego Lopes (£3m) cost less from next year's expected Real starting XI . Madrid have a history of expensive signings from the Galactico era, but the class of 2014 put even the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham and Luis Figo to shame. Even Barcelona, who added £75million Luis Suarez to the £71million purchase of Neymar this summer, don't come close - although the disparity is helped by the inclusion of La Masia product Lionel Messi, whose transfer fee in today's market could help Barca make up the £80million gap. And so as Rodriguez dons a Real shirt for the first time on Tuesday evening, he completes a staggering £226million line-up that will leave the money men as opened-mouthed as the defenders who will likely be chasing shadows in La Liga next season.

Jose Mourinho spent long periods of last season bemoaning his lack of a 'real striker' - but this pre season he is putting in the hours to get exactly what he wants. At Chelsea's Waldarena training base in Austria, the Chelsea boss has been spending a lot of time with his new £32million hitman Diego Costa, working to ensure that the 25-year-old knows what his new manager expects of him. Mourinho's man-management skills have long been lauded as the best around. Back in his first spell at Stamford Bridge in 2004, he told Frank Lampard he was the best player in the world - and the prolific midfielder went on to guide the Blues to their first title in 50 years.

Sturridge, who returns for pre season training this week, is now the club's most senior striker, despite joining just 18 months ago from Chelsea. And the England forward, who scored against Italy at the World Cup, feels those who played alongside Suarez last season will have to work hard to fill the void left by his former controversial striker partner.

The Arsenal and England midfielder has already spoken about how his 'time is running out' to make a mark, and he could end up joining an unfortunate list of English players to throw away great talent away from the pitch . Here, Sportsmail looks at the top 10 English talents who never fulfilled their potential: . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer's famous fight on the pitch . Time is running out: Jack Wilshere puffs on a cigarette during his holiday in Las Vegas for a stag weekend . Jermaine Pennant . Pennant set a transfer record for a trainee when he joined Arsenal for £2million at the age of just 15 from Notts County. His skill and pace on the wing excited fans but poor discipline and time-keeping frustrated Arsene Wenger. All that paled into insignificance though when he was jailed for drink-driving during a loan spell at Birmingham - and on release he was the first Premier League footballer to wear an electronic tag. Pennant has since gone on to play for seven other clubs, and even played in a Champions League final with Liverpool, but without an England cap to his name it's indisputable that what was a great talent was wasted. Young guns: Pennant played in the same Arsenal youth team as Steve Sidwell, Moritz Voltz and Jay Bothroyd . Jailed: A promising start at Arsenal turned sour for Pennant who was sent to prison for drink-driving aged 22 . Keeping track: Pennant had to wear an electronic tag during the months after he was in prison . Michael Johnson . Back before the money came in, Johnson was the next big thing at Manchester City. A handful of impressive appearances made him a fans' hero before injury ruled him out of the side over the Christmas period in 2007. Former team-mate Dietmar Hamann likened him to Michael Ballack. Even when Thaksin Shinawatra's millions made their impact, Johnson was still a key player and impressed alongside Elano under Sven Goran Eriksson before more injury troubles and three drink driving arrests. Photos surfaced of him looking overweight and unfit in 2013 and Johnson later revealed he had been for treatment at The Priory Clinic for mental health problems - a sad end to the career of a player once tipped for the top with City and England. Fat lot of good: The Michael Johnson picture . which emerged contrasts with his appearance in his . early, promising days at Manchester City . Outcast: Johnson was released from his £25,000-a-week Manchester City contract . Kieron Dyer . Dyer was blessed with the sort of pace and technical ability seen to be lacking in many English footballers - and he helped Newcastle qualify for the Champions League twice while being a regular in his country's midfield. But he was also the poster boy of Newcastle's 'Brat Pack' of gifted players prone to scandal: he lived in a flashy penthouse, crashed a Ferrari into the Tyne Bridge after a night out and generally 'succumbed to temptation' as he later admitted. He was judged to be the aggressor in a famous fight with team-mate Lee Bowyer on the pitch at St James' Park and after leaving Newcastle ended up as an expensive journeyman - spending the prime of his career as a £450,000-a-game flop at West Ham. Fight club: Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer were separated by astonished team-mates and opponents, leaving Bowyer's shirt shredded. They were both rightly sent off . Lee Bowyer . A one-cap wonder with England, Bowyer was always at the heart of controversy during spells at Leeds, West Ham, Newcastle and Birmingham. Being charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and affray, questions about his attitude towards racism and his on-the-pitch brawl with Dyer were among the low points - the first of which delayed his England debut while he stood trial. But before all that he was a key player in the Leeds side that reached the Champions League semi finals and the goalscoring, all-action midfielder was even voted their player of the year in that 2000-01 season. Lee Sharpe . Another player whose playboy image got the better of him, Sharpe was ditched by Sir Alex Ferguson despite being one of England's most exciting wingers. His attitude to football was perhaps summed up in a conversation with Gary Neville about why the defender did not want to go on a night out. Sharpe asked Neville: 'You don't like nightclubs? In nightclubs there's beer, decent music, women, what exactly is there not to like?' Sadly Sharpe is now probably better remembered for his appearance on Celebrity Love Island than his football, which says it all, really. The Sharpey shuffle: Lee Sharpe was a fans' favourite but his antics would not wash with Alex Ferguson . Faded: Once a flying winger, Sharpe is now better known for his appearance on Celebrity Love Island (below) Stan Collymore . Tall, powerful, fast and skillful, Collymore was one of the stars of the new Premier League era when he scored 22 goals for newly-promoted Nottingham Forest. But his outspoken nature - still obvious today in his media work - and supposedly poor work ethic made him unpopular with fellow players. During his time with Aston Villa he assaulted then-girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson and ended up having short spells at a number of clubs incluidng Real Oviedo before retiring with a disappointing three England caps. Couple: Collymore's relationship with Ulrika Jonsson and subsequent assault arrest was a huge low point . Outspoken: Collymore remains as controversial and opinion-dividing as a broadcaster as he was a player . Wayne Bridge . There was a time when Bridge was being talked about as a replacement for Ashley Cole in the England setup, such was his form for Chelsea. But Jose Mourinho was unimpressed with his smoking habit and ended up bringing Cole to the club and shipping Bridge out to Manchester City - where he eventually ended up exiled from the squad. Two Premier League winners' medals might be a decent boast for Bridge but he could have had much more. Winner: Bridge scores for Chelsea against Arsenal at Highbury in the Champions League in 2004 . Waiting in the wings: Bridge was constantly playing second fiddle to Ashley Cole, who he replaces here . Robin Friday . Any Englishman rated as 'the greatest footballer you never saw' has to make this list. Friday has been voted Reading's greatest ever player despite a career that lasted just five years, and was said to be good enough to play for England. Former World Cup referee Clive Thomas claimed Friday had scored the best goal he had ever seen ahead of the likes of Pele and Johan Cruyff. He was constantly in scraps with other players and even kissed a policeman after scoring one goal. But off the pitch his behaviour was even more erratic and his drug-taking, police arrests, up-and-down love life and tendency to dance naked in pubs made him tough to handle. In the end he quit at the age of 25 saying he was 'sick of people telling me what to do.' Loose cannon: Robin Friday sticks up two fingers at Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic after scoring in April 1977 . Record deal: Super Furry Animals used the picture of Robin Friday on one of their singles . Stan Bowles . Bowles was your typical 'character on and off the pitch' and wrote in his autobiography about spending his time drinking, gambling and womanizing during his playing days. His tendency to 'take the p***', as he put it, made him unpopular with other players and he never really got a fair shot with England before walking out. He also walked out on Brian Clough and a place in his European Cup-winning Nottingham Forest side, which probably represents one of the best examples of an opportunity lost. Competitor: Stan Bowles takes on David O'Leary during his playing days with QPR . Fag-end of his career: Bowles smokes a cigarette at the North Star pub in Brentford . Peter Knowles . Not the typical route for a footballer to throw away his career - Knowles quit the sport to become a practicing Jehovah's Witness. Before that he had dreamed of an England cap and appeared for the Under 23s but never fulfilled his potential from his days with Wolves. He remained on contract there for 12 years without playing a game and later ended up working in Marks & Spencer.

The Hull-born 24-year-old, who since joining the Robins from city rivals Hull FC in 2010 has made more than 100 appearances and earned a call-up for the second-string England Knights side, has agreed a two-year contract with the NRL club. On the move: Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson is set to leave for Canberra Raiders at the end of the season . Rovers chairman Neil Hudgell told www.hullkr.co.uk: 'Whilst we are disappointed to lose a player of Josh's calibre, we fully understand his reasons for wanting to test himself in the NRL. 'As you would expect from Josh, he has been honest with the club from the start of these discussions and we have secured a substantial fee from Canberra as well as agreeing first refusal on Josh if he comes back to the UK.' Hodgson added: 'This opportunity has come at the right time for me. I've always had an ambition to play in the NRL and I felt I would have had regrets later in my career if I didn't take this opportunity. 'Hull KR took a chance on me five years ago when I first came to the club and I was grateful for that. I've always done my best to repay the faith they showed in me and it was a really tough decision to leave.'

"By . Press Association Reporter . England made it two from two at the Women's Rugby World Cup in France, beating Spain 45-5 in the Pool A clash. Head coach Gary Street's side scored six tries to Spain's one, with Kay Wilson, Danielle Waterman, Laura Keates, Claire Allan and Marlie Packer - with two - all scoring and Emily Scarratt adding 15 points with the boot. After a cagey opening England broke the deadlock when a deft grubber through from fly-half Ceri Large bounced perfectly for Wilson to jump on for her third try of the tournament. Big win: Danielle Waterman breaks through the Spanish line to score one of England's six tries . Scarratt converted the try from wide, and the Lichfield centre duly added a penalty after 33 minutes. At 10-0 Spain continued to press, but some dancing feet from Waterman saw her get over the line for her 35th international try. England went into the break 17-0 up, and started the second half with real pace. First, Keates rumbled over to score after strong work from the pack before Allan was on hand to finish off a smart team move across the line for 31-0 and the bonus point. Scarratt converted both with ease and had her sixth successful kick after Packer barged her way over the line for her first try of the World Cup. Dominating: Ceri Large tries to ride the challenges from Spain's Marina Bravo and Paula Medin . With just over 10 minutes to play Spain were rewarded with their first try after a spell of pressure on England's line - Marina Bravo eventually diving over. But it was England who had the final say. Packer scored her second try after more strong work from the pack and Scarratt rounded off the win with the conversion, her seventh from seven attempts. Dynamic duo: Waterman causes the Spanish defence more problems while Emily Scarratt kicks some extras . England captain Sarah Hunter said: 'It was a tough game, we knew that Spain would come at us and cause us problems. 'It was a case of playing in the right areas and hoping that we would get the rewards - and eventually they came. 'Canada up next will be a huge test for us, we'll look at this game and take what we can out of it and then switch attention to that match on Saturday which will be a difficult game as they are an excellent side.'

The positive test raises serious questions over how even youth players are being tempted to take performance-enhancing drugs. Kris Radlinski, Wigan rugby general manager, said in a statement: 'Rhys has been honest and contrite throughout the process and has extended apologies to Wigan coaching staff, players and sponsors for his actions in letting down both himself and the Wigan club. 'The club will support him, as allowed, through this difficult time and is in the process of constructing a rehabilitation programme to take effect after the recommended period of remorse, reflection and full awareness.'

Pugsley, originally from Newport, tested positive for anabolic steroids (metabolites of methandienone) following an out-of-competition test on 22 April 2014 and was provisionally suspended from all competition on May 15. He is banned from all competition until May 14 2016. UK Anti-Doping legal director Graham Arthur said: 'Athletes should be under no illusion.

Hull boss Steve Bruce has vowed to relish every moment of Saturday's FA Cup final against Arsenal after being hit with another timely reminder of the precarious nature of football management. Bruce believes the prospects for Premier League managers are now bleaker than anywhere else in the world after Tim Sherwood became the second top-flight manager to lose his job this week.

Bruce said: 'I never thought I'd see the day but it's now becoming like it is in Europe or South America - in fact it's probably worse now. 'We keep getting told the average lifespan (for a manager) is 13 months and another good young manager has just lost his job. 'From the outside I don't know how much more he could have done. In terms of results he's been terrific. 'I've been in management for 15 years now and two or three people have lost their jobs in the last 48 hours so I'm going to take a deep breath and enjoy the occasion.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Russian intelligence-gathering ship accompanied by a tugboat has been roaming the waters off the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for the past month, the Pentagon revealed Thursday. Agency spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Crosson said the Russian vessels Viktor Leonov and Nikolay Chiker have been operating beyond American territorial seas near the coast of Cuba. 'We respect the freedom of all nations, as reflected in international law, to operate military vessels beyond the territorial seas of other nations,' the official stated. Eavesdropping: The Pentagon says the intelligence-gathering ship Viktor Leonov has been operating in international waters off the East Coast for the past month . Strategic location: The Vishnya-class spy boat may have been targeting the U.S. nuclear missile submarine base in Kings Bay, Georgia, . The Viktor Leonov CCB-175 boat, which measures 300 feet long and 47.5 feet wide, was first sighted in Cuba back in February, when it docked in Havana. The Russian Vishnya-class vessel with a crew of 200 sailors carries high-tech electronic surveillance equipment and weaponry, AK-630 rapid-fire cannons and surface-to-air missiles. At the time, neither Cuba nor Russia acknowledged or explained the presence of the spy ship in Havana. According to media reports, the Leonov made additional trips to the island nation 30 miles from Florida in March and earlier this month. Officials with the U.S. Department of Defense suspect that since March, the Leonov and the Chiker have been part of an intelligence-gathering operation targeting the U.S. nuclear missile submarine base in Kings Bay, Georgia, as well as other key military installations on the East Coast, The Washington Free Beacon reported. Just like old times: Tourists in a old American car pass by Russian Vishnya class warship CCB-175 Viktor Leonov, docked, on February 26, 2014, at Havana harbor . Mystery: A Soviet-made Lada limousine passes by the Leonov, whose presence in Havana back in February was never acknowledged by Russia . The pair of Russian vessels also have been detected in the vicinity of the U.S. Naval Station in Mayport, Florida. According to a recent article in the Russian-language Armenian news outlet Iratvakan.com, the ocean-going tug Nikolay Chiker was also sighted earlier this month near the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. The sightings coincided with a large-scale Russian nuclear exercise involving 10,000 troops and 1,000 pieces of equipment, which took place between April 17 and April 19. The appearance of the Leonov and the Chiker in such close proximity to American shores comes at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Russia are extremely high due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.","Russian Vishnya-class Viktor Leonov has been operating beyond U.S. territorial waters near Kings Bay nuclear submarine base in Georgia .

"By . Mike Dawes . The boxing gloves worn by Muhammad Ali in his first ever professional defeat at the hands of arch-rival 'Smokin' Joe' Frazier have emerged for sale for £300,000. The gloves were used by the boxing hero when he took to the ring against Frazier in March 1971 in a bout billed as the 'Fight of the Century'. At the time, Frazier was the heavyweight world champion, a title that had been stripped from Ali four years previously after he was banned from boxing for refusing to enlist in the Vietnam draft. History: The gloves were used by the boxing hero when he took to the ring against Frazier in March 1971 . Memorable: Ali suffered his first professional defeat at the hands of Smokin Joe Frazier (left) After successfully fighting a five-year prison term handed down in 1967, Ali had been granted a license to box again in late 1970 and set his career back on track with easy wins against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena. The victories paved the way for his first fight against reigning champ Frazier, once a friend but now a bitter enemy. Ali viewed Frazier as the poster boy for the pro-Vietnam movement and the two exchanged increasingly barbed words in the run-up to the fight. Frazier was the most intimidating fighter at the time and the match, in New York's Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1971, was one of the most anticipated in the sport's history. The two boxers unleashed their animosity towards one another in the ring but it was Frazier who emerged on top and after Ali was floored in the 15th round the bout was awarded to Frazier. It was Ali's first ever professional . loss and set the stage for a thrilling rematch against Frazier in New . York in 1974 and the series decider, the Thrilla in Manilla, the . following year, both of which Ali won. Hefty: The gloves are expected to fetch more than £300,000 at auction . Following the 1971 fight Ali's gloves were cut off his wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012. The sweat-stained Everlast gloves, in good condition but with signs of discolouring where the tape was, were then purchased by a private collector. Experts have tipped them to fetch upwards of 300,000 pounds when they go under the hammer in the Heritage Auctions sale in Cleveland, Ohio. And they could challenge the current world record for boxing memorabilia set in February this year when a pair of Ali's gloves from his 1964 heavyweight victory against Sonny Liston sold for 540,000 pounds. Back then: New York's Madison Square Garden hosted the fight on March 8, 1971 . Included in the sale is a signed letter from Angelo Dundee confirming the provenance of the gloves. Chris Ivy, director of sports at Heritage, said: 'These gloves represent so much more than just a sporting moment in history. 'They were the tools of one of the greatest ever sportsmen but they also represent a pivotal point in Ali's career. 'Both he and Frazier were undefeated when they stepped into the ring together for their first fight in March 1971 so there was a lot riding on it and a lot of hype surrounding it. 'There were strong political overtones too - Frazier was seen as being part of the pro-Vietnam establishment while Ali had refused the draft due to his religious views. Safe keeping: The gloves remained with his trainer Angelo Dundee until his death in 2012 . 'All this sent people into a frenzy and led to an epic battle that lasted the full 15 rounds. 'Ali lost the fight but it laid the groundwork for two rematches which are now legendary. 'You can definitely tell the gloves have taken some punishment but they are in pretty good condition. 'There is every chance that the sale of these gloves could break the world record that was set last year - they are just as significant.' The auction will take place on July 31.","The gloves were used by the boxing hero when he took to the ring against Frazier in March 1971 .

"By . Tamara Cohen . The charity chief who defended six-figure salaries for executives at aid charities had his 60th birthday party paid for by donations. Sir Stephen Bubb held a £1,500 reception for 90 guests in the House of Lords, where guests enjoyed afternoon tea. But instead of footing the bill himself, Sir Stephen, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), got his employer to cover half the bill – £765 – despite the organisation being funded by charities. Controversial: The charity chief ,  Sir Stephen Bubb, who defended six-figure salaries for executives at aid charities had his 60th birthday party paid for by donations . A picture posted on his personal blog shows him posing in front of two pink birthday cakes. Another shows guests in the Cholmondeley room, the most sought-after as it gives access to the terrace and views across the Thames. Sir Stephen, who earns £100,000, wrote: ‘It seemed just right to celebrate my 60th with a tea party in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I even had a note from Ed Miliband to wish me well, though as he said “60; hard to believe it”. And a card from Tony and Cherie Blair. Tony’s nice note was rather touching “thanks for your fantastic contribution to the nation and its voluntary sector”.’ After the party on November 5 last year, guests went back to Sir Stephen’s London home for ‘champagne and fireworks’. He added that he was not retiring and would continue ‘challenging Government to do what is right and just’. Fancy: Sir Stephen held the reception in the House of Lords . The event, which must be booked by a member, is in the name of Labour peer Baroness Gould of Potternewton, a former trade unionist. The cost for afternoon tea is £17 per person – £1,530 for 90 guests. Charlie Elphicke, a Tory MP who site on the Public Administration Select Committee, said: ‘Spending charitable funds in this way seems highly inappropriate. These funds are donated to help people in need, not birthday bashes for the great and good.’ Fellow Conservative Priti Patel said: ‘Money held by charities should be used for charitable purposes, not for personal perks and parties.’ Earlier this week an investigation revealed a sharp rise in the number of executives on six-figure salaries at charities that distribute Britain’s foreign aid. Save The Children’s chief executive Justin Forsyth was paid £163,000 last year, Sir Nicholas Young of the British Red Cross earned £184,000 and Dame Barbara Stocking of Oxfam £119,560. While the head of the charity regulator William Shawcross said the revelations ‘risked bringing the charitable world into disrepute’, Sir Stephen hit back at him saying the focus on salaries was a ‘disgraceful distraction.’ In angry television and radio interviews, he said: ‘This simply isn’t an issue for donors. They are more concerned about the outcomes, the performance and the efficiency of these organisations.’ He said the earnings were ‘not excessive’ compared to those of bosses in the private and public sectors, and said the average charity chief executive was paid £58,000. An Acevo spokesman said yesterday: ‘As part of its ongoing work in building stakeholder relationships, Acevo invited its members, parliamentarians and cabinet ministers, national media and other key partners to an event at the House of Lords to mark the 60th birthday of Acevo’s long-standing chief executive. ‘The Acevo board approved these arrangements and covered half the cost. Sir Stephen also asked family and friends to the event, so he paid half the cost personally. The spokesman added: ‘This was a tea party, no alcohol was provided and Sir Stephen arranged his own birthday cake. It was an entirely fitting recognition of Sir Stephen’s outstanding contribution to the charity sector and a valuable contribution to Acevo’s work representing charities to Westminster.’","Sir Stephen Bubb held a £1,500 reception for 90 guests in House of Lords ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Couples will be able to marry at any time of the day or night in England and Wales from tomorrow. The round-the-clock ceremonies follow the lifting of a 176-year-old ban on getting hitched outside the hours of 8am-6pm . One of the first venues to embrace the Las Vegas-style weddings will be Blackpool Tower where couples can tie the knot at sunrise, midnight or even 3am. Wedding venue: One of the numerous 24-hour chapels in Las Vegas which caters for couples who want to get hitched in a hurry . Local authorities and churches will not be forced to conduct marriages outside the traditional hours and at least 15 days advance notice will also still be required. Wedding venue: Blackpool tower will hold ceremonies at sunrise and even midnight after the lifting of a 176-year ban . Venues for civil partnerships are also expected to conduct day and night weddings. Laws . which impose time limits on marriage solemnization date back to 1836 . and were introduced in order to prevent clandestine marriages, which . were deemed to be a particular problem in society at the time. The . change was brought in by the Home Office following a cross-government . survey, Your Freedom, which gave the public the chance to suggest which . unnecessary laws should be repealed. Kate Shane, general manager of Blackpool Tower is looking forward to ceremonies being held 380ft above the ground at the top of the tower. She told the Sunday Times: 'We are really excited about this change as it now means we can offer sunrise, sunset and even midnight weddings.' Registrar General for England & Wales, Sarah Rapson said she was 'pleased' at the relaxation of the wedding hours. She added:'Marriage and civil partnerships are something very personal to every couple that chooses to undertake them and this change will allow people to make their day unique to them.' Las Vegas has been the home of night-time weddings for decades and a favourite venue for celebrities to marry in haste and then regret their impulsive behaviour. Singer Britney Spears married her childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at 5am at the Little White wedding Chapel wearing jeans and a baseball cap. The marriage was annulled after lasting just 55 hours. Radio Two presenter Chris Evans married actress Billie Piper at the Little Church of the West in 2001. They were divorced in 2007. Bob Geldof and Paula Yates got hitched there in 1986 and divorced 10 years later. But actor Michael Caine and his wife Shakira  who married in a Vegas chapel in 1973, will soon celebrate the 40th wedding anniversary. Kelly Chandler, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners, welcomed the change, describing it as a 'positive move.' She told the Sunday Times: 'Wedding planning is so personal and individual and this change is just an extension of that, allowing people to make it that bit more unique to them.' The way they were: Chris Evans and Billie Piper married in a Vegas chapel . Over the years, celebrities have flocked to Las Vegas to marry because they can get hitched there in almost total secrecy. Marriage licenses are available seven days a week, including holidays and late at night, and there is no waiting period or blood test required. Stars who wed there included Joan Crawford, Kirk Douglas, Clint Eastwood, Jane Fonda,  George Hamilton, Rita Hayworth, Elvis Presley,  Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.

"By . Daniel Mills . Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he wishes Peter Greste was deported back to Australia before being jailed . Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has spoken out about how he wished jailed Australian journalist Peter Greste had been deported home instead of being tried because of the damage the case has caused the African nation. Greste and his two Al Jazeera colleagues were sentenced to between seven and 10 years for allegedly defaming Egypt and aiding banned Islamists. The verdict sparked international outcry and condemnation of the north African country, and now the president of the country, who man called to intervene on the ruling, has finally conceded it has had a 'negative' impact on Egypt. During a roundtable on Sunday, the president said the June 23 verdict has had a ""very negative effect"" on Egypt, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported . Egypt's mass circulation daily Al-Masry Al-Youm  quoted the president saying: 'I wish they were deported after their arrest, instead of being put on trial,' he said. Scroll down for video . Peter Greste, middle, was sentenced along with Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed for between seven to 10 years in jail . But despite his comments he has denied the Greste family and the Australian Government their wishes of a presidential pardon, saying local authorities 'will not interfere in judicial matters'. Humans rights groups and Governments from the US and Australia have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the jailing of Greste and the journalists. Washington described the sentencing as 'draconian' and called on Mr Sisi to release them, while the United Nations said imprisoning them was 'obscene'. Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said after the sentencing that the government was in shock. ‘We are deeply dismayed by the fact that a sentence has been imposed and we are appalled by the severity of it.' The family of Peter Greste, including his two brothers, have been in close contact with him. Greste and two other journalist - Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed - were arrested inside their office on December 29 . They have continually denied the accusations leveled against them, saying they were just doing their job. The family of Peter had previously said that appealing for a presidential pardon was one of the first things they would consider in the campaign to free him. But with that no longer a prospect, the Greste's must now decide whether to lodge an appeal with the same judiciary that convicted him .","Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the sentence has had a 'negative effect' on Egypt .

"By . Emily Crane . An Adelaide cigarette shop has come under fire from angry parents after it advertised a free in store face painting event for children. The face painting was on offer at the Smokemart & GiftBox store at West Lakes, north-west of Adelaide, on Saturday. Cancer Council SA say they fielded a number of complaints from 'shocked' parents before and after the event. The face painting was on offer at the Smokemart & GiftBox store at West Lakes, north-west of Adelaide, on Saturday . 'We received calls from concerned members of the public who were understandably shocked that children were being encouraged to visit a cigarette retailer through an in-store face painting promotion,' Dr Marion Eckert, Cancer Council SA's general manager of cancer control, told MailOnline. 'To entice children into a tobacconist on the basis of a fun activity like face painting, simply adds to the miscomprehension of the dangers of smoking.' The face painting event was organised as a fundraiser in conjunction with Westfield West Lakes to raise money for the Cora Barclay centre – a charity for deaf children. The advertised event was organised as a fundraiser in conjunction with Westfield West Lakes . A spokesman from the Smokemart store said he didn't agree that it was 'inappropriate' to hold an event for children at the cigarette shop, according to the Advertiser. Tony De Maria, from Peregrine Corporation which owns the Smokemart chain, told the newspaper they had been invited to take part and donated a few hundred dollars, which Westfield then matched. 'We sell many other products - all the cigarettes are against one wall and most of them are hidden by legislation (and) most of our shop is a gift shop,' Mr De Maria said. Cancer Council SA say they fielded a number of complaints from parents who were 'shocked that children were being encouraged to visit a cigarette retailer' He said the face painting was held outside the store, despite it being advertised online as an 'in store' event. The Cancer Council said around 90 percent of smokers start when they are teenagers and don't 'fully comprehend the consequences of taking up the habit'. 'Tobacco kills around 20 South Australians every week and it is entirely inappropriate to have children's promotions associated in any way with these deadly product,' Dr Eckert said.","Smokemart store at West Lakes advertised in store face painting for kids .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A man fed up with using girly-smelling soaps has designed his own range using 'manly' fragrances such as beer, soil and even cash. Adam Anderson  began creating his own concoctions in his kitchen after he realised most of the soaps available contain ingredients such as lavender or vanilla. He mixed together cocoa, palm oil, and glycerin with secret ingredients to replicate the . 'manly' aromas. Inventor Adam Anderson made the soaps after realising there were none with the manly aromas 'real men' would prefer, such as top soil and freshly cut grass . The products shun scents such as lavender and vanilla often used in male grooming products like facial moisturiser in favour of more 'manly' smells, such as beer or coffee . Other rustic fragrances in the product range are bonfire, coffee, red wine, freshly cut grass and cedar log cabin. The products shun floral scents used even in some male grooming products such as moisturiser in favour of more 'manly' smells. Mr Anderson, 27, from Nebraska in the U.S., . said: 'It all started a few months ago when I went to wash my hands and . noticed all the girly scented soaps we had around the house. Some of the other odours available include the waft of a bacon sandwich or the aroma of red wine . 'I thought to myself, ""this is not how a mans hands should be smelling"". 'Something needed to be done and that is when ManHands Soap started to come alive. Smelling the money:  Mr Anderson even made CASH scented soap . 'Before . that I had never made soap before but after a few weeks of research I . had produced my first batch of soap in my kitchen, which included 12 . different scents. 'I sat . back and thought about what were some of the worlds favorite smells? Things like bacon and fresh cut grass and even buttered popcorn. His home-made soaps have now developed into a set of 20 different bars which he began selling at art and craft shows. Word about the unique soaps spread quickly and they are now available in a variety of shops and online for £4.40. Mr Anderson added: 'Once . people became brave enough to smell the sample jars I had of each scent . they soon fell in love and couldn't believe how dead on the smells were. 'Even . though its called ManHands, these soaps aren't just for the male buyer, . lots of women enjoy some of the exact same scents as well.'

"By . Janet Tappin Coelho In Rio De Janeiro .

Chad Smith was forced to make a grovelling apology after the gesture, which has sparked outrage among some of the Rio club's 33 million fanatic followers. Flamengo, whose famous past players include Zico and Ronaldinho are known for their intense fans, called the 'Nação Rubro-Negra', which means the 'red and black nation'. They adopted the name because their number of supporters is greater than the population of some small countries. Scroll down for video . Not so hot: Smith first goaded Flamengo fans by holding the shirt aloft to cheers from the crowd . Bad idea: The drummer then decided to wipe the shirt on his backside as if it were toilet paper . Smith, who is currently on tour with the . American band, was at an event for fans in the Hard Rock Café in Belo . Horizonte the capital of the south eastern state of Minas Gerais, where the local football team are Flamengo's great rivals Curzeiro. He was conducting a drum clinic when a member of the crowd threw the black and white Flamengo shirt onto the stage to mixed reaction of boos and cheers. Smith decided to side with the local fans who were jeering and stuffed the jersey down the back of his jeans. The mood swiftly turns ugly with . deafening jeers as many react in disbelief to his actions. To make . matters worse, Smith then throws the t-shirt on to the floor. Ill-judged: The Chilis member even stuffed the shirt down the back of his jeans . Disregard: The musician's disrespect for the shirt has not gone down well with Flamengo fans .

(When you come here in Rio you will die!!!)' Smith received the same level of abuse on Facebook from Flamengo fans, so incensed by his actions they didn’t care that their profiles could easily be identified.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . BT Sport has sent shockwaves through the football world by outbidding Sky and ITV to secure exclusive rights to broadcast top European matches. The telecommunications giant has agreed a stunning £299million a season, three-year deal to show all 350 Champions League and Europa League games from 2015/16. It represents a staggering coup for the fledgling channel - which only launched in August this year - to have beaten off Sky, which has dominated the live football landscape in Britain for more two decades, while ITV has broadcast the Champions League since 1992. Mega deal: BT Sport has blown its rivals out of the water with a staggering £900m deal to show Champions League football . End of an era: ITV - originally with Bob Wilson anchoring the show - have shown the Champions League live since its creation in 1992 . It means that, for the first time, fans will have to pay to watch European matches, which have always been shown on terrestrial television. Although BT Sport says it will make a handful of matches available for free, including the finals of both competitions, supporters will have to buy BT broadband or pay a subscription to watch through their Sky box. Making some matches free will appeal to sponsors, which was ITV's main trumpcard in its relationship with Europe's football governing body, Uefa. Gavin Patterson, BT chief executive, said: 'I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League. 'Both tournaments are world class and firm favourites with many. The live rights will give a major boost to BT Sport and give people yet another reason to take our terrific service.' Overpriced: TV rivals Sky said the company has overpaid for the rights . The BT channels are also showing live FA Cup games and live football from the top leagues in Germany, Italy, France and Scotland plus the FA Women's Super League. Away from football, there will also be rugby union and women's tennis, plus MotoGP coverage from next year. Mr Patterson added: 'BT Sport has got off to a strong start with customers enjoying what we have to offer. We have attracted millions of customers by giving sport back to the fans, and we can assure people who want to catch all the action, that European football will be far more accessible and affordable with BT.' Sky, which is thought to have nearly matched BT's bid, said its rival had paid 'far in excess' of its own valuation for the rights to the European matches. A statement from Sky read: 'We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation. 'There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. 'Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering.'","Fledgling channel sends shockwaves through football world with deal .

Researchers have used modern day forensic science techniques to solve the millenia-old mystery of how Egyptian king Ramesses III was assassinated. Scans of the Pharoah's mummy have revealed a wide and deep wound in his neck which indicates that his throat was slashed with a sharp blade. The findings have finally shed light on Ramesses' harrowing final moments, over 3,000 years after his reign was brutally cut short. Until now, precisely how Ramesses III . died has long been hotly debated by Egyptologists. The second Pharaoh of . the 20th dynasty, he is believed to have ruled Egypt from 1186 to 1155 . BC. Papyrus trial documents . have shown that in 1155 BC members of Ramesses' harem made an attempt . on his life as part of a palace coup to change the line of succession. The . conspiracy was led by Tiye, the lesser of his two known wives, and her . son Prince Pentawere - but from the texts it was not clear whether the . plot was successful. Based . on the available documentary evidence, some researchers say it was, . while others have claimed he was merely injured and later died from his . wounds. To resolve the . dispute, a team of researchers conducted a forensic cold case review on . the mummies of Ramesses III and the unidentified remains of a younger . man buried nearby, believed to be Prince Pentawere. Led by Dr Albert Zink from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman of the European Academy of Bolzano/Bozen in Italy, the team undertook anthropological and forensic analyses of both bodies. Working out of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where the mummies are now kept, the team ran CT scans and DNA tests on the mummies to determine the cause of death and whether they were in fact related. Previously it had been speculated that Ramesses was killed in a manner that left no mark on his body. Among the conspirators were practitioners of magic, who might well have used poison. Others have suggested that a bite from a viper was the cause of the king's death, since his mummy was found with an amulet to protect him from snakes in the afterlife. Scroll down for video . An axial CT section image of the neck of Ramesses III: The stars indicate the margins of the 2.7in gash to his neck, while the arrow points to where embalming material has seeped into the wound . Scans of Ramesses III revealed a deep, 2.7in wound in his throat just beneath the larynx, probably caused by a sharp blade – and which could have caused immediate death, say the researchers. They write in the most recent issue of the British Medical Journal: 'The trachea was clearly cut and its proximal and distal ends were retracted and separated by about 30 mm. 'A small, focal cortical interruption at the anterior surface of vertebral body was visible, at the seventh cervical vertebra. 'Accordingly, all organs in this region (such as the trachea, oesophagus, and large blood vessels) were severed. 'The extent and depth of the wound indicated that it could have caused the immediate death of Ramesses III.' Ramesses III depicted in a relief from the Sanctuary of Khonsu Temple at Karnak . Ramesses . III, the second Pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty, is considered to be . the last great New Kingdom king to wield any substantial authority over . Egypt. His . 31-year reign, from 1186 to 1155BC, was beset by foreign invaders and . experienced the beginnings of increasing economic difficulties and . internal strife which would eventually lead to the collapse of the . Twentieth Dynasty . In . Year 8 of his reign, the Sea Peoples invaded Egypt by land and sea, but . were repelled in two great land and sea battles. He was also compelled . to fight invading Libyan tribesmen in two major campaigns in Egypt's . Western Delta in his Year 6 and Year 11. The . heavy cost of these battles slowly exhausted Egypt's treasury and . contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The . severity of these difficulties is stressed by the fact that the first . known labour strike in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of . Ramesses' reign. The . favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of . Set Maat her imenty Waset downed tools after cuts in food rations in . response to inflation of grain prices. The neck was covered by a collar of thick linen layers from the mummification process, which had prevented researchers from being able to examine this part before. Dr Zink told the BBC: 'Before now we knew more or less nothing about the destiny of Ramesses III. 'People had examined his body before and had done radiographs but they didn't notice any trauma. They did not have access to the CT scans that we do. 'We were very surprised by what we found. We still cannot be sure that the cut killed him, but we think it did.' A Horus eye amulet was also found inside the wound, which the researchers say was most probably inserted by the ancient Egyptian embalmers during the mummification process to promote healing in the afterlife. Analysis of the body of the younger man revealed an age of between 18 and 20 years, while DNA similarities between the pair revealed that he was probably Ramesses son. Documents from the time indicated that . Pentawere was involved in the harem conspiracy, was found guilty at . trial, and then took his own life. Neck region of the unknown man: Arrows point to skin folds and wrinkles under right mandible and neck region, indicating that this man, thought to be Ramesses' son Pentawere, was probably strangled . However, the researchers' analysis of the mummy found and inflated thorax and compressed skinfolds around the neck, suggesting that, if it is the corpse of Pentawere, he may have in fact been strangled. The body was not mummified in the usual way – and was covered with a 'ritually impure' goatskin - evidence for punishment in the form of a non-royal burial procedure. 'He was badly treated for a mummy,' said Dr Zink. DNA analysis revealed that the mummies share the same parental lineage, 'strongly suggesting that they were father and son', say the researchers. The authors believe that unknown man E 'is a good candidate for Pentawere.' However, they stress that the cause of death 'has to remain a matter of speculation.' In the end, the crown passed to the king's designated successor: his eldest son, Ramesses IV.","The Pharoah was assassinated in a palace coup in 1155BC, but the manner of his death was previously unknown .

"By . James  Nye . President Assad of Syria is committing systematic mass murder using his regime's 'Machinery of Death' resulting in atrocities not seen since the Holocaust claims the State Department's chief war crimes official. Nearly 30,000 photographs have been compiled as evidence of the Syrian government's torture, murder and starvation of 10,000 civilians in custody described as akin to genocide and the worst since the Nazis and Adolf Hitler. Stephen Rapp, the State Department's ambassador-at-large for War Crimes has seen the huge collection of photographic evidence smuggled out of Syria by an intelligence operative known only as 'Caesar' and told The Daily Beast he was shocked and appalled. Crimes against humanity: UN chemical weapons experts, wearing gas masks, holding a plastic bag containing samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus in this August 29, 2013 file photo . 'This is solid evidence of the kind of machinery of cruel death that we haven’t seen frankly since the Nazis,' he said. 'If it is as it appears thus far, we’re talking about more than 10,000 individuals being killed in custody over the period from 2011 to 2013, including largely men but also some very, very young men and boys and women… It’s shocking to me, as a prosecutor—I’m used to evidence not being so strong.' Accused: A new report being examined and verified by the State Department accuses President Assad of Syria of committing crimes against humanity . Rapp said that Assad regime is committing crimes against humanity and has called upon the Obama administration to take action against Syrian government forces. Another war crimes prosecutor told The Daily Beast that he believes the vast collection of photographs reveals indirect 'Russian government responsibility.' The shocking images were smuggled out of the country last year and emerged in January after a team of international war crimes prosecutors released their report. Compiled by noted international war crimes prosecutors David Crane, Desmond de Silva, and Geoffrey Nice it said there was 'clear  evidence, capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law, of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the Syrian government' that equalled war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lvrov has said that the report is not . conclusive and has asked for independent verification because it was . funded in part by the Qatari government. Meanwhile . Rapp said that the US government had nearly completed its own analysis . of the 28,000 photographs and preliminary findings show that not only . are they genuine but that they prove crimes against humanity. Hama, Syria --- People, affected by what activists say was a gas attack, receive treatment inside a makeshift hospital in Kfar Zeita village in the central province of Hama May 22, 2014 . 'Thus . far the indication is that it would be impossible to have fabricated . this kind of material, and having personally seen hundreds of the images . of twisted bodies with real wounds and real human beings of every shape . and size, this is not phony evidence,' he said according to The Daily . Beast. 'These . bodies were brought to one location from 24 other facilities, in which . they had been tortured to death in a variety of ways: ligature . strangulation, burning, bruising, starvation, evisceration, the most . horrendous things you can imagine.' Rapp admitted that since Assad was not attempting to kill one particular set of people that this is not technically genocide. However, Rapp told The Daily Beast that his crimes against humanity are so heinous that they fit past definitions of genocide. Rapp added that Assad is legally linked to the crimes because as head of the Syrian government and military he is in command and therefore is responsible. It is not clear when the State Department and President Obama will be willing to comment on their final review of the images. International war crimes scholar Cherif Bassiouni—who led the U.N. investigations into war crimes in Yugoslavia, Bahrain, and Libya, and helped create the International Criminal Court told The Daily Beast he sees the hand of Russia in some of the methods of torture. Allies: A handout picture made available by Syrian Arab news agency SANA shows Syrian president Bashar Assad (R) meets with Sergei Ryabkov (L), deputy Russian foreign minister in Damascus, Syria, 28 June 2014 . 'We see a pattern of systematicity and discipline in the taking of the pictures, the numbering of the persons, etc., which has never occurred before in the history of Syria. It has occurred in Russia,' he said. 'If I compare the cultural practices of the Syrian military in the past, their practice has always been to torture, kill, get rid of the bodies, get rid of the evidence. 'When you look at the practices of the USSR and the eastern European countries, everything is documented.' There is however no proof of direct Russian involvement. If the international community chooses to accept the recommendations of the report then there are three options for future prosecutions of Assad. The U.N. Security Council could again attempt to refer Assad to the International Criminal Court, or a special inquiry set up. Thirdly, if the revels win then Assad could be prosecuted within Syria itself. In Bassiouni’s view, the U.S. will have to act if the evidence is deemed overwhelming. 'It places a moral and legal burden on the United States. The moral burden is self-evident. 'There is a point,' Bassiouni added, 'when you just can’t look the other way.'","State Department is reviewing almost 30,000 photographs obtained secretly from Syrian prisons .

"By . Mark Duell . Police forces have spent more than £250,000 on art for their offices and stations over the last five years, it was claimed today. South Wales Police spent £75,000 on a lighthouse sculpture in Cardiff and Hampshire Constabulary put £48,000 towards sandblasting a floor design in Southampton, according to The Sun. It also claimed Cleveland Police spent £25,000 on photographs in Hartlepool and the Metropolitan Police forked out £13,000 on portraits of former commissioners Sir Paul Stephenson and Sir Ian Blair. Structure: Northumbria Police spent £50,000 in 2011 on a steel and glass sculpture outside its headquarters in Wallsend, North Tyneside - which it took delivery of on the day staff were told 450 jobs would go . The Mail revealed in 2010 how the London force had spent £9,000 on a taxpayer-funded portrait of Sir Ian, who posed clasping a glass bowl inscribed with the words 'Could have done better'. It was his armed officers who shot dead an innocent Brazilian, Jean Charles de Menezes, while under the impression he was a terrorist in 2005 at Stockwell Underground station in South-West London. It was then reported last year by The Times that the Met would spend £4,000 on the portrait of Sir Paul, who had been in charge for less than three years when he abruptly resigned in 2011. A spokesman said that was the best value it could get from an artist after the procurement process. Northumbria Police spent £50,000 in 2011 . on a steel and glass sculpture outside its headquarters in Wallsend, . North Tyneside - which it took delivery of on the day staff were told . 450 jobs would go. The structure, created by Newcastle-based . artist Cate Watkinson - which some observers said looked like a ball . bearing in a hula hoop - led the force to be accused of ‘crass . insensitivity’. But Northumbria Police Authority chair . Cllr Mick Henry told the Mail on Sunday at the time: ‘The cost is a . tiny proportion of the overall building costs. The artwork will give . pleasure to visitors to the local community.’ Expenditure: The Metropolitan Police forked out £13,000 on portraits of former commissioners Sir Paul Stephenson (left) and Sir Ian Blair (right) Other costs found in Freedom of Information requests made by The Sun from 2008 to 2013 took the total to more than £250,000. Eleanor . McGrath, campaign manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told MailOnline: . ‘It’s ludicrous that police chiefs spent so much taxpayers’ cash on . pieces of art. ‘Police stations are where officers are based and criminals are detained - they're not supposed to also act as a local Tate Modern. ‘At a time when budgets are tight, police chiefs should be spending taxpayers’ cash on fighting crime not buying abstract sculptures.’ Hampshire Constabulary and the Police Federation did not immediately return requests for comment when contacted by MailOnline today. A Cleveland Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'The decision to fund the public art was made by the then Police Authority in 2007 as part of the refurbishment of the police station. 'The artwork remains in situ at the station’s entrance and no other artwork has been funded since.' And Superintendent Danny Richards from South Wales Police said: ‘South Wales Police divisional headquarters in Cardiff opened in 2009 with 60 cells and state of the art facilities which have enabled more police officers to be on the streets for greater lengths of time. ‘It is a planning condition with new large public buildings that a percentage of the total cost of the project, usually around 1 per cent, is spent on a piece of art work. ‘The lighthouse, which cost 0.4 per cent of the total cost of the station, symbolises a point of safety and reflects the maritime history of Cardiff Bay.’","South Wales Police spends £75,000 on a lighthouse sculpture in Cardiff .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Syrian air force killed dozens of children at a school when they dropped a 'napalm-like' bomb, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. It was one of 56 incendiary weapon attacks carried out by President Bashir Assad's air force between November 2012 and September this year, the organisation said. It claims that 41 civilians were killed in the attacks and 71 wounded. Some 37 people were killed when a half-ton 'napalm' bomb was dropped on a school in Aleppo (pictured) Human Rights Watch is presenting the report to the Convention On Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva this week. Witnesses to the alleged school attack in August this year said a fighter jet had repeatedly flown overhead, as if searching for a target, before dropping the bomb. Most pupils had been preparing for exams inside the building near Aleppo, in the north west of the country. According to the report, seen by The Sunday Times, at least 38 people, including many children, were killed in the one attack. A further 44 were wounded by the bomb, which allegedly contained a chemical similar to napalm. A doctor, who treated the injured in a makeshift clinic, said: 'The strike hit the school not far from here. A convoy of U.N. weapons inspectors. A report by Human Rights Watch claims 56 incendiary weapons attacks were carried out by the Syrian air force between November 2012 and September this year . 'It was something similar to chemicals, maybe similar to napalm that causes big burns.' Mary Wareham of the arms division of Human Rights Watch said in the report that the bomb weighed 1,100lbs and contained a fuel similar to napalm. Bonnie Docherty, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told the newspaper: 'There is a great risk of long-term damage in terms of disfigurement. 'These are some of the worst injuries I've ever seen.' Napalm causes severe burns to skin, asphyxiation and death. It sticks to human skin and is incredibly difficult to remove. The use of incendiary weapons against civilians was banned in the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons Protocol. However, Syria has never signed up to the agreement.","Human Rights Watch: 'Air force conducted 56 incendiary weapon attacks'

"By . Sophie Borland . Professor Bruce Keogh's review is also expected to suggest that the number of A&E departments should not be reduced and in some cases may need to be made bigger . Paramedics will be urged to drop patients off at their GP or high street chemist rather than taking them to casualty, under NHS guidelines. Officials also want ambulance staff to treat less seriously-ill patients in their own homes and only bring them to hospital if necessary. This week the NHS’s medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will publish a major report setting out what needs to be improved in A&E units to avert a crisis this winter. Many departments are already struggling to cope with the combination of a steady rise in patients and drastic shortages of senior doctors. The numbers of patients turning up in A&E has soared by a third in the past decade, which has partly been blamed on a failure of GP out-of-hours services and an ageing population. At the same time, fewer doctors are wanting to specialise in ‘emergency’ medicine as it involves working out-of-hours. Senior doctors fear this winter may be one of the busiest yet with the numbers of patients rising further with the onset of the norovirus and flu. The report, to be published on Wednesday, is likely to urge paramedics to be more involved in diagnosing and treating patients rather than just ferrying them to hospital. Outlining his plans earlier this autumn, Sir Bruce said: ‘Historically ambulances have been about transporting people from one place to another. ‘Increasingly we’ve seen ambulances treating people in their own home, delivering clot-busting drugs, treating severe asthma, treating heart attacks and delivering the early stages of stroke treatment. ‘There is more that ambulances services and others can do in providing early treatment.’ He added ambulances could also be used to drop patients off at GP surgeries if they weren’t found to be seriously ill, at a chemist or at home. The report may also suggest A&E units start specialising in treating certain conditions or injuries – such as heart attacks and stroke or traffic accidents. An NHS report due to be published this week is expected to advise paramedics not to take as many patients to A&E . Officials believe that although patients would have to travel further to reach the most appropriate centre, they would receive a higher standard of treatment. Experts also expect the NHS will eventually have to reduce the number of A&Es in England to save money although this is unlikely to be announced this week. Only last week the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, urged patients to stockpile medicines and call NHS 111 rather than going to casualty. Dr Bernadette Garrihy, a senior member of the College and consultant at Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital, said: ‘We are getting ready for what may be our worst winter yet. ‘This, in the face of rising demand, is a real issue for us. We are concerned about providing a safe and quality service this winter. ‘People should look after themselves this winter. They should keep simple remedies in the house, they should try to talk to their GP if they can, they should use the 111 service and then only as a last resort, if any of these fail, access the emergency departments.’","Professor Bruce Keogh's review suggests taking most patients to hospitals does not always offer the best care .

"By . Chris Leadbeater . They are the fragments of the ancient world that have long been a bone of contention between Greece and Britain. And now the Parthenon Marbles have come under closer – and brighter focus – thanks to a clever technique that brings Athens’s revered past to life. The Acropolis Museum – the showpiece institution which displays many of the artefacts from the famous hill that has long been the heart of the Greek capital – has announced an ambitious idea that sees it ‘colour in’ some of its key exhibits through digital technology. Before and after: The museum is using 3D imagery to 'restore' the marbles to their original appearance . Panels from the Parthenon temple, which were once daubed in bright hues, have been ‘restored’ to their original condition via the use of 3D digital images. Stones from the celebrated structure’s west frieze – which show a procession of pilgrims paying tribute to Athena, the Greek goddess who gave her name to the city – have been ‘resurrected’ in this manner, with flowing capes and brandished weapons. The images have been 'scanned' onto the ancient stones to show them as they would have appeared some two-and-a-half millennia ago. Iconic: The Acropolis Museum (right) opened in 2009 as a showcase for the treasures of the Parthenon (left) The concept is part of the celebrations for the fifth anniversary of the museum’s launch. A striking structure of glass and concrete, the museum opened in June 2009 as a modern showcase for the treasures of the Acropolis – on whose southern slope it sits. ‘In the first five years of life, the Acropolis Museum has fulfilled our country’s high expectations,’ says Dimitros Pandermalis, the museum’s president. ‘New technologies are increasingly finding their place in the museum, and now offer essential tools to aid the understanding of the great exhibits.’ Landmark: Thanks to its lofty location, the Parthenon is visible from many corners of Athens . The museum has been regarded as a considerable success since it opened its doors, welcoming over 6.5 million people in its first half-decade – over 170,000 of them British. Its arrival has rekindled the debate about the fate of the Elgin Marbles – panels from the Parthenon which, notoriously, are currently on show at the British Museum in London. While the Acropolis Museum holds around half of the Great Panathenaia – the main frieze which circled the Parthenon, telling a single story about worship in the ancient city – the other half has been kept in London for over two centuries. Striking: A temple to the Greek goddess Athena, the Parthenon was constructed in the fifth century BC . The Marbles were removed from situ between 1801 and 1812 by the British collector of antiquities Lord Elgin – nominally for their protection at a time when Greece was occupied by Ottoman Turkey. However, the advent of the Acropolis Museum as a world-class facility on the doorsteps of the temple has amplified the calls for the Marbles to return home. ‘We comfortably welcome 3,000 visitors a day, and we are proud to have been recognised as being amongst the three best museums in the world,’ Mr Pandermalis adds. Blast from the past: The 're-colouring' of the friezes is part of the celebrations for the museum's fifth birthday . Long viewed as one of the finest remnants of the ancient era (although it was not considered one of the original ‘Seven Wonders of the World’), the Parthenon was constructed in the fifth century BC. It remains an Athenian landmark, visible from most corners of the city.","Parthenon marbles are 'restored' to their original condition using 3D trickery .

"By . Sean Poulter . Energy and water bills are set to rise faster than inflation and wages for the next 17 years, the National Audit Office warns today. It says major infrastructure projects, such as the switch to green energy, building nuclear power stations and new sewers, will cost the nation £310billion by 2030. Almost £208billion – 67 per cent of the total – will have to be funded by families through their bills, according to government plans. Energy and water bills are set to rise faster than inflation for the next 17 years, according to the NAO . In simple terms the huge  cost works out at an extra £8,000 per household – on top of what energy and water bills would normally be – over the next 17 years. The news will be  a punishing blow to millions  of families who continue to  suffer a cost of living squeeze despite improvements in the wider economy. The price of essentials such as heat, light, food, water and transport has risen faster than wages for at least the last five years causing real hardship. The research published today suggests this pain is set to continue until at least 2030. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee which oversees the work of the NAO, said there is a danger that bills will become ‘unmanageable’. She said: ‘Households up and down the country are already struggling to cope with rising water and energy costs. ‘I have serious concerns that government is taking decisions on infrastructure, banking on hard-pressed consumers to foot the bill, without knowing whether households will be able to afford to pay.’ The NAO warns that the Government and utility regulators have failed properly to calculate the impact of the huge infrastructure projects on bills. It states: ‘High levels of expected new investment in infrastructure mean that energy and water bills may rise significantly from current levels. ‘This is likely to hit those households with incomes in the lowest 10 per cent particularly hard. ‘The available projections suggest that increases in both energy and water bills will continue to outstrip inflation, on average, up to 2030. ‘This is particularly concerning, given that energy and water bills have increased significantly in recent years, while incomes have not.’ Ed Davey insisted the energy industry, rather than the Government, was to blame for higher bills . The head of the NAO, Amyas Morse, said too little attention has been paid to the impact of passing on the huge costs to consumers. A raft of green taxes and supplements are already being applied to energy bills to finance a shift from coal and gas to wind and nuclear power and so cut the nation’s carbon emissions. The NAO said the UK is  committed to increasing the proportion of energy it gets from renewable sources by 3.7 times by 2020 in order to meet EU targets. This same regime involves adding a supplement to all bills under the ECO scheme to raise money to provide free energy saving measures, such as loft insulation and efficient boilers, for the poor. The NAO says these supplements will add up to £221 a year extra on every household’s energy bills by 2030 in terms of today’s prices. Separately, water companies, most of which are now foreign owned, have been allowed to increase bills ahead of inflation to build new sewers, tackle leaks and meet EU requirements to clean up the effluent released into rivers and the sea. This is set to continue under a formula which allows price increases above the general rate of inflation on a five-year rolling pattern. Energy bills have risen by 44 per cent ahead of inflation and wages since 2002, while the cost of water has gone up by 21 per cent above incomes, according to the NAO. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey yesterday insisted the energy industry, rather than the Government, was to blame for higher bills. He said executives risk being put in the same category as greedy bankers. He told an energy supplier conference that profits ‘cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society’. He warned: ‘Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. ‘Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks.’ While Mr Davey has been keen to shift the blame for higher bills to energy firms, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has turned his fire on water companies. Last week, he wrote to all the major water suppliers asking them not to impose a series of inflation-busting increases in tariffs from next April. According to government plans, families will have to pay £208bn through bills to major projects . In fact, the increases have already been approved by industry regulator Ofwat under a long-running formula and it seems unlikely that firms will refuse to apply them. A government spokesman said: ‘Decades of underinvestment have left the UK struggling with insufficient energy infrastructure, but we are committed to fixing the failures of previous governments, and to making the difficult decisions that will allow us to have the infrastructure we need.’ However, a source said ministers are acutely aware of the impact of the costly levies  on families and indicated some of these would be rolled back in the Chancellor’s autumn statement. Energy industry leaders insist they are as unhappy about the taxes and supplements added to bills as customers. They have likened them to a poll tax and called for some to be shifted to general taxation. It is impossible to avoid the fact that energy prices are on the rise. But don't take it on the chin - make sure you do everything you can to cut your costs. The . simplest way to lower your energy bills is to switch to a cheaper provider.

"By . Richard Shears . Accident: Desiree Gill, the top Australian jockey who died after a fall from her horse . A top female jockey has died after a horror crash on an Australian track - the second woman rider to be killed in the country in two months. Premiership winning jockey Desiree Gill, a 45-year-old mother of two, received critical injuries when her mount, Celtic Ambition, clipped the heels of another horse and crashed to the ground on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. Miss Gill sustained a head injury when the horse catapulted her heavily into the turf and she died in hospital later. She had recently returned to racing 'better than ever' after receiving severe leg injuries five years ago. Only last week she rode the first four winners at Bundaberg, Queensland, on Melbourne Cup day and ran third in the only other race at the meeting. The shock death comes two months after Darwin's leading rider Simone Montgomerie died following a fall in August. Many thought that Miss Gill's decades-long riding career was over when she was seriously injured in the training accident in 2008, but she endured a lengthy rehabilitation and returned to the track to start winning again. 'It was an indication of her toughness,' said Mr Spencer Slatter, president of the Gympie Turf Club, the town that Miss Gill comes from. It was in Gympie in August that she was crowned the town's champion jockey for the year 2012-2013 following 27 wins, while husband Barry was champion trainer with 21 winners. 'She lived and breathed racing, arriving at the stables at 4am and she had a busy schedule that including tutoring younger riders, training horses and racing, Mr Slatter told the Brisbane Times. 'Racing was her whole life, from dawn till dusk. She put a lot into the industry and she loved it.' Simone Montgomerie, Darwin's leading rider, died following a fall in August . Miss Gill and her husband, said Mr Slatter, 'made a formidable team.' Her death, said Mr Darren Condon, boss of Racing Queensland, would have a serious impact on the racing community. Racing photographer Michael McInally recalled that many apprentices came to Miss Gill to learn. 'She was there to help them. She was a great person and will be very missed,' he said. 'The horse racing industry is such a tight-knit community so when someone loses their life, everyone feels it.'","Mother-of-two Desiree Gill died from a head injury following the fall .

Independent analysts said EDF customers will be paying an extra £52 a year, taking the average annual dual fuel bill up to £1,384. The French-owned firm’s decision to cap the increase means its new standard tariff is up to £107 cheaper a year than the likes of Npower, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power. The fact that it has been able to announce a lower price rise will increase suspicions that its rivals are guilty of profiteering. EDF said that just £1 of the latest rise can be blamed on a higher cost of wholesale gas and electricity. The rest relates to costs imposed by the government and regulators, most of which are associated with cutting energy use and carbon emissions in a switch to green energy. It said the price rise would have been £50 higher if it had factored in the rising cost of the government ECO scheme. This involves applying a supplement to all bills to finance free home energy efficiency measures – loft insulation, double glazing and efficient boilers – for the poor. EDF said that as the Prime Minister has signalled plans to shake-up this scheme, perhaps shifting the bill to general taxation, it has decided to hold off adding this to tariffs. Its chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said: ‘The best way to help customers is for us to keep our prices as low as possible. ‘I know that price rises are always unwelcome, but we have taken the first step to show what can be done if rising costs are tackled head-on.’ Mr de Rivaz said he supported schemes to make homes more energy efficient, but insisted the cost of the schemes needed to be cut. ‘Something can and must be done for consumers,’ he said. ‘Energy firms, politicians and consumer groups need to be part of the solution and stand on the side of customers to give them energy at an affordable price.’ While EDF was keen to claim credit for its lower price rise, the reality is that the company remains more expensive than a number of small independents. For example, Spark currently has a variable rate tariff charging an average of £1,116.41 a year, which is a saving of £268 versus EDF. For those looking for more certainty, First Utility has a fixed rate deal until June 2015 with a relatively low average bill of £1,178.48. E.ON UK, the only one of Britain’s big suppliers yet to increase prices for this winter, declined to comment on whether it was rising prices yesterday. It is reported to be planning a 6.6 per cent increase. EDF said that as the Prime Minister has signalled plans to shake-up this scheme, perhaps shifting the bill to general taxation, it has decided to hold off adding this to tariffs . Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, said he was ‘encouraged’ that EDF had kept its price rise much closer to the general rate of inflation than some of its competitors. He insisted the energy market is becoming more competitive and said people can make meaningful savings by shopping around. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd welcomed EDF’s lower price rise, saying: ‘Today’s announcement will make people question why other major suppliers have hit their customers so much harder.’ Tom Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Any winter price rise is a blow to consumers as it makes the struggle to afford to stay warm that little bit harder. ‘However, EDF Energy is to be applauded for the stance it is taking by factoring in the potential reduction on green levies into its calculations. ‘This means that customers will know upfront that they will benefit from any step the Government takes to reduce the impact of ‘hidden’ taxes on bills.  More importantly it also challenges the Government to put its money where its mouth is and to make good its pledges on affordability.’ Energy industry expert, Adam Scorer, director of Consumer Futures, said: ‘This is a smaller price rise because it comes with strings attached. It puts pressure on the Government to shift the burden of some policy costs from the bill to taxation.’","Analysts said EDF customers will be paying an extra £52 a year, taking average annual dual fuel bill to £1,384 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A powerful typhoon has pounded southern Japan as residents took refuge from destructive winds, towering waves and storm surges. Airports closed and residents were evacuated from low-lying areas and shorelines as Typhoon Neoguri was passing through the islands comprising the southern Okinawa prefecture. The storm has sustained winds of 108mph per hour and gusts up to 154mph, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Scroll down for video . From above: Typhoon Neoguri is seen from the International Space Station. The storm has sustained winds of 108mph per hour and gusts up to 154mph as it passed through the islands comprising the southern Okinawa prefecture . Approaching storm: This satellite image, from July 7, shows Typhoon Neoguri whirling towards the Japanese coast . Shaken: Ships were lashed to the shore for safety at Itoman, on the Okinawa island, in preparation for the violent weather formation to come . Collapse: This wooden building in Naha was knocked down by the storm's powerful winds . Shelter: . Officials in Japan have warned some 550,000 people at risk from the . typhoon to take shelter from its high wings and torrential rain . The storm is due to hit the main Okinawan city of Naha this evening. The national broadcaster said one woman had suffered a head injury due to the storm and one fisherman was missing after he was swept off a boat in seas near the southern island of Kyushu. The storm was at its most powerful when passing Okinawa, some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo today. But forecasters warned of heavy rains and potential flooding in Kyushu, the westernmost of Japan's main islands, as well as heavy rain in the rest of the nation as the storm turns east later in the week. More than 50,000 households in Okinawa lost power and an oil refinery halted operations. One Okinawa resident said the gusts are powerful enough to knock people off their feet. She said: 'When the wind blows most strongly, it's impossible to stand. You have to hold on to something.' 'The lights are fading in and out, like the house is haunted. The rain is getting stronger and falling sideways.' Ripped . apart: The streets of Naha, on the souther Okinawa Island, were strewn . with debris as tree branches were ripped apart by Typhoon Neogrui . Response: A Japanese fire engine takes position on an otherwise abandoned street at Itoman, Okinawa . Television footage showed a collapsed roof of a shopping arcade, street lights rocking in high winds and branches being blown down largely deserted streets. Officials said the storm could be one of the strongest to hit Japan in decades, generating waves up to 46 feet high. But since typhoons track along Japan's coasts and occasionally veer onshore every summer, the country is relatively well prepared. 'Please take refuge as early as possible,' said Keiji Furuya, chairman of the National Public Safety Commission. The meteorological agency issued special warnings for violent winds, heavy rain and storm surges. The storm was moving slowly and diminishing in intensity, but its wide area and slow movement could add to the potential damage, weather forecasters said. Evacuation advisories were issued for some 500,000 people, and about 500 sought refuge in Naha's city hall, NHK reported. Government leaders held an emergency meeting yesterday, urging local governments and residents to take maximum precautions. Authorities in China and Taiwan also warned ships to stay clear of the storm. Approach: Huge waves are seen battering the coast of Korea, as the storm veers round towards the southern-most island of Japan . Dangerous: A man can be seen taking a swim ahead of the dangerous storm. It emerged today that one man had been swept out to sea by the after being knocked off of his boat . Rough . seas: The Yuhzan Maru, a Japanese fishing boat, is tossed by strong . waves as the typhoon passes over Itoman, on the island of Okinawa . Forecasts show the storm tracking towards Kyushu island and then across Japan's main island of Honshu. It is forecast to lose more of its power over land, but much of the damage from such storms comes from downpours that cause landslides and flooding. Such risks are elevated by the storm's timing, at the tail end of Japan's summer rainy season. The Philippines, which suffered the strongest typhoon to ever hit land when Haiyan struck six months ago, was spared the ferocious winds of Neoguri. The storm did not make land fall and remained about 480 kilometres (300 miles) east of the northern-most province of Batanes, when it roared past on Sunday. The typhoon did intensify the country's south-west monsoon, dumping heavy rains on some western Philippine provinces.","Storm landed today on southern islands of Okinawa prefecture .

"By . Emma Lowe . With a public execution, a violent beating and frenzied animals, it hardly sounds like ideal entertainment for children. But film censors appear to think otherwise – granting The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a 12A rating, which means it can be seen by under-12s if they are with an adult. Yesterday, critics attacked those behind the film for glamorising violence and exposing the young target audience to ‘unnecessarily graphic’ scenes. Set in a futuristic North America, the film is the second adaptation taken from the phenomenally successful Hunger Games book trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Fight to the death: Katniss Everdeen returns to the arena to fight before facing a jungle of horrors . Bloodied: Viewers see a man's back as he is whipped and flogged. Later, an elderly man is publicly executed . Starring 23-year-old Jennifer Lawrence, it explores life under a totalitarian government which annually requires a young ‘tribute’ from each district of the country to compete in a televised ‘hunger game’ – in which each competitor must try to kill off their rivals. In one scene viewers witness a man being flogged and whipped by soldiers and are shown his wounded and bloodied back. Later, an elderly man is clubbed by two soldiers and publicly executed by a gunshot to the head. The first Hunger Games film, released in March 2012, grossed £5million in the UK in its opening weekend, twice as much as the opening instalment of another teenage favourite, the Twilight Saga. Hunter: Jennifer Lawrence plays a fragrant, rather lovely killer. But a killer nonetheless in Catching Fire . Weapons: 23-year-old Jennifer Lawrence stars in the film which is graphic, violent, and often realistic . Popular: The film had more viewers in its first weekend than Twilight - grossing £5million in the UK . Yesterday Vivienne Pattison, of lobby group Mediawatch, accused producers of deliberately opening up the new film to children – regardless of the consequences the violent scenes will have on them – to generate box office sales. She also claimed the flexible rating failed to protect youngsters. Miss Pattison said: ‘The problem with this particular film is that it originates from a book designed for children. Success: The blockbuster has made Miss Lawrence a household name. But critics blast the appeal to children . ‘And there is a very big difference between reading a gory image on the page than burning it into the retinas of young children watching it on the big screen in the cinema. ‘Although the rating suggests there may be some adult scenes there is still little guidance, and there is nothing in place to stop parents or guardians from taking children as young as six or seven to the cinema to see the film. ‘The story environment at times is quite realistic and therefore the horrific violence is glamorised. 'In a society in which children are exposed to so much violence and adult imagery we should be working to protect youngsters from further exposure in films and games. We don’t need to terrify children to entertain them.’ Prior to the release of the first Hunger Games film, edits were made in order to achieve a 12A rating in the UK. Later the same year, a DVD was released of the international version, which restored the cut material but carried a 15 classification – warning of strong violence and threat. Yet despite sharing the same themes, the  sequel, which will be out in the UK on November 21, passed uncut through the British Board of Film Classification with a 12A rating. The BBFC report states the film contains ‘moderate violence and threat and infrequent strong language’. Pippa Smith of the Safer Media campaign said: ‘The film industry puts too much responsibility on parents. It isn’t fair they should have to make the decision whether they take their child or not when the guidelines are so vague. Classification on films needs to be much stricter.’ But a BBFC spokesman encouraged parents to check their website for guidance before taking their children to the cinema, adding: ‘We consider the content of 12A rated films to be suitable for children aged 12 and over, and we would not recommend taking very young children to see them, though an adult may take a younger child if, in their judgement, the film is suitable for that particular child.’","Viewers witness a man being whipped by soldiers and a public execution .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This fierce bear shows its more relaxed and calm side by having a lazy day as it sleeps on a beach. She twists and turns on her back and struggles to get comfortable before nodding off during the day. The 18-month-old female brown bear even covers her eyes with her giant paw before enjoying a nap.

At one point, the giant bear strikes a Usain Bolt-like pose as she lies on her back while pointing her right arm in the air. She also stares into the camera lens when she was just 50ft away from the photographer. Professional photographer Olav Thokle from Volda, Norway, travelled to the Lake Clark National Park to take pictures of the bears. The 46-year-old said: 'Me and a friend went to Alaska for a nature and landscape photography trip. Striking a pose: The bear stares into the camera lens when she was just 50ft away from the photographer . Dreamer: The bear is fast asleep and blissfully unaware that it is having its photograph taken . 'The main purpose for this was to try to spot brown bears as Lake Clark National, Alaska, is one of the best places in the world to do this.' Mr Thokle managed to find 14 individual bears walking around on the beach that day. He added: 'Some of the bears slept nearly all day, especially the female who is pictured. 'She looked quite young, and had no cubs, so she could think only of herself. 'It looked like she had a really good time sleeping on the beach for several hours. Don't wake me up: The bear begins to stir after having her little nap . Back to bed: The beautiful photographs were taken by Olav Thokle from Norway . 'She sometimes opened her eyes to have a quick look before falling asleep again.' The only way to get to Chinitna Bay - a famous home for brown bears - is to travel by plane. Mr Thokle added: 'We rented a small airplane, and a professional bear guide. After a one hour flight we landed on the beach on Chinitna Bay. 'From the air we could spot some bears on the beach, and then we knew that this would be a very special experience. 'The guide warned us: ""Never run! It's like a dog and a ball. The ball never wins!"" 'We tried to keep a distance of at least 50 feet, but a few bears came closer.'","The bear twists and turns as she struggles to get comfortable .

"By . Dan Bloom . If you go down to the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise. At least, you are if you're this mother black bear - whose mischievous cub played a trick on her by hiding behind a tree trunk. Photographer Ken Archer, 51, captured the magical moment between mother and baby in the Rocky Mountains of western Wyoming. I'm bear-hind you: The black bear cub hid out of the way of its mother's gaze in Wyoming's Rocky Mountains. There are thought to be at least 600,000 black bears in North America, spread across mostly the north of the U.S. and Canada. They eat plants, fruits, nuts and insects but will also kill salmon and occasionally young deer . Mr Archer, from Washington said: 'I was surprised when the cubs descended from the top of the large pine tree to see what their mother was up to. 'I was ecstatic to capture the curious expression of this cub peering around the trunk of the tree at its mother. 'This photo turned out to be my favorite photo of the trip. 'Much . of my time was spent patiently watching them rest in thick foliage, . eagerly waiting for them to come out into the open and be active. 'I . used camouflaged clothing to help blend myself into the environment, . but I also used a super telephoto camera lens to keep me at a distance . comfortable for the bears and safe for me.' Playful: The mother bear's two cubs were pictured clambering up a tree to play as she remained on the ground, scratching herself on a tree trunk. Black bear cubs remain with their mother for about a year after they stop being weaned. They are formidable climbers, with the natural advantage of their short, non-retractable claws . There are an estimated 600,000 black bears in North America, the largest of which have been known to weigh 600lbs. They most commonly eat plants, insects, fruits, nuts and honey, but also kill salmon as they swim upstream to spawn, and occasionally kill and eat baby deer or moose calves. During hibernation, they can live for more than six months without food. The bears tend to roam and forage for food alone - with the exception of mothers when they are raising cubs. Females have up to six cubs, with two the norm, and they continue caring for their young for a year after they stop being weaned from their mother's teat. The bears are intelligent with colour vision and can run at up to 35mph, but typically they are shy and easily frightened. Attacks on humans are rare and said to be less likely than being killed by a bee sting.

"By . Hugo Gye . Regulators have been accused of not doing enough to curb payday lenders after new rules were unveiled which did not include a ban on advertising or a cap on sky-high interest rates. Lenders will have to ensure that only borrowers who can afford to repay their debts, and will only be allowed to roll over loans twice, the Financial Conduct Authority announced today. The FCA also plans to restrict the number of recurring payments payday firms are allowed to collect following complaints that they are unexpectedly draining borrowers' bank accounts. But MPs and campaigners complained that lenders would be 'happy' to hear of the new rules, claiming they do not represent a fundamental challenge to the controversial industry. Crackdown: Payday lenders will have to check their customers are credit-worthy under new rules . The proposed rules will come into effect next April, when the regulator begins overseeing the consumer credit market, including payday lenders. There had been speculation that the FCA might ban such lenders from advertising their products, but instead it will have enhanced powers to ban misleading ads. Payday firms have become increasingly controversial thanks to the rise of online lender Wonga, which the Archbishop of Canterbury vowed to 'compete out of existence'. Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned against payday loans, said she would not be declaring victory and suggested that the public would be 'horrified to hear just how happy the legal loan shark industry is'. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'If we don't act now to change this, I'm convinced this is going to be the next PPI scandal. 'People aren't borrowing for luxury. It's not that they have options, it's that people need to pay their rent. I think we have to look at how we make sure people access affordable credit. The evidence for other countries is that capping does work.' Controversy: Firms like Wonga have been thrust into the spotlight over the past few months . Unite general secretary Len McCluskey . criticised the Government's 'shameful failure to act swiftly' and . called for a cap to be placed on the interest rates that payday lenders . can charge. 'These . measures are too little too late and will do nothing to stop people . falling prey to shady parasitic practices of payday lenders over the . coming months,' he said. 'They tinker at the margins and do nothing to address the reasons people fall into hardship and the clutches of payday lenders.' FCA . chief executive Martin Wheatley said: 'We believe that payday lending . has a place - many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt . without a hitch, so we don’t want to stop that happening. 'But . this type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it . and payday lenders must not be allowed to drain money from a borrower’s . account. That is why we’re imposing tighter affordability checks, and . limiting the use of rollovers and continuous payment authorities. 'Today . I’m putting payday lenders on notice: tougher regulation is coming and I . expect them all to make changes so that consumers get a fair outcome. The clock is ticking.' Outrage: MP Stella Creasy, left, and union boss Len McCluskey, right, spoke out against the new regime . The FCA will take responsibility for regulating more than 50,000 companies in the UK which offer credit to individuals. The new rules are subject to consultation for the next two months, and a final version will be published in February. While some of the rules, such as toughter affordability checks, apply to all lenders, some regulations are specific to the payday loan industry because of its 'higher-risk business'. For example, borrowers will only be allowed to 'roll over' their loans twice, and any who do so will be told how to get free advice on managing their debts. Under the FCA's proposals, payday . firms will only be able to make two attempts to use a type of recurring . payment called a continuous payment authority (CPA) to have a loan paid . off. The Office of Fair . Trading, recently carried out an investigation into payday loans, . finding 'deep-rooted' problems in the £2billion sector. It . said some firms' business models appear to be based around people who . cannot afford to pay their loan back, meaning they are forced to roll . their loan over, the original cost balloons and they become effectively . trapped with their lender. Checks: Payday lenders will have to ensure that they have investigated the finances of all borrowers . Consumer campaigners welcomed the plans but questioned why stronger action has not come sooner. Martin . Lewis, founder of consumer help website MoneySavingExpert.com, said: . 'Parasitical payday lenders have taken over our high streets in the last . five years. Our lax rules have made the UK a crock of gold and they've . flooded in from across the world. 'For those of us who've been crying out for a crackdown, this hardcore regulation, while not perfect, is very welcome. 'Yet . the Government should be shamefaced it's taken this long and even now . it'll be next year before the FCA has the authority to make this work.' Richard Lloyd, executive director of . Which?, said: 'Our research shows millions of people are increasingly . reliant on high cost loans to pay for essentials or to repay other . debts, so it's good to see the Financial Conduct Authority planning to . take tough action to clean up credit. 'We . welcome proposals to tackle unscrupulous payday lenders but we want the . regulator to go further and use its full powers to clamp down on . problems faced by struggling consumers across the credit market, like . sky-high penalty charges.' Opposition: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has spoken out against payday lenders . Mr Wheatley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the plans will put a stop to some consumers being able to get the green light for a loan in around 10 minutes. He said: 'The fact you can get a loan in 10 minutes means the person lending to you isn't really doing the proper affordability checking. 'It will be a lengthier process and arguably 10 minutes to get money for people who may not have the ability to repay is too short in any case. 'So certainly it will be a more complex process than exists today but it should mean you are not pushing people into a spiral of debt, which is what we want to avoid.' Mr Wheatley said a cap on the total cost of credit is also being looked at. He said: 'We haven't got enough data today to work out whether that would be proportionate or where to place the cap. 'There is a place for lending in society. It's not that we want to remove it entirely. What we want to do is to prevent the social damage it is creating for those people who really can't afford the loans.' The FCA also said that the fledgling peer-to-peer lending market, which involves websites matching people who want to invest some cash with borrowers, must explain the key risks of a loan before an agreement is made and assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. It said that a 14-day cooling-off period should allow the borrower to withdraw if they change their mind. Russell Hamblin Boone, of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents the interests of major payday loan businesses, said a cap on interest would lead to more people turning to illegal lenders. He said proper checks of customers to make sure they can pay back loans are in place and can be done quickly, similar to any kind of credit product. He added there has been a cap preventing people from rolling over their loans more than three times. On a potential interest limit, Mr Hamblin Boone told Today: 'I think you look around globally at other markets and see what's happened, France and Germany for example - three times more people being driven to illegal lending. 'Australia has just introduced one and they've seen a growth in the illegal lending market.' Earlier this year, Archbishop Justin Welby announced plans to support a new network of credit unions to compete with payday lenders, attacking firms like Wonga for their sky-high rates of interest. However, Wonga, which offers small loans via the internet, says its services are only meant for short-term borrowers and insists it represents a responsible alternative to High Street lenders. One in five payday loan customers say they were not asked about their finances when they first borrowed money, it emerged today. Nearly a quarter of consumers surveyed for new Government research said they had been put under pressure to extend their loan, despite rules agreed by the payday lending industry last year. While nearly all customers felt they understood the costs of taking out the initial loan, more than half said the costs of extending the debt was not explained properly. Lenders signed up to new codes last year which promised to improve the affordability checks they carried out and give better support to those who were struggling to pay their loans back. But the research found that nearly three quarters of consumers felt they were not dealt with sympathetically when in financial difficulty, and just 14 per cent had been told about free sources of debt advice. Consumer minister Jo Swinson said: 'This research shows that the industry has failed to self-regulate effectively.'","Financial Conduct Authority sets out new regulations for payday lenders .

However, Mr Banas said there is 'no evidence linking him to any terror act'. His arrest comes more than a week after he tweeted on social media he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers of the Islamic State - which is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. 'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter. Two days earlier, he tweeted: 'Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel.' Al-Hamdulillah means 'Thanks and Praise to God' in Arabic, Insha'Allah translates to 'God-willing', Ash-Sham refers to the Levant and the term du'a is used for the word 'prayers'. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the arrest of the 29-year-old but will neither confirm nor deny whether they are conducting their own investigation. 'The AFP is aware that Philippine authorities have taken action in relation to Musa Cerantonio, which may result in his return to Australia,' the AFP said in a statement. A federal government spokeswoman said she was aware Cerantonio had been detained but would not comment further. The Philippines has a large Muslim minority in the southern region of Mindanao, a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency and where Islamic militants linked to al-Qaeda also operate. Head bowed, the Islamic State member was found in the southern region of Mindanao - a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency . Just over a week ago, Cerantonio tweeted he was in the Middle East . He is one of Islamic State's most prolific extremists with more than 6,000 followers on Twitter . Police said they had been monitoring Cerantonio's activities since February when he arrived in Cebu, the country's largest metropolis outside Manila. 'We cannot say with certainty that he had any contact with local Muslim groups,' Supt Capa said, adding the Australian had been living with a Filipino woman and moving periodically around Cebu until his arrest at a one-room apartment near the airport. The 32-year-old woman was wanted by police over an unrelated fraud case and was also arrested on Friday, he added. A police intelligence officer involved in the operation said Cerantonio had been in Mindanao, though there was no indication he had tried to recruit Filipinos or been in contact with Islamic militants in the area. 'This person... has a website and he propagates extreme teachings and advocates jihad and calling on Muslim brothers to go to Syria and Iraq to fight together with the ISIS,' the official said, referring to the Islamic State militants who have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and in neighbouring Iraq. Cerantonio, a Melbourne native, 'is a convert from Christianity', the intelligence officer said. Cerantonio is expected to be deported back to Australia . 'Sometimes he mentions the Philippine government (on his website), but does not call for violence' against it, the officer added, adding that the Australian has 'no overt following' in the Philippines. Supt Capa said Cerantonio was arrested at an apartment near Cebu's airport, where he and the woman lived in one room, and that the woman bought food and other supplies for him. Television footage aired by the ABS-CBN network showed a bearded Caucasian man in a white robe being ushered out of an apartment by officers wearing helmets and flak jackets. A report in The Australian newspaper in June described Cerantonio as a preacher and 'one of (the Islamic State's) most influential propagandists', and that Australian police were planning to move against him. The newspaper said Cerantonio called for the assassination of Western leaders in a Facebook post in December, and that a study had found one in four foreign fighters in Syria followed his Twitter account. Recently, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commented that the government will do everything it can to ensure Australians don't become radicalised overseas and bring their extremist views back home. Ms Bishop refused to comment specifically about Cerantonio to avoid jeopardising the work of Philippine authorities, but she said reports of Australian citizens getting involved with radicals and fighting overseas were disturbing. 'We are determined to ensure that Australians do not leave this country to take up fighting in another country, become radicalised and then return to Australia with these new skills and extremist outlooks,' she told reporters in Brisbane. 'We are taking every step we can to ensure that Australians are kept safe.'","Cerantonio was born in Melbourne and was arrested on Friday .

Venice is made up of a group of 118 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges. The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. It was an important centre of commerce and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. People can now explore the ‘panoramic imagery of one of the most romantic spots in the world,’ according to Google, by selecting a mode of transport on the website. They can walk the streets by foot, travel by Gondola (or Google's small boat) to get a view of the city from the water or choose to cruise the Grand Canal and lagoon by Vaporetto - a larger type of boat.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Barack Obama may have lost a few approval rating points with this move. The president was seen cutting the line at Austin's Franklin Barbecue Thursday afternoon, while in town to raise money for the Democratic Party. Lives at the eatery are infamously long, and have been known to stretch as long as three hours wait.But Mr Obama did no waiting today, as he showed up at the restaurant, shook a few hands and made his way straight to the register to order more than $300 worth of meat. 'I know this is a long line. I feel real bad, but – I’m gonna cut'  Obama said. Scroll down for video . Line skipper! President Obama went straight to the resister at Franklin Barbecue today - a restaurant that notoriously enforces it's no line-cutting rule . Don't go hungry: Lines at the famous Austin eatery can last as long as three hours . Sorry! Mr Obama offered to pay for the meal of the father and daughter customers directly in front of him . Even restaurant owner Aaron Franklin said the move was unheard of. 'That's out thing, no one skips the line...except Obama,' Mr Franklin told the Statesman. Mr Franklin and his daughter took a picture with the president, who he said 'seems like a nice dude'. And to the president's credit, he did pay for the order of a local father and daughter who were directly in front of him. While the restaurant seemed more focused on getting to see the president than they were on the fact that he cut them in line, others on Twitter were not as enthused about the president's line manners. 'No, no, no President Obama, You wait in line for 3 hours at Franklin's BBQ like everyone else!' a user named Kelly wrote. Mr Obama ordered some $300 dollars worth of barbecue - not including the order he offered to pay for - carrying out 'eight pounds of brisket, ribs, sausage and turkey' to feed the legions on Air Force One. When he was paying for his order, the president first brought out a sad was of $1 dollar bills, before flashing his black JP Morgan card for the cameras. The president would leave Texas with out . giving in to demands from Texas lawmakers and from around the state to . visit the border, where a child migrant crisis is unfolding and instead . said his critics should get behind his request for $3.7 billion if they . want to solve the problem.

Presidential digits: President Obama brazenly flashed his credit card Thursday during a dinner stop for Texas barbecue as he prepared to leave Austin . Obama aides Dan Pfeiffer and Bobby Schmuck carry Obama's order from Franklin Barbecue, where he bought eight pounds of brisket and other Texas treats . 'Are folks more interested in politics or are they more interested in solving the problem,' Obama said he told Perry. 'If they are interested in solving the problem then this can be solved. If the preference is for politics then it won’t be solved.' Obama visited Texas for the first time since the influx of child migrants from Central America overwhelmed border resources. He had talks with Perry aboard his Marine One helicopter and in a group meeting with local officials that Obama called constructive. In a brief news conference after the meeting, Obama dismissed criticism from Perry, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, that he should personally visit the border region for a first-hand look. Ridicule: President Obama ridiculed congressional Republicans on Thursday in Austin, accusing them of doing little more than opposing his agenda in a campaign-style rally with less than four months remaining before midterm elections . 'This isn’t theater. This is a problem. I’m not interested in photo ops. I’m interested in solving a problem,' he said. The president, on a three-day trip out of Washington, is spending much time raising money for Democratic congressional candidates, leading to criticism that he should spend some time visiting the border. Obama said he is getting plenty of information from top advisers who are visiting the area. 'There’s nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on,' he said. Obama is battling political pressure from supporters and opponents alike to halt a growing humanitarian crisis along the Texas border with Mexico.

"By . Tamara Cohen . A controversial scheme to give new mothers vouchers to breastfeed will not be rolled out nationwide, Nick Clegg said today. A pilot study in Sheffield, his home city, will see mothers receive £200 in shopping vouchers if they feed their babies breast milk for up to six months. But the Deputy Prime Minister insisted it is not going to become government policy to pay people to breastfeed. Shelved: Poundland vouchers are being given to some new mothers to persuade them to breastfeed, bu it will not be rolled out nationally . A feasibility study has begun aimed at increasing rates of breastfeeding in an area where it is very low, and it was suggested if successful it could be rolled out nationwide. Critics rounded on the scheme saying money was not the way to increase take-up of breastfeeding, and the scheme would penalise women who were unable to do so. But Mr Clegg said on his weekly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3 said: ‘It’s not going to be Government policy to say we’re going to pay people.’ Mr Clegg added: ‘We’re not going to start paying people for that. But I do want to do everything we can in Government to change the environment such that all women who want to breastfeed feel that they are supported and that they are free to do so. Women who can’t or don’t want to are of course free to take that choice.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the idea of paying people to breastfeed was not government policy . While he said it was not something government should pay for, he added: ‘But am I going to say the academics and others who are looking into this somehow should stop doing that study? No’. He was asked by a caller what he thought of the pilot, unveiled by academics at Sheffield University earlier this week, and also about evidence for the health benefits of breastfeeding. One recent study estimated that breastfeeding saves the National Health Service at least £40million a year by preventing respiratory and gastrointestinal problems and reducing breast cancer. Mr Clegg told the caller, Sonia: ‘I hadn’t heard that figure that if you could get more mums breastfeeding that would make a massive saving for the NHS, probably be good for their sons and daughters too. ‘But I have to stress there are some women who can’t breastfeed and they shouldn’t feel in any way guilty about that. ‘It’s all about making their choices available to them. If you can and if you want to you should feel free and empowered and happy to do so.’ But he said the topic did need to be addressed, adding: ‘This is a research study about what to do with those mothers who are the hardest to reach, who are the hardest to persuade, to take that step of breastfeeding in the first place. ‘Compared to other countries, we have lower rates of breastfeeding and the health effects on children do suggest breastfeeding can be very helpful’. Around 130 mothers in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, including his Sheffield Hallam constituency will get shopping vouchers for Matalan, John Lewis, Mothercare or supermarkets worth £120 if their babies receive breast milk until they are six weeks old, and a further £80 if their babies are still breastfed at six months. The initiative will not be rigorously policed and will simply require the participating mother and their health visitor or midwife to sign off to say they are breastfeeding. Formula: Research reveals 34 per cent of British women feed their babies milk formula for the first six months . The Department of Health is funding the project but health minister Dr Dan Poulter stressed that he did not believe ‘financial incentives’ were the best way to encourage mothers to do it. Dr Clare Relton, senior research fellow at the University of Sheffield said only 34pc of UK babies are breastfed at six month months, and only 1pc breastfed exclusively at that stage. She said: ‘Breast milk is perfectly designed for babies and provides all they need for the first six months of their life. ‘The scheme offers vouchers to mothers who breastfeed as a way of acknowledging both the value of breastfeeding to babies, mothers and society, and the effort involved in breastfeeding.","Deputy Prime Minister insists vouchers will not be rolled out nationwide .

"By . Emma Innes . Most people would panic and seek immediate medical help if they found an insect living in their body. But not one German Ph.D. student, who was so fascinated by the flea inhabiting her foot that she left it there for two months. Marlene Thielecke, a student at Berlin’s Charité University Medicine, decided to study the creature after she discovered it in her foot. A German researcher found a sand flea (pictured) living inside her foot and decided to keep it there for two months while she studied it . While it was there, she took regular photos and videos of it, the website Geeko System reports. Ms Thielecke’s job at the university involves carrying out research into ways to prevent tungiasis – a skin disease caused by infection with a female flea – in Madagascar. These sand fleas burrow into the skin of their host where they live and breed. They cause the human host to suffer pain and itching and the site of the infestation often becomes infected. The only cure is to dig the fleas out of the skin. Last month it was reported that an American biologist, Dr Jonathan Allen, had lived with a parasitic worm in his mouth for three months (pictured) Ms Thielecke says that after two . months she became ‘uneasy’ about the experiment as her foot was itchy . and painful and she was struggling to walk. As a result, she decided the time had come to remove the flea. Despite the termination of her experiment, she made an interesting discovery – she found that the fleas most likely mate while inside their human hosts as she only had one flea living inside her foot and it neither laid eggs nor died. As a result, she believes it lived in a ‘waiting state’ in anticipation of finding a mate. Ms Thielecke is not the first researcher to have compromised her health for the sake of science. Last month it was reported that an American biologist had lived with a parasitic worm in his mouth for three months. Dr Jonathan Allen, 36, played host to a Gongylonema pulchruma parasite which moved around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips. Dr Allen consulted a dentist and a surgeon about the issue but neither removed the parasite so he decided to deal with the problem himself. He used small forceps to remove the worm from his cheek with the help of his wife. He now keeps it in a jar and studies it.","Marlene Thielecke took regular photos and videos of the flea in her foot .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A seal called keith which anglers wanted to shoot in order to protect fish stocks has had a last minute reprieve. The 4ft seal, which is in fact female, became a local celebrity after she swam over 50 miles inland up the River Severn, in Worcestershire. But after a storm of protest and an internet campaign, the Angling Trust has agreed to support attempts to return Keith to her feeding grounds in the Irish Sea. All at sea: Keith the female seal is said to be confused after losing her way and swimming up the River Severn . Animal-lovers have followed . its journey and reports of sightings after it was  first spotted in the River Severn in . November. But after she was snapped . eating a duck and numerous fish, the Angling Trust labelled it a ‘marine . predator’ and threatened to obtain a licence and use a qualified . marksman to shoot the mammal. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the . Trust, said: ‘This marine predator cannot be allowed to carry on eating . its way through freshwater fish that have taken decades to grow to a . size. 'We will try everything possible to remove it humanely but more . drastic action may be the only option if these methods do not work.’ 'Marine predator': Keith the seal tucks into a freshly-caught salmon, much to the dismay of local anglers . This picture and the one above were taken by cyclist Mick Finn who spotted Keith near Diglis Locks in Worcester . Enjoying herself: Keith seems in no hurry to leave . One . angling club member even claimed Keith was a threat to pets. Stuart . Anderson said: ‘I am very worried as it has started taking ducks and . waterfowl and soon will start attacking swans and maybe dogs swimming.’ But within hours of the shooting threat emerging a Facebook campaign entitled ‘Save Keith the Seal’ was launched. It was endorsed with more than 600 ‘likes’. Twitter was also buzzing with messages . backing Keith, while an online petition to save the seal from the . bullet amassed well over 400 signatures. The seal was first photographed having swum upstream to Bewdley and Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire. There locals nicknamed it after Colonel Keith, the Royalist commander at the 1651 Battle of Worcester during the Civil War. The seal’s usual home is believed to . be in the Irish Sea or Bristol Channel . An Environment Agency spokesman said: . ‘We understand the concerns of anglers, but one animal in a large river . like the Severn is unlikely to have a significant impact on fish stocks. ‘This is natural predation and it will eventually make its way back out to sea. ‘With this is mind, and because seals are a protected species, we won’t be taking action.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘It’s not uncommon for seals to venture away from the sea. ‘As long as the seal is not injured, or in any immediate danger, then we would not be concerned for its welfare.’ Keith's petition can be found at www.facebook.com/savetheseal, and the petition at http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/save-keith-the-seal.html .

"By . Jennifer Smith . British universities killed a staggering 1.3million animals last year in the name of research, it has emerged. Among the slaughtered animals were almost a million mice, 124 monkeys, 10 dogs and six emus that were all killed for medical and veterinary research throughout British universities and research institutes. Edinburgh University had the highest death rate, with 226,341 animals being killed, followed by Oxford and Cambridge. Almost 75 per cent of the animals killed by universities and research institutions in the last year were mice . Some 226,000 fish, 50,000 frogs and 4,250 birds were put to death for vivisection - compared to just 40,248 animals that are killed for research by the Institute for Cancer Research annually. The figures were obtained in Freedom of Information Act requests by The Tab series of student newspapers to every university in Britain. Yesterday, animal welfare groups expressed their 'disgust' at the findings and claimed much of the research is funded by High Street charities. Michelle Thew, CEO of The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV),said: 'The details of some (university) research will not only surprise but disgust. MICE: 978,259 . FISH: 278,586 . RATS: 51,218 . FROGS: 5,552 . BIRDS: 4,246 . CHICKENS: 2,953 . REPTILES: 2,040 . MONKEYS: 124 . DOGS: 10 . CATS: 2 . EMUS: 6 . 'Tests have involved forcing rodents to inhale diesel fumes to investigate their harmful effects and deliberately inflicting high levels of stress on baby animals to see if having a stressful childhood causes mental health issues in adulthood. 'Many members of the public are under the illusion that all animal experimentation is vital for human health benefits, whereas this couldn’t be further from the truth.' The FoI request was submitted to a total of 132 universities and research institutes. Among the 44 universities who replied, a total of 1,329,013 animals were killed between July 2012 and July 2013, with mice accounting for 73 per cent of the dead. The University of Edinburgh has the highest death toll due to its College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, which is one of the oldest units of its kind in the UK. The college euthanised 165,050 mice, 51,368 fish, 7,260 rats and 1,824 birds, while Oxford University's casualties included 29 monkeys, 18 pigs and 43 badgers. Cambridge University’s deaths included 186 guinea pigs and 36 primates, while six emus were killed at the Royal Veterinary College in London. Kings College London, Imperial College London and Stirling University in Scotland were the only other three institutions which killed more than 100,000 animals. Andrew Tyler, the director of Animal Aid, said the experiments carried out on animals are unreliable for human medicines. 'Apart from causing a great deal of suffering to these animals the experiments of this type do not deliver the data that is reliable and productive for human medicine. 'It should not happen, especially not at universities. 'Much of the research of this sort in universities is funded by medical research charities, high street charities, such as the British Heart Foundation or Cancer Research. 'When we polled people a huge 80 per cent said they didn’t want their money going into this type of research, so the British public is not happy with this either.' 'I don’t think they know this happens at universities.' Research: Kings College London, Imperial College . London 9pictured) and Stirling University in Scotland were the only other three . institutions which killed more than 100,000 animals . Mr Tyler's sentiments were echoed by animal rights group PETA, who told Mail Online: 'The development of cutting-edge non-animal methodologies that can accurately predict what happens in human beings is exciting and also progressive science that works. 'Unless they wish to be at the bottom of the science pile, these universities need to embrace today's technological breakthroughs.' But the Association of Medical Research Charities refuted claims the research being carried out was unnecessary. Chief Executive, Sharmila Nebhrajani, said: 'Charities fund projects using animals only when they are satisfied that there is no possible alternative. 'That the scientific benefit that will come from the project will outweigh the impact of the experiment on animals and that all animals in the lab are treated as respectfully and humanely as possible.' Newcastle University used 14 macaques, while Kings College London euthanised 39 marmosets, the Freedom of Information request revealed. The University of Leicester, which euthanised 18,204 animals, declined to comment to The Tab and directed reporters to a statement on animal testing on the website of its Central Research Facility. The statement reads: 'Animals are only used in research programmes where there are no alternatives. 'The minimum number of animals consistent with the objectives of the research is used and the animals are housed in optimal conditions. 'The University’s use of animals is scrutinised by an ethical review process which includes lay representation (including members external to the University).'","Over a million animals slaughtered for medical and veterinary research .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . His grandfather's dashing good looks stole America's heart during his time as President. Now it seems John F Kennedy's charm has resurfaced - in his only grandson. Admirers took to the internet to sing the praises of John 'Jack' Schlossberg, 20, who is training to become an emergency medical technician as he studies at Yale University. Scroll down for video . John F Kennedy's grandson John 'Jack' Schlossberg, left, with his mother Caroline Kennedy as she is sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to Japan with her husband Dr Edwin Schlossberg and Secretary of State John Kerry . Smart: Schlossberg is training to become an emergency medical technician at Yale University . As he appeared beside his mother Caroline Kennedy, who was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, one Twitter user asked: 'When did Caroline Kennedy's son become such a 10?' One cheekily asked whether he was 'legal' while another said: 'I can't wait to marry into the Kennedy family.' Despite his comparatively tender age, the young member of one of U.S. politics' greatest dynasties has more than his share of family tragedy. His uncle John Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash in 1999, and his great-uncle Bobby was assassinated - as, of course, was his grandfather. Not shaken by his family's past, Jack has been described as a budding statesman. He has already spoken at several prominent events, including the 50th anniversary of New York's JFK Airport. Jack Schlossberg, left, has been compared to his grandfather JFK, pictured right aged 22 at a garden party . Statesman in the making: John 'Jack' Schlossberg listens to a speaker on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis last year, at the library in Boston, Massachusetts, which was named for his grandfather . At his age, Jack's grandfather led a . somewhat more relaxed life - during time off from Harvard aged 20, he . sailed to France with his convertible car and spent 10 weeks driving . through Europe. But the . future President would soon come of age with the onset of the Second . World War when he was 22. He served first in the Army then the Navy, . receiving the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. His daughter Caroline Kennedy took part . in a traditional tea ceremony yesterday, just days before flying to . Japan in her official role as Ambassador. The . daughter of President Kennedy was confirmed as the new ambassador by . the Senate last month and is due to move to Japan with her husband and . children tomorrow. The . 55-year-old attorney, who will be the first woman to represent the U.S. in the Asian country, was nominated for the vital role by President . Obama after his re-election.

'We just had a tea ceremony which was . a . wonderful introduction to the Japanese culture,' Ms Kennedy said at a . reception in the residence of Japanese ambassador Kenichiro Sasae, which . was hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry. 'My . husband and I and my children are so excited to be going to Japan. We . look forward to meeting as many people as we can, to making new friends, . visiting and studying the history and culture of this beautiful country . that is such a strong partner to the United States in so many important . efforts.'

Partners: Japan's ambassador to the U.S. Kenichiro Sasae with Caroline Kennedy . Japan is the fourth-largest trading partner to the U.S. and home to the Navy's 7th Fleet and 50,000 American troops. As Mr Kerry introduced the new Japanese ambassador, he told the reception that he first met Ms Kennedy in the 1960s. He said the young Ms Kennedy, who had . been getting ready to ride her pony Macaroni, had burst into tears when . the pony backed into her. Mr .

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . Manchester United have desperately needed a leader this season, but Rio Ferdinand didn’t even bother applying for the job. It would have been the perfect way for Ferdinand to repay the club after they stood by him during his drug test ban all those years ago. After messing Roy Hodgson about last year, and turning his back on England, I expected Ferdinand to become a regular and a leader for Manchester United. Instead he’s tweeting about toilet smells and Celebrity Big Brother. Leading the way: Manchester United need Rio Ferdinand to be a strong captain on and off the field . Toilet humour: Rio Ferdinand asks Twitter a hypothetical question about toilet smells . Television observations: Ferdinand offers his insight into reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother . Sir Alex Ferguson speaks very highly of Rio, describing his ‘unquestionable class’ in his autobiography last year. He also highlighted the extent of Rio’s focus away from football – scoffing at plans to go to the USA to meet rapper P Diddy: ‘Is he going to make you a better centre half?’ Fergie asked. When Rio met Puffy: Sir Alex Ferguson questioned Ferdinand's motives for meeting rapper Puff Daddy . There’s nothing wrong with players having interests outside football, unless of course they take your focus away from the game. Fergie felt so concerned he instructed Rio’s agent to run all of the centre half’s activities away from football by him first. Here’s the truth about Rio Ferdinand’s career: he’s been brilliant for Manchester United. His partnership with Nemanja Vidic has been rock solid in a period of United domination. Arguably the best centre half pairing in Premier League history. For England he’s been one of many who failed to live up to expectation, which is disappointing. If you’re thinking he’s past it, think again. Rio played a lot of games last year – over 30 – and was so good he made the PFA team of the year. He also earned a new contract extension from David Moyes. Sir Alex described it as Rio’s best ever season for United. He’s now averaging one game a month for his club, sometimes watching the whole game from the subs’ bench. Rio’s out with a knee injury right now, but without wishing to be disrespectful, nobody is missing him. I can’t help thinking that even though injuries might make things hard for Rio, he should be the leader on and off the field during these difficult times for Manchester United. Last season proved he’s still got the ability and the fitness, but his major contribution off the field this season has been to question Moyes’ way of telling the players who’s in the team. Not helpful. Rio won’t like this but in terms of leadership, playing through the pain and proving people wrong, he could learn a huge lesson from John Terry on the pitch. Showing how it should be done: John Terry has been a consistent performer for Chelsea this season . Fan favourite: The Chelsea fans show their affection towards Terry with a banner at Stamford Bridge . The Chelsea captain has been magnificent, playing every minute of every game in the Premier League so far this season, when many thought he was finished. I can’t help thinking Rio has underachieved – we should be talking about him as a leader, a captain, a rock. He should be out there setting the example for others. But it seems he has failed to convince Moyes of his value. When he’s on Twitter asking inane questions about wee and poo I’m not surprised. It’s harmless ‘fun’ I suppose. Sadly it all contributes to the probability that Rio will be remembered most for an eight month ban, rather than being a Manchester United legend. Two of the best: Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand were one of the best centre back pairings in the league . Bench boy: Ferdinand has averaged just a one game a month this season . Celeb scene: Ferdinand and ex-TOWIE star Mark Wright catch up in Alderley Edge . When Rio Ferdinand was coming through the youth system at West Ham United Harry Redknapp confidently predicted: ‘He’ll be the best defender in Europe one day.’ I don’t think that prediction quite came true. And this season, Rio Ferdinand seems to be letting a golden opportunity to prove any doubters wrong pass him by. Shame. Having recently seen a Premier League game at Newcastle United you can’t help but be impressed by the stadium, the fans and the aura around this huge club. They’ve tasted Champions League drama, and FA Cup finals in recent memory. But the only thing missing on Tyneside is a sustained period of real success, and trophies of course. And that’s why Yohan Cabaye is so keen to leave. In simple terms, he is way too good for Newcastle United. I feel for the Newcastle fans. Big loss: Yohan Cabaye looks set to swap Newcastle for PSG this month . Waving goodbye: Alan Pardew has shown disregard for cup competitions this season . I said last week in this column that Alan Pardew’s disregard for cup competitions would mean top players have no reason to stay. If any Liverpool fan has to pay £93 . to get into the Emirates to watch their team’s FA Cup fifth round tie . next month then Arsenal should be disqualified from the competition. It really is that simple. I can’t help thinking Cabaye’s stay at Newcastle has been a missed opportunity. He’s the kind of player you can build a top four team around, a cup winning team around. Pardew failed to do that, and Mike Ashley didn’t offer the right investment to build a successful team. Newcastle United fans have been lucky to have Cabaye – they will miss him, and so will the Premier League. What a chance missed by everyone in charge at St James’ Park. Jose Mourinho is going to look like a fool if Chelsea win nothing this season. By selling Juan Mata to Manchester United Mourinho has sent out a clear statement that he can be successful without such a talented player. At their best last season, Mata, Oscar and Hazard were a joy to watch. Mourinho felt the need to break it up and dispense with Mata. This is the Juan: David Moyes poses with new Manchester United signing Juan Mata . This guy has been a match winner, a man for the big occasion, a man who could create and score, a player you would happily pay money to see. But apparently he’s not good enough for what Mourinho wants. It’s no surprise: Mourinho is a winner, and he finds a way to achieve success. It’s not as pretty as Barcelona’s method of lifting trophies, but he is a consistent champion doing it his way. Oscar winner: Brazilian midfielder Oscar is Jose Mourinho's first choice for the No 10 role at Chelsea . There are not many managers around who would feel comfortable leaving a player of Mata’s quality out of the starting line-up. Mourinho didn’t just leave him out of the Chelsea XI, he sold him to Manchester United. I still think Chelsea will win the title, but if they end up with no trophies this season, everyone will have the right to point the finger at Mourinho and accuse him of making a huge blunder selling Mata. Bringing pressure on himself: Jose Mourinho will be the one to blame if Chelsea fail to win anything this season . On top of that he will also stand accused of lacking the creative coaching knowledge needed to get the best out of such a talent. You have to admire Mourinho for heaping that pressure on himself. If you have concerns about the future of the society we live in then you should want Twitter to show more willingness to clean up its act. I’m not talking about people bantering about football or debating the game. I’m talking about the disgusting responses to some of those debates. It seems to be acceptable that a whole new generation is growing up thinking mild or vile abuse posted online to people they’ve never met is acceptable. Staying loyal: Leighton Baines signed a new deal at Everton despite interest from Manchester United . Sadly the people running social media forums and the people running the country are reinforcing the message that such abuse is acceptable by doing nothing to prevent it or punish it. One example from this week: on my talkSPORT radio show we asked if Leighton Baines had ‘bottled it’ by staying at Everton and not seeking a move to a club regularly winning trophies and playing in the Champions League. My view was that Baines’ wish to stay at Everton and help them try to achieve greatness was admirable. Remarkably some Everton fans thought this was a signal for them to fire abuse at me. One threatening tweet suggested I should ‘watch out’ next time I’m at Goodison Park. Whoever posted it later deleted it. I’ve seen pundits threatened with murder because they tweet about football. I’ve seen anonymous tweeters start campaigns falsely accusing ex-pros and pundits of being paedophiles because they offer an opinion on football. I’ve seen grown men who claim to be a ‘proud father’ in their Twitter profile tweet all sorts of vile, disgusting abuse and threats to people they don’t even know, simply because they disagree with a football opinion. God help their children who will be growing up using a man with no moral compass whatsoever as a role model. They won’t know right from wrong. I’ve even seen tweets saying pundits should expect to be threatened with murder if they offer an opinion on football. A debate about football is exactly that. How an individual can possibly think it is right to shift that debate into something sinister is beyond me. For me personally, I can try to educate people to be decent and just talk about football rather than be abusive, but I can’t possibly get upset about a total stranger with a sick mind tweeting abuse to me. But not everyone is as strong. If one day these unchecked threats lead to the suicide of someone receiving them, or an aggressive twitter user decides to follow through with a threat for real, then Twitter, and all those who choose to ignore the message I’m conveying here, will have blood on their hands. I sincerely hope that sickening scenario never comes true.","Rio Ferdinand has failed to be the leader David Moyes needs at Man United .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . She's the single mother of two who sparked outrage when it emerged that she'd had a £4,800 breast enlargement operation on the NHS - but it seems that Josie Cunningham still isn't happy with her body. Despite claiming that the surgery was needed to make her feel 'womanly', the aspiring glamour model says she's now so desperate for a reduction, she's turned to escorting to pay for it. This time, however, Cunningham, 23, plans to pay for the operation herself after a cancer scare made her change her mind about wasting NHS funds. New leaf: Ms Cunningham says she has turned to escort work in a bid to refund the NHS for her boob job . 'I'm desperate for a boob reduction and I feel so bad about using NHS funds for my breast enlargement,' said Cunningham, who lives in Leeds with her two sons. Speaking to Closer magazine, the former shop assistant added: 'I'm raising cash from escorting to pay for it.' And escort work appears suit her, with Ms Cunningham describing it as 'a great job' and claiming that the toughest part is trying to avoid falling in love with clients. 'I enjoy sex so it's not like it's a chore and the free dinners are great - it's like being paid to date,' she revealed. 'I charge £450 for dinner and £1,000 for the night including sex. It's much better than scraping by on minimum wages working in a shop!' Ms Cunningham's surgery story began in January last year, when she was given a taxpayer-funded £4,800 breast enlargement operation which boosted her measurements to a 36 DD. Before: Prior to having her NHS boob job, Josie claimed that she felt unwomanly because of her small breasts . Too large: Josie, who appears in this week's Closer (right), says she is desperate for a reduction . Despite being initially thrilled, just four months later, she decided her new-look bust was too big and approached the NHS about having them reduced. But just months later, Cunningham suffered a skin cancer scare - a fright that left her embarrassed about wasting taxpayer's money on a breast enlargement. 'I realised I was wrong to think I deserved the cash for my boob job as much as anyone else with an illness - there are far more worthy causes.' Now, she says she not only plans to pay for her own breast reduction, but also hopes to reimburse the NHS for the amount spent on her original operation. But after failing to make headway via the Just Giving page she set up, Cunningham chose to turn to escort work instead - and admits that she has no plans to quit. 'I thought I'd give up when I made enough money for the reduction and to pay back the NHS but I've been splashing out on gifts for my family instead.' She added: 'I don't care if people think selling my body is bad - I love it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm proud to be making my own way.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A collection of ancient baby bones has challenged the belief that the Romans murdered more baby girls than boys to control the size of their families. British archaeologists have taken another look at the 1,800-year-old bones discovered near Hambleton, Buckinghamshire and have found that baby girls were not killed more often than male infants. Of the 12 skeletons discovered at Yewden Villa, seven were female and none of them shared a mother, leading the scientists to the conclusion that the Romans did not use infanticide to manipulate the sex ratio. British archaeologists have taken another look at the 1,800-year-old bones (pictured) discovered near Hambleton, Buckinghamshire and have found that baby girls were not killed more often than male infants . It was previously thought that Romans used infanticide to manipulate the sex ratio and were more likely to murder girls than boys. Archaeologists have examined 1,800-year-old skeletons of babies found in Britain to discover that baby girls were not killed more often than male infants. Infanticide was relatively commonly used to control the size of families. The Romans did not consider babies fully human and instead thought that children gained humanity over time, with milestones such as their naming and eating food all adding to them being human. Archaeologists have pointed out that the culture in Rome might have been drastically different to that of some of the Empire’s colonies. Scientists from English Heritage recently analysed ancient DNA to study the bones that were unearthed in 1912 and had thought to have been lost. There were re-discovered by the director of Chiltern Archaeology in England, Jill Eyers, in an archive and were put under the microscope again, LiveScience reported. Simon Mays, a skeletal biologist for English Heritage, said: ‘Very often, societies have preferred male offspring, so when they practice infanticide, it tends to be the male babies that are kept and the female babies that are killed.’ Two years ago he and Dr Eyers said the bones discovered in Buckinghamshire were those of babies that had been killed as they died at the same age just after being born. They proposed that that burial site belonged to the babies of prostitutes, but said the idea was a ‘long shot’. Infanticide was used by Romans to control their family size, but not - as previously thought - to manipulate the sex ratio. Romulus and Remus (pictured) the mythical founders of Rome, were left in the river Tiber to die by their parents and were raised by a wolf in the tale . Now however, they have revised their idea as none of the babies shared a mother and if the babies were born of prostitutes, it would be incredibly unlikely that one of them had not had more than one child, the scientists explained in their paper, which will be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Ancient Roman texts reveal that infanticide was an accepted way of controlling the size of Roman families in a time before contraception. While the concept of killing babies to regulate family size seems . abhorrent to modern people, the Romans did not consider them fully human . and instead thought that children gained humanity over time. Archaeologists have pointed out that the culture in Rome might have been drastically different to that of some of the Empire’s colonies. The skeletons of 12 babies were discovered at Yewden Villa near Hambleden in Buckinghamshire just over a century ago. They have now given up more of their secrets following DNA analysis . One document, written by a Roman soldier posted in Britain suggested that Romans were more likely to kill their daughters than sons. He told his wife not to bother keeping their baby if it was a girl. Other than this evidence, there is little know about the use of infanticide by Romans in Britain. However, while scientists cannot use the shape of bones to determine a baby’s sex, DNA analysis was used on 12 of the bones to reveal that seven of the 12 skeletons were female. The 12 babies studied add to DNA evidence collected from 13 more baby skeletons, which shows that there is no evidence that baby girls were killed more often than boys. ‘It seems as though they weren't using infanticide to manipulate the sex ratio,’ Dr Mays said. Commenting on the study, Kristina Killgrove, a bioarchaeologist at the University of West Florida, said: ‘Now that we can use DNA to tell whether the babies were male or female, we're starting to revise the commonly held assumptions about infanticide in the Roman world.’ The Romans did not consider babies fully human and instead thought that children gained humanity over time, with milestones such as their naming and eating food all adding to them being human. The children pictured in this frieze of an imperial procession, taken from Ara Pacis Augustae in Rome, would have been treasured .","British archaeologists conducted DNA analysis on the 1,800-year-old bones discovered near Hambleton, Buckinghamshire .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Hong Kong has culled 20,000 chickens and closed a major poultry market after the bird flu virus was discovered. Authorities have banned local farms from selling to the Cheung Sha Wan poultry market just two days before Chinese New Year, when traders usually see a big boost in sales. The city has also blocked imports of fresh chicken from mainland China for 21 days after the H7N9 virus was discovered in a shipment from the southern province of Guangdong. Authorities in Hong Kong have ordered the cull of 20,000 chickens after the bird flu virus was discovered . A shipment from southern Gunagdong province contained the H7N9 strain of the virus which can spread to humans . Officials have also closed the Cheung Sha Wan poultry market in the city just two days before Chinese New Year when traders usually see a spike in sales . The market will also remain closed for 21 days until February 18 for cleaning and disinfection. 'Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department officers will inspect all the local chicken farms and collect more samples for testing to ensure that local farms are not affected by H7 avian influenza,' Secretary for Food and Health Dr Ko Wing-man said in a statement. The H7N9 virus passes easily between birds and could develop the ability to spread from human-to-human, causing a global pandemic. So far this year around 19 people have died in China from the disease, including two in Hong Kong . The flu is difficult to spot because it does not make the animals visibly ill and can pass between them easily . While the disease does not pass easily between people, scientists fear it could mutate and cause a pandemic . Staff members of Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have carried out the cull today, gassing the chickens with carbon dioxide. The health minister has also said the government is considering separating local and imported birds to stop the need for large culls in the future. Two people infected with H7N9 bird flu have died in Hong Kong and a third patient is being treated. All three were infected during visits to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 240 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Department of Health. China's official Xinhua news agency, citing the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said 19 people had died of the flu in China this year. Fears are growing for more human infections as the cull comes just two days before Chinese New Year, where chicken is a popular dish in feasts . The birds were gassed using carbon dioxide before being put into black bin bags and wheelie bins and taken away . Hong Kong has also banned imports of fresh chicken from mainland China to try and stop the disease spreading . China's Health and Family Planning Commission reported a further nine cases of H7N9 bird flu to the World Health Organization on Sunday and Monday. Hong Kong last suspended live poultry imports in 2011 after a dead chicken tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu at the same market. The cull marks the first time that the virus has been found in imported poultry . Staff members of Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have carried out the cull .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Few rock icons can claim to still be going strong after 60 years, but today marks the anniversary of the first Fender Stratocaster being built, and the music icon is still as popular as ever. Designed by Leo Fender in a small . workshop in Fullerton, California, six decades ago, it has been used in . all genres from country to reggae, and from rock to pop and was the only . guitar to challenge the Gibson Les Paul for popularity. Today the guitars are built by hand in Fender's factory in Corona, California. Each Stratocaster starts life as a long, thin piece of ash wood which is shaped into a neck by machine, before being hand laid with either more ash or rosewood for the fret board. The frets are then hammered in by hand, using a machine to tighten them. The body, which can be made of two, three, or even four pieces of wood, is then given its shape by a machine which cuts holes for the controls, tremolo bridge and other metal parts which are assembled by hand. The neck and body are then hand shaped by workers using sanders before being sent through the paint shop, which uses similar technology to car factories. The paint is then left for three days until it properly dries. Finally, the body and fret are given a final shaping, which puts the high-gloss finish on them, before being sent through quality control where they are examined, tuned and given a final check before being sent out. Designed to be used by country musicians, the guitar was first memorably played by Buddy Holly and became his signature as an artist. One of the defining images of the 50s was Holly pictured with the guitar high up on his chest. From there it was taken up in the early 60s by the likes of the Beach Boys who favoured it for it's wailing sound, and later by Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and George Harrison. The birth of heavy metal saw the Stratocaster take on new life in the hands of Iron Maiden, while Eddie Van Halen's famous Frankenstrat only added to the instrument's iconic status. The guitar then passed into the capable hands of modern-day musicians such as the Red Hot Chili Pepper's John Frusciante, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and the Arctic Monkey's Alex Turner. Other memorable players include Hank Marvin, Stevie Ray Vaughn, the Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler and Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, to name but a few. Scroll down for video . The Fender Stratocaster celebrates its 60th anniversary today. It was originally created in the 1950s by Leo Fender to replace the earlier Telecaster . Unlike the big-band Telecaster, the Strat was designed for use in smaller bands and groups and also featured a contoured design to make it more comfortable to wear . The body of a Strat (top) is given this basic shape by a machine, but it repeatedly shaped and reshaped by hand using sanders to give it a high gloss finish (right) The neck of a Strat is also initially shaped by a machine, but the fret board is laid on by hand before the metal frets themselves are hammered into place by workers . In the paint shop, brand new guitar bodies are sprayed using similar technology to car plants. They are then put into racks which slowly move them across the floor to be finished. In total, it takes three days for the paint to dry . At the end of the manufacturing process all Fender guitars are put through a rigorous testing process, when they are checked for quality, finish and tuning . Other 60s musicians to take up the instrument included Jimi Hendrix, who famously played his flipped over because he was left handed. The Beatles' George Harrison was also a fan of the Fender, pictured here in 1970 . While stars such as Kieth Richards are happy to buy Strats straight off the rack, Fender also offer a custom shop where almost any aspect of the guitar can be tweaked . Showing the instrument's infinite flexibility, it was perfectly suited to both the slow-hand style of Eric Clapton (left) and the harsher tones of Eddie Van Halen (right) British band Iron Maiden brought the Stratocaster with them into the heavy metal revolution and carried on using the instrument form many years . Still rocking: Restoration expert and master builder John Cruz works on the body of a heavily used Strat at the Corona factory in California . The Strat has been used in virtually every genre, from reggae to rock, pop to punk. Here blues legend Robert Cray performs with one during a concert in Anaheim, Calif. Vinnie Garcia hands Country legend Vince Gill his 1957 Strat. Garcia sold Gill his first Stratocaster for $200 and a pair of cowboy boots. Gill said: 'I love the versatility of the guitar as much as anything, no matter what way you want to play it, it always responds' Kurt Cobain, the force behind grunge band Nirvana, used a Strat and the Arctic Monkeys' frontman Alex Turner was also a fans of the guitar in the band's early days . Golden oldie: John Mayer performs with his Stratocaster. He said: 'It's the machine of my dreams.

"By . Andy Dolan . Fiona Leonard, who was drunk at the time of the attack, has now been jailed for two years, three months . Dressed in her finery, Fiona Leonard . had been looking forward to the highlight of her social calendar – . Ladies’ Day at Royal Ascot. The . 31-year-old insurance clerk joined a party of women for a chance to . mingle with the fashionable and famous at an event attended by the . Queen. But instead of fond . memories, Leonard was yesterday left shamed and beginning a prison . sentence in the aftermath of a drunken assault in which she bit another . woman’s face. The savage unprovoked attack has left her victim, Carol . McAndrew, 49, scarred for life. A . court heard how Leonard punched Mrs McAndrew to the floor and bit her . on the cheek, removing a chunk of flesh and leaving her needing 15 . stitches. This week a judge jailed Leonard for 27 months for the attack, which took place last June. The . thug, who is now 20 weeks pregnant, and her victim had been among a . group of women from Birmingham who hired a coach to take them to the . meeting at the Berkshire racecourse. But Leonard failed to return to the coach promptly at the end of the day, causing the 130-mile journey home to be delayed. Birmingham . Crown Court heard that when Leonard did eventually appear, the coach . set off but she became ‘aggressive and foul-mouthed’ and a row broke . out. Prosecutor Alexander Davies said that Leonard approached Mrs McAndrew and asked: ‘Have you got a problem with me?’ Mrs McAndrew decided to get off the bus early and phoned her husband to come and pick her up. Leonard launched the attack after being 'aggressive and foul-mouthed' on the bus back to Birmingham from a day at the races, the court heard . However, . Leonard followed her off the vehicle and attacked her on the pavement. ‘The defendant grabbed her by her hair and punched her several times in . the face,’ Mr Davies said. ‘She . was knocked to the floor and the defendant was on top of her and bit . her hard to the left side of her face.’ The bus driver had to drag . Leonard off Mrs McAndrew and hold her until police arrived to arrest . her. Joseph Keating, . defending Leonard, said: ‘She understands that her actions were . completely out of all proportion in the circumstances.’ Leonard approached Mrs McAndrew and asked 'Have you got a problem with me?' after Mrs McAndrew tried to act as a peacemaker in a row . Leonard . and her partner had planned to move to Ireland before their child was . born, but this incident had ‘completely turned her life around’, he . said. She is now unemployed and living off financial support from family and friends. Leonard, . from Yardley, Birmingham, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Carr told her it was ‘plain from what . happened that you had far too much to drink’. He . added: ‘You were late back to the coach. Once you were on it there is . plain evidence that  you were aggressive towards Mrs McAndrew and . foul-mouthed. The attack happened after the women had been on a coach trip to Ladies Day at Ascot racecourse (file picture) ‘You were told . to behave yourself but you did not heed the warning. The really vile . aspect of this case is the fact that you bit her.’ Mrs . McAndrew, from Solihull, West Midlands, said after the case: ‘I am . absolutely devastated at what has happened. I had never met the girl . before and things just got out of hand.’ Her husband Thomas, 53, added: ‘Carol is very upset about all this and had no intention of the woman going to prison.’","Fiona Leonard attacked Carol McAndrew after boozy day at the races .

"By . Corey Charlton . Travellers may experience airport delays and holiday disruptions if the U.S. Government decides to tighten security measures ahead of new intelligence signalling a possible airliner attack. Concerns a new generation of innovation in bomb making is being developed in the battlegrounds of Iraq and Syria could prompt a tightening of security across European and U.S. airports. It would likely disrupt travel plans and cause airport chaos for those heading away this summer, although the U.S. Government has not yet formally declared what it intends to do. The intelligence has revealed the groups are developing new covert weapons as well as recruiting willing plot members from the large number of foreigners currently fighting in the region. Many of these radicalised fighters carry European and U.S. passports and have travelled to the region to help ISIS establish its Islamic State, or join the Al-Qaeda affiliated Al Nusrah Front. Scroll down for video . The U.S. is considering a crackdown on airport security after new intelligence was received, with concerns there could be a new generation of bomb making technology underway . ISIS has been responsible for executions and other atrocities during its surge to the edge of Baghdad . ABC News reported U.S. analysts believed a section of extreme terrorists in Syria were planning to attack a U.S. or Europe-bound plane, aided by any number of the thousands of U.S. or European passport holders fighting in the region. To try and stop the attacks, one source told the network the new airport security measures could include increasing rates of random screenings, targeting certain types of travellers and increasing its armed air marshall presence. Fighting across the region has been brutal in recent weeks with ISIS carrying out mass executions and crucifixions so blood thirsty it has been branded too extreme by Al-Qaeda. The United Nations said more . than 2,400 Iraqis had been killed in June alone, making the current . violence the most deadly since the height of sectarian warfare in 2007.

ISIS yesterday declared it would now call itself The Islamic State – to reflect the territory it controls across Syria and Iraq and its goal of establishing an Islamic state across the entire Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe by the year 2020. The announcement, made on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, could trigger a wave of infighting among Sunni extremist factions that have until now formed a loose rebel alliance. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS and the person to announce the creation of the new Islamic state . A spokesman for ISIS declared the group's chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as the leader of the new caliphate, or Islamic state, and called on Muslims everywhere, not just those in areas under the organization's control, to swear loyalty to him. The group currently controls a large slice of Syria and Iraq, and conquered large swathes of territory at breakneck pace in recent weeks before slowing down when it found itself at the edge of Baghdad. As well as plans to expand its caliphate throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and large parts of western Asia, the map also marks out an expansion in parts of Europe. Spain, which was ruled by Muslims for 700 years until 1492, is marked out as a territory the caliphate plans to have under its control by 2020. Elsewhere, ISIS plans to take control of the the Balkan states - including Greece, Romania and Bulgaria - extending its territories in eastern Europe as far as Austria, which appears to be based on a pre-First World War borders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.","U.S. concerned about new bomb making innovations in conflict zones .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A cup of tea or a mug of 'cha' might taste the same, but the choice of words for the brew can reveal a great deal about a person's ancestry and even the history of the world. Recently published maps plotting the different words used for various objects make it clear that a simple term can say a lot about a country. The infographics, posted by Reddit user Bezbojnicul, show that some seemingly mundane words can explain a country's links to trade, its history of conflict and migration. The maps show how many words for 'tea' found in different languages are ultimately of Chinese origin. Languages spoken in eastern Europe and Asia which got their tea overland rather than from the Dutch tend to use forms such as chai . For example, there are many words for ‘tea’ found in different languages but are all ultimately of the same Chinese origin. Those differences, however, give an insight into how the product arrived in the country. The Dutch traders, who were the main importers of tea into Europe, had their main contacts in Amoy in Fujian. For this reason they adopted the word for ‘tea’ as 'thee', and in this form it then spread to large parts of Europe. The English word rose comes from French, which itself comes from Latin rosa - one of the languages that most influenced English. Interestingly, the map shows how garoful, the ancient Greek word for rose, today only remains in north eastern Italy . The first European tea importers in the 16th century, however, were Portuguese. Portuguese uses the term 'chá', derived from Cantonese 'cha'. As a result, languages spoken in eastern Europe and . Asia which got their tea overland rather than from the Dutch tend to use . forms such as 'chai'. These European Etymology maps provide a fascinating insight into how words have changed across a geographical area. The English word 'rose', for instance, comes from French, which itself comes from Latin 'rosa' – one of the languages that most influenced English. Church is common to many Teutonic, Slavonic and other languages under various forms. In German it is kirche, in Swedish kirka in Danish kirke and in Finnish kirkko . The modern Persian word for ‘rose’ is 'gul', which developed through a series of regular sound changes from the word 'varda'. Interestingly, the map shows how 'garoful', the ancient Greek word for 'rose', today only remains in the north east of Italy. The maps also reveals how Greek influenced the English word 'church'. 'Church' is common to many Teutonic, Slavonic and other languages under various forms. In German it is 'kirche', in Swedish 'kirka', in Danish 'kirke' and in Finnish 'kirkko'. These all originate from the Greek word 'ecclesia' which means ‘assembly’, with the meaning of the word transferred from the community to the building. In many places the pineapple has a name similar to ananas derives from nana, a Tupi Indian term for the fruit. Christopher Columbus is alleged to have named the pineapple, calling it the 'pine of the Indies' due to its resemblance to a pine cone . The word pineapple, however, seems to be something of an anomaly. In many countries, it has a name similar to 'ananas', which derives from 'nana', a Tupi Indian term for the fruit. Christopher Columbus is alleged to have named the pineapple, calling it the ‘pine of the Indies’ due to its resemblance to a pine cone. Another unusual word illustrated on a map is for the orange fruit. In the West it comes from Sanskrit narangas (‘orange tree’). 'Apple' has a lot of diversity. The word in Finland and Estonia may come from an Indo-Iranian origin . However, the dominant word in much of eastern and northern Europe comes from a word meaning 'apple' from China, such as the Dutch word ‘sinaasappel.’ ‘Apple’, meanwhile, has a great deal of diversity. The word in Finland and Estonia may come from an Indo-Iranian origin. ‘Bear’ seems to be influenced by Russia which has the largest brown bear population in Europe can be found.

The images recreate the photos in incredible detail - from the wrinkles on an old man's face to the small words on a leaflet. It is no surprise then that it takes Mr Cadden up to three months to complete one painting or drawing. Hyperrealism was born from photorealism, which are paintings based on photographs but created in a non-photographic medium. Mr Cadden, from Glasgow, Scotland, said: 'I travelled to China and went to Hong Kong for three weeks because I was invited to give a talk to a school about my work. Incredible: Mr Cadden's paintings and drawings recreate the photos in incredible detail - from the wrinkles on an old man's face to the small print on these empty cans .

"By . Ap  Reporter . In Paul Salopek's first year of his trek across the globe, the reporter walked alongside his camels for days in Ethiopia without seeing glass or bricks or any other signs of modern humanity, ate a hamburger on a U.S. military base and was shadowed by minders in the Saudi desert. He has only 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) to go. The Pulitzer prize-winner journalist is walking from Ethiopia, Africa, to the tip of Chile, South American, in a seven-year journey that aims to reproduce man's global migration. Beauty and difficulty filled his first year, which is now nearly complete. You can follow the National Geographic Fellow's incredible journey in real time at Out of Eden Walk: Dispatches from the Field from Paul Salopek. In the beginning: U.S. journalist Paul Salopek walks across the Afar desert of Ethiopia. The respected writer is now one year into a planned seven-year trek across the world, beginning in Africa and finishing in South America . The never-ending journey: This graphic, relased by the National Geographic Society this week, shows the planned route Paul Salopek will take across the globe, starting in Ethiopia and ending in Chile . Can't do it without you: Paul Salopek one of his camel companions in the Ethiopian desert . Let there be night light: African migrants crowd the night shore of Djibouti city trying to capture inexpensive cell signals from neighboring Somalia . In his second he will skirt the violence of Syria but will cross Iraq and Afghanistan. After . about 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) on foot, Salopek has walked . through five languages (Afar, Amharic, Arabic, French, Somali), filled . 40 notebooks full of words, said goodbye to four camel companions and . has logged one 34-mile (55-kilometer) day. Beginning in Ethiopia's Rift Valley, where early man lived, Salopek walked east into Djibouti, where he ate a hamburger on a U.S. military base, then waited nearly six weeks — because of insurance requirements over piracy attack fears — for a boat to take him across the Red Sea and into Saudi Arabia. Much of Africa, the 51-year-old noted, is still dominated by humans who travel on foot. 'The Africa segment was remarkable for its kind of historical reverberations, and getting to go through historical pastoral cultures like the Afar, and walking through a landscape still shaped by the human foot,' Salopek said by telephone. 'It really has struck me that walking out of Africa, a place that still walks, how fantastically bound to our cars the rest of the world is.' Salopek's journey will take him from Africa, through the Middle East, across Asia, over to Alaska, down the western United States, then Central and South America, ending in Chile. That's about 21,000 miles (34,000 kilometers). The walk is called Out of Eden and is sponsored by National Geographic, the Knight Foundation and the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting. Villagers pray for rain in the Afar desert of Ethiopia . Paul Salopek's trek - which is partly funded by National Geographic, a publication he has long contributed to - will produce one main magazine feature for each of the seven years. The first comes out in December (pictured) On guard: Backed by old AK-47s, coast guard personnel in Djibouti city monitor the Bab el Mandeb waterway . A two-time journalism Pulitzer Prize winner, the American plans to write one major article a year, the first of which appears in December's National Geographic. Salopek's highlight from his first year was his access to Saudi Arabia, a country that maintains tight controls on what outside journalists can see. He noted that the oil-producing nation is 83 percent urban, a higher percentage than the U.S. 'I have been moving slowly through Saudi culture, from walking along highways with camels, to — the surreal reality of it in some cases is walking with camels by a Pizza Hut with Saudis inside eating pepperoni, who look outside and see a skinny American with camels,' said Salopek, interrupting himself with the observation. Saudi Arabia made global headlines in October over protests against its effective cultural ban on women drivers. But Salopek encountered many women drivers in the country. 'They just happen to be in places where there are no reporters,' he said. In some places in the country Salopek knew he was being watched by government officials, who explained their presence by saying they were concerned for the American's safety. Plenty of alone time: Paul Salopek has already conquered Africa but won't finish his journey until 2020 . Tools of the trade: Paul Salopek stops for coffee and to take notes, with his satellite phone always close . But most times he has had unfettered access, he said. He thinks he's the first outside journalist to walk through Saudi Arabia since 1918. Salopek doesn't miss much from the Western world except information because of his limited access to the Internet. He also misses his family, but his wife is joining him in Jordan, where he currently is. He says he's on schedule to complete his seven-year journey, though because of his six-week wait in Djibouti and his boat ride up the Red Sea, he didn't walk as many steps as he thought he would. He has suffered few physical pains or ailments, save for two blisters. 'This has been very fun and very interesting and I have no indication as I sit that I'm getting bored with it,' he said. 'On the contrary, walking into a new country on foot with your clothes on your back and a shoulder bag stuffed with notebooks was really fascinating.'","Reporter Paul Salopek, who is on a seven-year mission to walk the world, has clocked up 1,300 miles of his 21,000 mile journey after one year .

"By . Gerri Peev . Boris Johnson is under increased pressure to declare a return to the Commons after senior ministers declared it would be 'wonderful' to have the London mayor back as an MP. Speculation has been rife that Mr Johnson will make a pitch for a safe Commons seat in the 2015 general election – a year before his term as London mayor expires. Allies of Mr Johnson have suggested he could return as a backbencher and continue as London mayor because running the capital was as much work as one of the great offices of state. 'Soap opera': Senior ministers have declared it would be 'wonderful' to have Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, back in Parliament . Backbench Tory MPs have been frustrated by the endless 'soap opera' about Mr Johnson's ambitions, warning it was a distraction from the local and European elections. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Foreign Secretary William Hague both said he would be a welcome addition to the Conservatives in their fight to win an outright majority in 2015. Asked if Mr Johnson could return to the Commons to lead the Tories, Mr Hunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'Well that would be wonderful. But the point is of course it takes longer than people would like, but I think the British people understand that Rome wasn't built in a day and we will get there but we have to have patience.' A source close to Mr Hunt insisted he had misheard the question and was simply welcoming the prospect of Mr Johnson coming back to Parliament rather than speculating on him replacing David Cameron. Mr Hague also hailed Mr Johnson as 'one of the great figures of our party' but signalled he would expect Mr Johnson to abide by his pledge to focus on being London Mayor. 'I have always been a tremendous fan of Boris Johnson and the rest of us in parliament would welcome his return to parliament as well as his continued commitment to the great job that he does as Mayor of London but that is for him to decide when and how he does that,' the Foreign Secretary told Sky's Murnaghan show. Foreign Secretary William Hague is one of the senior ministers putting pressure on Mr Johnson to stand for Parliament . Mr Johnson has told friends he will declare whether he will stand in the general election this summer. He is expected to pledge not to take a Cabinet post for the year he remains London Mayor if he makes a comeback as an MP. Running the capital is the equivalent of holding a big Cabinet post, his allies have said. David Ruffley, a Conservative MP (Bury, St Edmunds), said he believed Mr Johnson would return to fight the next election. 'He should because he's done a great job running London. I think he could come back in a Cameron Cabinet after 2015...you want your stars in your government,' he told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Tories had to be 'patient' about Mr Johnson's return . Mr Ruffley added however that Mr Johnson should not just be seen as a rival leader to Mr Cameron. 'I think he could occupy any number of cabinet posts. This idea that it's either Cameron or Boris is a false logic. You could have Boris back in the Commons running a big department of state, why not?' But ahead of being re-elected mayor, Mr Johnson pledged not to hold down two jobs. He said: 'If I am fortunate enough to win I will need four years to deliver what I have promised. And having put trust at the heart of this election, I would serve out that term in full. 'I made a solemn vow to Londoners to lead them out of recession, bring down crime and deliver the growth, investment and jobs that this city so desperately needs. Keeping that promise cannot be combined with any other political capacity.' He has been advised by his former spindoctor and the PM's current spin chief, Lynton Crosby, that he needs to stick to his word if he wants to be taken seriously. Mr Johnson's friends have said the way to square that is to have him ruling out taking on any big Cabinet jobs while running London. They told the Sunday Times: 'That will go down well with people and it won't look like he is breathing down Cameron's neck. Boris can see that makes sense.' The Prime Minister has already said he would be happy to see Mr Johnson back in the Commons at the next election. But MPs have urged Mr Johnson to stop dithering. Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, said: 'Undoubtedly, he would be a great addition to parliament, but he needs to get on and decide what he is doing if he is to be taken seriously.' A spokesman for the Mayor would not be drawn on speculation about his future.He told the Mail: 'The mayor is concentrated on three things: delivering for London, campaigning to return Conservative candidates in this May's elections and helping to return David Cameron as Prime Minister of a majority Conservative government in 2015.'","Speculation rife that Boris will make a pitch for a safe seat .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . He has been dead for 1,200 years – but only now have scientists finally identified the bones of Charlemagne. After 26 years of research, German scientists are satisfied that bones held for centuries at Aachen Cathedral, Germany, are those of the king of the Franks, who is also known as the father of Europe. They said that the bones came from an older man who was tall and thin. 1,200 years after the death of Charlemagne - king of the Franks - (pictured right in a stained glass window right) scientists  have confirmed that bones (pictured left) thought to be the emperor's do indeed belong to him and they paint a picture of a tall, slim, older man . Charles the Great, King of the Franks, ruled a European empire from 768 based mainly around France, Germany and parts of Italy. Called the 'Father of Europe' he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Roman Empire. His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance - a period of cultural and intellectual activity within the Catholic Church. Both the French and German monarchies considered their kingdoms to be descendants of Charlemagne's empire. Although he could not write, he spoke Teutonic, Latin and Greek. He was 6ft 4in - a monstrous height for the period, which has been confirmed by measurement of his skeleton. Oddly, his father was known as Pepin the Short and was around 5ft tall. Charlemagne's first campaign came at the age of 27, when the Pope sought his aid in repelling the Lombards of Italy. He conquered them in the field and took the crown of Lombardy as his own. From his capital of Aachen in modern-day Germany, Charlemagne went on to fight 53 campaigns, most of which he led himself. He defended a Christian Europe from Muslim Saracens and pagan Saxons, often beheading thousands in a single day. He is thought to have died aged 72 from a fever, but study of the ancient bones has not confirmed this. A total of 94 bones and fragments were analysed from the cathedral and are believed to belong to the founder of the Holy Roman Empire. The sarcophagus holding the remains was secretly opened in 1988 and there were high hopes that the bones belonged to Europe’s first emperor after the fall of the Roman Empire, German newspaper, The Local reported. Professor Frank Rühli, of the University of Zurich, Switzerland, who was among the scientists studying the remains, said: ‘Thanks to the results from 1988 up until today, we can say with great likelihood that we are dealing with the skeleton of Charlemagne.’ The team of researchers studied the dimensions of the thigh, shin and upper arm bones to get an idea of the man’s height and build – which match the descriptions of the emperor. The man now confirmed to be . Charlemagne, was six feet tall (1.84metres) weighed around 12stone . 3lbs (78kg) and had a slim build. Historians have previously estimated the emperor’s height to be between 1.79metres and 1.92metres tall. One Medieval biographer, Einhard the . Frank, wrote that Charlemagne walked with a limp in his later years, . which the scientists now think could be true. They found that the skeleton’s kneecap and heel bones had deposits that would indicate an injury of some sort. But they didn’t find any new evidence to . suggest that he died of pneumonia – or other clues about his later . health – which would back up other accounts. A total of 94 bones and fragments were . analysed from Aachen Cathedral, Germany (pictured left) and are believed to belong to the founder of . the Holy Roman Empire. The golden bust of Charlemagne, on display in the Domschatzkammer - the treasury of the cathedral - is pictured right . Historians have traditionally . described the work as the first example of a biography of a European . king and think it was written after Charlemagne's death. The . book contains intimate glimpses of Charlemagne's personal habits and . tastes, which he was knowledgeable about as he was part of the . emperor's Charlemagne's court. Most of the skeleton was discovered in the king’s golden tomb, while a few fragments of his skull were collected from inside a bust of the late emperor. It is thought that some of the missing bones ended up as relics, which were given away at the time of Charlemagne’s death. The bones were held for centuries at Aachen Cathedral, Germany (pictured) Medieval biographer Einhard the Frank wrote that Charlemagne walked with a limp in his later years and now scientists found that the skeleton's kneecap and heel bones had deposits that would indicate an injury of some sort.

Louise Keel, 46, from Caerphilly, South Wales, was heartbroken after finding out she couldn't have children of her own, so spent more than £1,000 on the lifelike curly-haired toddler. Now Bert will be dressed up in a pageboy outfit for her big day in spring 2014 when Louise, who is registered blind and uses a wheelchair, weds fiance Brian. Louise Keel of Caerphilly couldn't have children of her own so she bought 'reborn' dolls from the internet . She said: 'Finding out I couldn't have my own family left a gaping hole in my life but now I am settled and happy with my partner Brian. 'When we marry next year Bert will be my pageboy - it will mean a lot to me.' Bert is made out of a special silicon material and has lifelike skin, hair and eyes. Louise bought him after doctors told her she would never be able to have a child of her own. When her partner Brian, 48, proposed Louise started planning her wedding with Bert as the guest of honour. Louise bought Bert through after discovering a company offering 'reborn dolls' on the internet. Louise has two other lifelike dolls, Leah-Rose and Cassidy-Anne (left), which are both babies .

Every morning she wakes up early to warm bottles of formula and feed her family. Her home is filled with all the equipment new mums need, including baby bouncers, bottles and comforter blankets. Louise often wraps Bert up warm and takes him out in a buggy to feed the ducks and visit local attractions . She buys her plastic children Christmas presents and sings them lullabies at night.

'Just holding one of the dolls takes the edge off my pain. I love stroking their hair and feeling their chubby cheeks.

"By . Harriet Arkell . The woman who wrote Harry Potter has admitted she will 'never, ever top' the successful series that made her a multi-millionaire. Author JK Rowling, 48, said that the 'unexpected' success of her children's books had brought her 'money beyond my wildest dreams', which was 'marvellous and liberating'. But she said that three years after the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published, she knew she would never write anything as good. JK Rowling, worth an estimated £1billion, says she knew in 2000 she would never beat her Potter success . The first and second Harry Potter novels were published in 1997 and 1998 - there are now seven in the series . In an interview with Sky News the writer, who lives in Edinburgh with her husband, Neil Murray, and three children, said: 'By 2000 I knew perfectly well that I will never top Harry Potter -  I knew that before the series ended. 'So, what do you do if you've had that kind of success that you've never expected?  Well you can go one of two ways. 'You can think: ""Oh no how dreadful, I'll never, ever top that"", or you say say: ""How incredibly marvellous and liberating, you know, that I made money beyond my wildest dreams, I can affect issues that I really care about. '""But what do I love doing?  I love writing, so clearly I'm going to continue to write."" 'But I don't know.  I absolutely don't sit around and think I must now write a THIS kind of novel to prove that I can write it, because I always did write what I wanted to write and I will continue to do that.' The author, who has said she was 'as poor as it's possible to be' when she wrote the first Harry Potter novel as a single mother who would have just one Rich Tea biscuit for dinner, has made an estimated £1billion fortune from her books, which were also turned into films. Philanthropy: The author was publicising her Lumos charity, set up to fight children being institutionalised . The first Harry Potter was made into a film in 2001 starring Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson . Family: JK Rowling, 48, lives in Edinburgh with her doctor husband, Neil Murray - they married in 2001 . She published her most recent work, crime novel The Cuckoo Calling, in April this year under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.  After Rowling was revealed as the true author, sales rose by 4,000 per cent. Rowling's revelations came during an interview to publicise her charity Lumos, which she set up eight years ago to fight the institutionalisation of children. The author, who is said to have given millions to charity, said: 'There are 8m children globally being raised by institutions and everything we know about institutionalisation tells us it's harmful to children's physical and mental health. 'To take a child from their family...it's about the worst thing you can do to a child... That's what we're working to end.'","Author worth £1billion says she knew in 2000 she'd never beat the series .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A polish captain ran his massive ship aground off the British coast after plotting a straight line from Scotland to Belgium - forgetting that England was in the way, it is claimed. Blundering Tadeusz Dudek had been using an unapproved GPS device to navigate - similar to a car's Sat Nav, an investigation revealed. And the lookout on board the 80 metre-long MV Danio cargo ship was asleep when time the enormous vessel crashed into Farne Islands, off the North-East coast, last March. Disaster: The stricken MV Danio sitting on a mud bank on Farne Island after its captain did not realise he was approaching land . The disaster at the Farne Island nature . reserve, in Northumberland, sparked fears at the time it would break up . and its 27 tonnes of diesel fuel and 1,500 tonnes of timber would . decimate the wildlife for decades. Coastguard . surveyor Alan Thompson told a BBC Inside Out documentary: 'They basically said ""well OK . we're sailing from Perth and we're going to Antwerp and we'll draw a . line and we'll go the quickest way possible"", without really thinking.' Following the accident coastguard surveyor, Alan Thompson, detained the vessel at Blyth port. Prat Nav: The ship's captain headed in a straight line from Perth, Scotland, to Antwerp, Belgium, forgetting England was in his way . He said from the evidence they looked at there was a serious failing of the ship's safety management system. He says: 'He was using an unapproved electronic chart plotter, which is basically a bit like your GPS for the car.' Mr Thompson says from the time the Danio left Perth to the time it went to ground, there were two positions on the chart. He said: 'They basically said 'well OK we're sailing from Perth and we're . going to Antwerp and we'll draw a line and we'll go the quickest way . possible,' without really thinking.' Usually a bridge look-out should still have spotted the Farne Islands and its flashing lighthouse. Mr Thompson added: 'If he's fallen asleep it will alarm in the . captain's cabin and if the captain doesn't acknowledge it, it will ring . everywhere. 'Now the Danio did have a very basic bridge watch alarm, but it was switched off.' But . the German owner of the Danio, Frank Dahl, tells the BBC in Poland - . where the vessel is being repaired - stresses it was his company policy . to use it and he blames the Captain and the First Mate for the accident. He tells the programme: 'The technique is perfect, it's the humans that make mistakes'. Blunder: Captain Tadeusz Dudek's ship hit Farne Island, which is home to 80,000 pairs of seabirds and a large grey seal colony . He subsequently fired Captain Tadeusz Dudek, and the first mate. Captain . Dudek via telephone then tells the BBC in broken English about whether . the first mate did fall asleep and Captain Dudek replies: 'It is what he . told in his statement and it looks like it is true.' And . he admits that if he had used the alarm system the accident could have . been prevented, adding: 'Yes but I forgot. For sure this would not . happen (if the alarm had been used).' Eventually the ship was floated away . but new research shows the captain was trying to sail a straight line . from Scotland to Anterp, in Belgium - and forgot about England's . jutting-out coastline in the middle. Built in 2001, the ship was sailing six months ago with a cargo of timber but just six crew. When . it ran aground, a lifeboat was scrambled to the scene from Seahouses . and as the weather worsened and the drama unfolded, wildlife wardens on . the Farnes feared an environmental disaster. The islands are home to about 80,000 pairs of seabirds and a large grey seal colony. Warning: A lighthouse on Farne Island warns approaching ship of the dangers in the seas nearby . National . Trust Ranger, David Steel, says: 'To have a boat like that run aground . and obviously if it had started breaking up with fuel oil and the likes . spilling into the sea, it would have been devastating.' Inside . Out also reveals that 95 per cent of Britain's freight is shifted by . sea and last year a third of all ships detained for serious breaches . were found in the North East. However British authorities have still to decide whether to bring criminal charges in the case of the Danio. The programme will be broadcast tonight on BBC ONE (North East & Cumbria) at 7.30pm.","MV Danio cargo ship hit Farne Island, off the Northumberland coast .

"By . Martin Robinson . The Royal Marine who murdered a Taliban fighter should not be shown any clemency for his 'heinous crime', the head of the Armed Forces has said. The 39-year-old commando – known only . as Marine A – carried out the ‘field execution’ when he and two others . found the injured man and he then shot him in the chest. General Sir Nick Houghton believes that the gravity of the crime means he must be severely punished. 'Murder is murder, . this is a heinous crime. No serviceman or woman is above the law', he said. Challenge: Blackman and four other Marines investigated over the killing said their names should not be public . Marine A killed . the insurgent near the end of a ‘tour from hell’, during which 23 . servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade were killed and the Taliban hung the . limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’. Senior figure: Head of the Armed Forces General Houghton said not severely punishing murders would 'erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies' Not punishing him would severely 'erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies', General Houghton said. ‘It would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading, some sort of exemption,' he said. ‘If . we try to put ourselves beyond the law or expect special provision from . the law, then we start to erode the position where we have a moral . ascendancy over those who are our enemies. Those in authority over the armed forces should not request any form of leniency... we should be . immaculate in these respects.’ Lord . Guthrie, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, agreed and said: ‘The military . should observe the highest standards, and if some crime is committed, . like everybody else they should pay the price. Murder is murder.’ Marine A was found guilty by a court . martial of shooting the injured insurgent in the chest at close range . with a 9mm pistol, then taunting him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you . c***.’ He was convicted after a two-and-a-half week trial of slaying the insurgent on September 15, 2011. He will be sentenced on December 6 and could face life in prison. His . badly injured victim was found with an AK-47 assault rifle and grenade . following an attack on a British base. He denied murder, claiming he . thought the insurgent was already dead. He is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active . service abroad since the Second World War. His closest friends and family maintain that his killing was out of character. A family friend told the Mail: ‘We know him and the shooting was not him, it wasn’t in character. He is keeping positive.’ Harrowing: Video from a Marine's helmet camera was shown at the court martial, which captured the moment Blackman murdered the Taliban soldier in this field . Footage: The recording hears the group dragging the man's injured body with the Marines apparently joking about refusing to give first aid . Relatives of troops who died as they served alongside Marine A in 42 . Commando criticised the military authorities for prosecuting him. One . bereaved father said the decision was ‘inappropriate’. Others said the . unique psychological pressures of war should be taken into account. Retired . Colonel Mike Dewar said it was important to ‘make exceptions for . soldiers in extraordinary circumstances’. He added: ‘This is a . completely different environment to a cold-blooded murder in normal . circumstances.’ The sergeant, a 15-year veteran who . served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, is preparing a . last-ditch legal bid to block the release of his name. His . legal team plan to appeal against a ruling to lift the anonymity order, . claiming it breached the commando’s human rights by putting him and his . family at risk of revenge attacks. But . campaigners have warned that letting a convicted murderer hide behind a . veil of secrecy would seriously undermine the principle of open . justice. Murderers are usually named by the courts. Some . senior retired commanders, including Major General Julian Thompson, who . led the elite commandos in the Falklands War, have called for leniency . when Marine A is sentenced.","Marine A, 39, executed a Taliban fighter after Apache helicopter attack .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Home Secretary Theresa May warned the health of democratic politics would be undermined if the BBC squeezes out local competition . The BBC is ‘destroying’ local newspapers by using its taxpayer-funded dominance to squeeze out competition, Theresa May has warned. The Home Secretary condemned the BBC for using the licence fee to fund websites in direct competition with regional and national newspapers. And she warned that as papers close, fewer sources of news will become ‘dangerous to the health of democratic politics’. Mrs May is the latest senior Tory to publicly criticise the BBC, stepping up pressure on the Corporation over its management and spending. She said local newspapers are having ‘a particularly hard time’, which is being made worse by the ‘BBC's dominant position on the internet and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee’. ‘This makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local media to buy a paper? ‘It's destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well.’ Speaking to the Society of Editors' annual conference in London, Mrs May warned: ‘This is as dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism. ‘Because as a local MP I value the ability to raise issues in my constituency in my local newspaper but also I value its role in disseminating information about what I and local councillors are doing in the area.’ She added: ‘This is a debate that won't go away and I believe the BBC has to think carefully about its presence locally and the impact it has on local democracy.’ Mrs May said she believed ‘a plurality of news sources is essential to our democracy’. She warned if newspapers are forced to close down, the country could be left with a single source of information. The Home Secretary said: ‘At a national level, we have a healthy number of competing newspapers in Britain and that's something we surely don't want to lose.’ HQ: The Tories have stepped up criticism against the BBC over its culture, management and spending . Mrs May went on: ‘A monopoly on the provision of information would be a perennial temptation to malpractice, inefficiency and corruption in exactly the same way almost every other kind of monopoly is. ‘No single source of news can possibly represent the variety of opinion that there is in this country and a monopoly news provider would be far too easily captured by special interests. ‘So competition in the provision of news is essential to democracy and diminishing competition is dangerous to the health of democratic politics. ‘That's why it's important that the internet does not have the effect of making a plurality of newspapers commercially impossible in Britain.’ Mrs May is the second senior Tory in as many weeks to draw attention to BBC's role in the political process after party chairman Grant Shapps accused the corporation of biased reporting and questioned its funding. He warned that the television licence fee could be cut unless the BBC tackles a 'culture' of secrecy, waste and bias. Mr Shapps said the Corporation must rebuild confidence following the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall abuse scandals, controversy over fat cat salaries and pay-offs to stars and senior executives.","Theresa May accuses Corporation of squeezing out local competition .

"By . Riath Al-samarrai . The 'spygate' scandal at Cardiff City has taken a new twist, with the club denying reports that they have requested the Premier League overturn their 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace earlier this month. The BBC claim to have seen a five-page letter from Cardiff, in which they allegedly say the result should not stand after allegedly unearthing evidence that Palace director of football Iain Moody contacted club employees to find out team information. But a well-placed Cardiff source insisted to Sportsmail that their formal complaint did not make such a request. Living on a prayer: Vincent Tan has accused former director Moody of using inside information against Cardiff . Six-pointer: Crystal Palace beat rivals Cardiff 3-0 to move clear of the Premier League relegation zone . Accused: Cardiff claim they have concrete evidence against Iain Moody (left), who is fearing for his job at Palace . The source instead claims Cardiff have requested an investigation into the saga, as revealed by Sportsmail on Monday. The . source said: 'The club is not asking for the result to be changed – . that would sound like sour grapes. We ask that the Premier League look . into the situation.' The Premier has confirmed it is looking into the matter to ascertain what rules may have been breached. It is understood that Cardiff are claiming the incident goes against the Premier League's rules on 'good faith'. Rule . B15 states: 'In all matters and transactions relating to the league . each club shall behave towards each other club and the league with the . utmost good faith.' Cardiff's . allegations are understood to claim Moody, who was sacked by the club . last year, contacted at least three members of their staff ahead of . their fixture earlier this month. Moody has previously denied the allegations. A . prominent Cardiff source claims manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was made . aware of what was allegedly going on when a message sent from Moody's . phone was received by a third party, listing the starting 11 that . Solskjaer ultimately fielded against Palace. The recipient tipped off Solskjaer, who alerted the club's hierarchy, but the Norwegian opted against changing his team. An independent commission may be asked to rule on Cardiff's complaint. League . chiefs will decide whether the complaint should be taken forward - it . is understood there remains uncertainty about whether any regulation . would have been breached even if the allegation was proven. If . the complaint is taken forward it could be dealt with by either the . Premier League's board or more likely an independent commission.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Happy marriage: The actress says she has cracked the formula with Percy Gibson, 48, her fifth husband . With five husbands under her belt, you could say Joan Collins is something of an expert on marriage. But given four of those relationships ended in divorce, perhaps her rules for marital bliss should be taken with a pinch of salt. The 80-year-old actress has shared the secrets of her continued happiness with fifth husband Percy Gibson, saying they never use the same bathroom, and never interfere with each others' lives. She said: 'There are rules for living with Joan Collins, but I'm sure there are rules for living with anyone. We're never in the bathroom together. 'In fact, I think it's important to have separate bathrooms. He never interferes with my social calendar. I never interfere with his financial work. I occasionally give him advice on how he looks, but he's the least vain man I've ever known. 'The only time he looks in the mirror is when he's shaving.' Miss Collins and theatrical manager Mr Gibson - who is 32-years her junior - married in 2002. She admitted she 'wasn't interested in getting married again' at first, but changed her mind after they became close friends and insisted her current marriage is 'for good'. And despite her reputation as a strong-minded diva, she insisted she does not boss him around at home. She told the Sunday Times Magazine: 'Day-to-day life with him is very normal. Despite what people may think, no, I don't wear the trousers in our house. I don't make him do the hovering or the washing-up. 'He's a man's man and he likes to take charge. He likes to be in control. I suppose you could say we share the trousers; one leg each.' Dynasty ambitions: Joan planned a family with husband Ron Kass, whom she met through a mutual friend . 'He'd also become quite profligate': The . couple's marriage was already on the rocks when their eight-year-old . daughter was involved in a terrible car accident . 'I was fascinated by his talent': Joan met her . second husband Anthony Newley, pictured here with their daughter Tara, . while he was starring in the West End box-office smash Stop The World . In the same interview, Mr Gibson said his wife's romantic past never caused him to have second thoughts, despite the fact he was initially 'star struck' by her. He said: 'Obviously, I knew Joan had ""baggage"" - her past was out there - but you don't marry Joan Collins unless you know what you're walking into. 'I just wanted to make her happy. Of course there was a lot of soul-searching about the age difference. Co-producers: The actress was married to singer . Peter Holm between 1985 and 1986. He became her manager and co-produced . two of her television mini-series with her, Sins and Monte Carlo . 'I didn't want this man around my daughter': Joan claims Peter turned into a fiend - angry, sulky and rude . 'We knew it would impact on our lives, but we quickly came to the realisation that it only mattered in terms of the way it was perceived by other people. 'Can you put an age limit on finding love and companionship?' Miss Collins' first marriage was to actor Maxwell Reed in 1952. She later said it was a 'farce'. She later married - and divorced - actor and singer Anthony Newley, businessman Ron Kass, and Swedish singer Peter Holm.","80-year-old actress has been married five times - first in 1952 .

"By . Sophie Borland . NHS staff are being told not to say sorry when asking grieving relatives if they will donate loved ones’ organs. Guidelines instruct them not  to use ‘negative or apologetic language’ but instead stress the benefits the organs could bring to critically ill patients. They have been issued by the NHS in the hope of boosting the number of donors, saving hundreds of lives. Guidance: The advice instructs staff not to be 'negative or apologetic' when asking about organ donation . There are 10,000 patients who need new . organs – most commonly livers, kidneys and hearts – and three die every . day while on waiting lists. But although more people are signing up to be donors, most die at an age when their organs are no longer fit to be given to someone else. There are concerns that relatives occasionally override a dead patient’s wishes by refusing to allow organ donation. The NHS’s Blood and Transplant Authority is hoping to change attitudes to the issue. Paul Murphy, the organisation’s national clinical lead, said the highly sensitive discussions would not take place until families had come to terms with the death. He said: ‘Their death is sudden, it  is unexpected, it is untimely, it is occasionally violent – a road traffic accident, an assault. ‘This is someone you have kissed goodbye on the way to work this morning and now you have been told they are dead. ‘Decision-making for families in these circumstances is desperately difficult and desperately unstable. ‘This is not (about obtaining) a “yes” at any cost. It is about getting the right person there to give the family the best possible support, even if they say no.’ The guidelines, published this year, tell staff to avoid phrases such as ‘I am asking you because it is policy’ or ‘I am sorry to have to ask you’. Support: Staff are being encouraged to tell grieving families that, by becoming a donor their relative has a chance to save lives (picture posed by model) They should use positive language, such as ‘by becoming a donor your relative has a chance to save and transform the lives of many others’. The guidance adds that relatives are less likely to refuse if the topic is breeched sensitively. ‘The consistent message from the available evidence is that approaching families in certain ways arbitrarily prompts a premature refusal, and that avoiding such pitfalls can result – quite legitimately – in improved rates of family consent,’ it adds. It tells staff to question relatives if they do initially refuse. They are encouraged to ask them: ‘How do you think your husband would feel about organ donation?’ The NHS Blood and Transplant Authority says relatives normally only override patients’ wishes when they had no idea that they were on the donor register. This summer the organisation announced that it was considering giving registered donors priority on waiting lists for transplants. But critics warn this could unfairly discriminate against those who don’t want to sign up because of strong religious or ethical views. In July, the Welsh Government passed a law meaning that from 2015 everyone will be on the organ donor register unless they opt-out.","Guidelines say not to be ‘negative or apologetic’ about the subject .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . A controversial scheme to get women to breastfeed in return for store vouchers amounts to ‘bribery’, critics have warned. They say rewarding mothers who don’t rely on formula milk could penalise those who can’t physically feed their babies. Concern was also mounting the system could be abused after it emerged that mothers taking part will not have to demonstrate they are breastfeeding – instead their compliance will be ‘taken on trust’. Sensible use of public resources: Mothers taking part will not even have to demonstrate they are breastfeeding ¿ instead their compliance will be ¿taken on trust' It is feared that the feasibility study, aimed at finding ways to push up the UK’s low rates of breastfeeding, would not be rigorous enough to justify the use of taxpayer funding. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said: ‘This just doesn’t seem like a sensible use of public resources. The reasons why women don’t breastfeed are far more complex than this gives credit for – bribing women doesn’t tackle that, it just encourages them to take the money.’ Altogether 130 women in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire taking part could earn up to £200 in vouchers for Matalan, Tesco and John Lewis. If the initial scheme is successful, it could be rolled out nationally. However, midwives and health visitors will sign off the form for rewards without actually observing the breast feeding. Pilot: The scheme is being tested in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire but could be rolled out nationally . Once the form-filling is complete, the mothers will receive the first vouchers in bundles of £40 over three weeks. A spokesman for Sheffield University, which is running the four-month pilot, said: ‘It is a trust relationship, but the midwife will know from conversation and working with the mum if she is breast feeding.’ Currently one in four women does not attempt to breastfeed – one of the worst rates in the world.The Department of Health is funding the project, however, Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter stressed he did not believe it was the best way forward. He said: ‘Breastfeeding has huge health benefits. But it should be a woman’s choice to breastfeed and we know not all mothers are able to. Professor Mitch Blair, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the initiative may penalise mothers who are unable to breastfeed. Professor Laurence Moore, Scientific Committee, National Prevention Research Initiative, said: ‘This is a feasibility study – we don’t know if it will be effective or not. It’s worth finding out whether such a novel intervention might work.’ Television presenter Kirstie Allsopp, 42, who has two sons and two stepsons, tweeted her disagreement with the idea. She tweeted last night: ‘All day I’ve tried not to tweet about this Breast Feeding vouchers idea, and say it’s a f****** stupid bulls***idea, now I’ve failed.’","Critics say the scheme amounts to 'bribery' and rewarding some mothers discriminates against those who can’t physically feed their babies .

British man Babar Ahmad has pleaded guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan through websites that sought to raise cash, recruit fighters and solicit items such as gas masks. Ahmad, along with fellow Briton Syed Talha Ahsan, pleaded guilty in US District Court in New Haven to charges of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. By pleading guilty, the men 'admitted that they knew that their efforts could result in the maiming and murder of individuals, including US citizens,' acting US Attorney Deirdre Daly said. Ahmad was finally extradited to the US last year after an eight year legal battle. Babar Ahmad, left, and Syed Talha Ahsan, right, have pleaded guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan through websites that sought to raise cash and recruit fighters . A prosecutor said Ahsan traveled to Afghanistan with Ahmad's assistance to fight and attend a training camp run by al-Qaida, but Ahsan didn't admit that. Both men possessed a classified document discussing a U.S. Navy battle group's movements and vulnerability to attack, authorities said. A former Navy sailor was sentenced in 2009 to 10 years in prison for leaking the details about the battle group to the website, but the group was never attacked. John Sandweg, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said: 'This investigation further demonstrates law enforcement's resolve to bring to justice anyone who supports those who would target American interests at home or abroad.'

The judge didn't immediately accept Ahmad's plea while she awaits information from probation officials, but she said the plea was voluntarily made. The two men, British citizens who were living in Britain at the time, faced charges in Connecticut because authorities said they used an Internet service provider in the state to run one of the websites. A charge of conspiring to kill people in a foreign country will be dismissed under the plea agreement. The websites operated under the name of Azzam Publications, which authorities say provided support to Afghanistan's ousted Taliban regime and focused on the wars in Bosnia and Chechnya in the 1990s. The sites asked for donations of military suits and gas masks for the Taliban and appealed to Pakistanis to travel to Afghanistan to fight, according to Ahmad's plea agreement. A sketch shows Syed Talha Ahsan right appearing in court in the US . The websites posted articles on how to train for fighting and gave guidance on how women could participate in jihad, or holy war. The sites produced videos of Muslims detailing their experiences on the battlefield in Bosnia and advertised videos of battles in Chechnya. Ahsan, 34, has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, said his attorney, Richard Reeve, who described him as very intelligent. He said Ahsan didn't operate the websites. Ahmad, 39, was held without trial for eight years in a British prison, raising concerns among human rights advocates. He said in court that he was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder in 2009 and 2010, but he didn't offer details. In an interview after the BBC won a legal battle to speak with him, Ahmad insisted he didn't condone terrorism and urged authorities to put him on trial in the U.K. He acknowledged he had visited Bosnia several times during the 1990s and had been involved in the conflict there. Ahmad faces up to 25 years in prison and Ahsan faces up to 15 when they are sentenced on March 4.","Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan both admitted charges in US District Court in New Haven .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Search teams will 'stop listening for pings' from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's black box unless new signals are picked up, it has been revealed. Ten planes and 14 ships were scouring around 16,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean today in a bid to locate the device before its emergency beacons fade. But a U.S. Navy captain has said they could 'give up' on the acoustic search following two days without a ping. Scroll down for video . Giving up: Search teams will 'stop listening for pings' from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's black box unless new signals are picked up, it has been revealed. Above, the U.S. Navy's towed pinger locator (TPL-25) Vessel: The TPL-25 and Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle are currently on board the Royal Australian Navy Ship Ocean Shield (pictured). Ten planes and 14 ships were scouring the southern Indian Ocean today . 'When the time is right, we’ll . say ""Yes, the beacons have probably stopped transmitting"" and it’s time . to shift,' Captain Mark Matthews told ABC News. He added that the team wanted a 'few more days' to try and narrow down the underwater search  area, saying: 'As . long as we have a chance to receive another signal from the beacon, . we’re going to try.' Capt Matthews is in charge of the towed pinger locator (TPL-25) - that detects black box signals - and the Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle. Both are currently on board the Royal Australian Navy Ship Ocean Shield. Moving on: U.S. Navy captain, Mark Matthews (above), said: 'When the time is right, we'll say ""Yes, the beacons have probably stopped transmitting""' He said that after 'giving up' the 'pinger' search, the navy would 'shift' to the Bluefin-21, which uses sonar to map around 12 square miles of ocean floor every day. It comes just days after a fifth ping . was detected around 1,500 miles north west of Perth, in western Australia. The signal was captured on Thursday by a Royal . Australian Air Force Orion P-3 aircraft, which had been dropping sonar buoys into the water at the time. The . buoys each have a hydrophone listening device that dangles about 300 . metres (1,000 feet) below the surface and their data are sent via radio . back to a plane, Royal Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy said. However, Angus Houston, who is . coordinating the search for the plane, later said in a statement that an . initial assessment had determined the signal was not related to an . aircraft black box. Last Saturday, two sounds detected by the TPL-25 were found to be consistent with the signals emitted from aircraft black boxes - flight data and cockpit voice recorders. And a further two 'pings' were picked up on Tuesday. However, no 'credible' signals have been heard since, Capt Matthews said. It has now been five weeks since the Boeing 777 mysteriously vanished as it flew from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board on March 8. As time passes, the signals from its black box's locator beacons continue to fade, while the data it contains could be lost forever if its month-long battery dies. Finding the black boxes after the . batteries fail will be extremely difficult because the water in the area . is 4,500 metres (15,000 feet) deep.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Britain's youngest parents went on a romantic weekend away together shortly before their baby was born, it has been revealed. The mother, 12, and father, 13, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent time together in a caravan in Clacton--on-Sea last month, shortly before she gave birth to their daughter last weekend. The pair, from North London, apparently bought a 'True Love' bracelet which they split in half, keeping one part each, and wrote each other's names in the sand. Scroll down for interview with girl's father . Youngest: Mother, 12, and father, 13, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pictured after their daughter is born. A month before the birth the young couple apparently went on a romantic beach break together in a caravan in Clacton . According to The Sun the young mother then wrote a gushing message about her partner on Facebook and posted pictures of the break, alongside another picture she posted of her primary school leaving party. The trip took place a month ago, around the time the girl's father claims he found out about the tryst, which he claims was carried out behind his back. In an interview with LBC Radio, a man claiming to be the girl's father said he had only found out a month ago that his daughter was pregnant, around the same time the two went away together. He said: 'Unfortunately kids this age are going to grow up to have boyfriends and partners or whatever. 'If they do things behind their parents back that's something we're never going to be able to find out. 'We only found that she was actually pregnant a month ago. For us what can you do?' The pair are thought to have stayed in a static caravan, much like this one (file picture). They also bought a bracelet with 'True Love' written on it which they split in two, keeping one half each . While visiting the Essex seaside town the pair took a trip to the beach and wrote each other's names in the sand . He also said that the family are 'not scroungers' and will be paying to bring up the child themselves, rather than relying on benefits. However, in Middlesbrough, the UK's teen pregnancy capital, other teenage mothers are unashamedly admitting to having children for the sake of getting a council house. Speaking to The Sun, Bryony Fisher, 21, said: 'Many girls do it for the benefits and to get a house. They're quite open about it.' The former factory town, which boomed in the mid-1800s on the back of the iron-working industry, has a teen pregnancy rate which is more than double the national average. In 2012, for every 1,00 girls aged 15-17 in Middlesbrough, 68.6 got pregnant, an unexpected rise after several years of falling numbers. Middlesbrough is the UK's teen pregnancy capital, where the number of young mothers is more than double the UK average. It is also the youth unemployment capital, with some young mothers admitting they got pregnant to increase their benefits . Middlesbrough is also the UK's youth unemployment hotspot, with one in three people under 25 out of work, and is among the worst areas in school results too. Kelly Warren, who first fell pregnant aged 17, said: 'There's no jobs here so people get bored. They binge drink and then just start fighting. 'A lot don't want to work and just use their kids to get more benefits, but not me. I worked before I was pregnant and I want to work again when my baby is older.' Middlesbrough Mayor Ray Mallon, a former police superintendent known as 'Robocop' for his no-nonsense attitude to crime, has previously despaired of some of Middlesbrough's worst families. He alleged that one family had cost the council £600,000 a year due to council interventions, and that another mother gave her 13-year-old daughter three ecstasy pills to celebrate her becoming a teenager.","Mother, 12, and father, 13, became UK's youngest parents last weekend .

"By . Simon Cable . To many it is as much a part of Christmas as turkey or carolling, but families will have to dig deeper in their pockets to afford this year’s festive edition of Radio Times. The two-week special edition of the listings magazine, which goes on sale next Wednesday, will cost £3.20 – a rise of 14 per cent on last year’s issue, which cost £2.80. The increase is also a 45 per cent jump in price in just four years. The two-week special edition of the listings magazine, which goes on sale next Wednesday, will cost £3.20 . However, at least readers will be able to welcome back Santa Claus to the magazine’s cover for the first time since 2009, after he was removed so as not to upset cash-strapped families who couldn’t afford presents following the onset of the financial crisis. The 294-page Christmas issue will have a print run of almost 2.5 million copies, up from the normal weekly run of 900,000. Last year’s issue, which had The Snowman and the Snowdog on the front cover, sold 2.17 million copies. A total of 48 pages of advertising have been booked, up on 40 last year, which will bring in more than £2million. When sales are included, the Christmas edition is expected to make around £7.5million for the publishers, Immediate Media. Listings: The guide has become as traditional as turkey but the price jump will see people digging deep to pay for it . Father Christmas was banished from the festive edition’s front cover in 2010, with the publisher claiming that a ‘symbol of the boom years’ wasn’t reflective of the nation’s mood during an economic crisis. A picture of Wallace and Gromit was used in 2010, and a ‘festive flowing illustration’ of a Christmas tree in 2011, which it felt better reflected the tough economic climate by ‘harking back to simpler times’. Radio Times was sold by the BBC in 2011 to private equity company Exponent. The deal was part of a £121million sell-off involving 11 titles owned by the corporation, including Gardens Illustrated.","Two-week special edition costs £3.20 .

"By . Damien Gayle . 'Couldn't be bothered to pay': Russell Brand claims that he jumped the barriers to avoid paying the train fare from London to Chelmsford, Essex . Multimillionaire comedian Russell Brand has made a fresh bid to bolster his revolutionary image... by boasting that he dodged a train fare. The comedian has admitted jumping the barrier on a journey from London to Chelmsford in Essex, saving him from a £14.90 hit to his estimated £15million fortune. He claimed that he didn't make the effort to pull out his credit card at the ticket office because he 'couldn't be bothered with the rigmarole of getting one'. Brand has come under fire for his vocal espousal of revolutionary socialist politics while enjoying a luxury lifestyle including stays at the Savoy in London and the purchase of a sumptuous home in the Hollywood Hills. He claims that his vast wealth has not changed him. The Mirror quoted the 38-year-old as saying: 'From someone that's gone from no wealth to wealth, I know that money doesn't make me happier. Like I jumped the train yesterday when I had to go to Chelmsford. 'I could have got a ticket but I couldn't be bothered with the rigmarole of getting of getting one. 'I realised all I had to do was get over a barrier so I did that and then slid out the other end behind someone.' Brand's self-alleged act of civil disobedience is just the latest in a line of anti-establishment arguments and claims he has spouted in recent months. But commentators say the comedian's professed enthusiasm for revolutionary anarchism and the overthrow of the capitalist economic system is a poor fit for his own money making schemes. The Daily Mail's Paul Scott revealed last November how Brand - who has called for an end to 'massive economic disparity' - has been trying to court 'high-net-worth' investors into stumping up cash for a new film, with the company behind the scheme highlighting the potential 60 per cent tax breaks for those getting involved. 'Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference': Brand's political activism has led to charges of hypocrisy, given that he enjoys a luxury lifestyle including a mansion in Hollywood and stays at the Savoy . In the UK, Brand is the director of . three separate entertainment companies, Mayfair Film Partnership, the . colourfully titled Pablo Diablo’s Legitimate Business Firm, and another . called One Arm Bandit Limited. Mayfair . turned over more than £1.5million last year, making close to £800,000 . for its shareholders. Latest accounts for the latter two firms, . meanwhile, show they turned over more than £370,000 last year, which . means Brand’s British businesses alone grossed close to £2million. Meanwhile, . the wannabe movie mogul, who still commands fees of around £5million . for acting roles in Hollywood, has been settling in to a five-bedroom . mansion in Hollywood that was once owned by Lawrence Olivier and, from . its commanding hillside position, boasts stunning views of the twinkling . lights of Los Angeles arrayed below. And . when he returns to Britain to foment revolution, he has been often seen . staying at the Savoy hotel on the Strand, that well-known doss house . and hotbed of anti-establishment sentiment close to Waterloo Bridge. Not so Anonymous: Brand supported the Anonymous Million Mask March in London from Trafalgar Square to the Houses of Parliament. London, United Kingdom on Guy Fawkes Night last November . Despite such apparent hypocrisies, Brand remains a darling of the Left and an icon to the young, many of whom feel disenfranchised by the homogeneity of political views expressed by the Westminster political machine and identify with the comedian's call for drastic political change. A poll by the House of Commons' own Committee on Standards in Public Life found that four in 10 people feel so alienated by politicians that they might not bother voting - with many giving reasons that resonated with Brand's own argument that he has never voted because he regards politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant. Last November, Brand told the BBC's flagship Newsnight political programme: 'I'm angry, because for me its real. this is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution. 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' A spokesman for Greater Anglia, which runs the London to Chelmsford route, declined to comment on Brand's claim, but said: 'We take fare evasion very seriously as it is in the interest of everyone who travels.'","Russell Brand's self-alleged fare evasion saved him £14.90 .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . Authorities say they have discovered an incomplete smuggling tunnel along the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the unfinished tunnel was found this week during a joint effort by U.S. and Mexican authorities. Authorities noticed freshly disturbed dirt within the channel floor of a drainage system near a port of entry in Nogales. Unfinished: The tunnel extends 133 feet into the United States from Mexico . Discovery: The tunnel was discovered Wednesday, in Nogales, west of the DeConcini Port, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection . They later discovered a tunnel that begins in Mexico and extends 133 feet into the U.S., but it did not yet have an opening from the ground. The tunnel is three-foot-high, meaning anyone intending to use it would have to crawl on hands and knees. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Nicole Ballistera, the tunnel was discovered in a routine patrol. She said its root was only seven feet into Mexico but extended 133 feet into the United States. As U.S. border security has surged on land, drug cartels have turned to the sky, sea and tunneling beneath the ground to avoid detection. By chance: Authorties noticed fresh dirt within the floor of a drainage system led them to the tunnel . Incomplete: The three-foot high tunnel did not yet have an opening in the U.S. More than 75 such underground passages have been found along the border since 2008, concentrated largely in California and Arizona. In December, authorities reported another tunnel, also in Nogales. In November 2013, a sophisticated tunnel was found that ran from near Tijuana airport to San Diego. It was fitted out with an electric rail system, ventilation and lighting. Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327lb of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery.","Authorities discovered an incomplete tunnel leading from Mexico into Arizona this week .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Britain’s owl population is still suffering the consequences of last winter’s wet and windy weather months later. Staff at Tiggywinkles wildlife hospital in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, have rescued 31 owls which had fallen from trees, compared with just two of the young birds of prey last year. Les Stocker, Tiggywinkles founder, said: ‘I am worried as last year we had just two owls in and this year we now have 31. Perhaps the storms taking out old trees might have something to do with it. Owl stretching time: These baby tawny owls will be spending the Whitsun bank holiday at Tiggywinkles wildlife hospital in Buckinghamshire after being rescued by the workers there . ‘Adult owls have been forced to seek new nest sites that aren’t as secure. The babies then fall out onto the ground. ‘My worry is that this is only in my catchment area. How many more are going to be lost across the country?’ Mr Stocker said that the orphans are aged between four days and two weeks and were rescued over a short period of time. These baby owls are among the lucky ones who have been found and taken to safety - others may not be so lucky. From last winter there has been 1,450 per cent increase from last year on owls found . They were all found on the ground in areas such as Milton Keynes, Henley on Thames, High Wycombe, Amersham and Tring. Suffering from starvation and dehydration they were given specialist care for the first 24 hours and are likely to be realised in the autumn, Mr Stocker added. Stormy weather?

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A first-time mother diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant had to be induced a month early in order to have a mastectomy. Roisin Pelan, 32, was diagnosed with the disease when she was 35 weeks pregnant. Surgery to remove the tumour - just days after baby Ivy was born - means she is now unable to breastfeed her baby daughter. Roisin Pelan was diagnosed with breast cancer 35 weeks into her pregnancy and had to be induced a month early to undergo a mastectomy . While pregnancy doesn't trigger breast cancer, the hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy can accelerate its growth . Mrs Pelan, from Preston, Lancashire, said: 'I'm only 32 - I didn’t want to lose my breast or be ill when having a new baby. 'But I feel lucky now that I know it’s not spread. I am really positive now.' The medical secretary was diagnosed with breast cancer just a week after finding a lump in her left breast. She said: 'I was moisturising - as you do to avoid stretch marks - and I found a lump in my left breast. 'Doctors told me there was a 50-60 per cent chance it was malignant - but within days they got me back in to say it was breast cancer. 'They were really good at reassuring me but the more time that went by, the  more I was thinking, what if it has spread?' Ivy was born on June 19, weighing 6lb, 7oz, and her mother (with partner Michael) had surgery six days later . Chemotherapy after the surgery meant Mrs Pelan was unable to breastfeed baby Ivy . The news left Mrs Pelan and her partner, Michael Brown, 29, fearing the worst for their unborn child. She said: 'All the way through the pregnancy I had been so excited - but when it came to it, I just wanted them to induce me. 'As awful as it sounds I just wanted the birth out of the way. It took all the excitement away. There was so much waiting, I couldn’t sleep or eat. Ivy and her father, Michael, who praised Roisin's bravery throughout the ordeal . 'I just wanted the breast off - I wanted the cancer out.' Baby Ivy was born on June 19, weighing 6lb 7oz, and six days later her mother underwent a mastectomy. Mrs Pelan said: 'I had a meltdown after the mastectomy. I thought I might not be around, but I have to keep reminding myself how lucky I was.' 'My job means I had more knowledge of cancer than many people - and that’s not necessarily a good thing.' Chemotherapy after the surgery meant she was also unable to breastfeed. She said: 'With the chemo I couldn’t breast feed - and I’ve only got one breast, so I was given a tablet to stop me producing any milk. 'Having the breast removed wasn’t my choice, but the only thing I have been thinking is ""it’s hasn't spread"".' She is now fundraising for Cancer Research UK, and is having her head shaved at the weekend, before donating the hair to the Little Princess Trust. Her partner Michael, an engineer, praised her determination throughout the ordeal. 'She’s been very brave, she’s brilliant.'

"By . Ruth Styles . He's guzzled blood direct from the veins of a cow, spent weeks enduring sub-zero temperatures and gone hunting in the desert equipped with nothing more than poison-tipped arrows. Meet biologist turned explorer, Hazen Audel, 40, from Washington: the star of National Geographic's new survival show, Survive the Tribe and a man not shy of getting in touch with his wild side. But unlike Bear Grylls, this is one TV survival expert who really does live the experience and says he'd rather sleep in a palm-leaf shack than a luxury hotel. Scroll down for video . Nice to meet you: Hazen with San tribesmen Touka, Mosse, Joseph and Jonas in Namibia's Kalahari Desert . Taking part: During his time with the San people, Hazen learned to hunt using poison-tipped spears and arrows . 'If I didn’t show my experience as it really was I would be doing a . disservice to the tribes I live with,' he insists. 'The people I lived . with on every episode showed me so, so much. 'After living with these people, eating with them, helping them find and grow food, . getting to know their children and sleeping every night under the same roof . or stars...the bonds you make with these people are . indescribable. 'If I didn’t show my real experience, it would be like . lying to my family. Unfortunately the camera is rarely there all the time but I certainly . am.' Audel, whose first experience of tribal living came when he decamped to Ecuador aged 18, has spent the last year living with a variety of different tribes, among them the Samburu of Kenya and Namibia's San people. Other tribes to feature on the new show include the hunter-gatherer Huaorani people of Ecuador, Mongolia's Kazakh population and Canada's Inuit - many of whom still live traditional lifestyles, complete with igloos and reindeer. Bleak: Hazen also spent time with the Kazakh people of Mongolia who hunt using eagles . Remote: The Samburu people of Kenya live in the Rift Valley and live on a mix of cattle blood and milk . Tasty: Hazen gives water to some of the Samburu people's cattle during his stay in Kenya . But while going on shark catching expeditions with the Solomon Islanders proved the most hazardous, it was the Samburu's lifestyle that proved hardest to cope with - in no small part because of their blood and milk diet. 'I lived on cow's blood and milk for . almost three weeks,' remembers Audell, who in one scene, slurps blood direct from the animal's vein. 'There weren't any other options but that said, this diet is . what has allowed the Samburu to live in one of the driest and hottest . places on Earth.' Despite the lack of alternatives, Audel admits that he did find the tribe's 'blood milkshakes' hard to stomach. 'I never got used to . drinking blood,' he confesses. 'Mixing it with milk, which I like to call a . blood smoothie, made it only a tiny bit better.' The one alternative he did get to try was goat, although according to the 40-year-old, that wasn't much nicer. 'The Samburu warriors and I killed a goat to . eat and there was not an ounce of fat on that animal,' he recounts. 'I can remember . eating the ribs as they were cooked over the fire. It was like eating . chopsticks with a touch of dried meat paint that you scraped off with your . teeth. 'But . when it was all said and done, there was nothing left of that goat. The next . day, I discovered my host mother tanning the goat skin while children had . made rattles out of the hooves and my host father had made clothing . hooks out of the horns.  I . learned to not take food for granted.' Memorable though his time with the Samburu was, it was the Huaorani, the same Ecuadorian tribe with whom he lived as a teen, that he most enjoyed living with. 'The Huaorani will always be a favorite . of mine,' he reveals. 'They took me in as a teenager and their way of life made me . question my own in so many ways. 'They have such strong family and . kinship bonds with one another within their communities. Everyone takes care of . each other.' Terrifying: During his time with Ecuador's Huaorani people, Hazen lived deep in the jungle . Remote: Life for the Huaorani involves devising elaborate ways to trap birds and animals living in the forest . What's more, he adds, the Huaorani could give the Samburu a run for their money when it comes to feats of physical endurance too. 'Seeing a 70-year-old man climb 100 feet up a tree . without branches and run through the swamps and jungles after wild game . with spears, showed me what humans are capable of - even at old age,' says an admiring Audel. But not everyone grew up in a rainforest or in the beautiful Great Rift Valley and as a result, says Audell, surviving in the wild shouldn't be taken lightly. 'It comes down to experience,' he explains. 'Inexperienced people don’t see the hazards and they don’t understand the . priorities of keeping themselves alive. Freezing: Living with the Inuit people of Canada proved challenging thanks to the extreme cold . Shark hunt: During his trip to the Solomon Islands, Hazen hunted Great White sharks in a flimsy canoe . 'You often hear stories of . people that get lost, give up and die because they were trying to find a way to . fix their mobile and they freeze to death despite having a lighter in . their pocket. 'If I had given up when I was lost in the . rainforest with the Huaoranis or when I was so dehydrated and over . heated driving cattle up a mountain with the Samburu or when I thought I was . going to freeze to death in the Arctic with the Inuit - in real survival situations like that, those those that give up, die. 'What some people see as survival skills, . I look upon as my lifestyle,' he continues. 'I don’t want the places I love to be spots that I have to fight to stay alive in and fight to get . out of. 'I want to learn all the ways to make these places useful so I can spend more time in them and even thrive there.' Survive The Tribe starts on Thursday 17th July at 9pm on National Geographic Channel . While you're unlikely to run into too many difficulties in the wilds of London or Edinburgh, should you find yourself marooned in the Brecon Beacons or on Dartmoor, these survival tips could save your life: . LEARN FROM THE LOCALS . 'The tribes are the ultimate experts in their terrain, whether it’s jungle, desert, mountain or Arctic ice. 'Survival knowledge is passed from generation to generation by word of mouth. Every skill and secret is passed on by the tribal elders. Theirs is a vital role and key to the tribe’s continued survival.' UNDERSTAND NATURE . 'Understanding the natural world is key to survival wherever you are. It can provide you with everything you need – food, water and shelter – and help keep you away from the plants and animals you want to avoid.' USE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS . 'Tribal survival is not just about now it’s about the future. Indigenous peoples are the masters at living in harmony with their environment, knowing when to harvest and when to leave in the ground; when to catch a fish and when to throw one back. 'Survival is not just about the present generation, it’s about all the generations to come. In the Solomon Islands, I caught a juvenile coconut crab but had to put him back. The Islanders will only eat adults that have first had a chance to breed.' WASTE NOT, WANT NOT . 'In tribal societies nothing is wasted. If an animal is killed, every piece of that creature is used – the meat for food, the leather for clothing, the bones and sinews to make tools and weapons. 'They have little, but everything they have helps them survive. In Namibia, the San make good use of the leg tendons of giraffes as they make great strings for their bows.' NEVER GIVE UP . 'Even in desperate situations, keeping your survival instincts intact can save your life. I got lost in the depths of the Ecuadorian rainforest, but by keeping calm and using field skills, I found my way back to the tribe.","Hazen Audel, 40, has lived with some of the world's most isolated tribes .

"The accused heroin dealers who police believe may have sold drugs to actor Philip Seymour Hoffman underwent a radical courtroom makeover before their arraignment in a Manhattan courtroom. Max Rosenblum, 22, was sporting a slick new haircut compared to previous courtroom appearances where he looked decidedly scruffy. Both he and Juliana Luchkiw, also 22, appeared in smart, black business suits. Meanwhile, a third 'dealer', Robert Vineberg said that his heroin addiction was a major factor in his alleged crimes, and asked for the case to go to a drug court designed to channel users to rehab instead of prison. Friends in high places: Robert Vineberg said in court papers he is a raging addict in need of help and asked to be sent to a court-ordered treatment program in a bid to stay out of prison . Another acquaintance: Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead with 70 bags of heroin in his West Village apartment . 'Mr. Vineberg is desirous of confronting and successfully dealing with his . substance abuse problem and becoming a sober, again-productive member of . society,' wrote his lawyer, Edward Kratt. The Manhattan district attorney's office hasn't yet responded to the request, and a judge hasn't yet ruled. Vineberg, . 57, is a longtime jazz and pop studio musician who has played, under . the name Robert Aaron, on albums by artists including David Bowie, Mick . Jagger and the late Amy Winehouse. But his musical career has foundered . in recent years. As police . followed a tip after Hoffman's Feb. 2 death in an apparent heroin . overdose, they said they found about 300 one-dose packets of heroin and . $1,300 in cash in Vineberg's apartment and music studio. He's . facing felony charges of possessing heroin with the intention to sell . it, but he's not charged with any role in Hoffman's death. Vineberg's stepdaughter Christine Soto admitted that Hoffman had visited . the apartment where her stepfather sold drugs before adding: 'But he had . nothing to do with what killed him.' Scruffy: In his previous court on February 5 appearance, Max Rosenblum, 22, looked like a mess. He has now had a smart haircut for today court appearance . Cleaned up her act: Juliana Luchkiw also appeared in court today but looked visibly smarter than her previous court appearance seen here on February 5 . Cleaned up her act: Juliana Luchkiw also appeared in court today but looked visibly smarter than her previous court appearance seen here on February 5 . Luchkiw and Rosenblum, both 22, were formally charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. 'Yes, he got a haircut,' said Rosenblum’s lawyer, Daniel Hochheiser, adding that will ask the court to review the grand jury testimony and then move to dismiss his client’s indictment. They both were far more clean-cut in appearance than their previous court hearing. Luchkiw donned a trim-fitting black suit and black leather boots while Rosenblum sported a more stylish look. The pair quickly rushed out of the building - separately - with their parents and lawyers. During earlier proceedings, Luchkiw had called her arrest 'retarded' and was visibly upset that a judge initially denied her bond. 'Why is this happening? I can’t spend another night in here!' she wailed at the time. She and Rosenblum remain free on bail after the brief proceeding before Justice Edward McLaughlin. Court documents revealed that in addition to two bags of cocaine, cops found a bag of marijuana and a scale in their apartment. Accomplished musician: Robert Vineberg released his own album, Trouble Man, in 2010 . Known addict: Vineberg worked with Amy Winehouse on her debut album Frank . If Vineberg, who pleaded not guilty . Tuesday, is approved for drug court and succeeds in treatment, the . charges could eventually be lowered or dismissed. He's being held on . $200,000 bond. Vineberg has . said he was a friend of Hoffman's but has denied providing the heroin . that authorities said they found in the Academy Award-winning actor's . apartment. Vineberg told the New York Post in a jail interview that his . last contact with the actor was a December exchange of text messages . about attempts both were making at sobriety. New . York state has long had drug-court programs, but a 2009 change in the . state's drug laws gave judges more discretion to send nonviolent, . addicted offenders to treatment, on the theory that it would work better . than prison at stopping them from reoffending. About 2,600 people . statewide were approved for drug court treatment in 2010, more than . twice as many as in 2008, according to a state Division of Criminal . Justice Services report. Two . of Vineberg's neighbors, both 22, were arrested in the same . investigation and charged with possessing two bags of cocaine. They were . also in court Tuesday; their lawyers plan to file papers fighting the . misdemeanor charges. The attorneys have said the two had no connection . to Hoffman. Two law enforcement officials said at least one of them had the actor's phone number. Investigators zeroed in on the four after a tipster, responding to publicity about Hoffman's death, told police he had seen Hoffman at the lower Manhattan apartment building where they were arrested and he believed that's where Hoffman got the heroin, the officials said Wednesday. In searches of two apartments in the building, police found hundreds of packets of heroin in one of them, according to a criminal complaint. Making ends meet: Vineberg's stepdaughter says he sold drugs to pay his rent when he couldn't find work as a musician . Not involved: Christina Soto says her stepfather did not sell the drugs that Hoffman overdosed on . Tip off: Four people were arrested in apartments at 302 Mott Street in lower Manhattan after police were tipped off by a heroin user . 'This case and the charges against Mr Vineberg have absolutely nothing to do with the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman. ... We're hoping the (district attorney) will not use Mr. Vineberg as a scapegoat,' said his lawyer, Edward Kratt, who declined to say whether Vineberg knew Hoffman. On . hearing news of his tragic death on Sunday, Soto remember that her . stepfather said: 'If he would have come to me, I would have told him to . slow down, and if you’re going to do something, make sure you have . someone with you.' Hoffman, . 46, was found dead at his $10,000-a-month West . Village apartment surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes. 302 Mott St. where Robert Vineberg, 57, Max Rosenblum, 22, Juliana Luchkiw, 22, Robert Vineberg, 57, and Thomas Kushman, 48, were arrested . Robert Vineberg, 57, a musician who goes by the name of Robert Aaron, . was charged with felony drug possession following the police swoop . Vineberg was granted bail on February 14 after his February 4 arrest. His lawyer told the judge that the 300 bags of heroin found in his apartment were for personal use. Justice Edward McLaughlin said the claim was dubious. 'If he has an incessant, uncontrolled heroin addiction, then lying around with 300 bags of heroin, he would be dead,' McLaughlin said, reported the New York Post. 'If he has no job that produces income and has $1,500 or $1,300 in cash, you draw your own conclusions.' A group of about 20 musician friends were there to support Vineberg. Vineberg worked with Amy Winehouse on her best-selling album Frank in 2003 .

"An art group is being taken to court for blasphemy over a painting which shows a Polish priest breastfeeding the late Pope John Paul II. The painting by the group The Krasnals - The Dwarves - is entitled 'Battle of Grunwald / The Ship of Fools' and shows contemporary Polish figures depicted as cartoons 'in an international context'.

Art group The Krasnals are being taken to court accused of blasphemy for its painting 'Battle of Grunwald / The Ship of Fools' which features the head of right-wing Catholic radio station Radio Marja portrayed as a pig and breastfeeding the late Pope John Paul II (bottom left corner) 'This is outrageous and goes against all the norms of decency,' said Ryszard Nowak from The All-Poland Committee Against Sects And Violence. Nowak, who famously took a Polish pop singer to court for blasphemy, added: 'It offends the religious feelings of millions of people and is insulting to both Father Rydzyk and the late Pope. 'I fail to see how it is art. It is degrading and it has the word art attached to it to give it some credence and credibility that it does not deserve.' The art group has defended the image as 'little more than cartoons with a sense of humour in the genre of South Park' A spokesman for the Krasnals said: 'We . regret that the level of artistic education is so low in organisations . such as ""The All-Poland Committee Against Sects And Violence,"" which . should be the preserve of intelligence in our country. Such people . should know better than to confuse reality with science fiction. 'The fact is that ""The Battle of Grunwald/Ship of Fools"" is no more than an artistic work of fiction. The picture is a light and accessible creation, portraying the events and characters of contemporary Polish history, in an international context. 'They are little more than cartoons with a sense of humour in the genre of ""South Park"". The concept of ""Polish Civil War"" should be taken with a pinch of salt. 'Its message is exclusively positive, without any intention of causing offence.

"By . Pat Hagan . Scientists found eating a one ounce serving of nuts two or more times a week lowered the risk of a tumour by 35 per cent . Eating a handful of nuts just twice a week could slash the risk of developing one of the most lethal forms of cancer. New research shows snacking on one ounce of nuts two or more time a week can reduce the chances of pancreatic cancer by more than a third. The study, carried out at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, USA, did not differentiate between different types of edible nuts - suggesting having them as a regular snack is more important than eating one type over another. The findings, published online in the . British Journal of Cancer, offer some hope in the prevention of a . disease which has a high mortality rate. Every . year, around 8,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with cancer of the . pancreas, a pear-shaped organ about six inches long that lies deep . inside the body between the stomach and the spine. Its job is to produce enzymes that help to break down food and release insulin to control blood sugar levels. The cause remains largely unknown, . although smokers may have a slightly higher risk, as do those who have . suffered chronic pancreatitis - a persistent infection often brought on . by gall stones, or frequent binge drinking. Some studies suggest having diabetes is also a risk factor. Many . sufferers only discover a problem when they experience considerable and . unexpected weight loss, caused by the cancer eating away at their . digestive system. The study did not differentiate between different types of edible nuts - suggesting having them as a regular snack is more important than eating one type over another . It is widely regarded as one of the most lethal of all tumours, killing around 97 per cent of its victims within five years. Many only live a matter of months. Although previous studies have suggested nuts may have anti-cancer properties when eaten as part of a healthy diet, the evidence remains inconclusive. The Harvard team wanted to investigate whether eating them had any effect specifically on the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Scientists at Harvard University (pictured) found one ounce of nuts two or more time a week can reduce the chances of pancreatic cancer by more than a third . They used data from the Nurses' Health Study, a long-running investigation into all aspects of health among thousands of female nurses in the US. The researchers took a sample of more than 75,000 women and studied the incidence of pancreatic cancer. They then looked at nut consumption among the cancer victims, compared to healthy volunteers who did not have the disease. The results showed that eating a one ounce serving of nuts two or more times a week lowered the risk of a tumour by 35 per cent compared to women who rarely or never ate them. Even when researchers allowed for other factors that might have increased the risks - such as whether they were overweight or had a history of diabetes - they found nuts still had a significant benefit. In a report on their findings the researchers said: 'Frequent nut consumption is inversely associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer, independent of other potential risk factors for the disease.'","Harvard School of Public Health took samples of more than 75,000 women .

"By . Paul Harris . Her hair was looking perfect beneath the sparkling tiara. The beautician had done her spray-on tan, nails and fake lashes, and outside, the limousines were already waiting. Beth Woolley felt particularly special in her £200 sequinned dress and now she was ready to go to the prom. This was how an 11-year-old celebrated her last day at primary school – thanks to a proud mum who splashed out £1,000 to make sure her daughter shone at the end of term ball. Beth's huge prom extravaganza included this £200 dress and three limousines . In an outing that might have come straight from High School Musical, Beth joined 19 classmates for the kind of juvenile extravaganza that is catching on in Britain – even for pre-teen schoolchildren. The prom phenomenon has become popular after being imported from the US, where it was intended for 16-year-olds. In Tipton, West Midlands, however, they appear to have turned the clock forward a little. Aimee Woolley took an extra job as a cleaner to raise enough money to pay for the day of her daughter’s dreams. They began planning her appearance at the junior prom as soon as they got the date for the £15-a-head party for pupils leaving Great Bridge Primary. The prom, which was organised by parents, not the school, was arranged for Year Six pupils moving to secondary schools. Dress - £200 . Bag - £20 . Shoes - £30 . Jewellery - £10 . Kate's Magic Hair and Beauty - £140 . Perfume - £42 . Photographer - £200 . Cars - £300 . Red Carpet - £20 . Drinks - £23 . Ticket - £15 . Nineteen giggling girls met at a nearby house to enjoy non-alcoholic sparkling drinks from champagne flutes at a red-carpet gathering, pictured by a professional photographer. Then a trio of white, pink and silver limousines took them to the party venue, a local pub. It was the climax of Beth’s big day – but the preparation had started long before. She and her mother, a school dinner lady, chose the satin and royal blue netting dress online and ordered shoes and a clutch bag to match. Make-up artist Kate Hadley visited the family home a month in advance to trial hair and make-up styles. Then she spent six hours getting Beth ready, spread over two visits – one on the eve of the prom, another on the day of the big event. For three months, Mrs Woolley had been getting up at 5am, to start work at 6am, cleaning a factory for two hours. Then she returned to take Beth to school, did the housework – and headed back out to her full-time job before 11am. Was it all worth it? ‘Every penny,’ said Mrs Woolley, 36. ‘I just wanted to give my daughter the biggest, best prom she could imagine.’ In order to pay for her daughter's  prom package Aimee (right) took on an extra job as a cleaner . Aimee and Beth began planning in February as soon as they got the date for the ball on July 5 . Her beauty routine included fake tan, fake nails and lashes during two visits from a beautician and stylist . Beth and Aimee picked the blue netting and satin gown and ordered matching shoes and clutch bag . Debenhams has brought out a new range of prom dresses, with sizes starting at age four . As over-the-top as it might seem, Beth's story is no way unique. It seems that proms to mark the end of primary school are . the latest pre-teen craze and the hype has been building for a few years. End-of-primary school proms aren’t just growing in numbers, . but also in glitz, glamour and expense. The BBC aired a documentary called Pre-teen Proms, which . told the story of the children at two schools in the three months running up to . this latest rite of passage. The children demanded ‘pamper parties, horse-drawn . carriages, limos, Maseratis, red carpets and non-alcoholic cocktails - not to . mention prizes for prom king, prom queen and couple most likely to get married.’ And the parents had little choice but to stump up the cash. Netmums, a discussion forum for mothers, was quick to catch . onto the trend, writing on its site: ‘On Netmums over the years we've heard of . OTT proms - with parents spending a small fortune on dresses and tuxedos, . limousines and even a helicopter to make a grand entrance! 'Beauty salons have . seen a surge in children being booked in for tans and make-up sessions to look . their best at the prom.' It is also a hot topic on parenting forum Mumsnet. One user . posted: ‘Today [my son] brought home a letter informing us that to celebrate . year 6 leaving, they are having a prom. He is horrified, as apparently a lot of . the girls are insisting on dates. DS would rather lick his own foot than be . seen publicly with a girl, what with him being 11 and all.' 'Tonight . the fb . discussions have started between parents arranging limos. Limos for . 11-year-olds. Surely this is beyond bats*** crackers? Is this insanity . normal now? What's . wrong with a disco and a handful of Haribo ? Bewildered.’ An equally unimpressed mother called Josephine responded: . ‘Total waste of time. ""Proms"" are one of the worst things to happen . to British schools in the last 20 years. They should be banned.’ While Startail added: ‘Leaving six form fine, when you have . the figure for suites and long dresses. Any younger no,’ with Mary musing: . ‘Good heavens. It will be proms for leaving nursery school next.’ And in fact, Mary could be right: Debenhams has brought out . a new range of prom dresses, with sizes starting at age four. A spokesperson for ParentsOutloud (parentsoutloud.com) said: 'Whist I understand the reason mothers wish to give their child a very special prom night at 11-years-old this is verging on madness. 'Having spent £1,000 for a prom to now to find in two years there will be another... this is an American trend we could have lived without; a total mass marketing event which runs on parent blackmail. 'It's impossible to not partake but it should be confined to one prom only, possibly at the end of year 11, and leave primary school children to be just that.'","Aimee Woolley, 36, from Tipton, took on an extra job as a cleaner .

"By . Sophie Borland . Proposal: Lord Warner, who previously advised Tony Blair on health reform, said the levy should be paid before anyone receives free treatment . Everyone should pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, according to a former Labour health minister. Lord Warner called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment. Patients should also be charged £20 for every night they stay in hospital, he added. He said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the Health Service, which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing, unhealthy population. There is rising concern that the NHS is running out of money and will soon have to resort to charging patients or rationing common treatments. Lord Warner, who previously advised Tony Blair on health reform, said the NHS was ‘unaffordable’, ‘out-of-date’ and unable to meet the needs of the population. In a report written for the Reform think-tank, he estimated that a monthly £10 charge for using the NHS would generate £2billion a year. Certain groups would be exempt, including the elderly, the under-18s and pregnant women. Patients would not be denied emergency treatment if they had not paid the fee. Lord Warner recommended introducing a £20 fee for every night a patient stays in hospital. They would be made to pay extra if their stay was longer than the average for their age group – broken down into the under-65s, 65 to 85 and over-85s. The fees would generate up to £1billion, while also deterring patients from going to hospital unnecessarily. Lord Warner said there needed to be a ‘tough conversation with the public’ about new ways of funding the Health Service. Need for change: The former minister also claimed the health service was 'unaffordable', 'out-of-date' and unable to meet the needs of the population . ‘We can no longer pay homage to an out-of-date and unaffordable NHS that’s unfit for today’s and tomorrow’s care needs,’ he said. ‘All politicians allowed the NHS to overdose on higher budgets without shifting more care closer to home and concentrating our specialist services on fewer, safer, more highly-skilled, 24/7 centres. The day of reckoning has arrived with an obesity epidemic on our doorstep. ‘The NHS has to change radically. It should have no more hand-outs at the expense of other public services.’ But Joyce Robins, of campaign group Patient Concern, was ‘incensed’ by his proposals. ‘Hospitals are dreadful, unsafe places – why would anyone choose to stay there if they could help it? It’s not like they are hotels,’ she said. ‘I can’t imagine who sat in their office and thought this up. It really is a strange idea.’ The Health Service has been struggling to meet the demands of patients – even with its £106billion annual budget ring-fenced from spending cuts – and there have been growing calls for patients to be charged for certain services. In January, a poll of 800 GPs found that a third were in favour of charging patients up to £10 every time they went to casualty to deter ‘inappropriate attendances’. Last summer senior doctors from the British Medical Association said the NHS would soon have to make patients pay for some non-urgent treatments and operations.

"By . Ruth Styles . From a snowy Christmas lunch in Antarctica to the spectacular light projections currently brightening the facade of Sydney's St Mary's cathedral, the world is gearing up for Christmas in style. But for festive fun, little compares to London's very own Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, which, as these stunning images reveal, comes with lashings of Christmas cheer. Also enjoying a spot of festive cheer were the crew of HMS Protector, a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, who stopped for an early Christmas lunch on an Antarctic ice floe. Scroll down for video . Festive fun: The crew of HMS Protector, an ice patrol ship, tuck into an early Christmas lunch while sitting on an Antarctic ice floe. Lunch was followed by a football match . Working holiday: The crew were forced to have their celebrations early because the ship will be at sea on Christmas Day which means there will be no time to celebrate . Record attempt: Chefs in Ham, a village in France's Picardie region attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the planet's longest Yule Log . Although the ship will be at sea on Wednesday - leaving no time for Christmas fun - Captain Rhett Hatcher allowed his crew time off for a roast turkey dinner in a real-life winter wonderland and a game of football. Captain Hatcher said: 'Spending Christmas in the coldest, windiest and driest place on earth comes with a number of challenges but it is a truly unique privilege.' Closer to home, a group of intrepid French pastry chefs attempted to break the record for world's longest Christmas log in the northern French commune of Ham in the French Picardie region. Equally tasty were the offerings of traders at the Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park, who enjoyed a bumper day as shoppers ventured out in search of the perfect present. The temporary, festive theme park runs for over six weeks and features an ice rink, several large rides and numerous food and gift stalls.

"By . Emma Innes . A millionaire businessman bled to death after waiting five hours for surgery at a hospital run by the scandal-hit NHS in Wales. Doctors failed to spot that Malcolm Green, 82, was slowly bleeding to death internally after undergoing an operation. An inquest heard Mr Green was ‘happy and chatting’ after having successful surgery for colon cancer. Malcolm Green (pictured with his wife, Janet, after receiving an MBE), 82, bled to death after surgery to remove a tumour in his bowel in June 2012 . But as he recovered from the operation he was seen four times by doctors and nurses who realised his blood pressure was falling. His condition suddenly deteriorated and he was taken back to an emergency ward 12 hours after his blood pressure first began to drop. But Mr Green had to wait for a further five hours before the operation was carried out. By that time, doctors were unable to save Mr Green who was awarded an MBE for his charity work just months before his tragic death. His company, Greens Motors in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, is the oldest Land Rover dealership in the world and he was still working in the days before going into hospital. Coroner's officer Jeremy Davies said: ‘Malcolm Green was in good general health, fit, playing golf and still working. Surgeons managed to remove Mr Green's tumour but staff at Withybush General Hospital, in Haverfordwest, failed to notice that he was bleeding internally after the operation . ‘He had surgery on a colon tumour and it was successfully removed.’ Mr Green was due to have keyhole surgery at Withybush General Hospital in Haverfordwest but had open surgery instead in June 2012. The inquest heard in the early hours following the operation nurse, Stephanie Reynolds discovered his blood pressure had dropped. Ms Reynolds said she was caring for Mr Green along with another nurse and two healthcare assistants. The team of four was looking after a total of 30 patients that evening. Ms Reynolds said: ‘Mr Green's blood pressure fell but I didn't think it was that low.’ Surgeon Dr Otumeluke Umughele (pictured) visited Mr Green after the surgery and said he would call on him again but was not concerned about his health . Dr Ian Lane, who put him on fluids, told the inquest: ‘It seemed unlikely it was a bleed because he was alert, chatty and very co-operative. ‘When I examined him a second time his condition had improved.’ Dr Lane added that the hospital had been busy with greater pressure than usual during the night. Medical staff expressed no further concerns about Mr Green and he was visited by his surgeon Dr Otumeluke Umughele who said he would call to see him again later. The inquest in Milford Haven heard within an hour Mr Green's condition deteriorated and he lost unconsciousness. He was taken to an emergency ward and prepared for surgery but the inquest heard the operation did not go ahead for another five hours. The hearing was told that when the operation went ahead a large amount of clotted blood was found in his abdomen. Mr Green never recovered from the surgery and died of multiple organ failure caused by a bleeding vessel three days later. The inquest heard staff at the 311-bed district general hospital were busier than usual on the night of 27 June 2012. Father-of-two Mr Green was well known throughout the UK as managing director of Green's Motors for more than 50 years. The company was established 160 years ago, originally dealing in bicycles before the car was invented. He helped to raise tens of thousands of pounds for good causes in Haverfordwest. His business and family home were just a mile away from the hospital where he died with his wife, Janet, at his bedside. After the surgery, staff at the hospital were initially happy with Mr Green's progress as he was alert and chatty. However, 12 hours after the operation he lost consciousness and was moved to an emergency ward where he was forced to wait another five hours for further surgery . Dr Sue Fish, medical director for the health board, said: 'Delivering safe care for our patients is at the centre of everything we do and we sincerely apologise to the family of Mr Green that on this occasion the level of care fell below the acceptable level. 'We take these issues very seriously and a full internal investigation has been carried out and shared with the family. 'We await the coroner’s conclusion and we have already put in place the necessary steps to ensure these failings do not happen again including reminding doctors and nursing staff of the importance of accurate record keeping.' Just two weeks ago Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs the state of the NHS in Wales ‘is a scandal’. By the time Mr Green was taken back to surgery, medics were unable to save him and he died a few days later . Mr Cameron hit out at the Labour-run Welsh government over the performance of the health service in Wales. During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘Frankly what we have in our NHS in Wales is a scandal, and it's a scandal that's entirely the responsibility of the Labour party who are running the Welsh Assembly Government. ‘They made the decision to cut NHS spending by eight per cent in Wales, as a result, they have not met an A&E target since 2009.’ The inquest into Mr Green's death is ongoing.","Malcolm Green, 82, went to Withybush General Hospital for cancer surgery .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Android users beware: Heartbleed has been causing panic across users of popular internet sites and now millions of Android device users have been revealed to be at risk . Millions of Android smartphone and tablet users are vulnerable to the Heartbleed security flaw despite Google's insistence to the contrary, researchers reveal. The tech giant assured panicked users last week that their mobile platform was safe save for a 'limited exception.' It's now been revealed that the exception refers to millions of devices running a 2012 version of the operating system. Security experts say the vulnerable software can be found on popular phone and tablet brands including Samsung, HTC and others, reports Bloomberg. More than 900 million Android devices have been purchased worldwide. Of those, Bloomberg reports that 34 percent run some version of the outdated software. While a fix for computers and websites was readily available after news of Heartbleed sent internet users into a panic last week, the same cannot be said for Android. While a patch is available for devices with the flaw, wireless carriers and handset makers must now provide updates and the process is long. 'One of the major issues with Android is the update cycle is really long,' Michael Shaulov, CEO of mobile security company Lacoon Security Ltd. told Bloomberg. 'The device manufacturers and the carriers need to do something with the patch, and that’s usually a really long process.' Panic was triggered last week when it emerged that tens of millions of websites around the world did not have the security promised. The popular blogging website Tumblr, which is owned by Yahoo!, urged its users to change all their passwords, especially those protecting sensitive data like email and bank accounts, immediately. Internet security companies have painted a doomsday scenario of customer web accounts being hijacked by criminals or even government spies. Global web giants were given advanced warning of the need to improve security, which allowed them to make sure their sites safe. Hacked? Internet security companies had warned of accounts being hacked by criminals or government spies and despite Google's assurances to the contrary, it appears many millions of Android users are vulnerable . However, millions of other firms have not had the time – or expertise - to ensure their sites are protected, leaving consumers in the dark about whether they are safe to use. These firms will have no choice but to bring in outside security consultants at great expense to protect their websites and customers. The Heartbleed bug bypasses the encryption – called OpenSSL  - that normally protects data as it is sent between computers and servers, leaving personal and sensitive data vulnerable. The problem has existed for at least two years, however details were only made public this week by Google and a small company from Finland, called Codenomicon. The fact the loophole has existed for so long is a huge blow to the credibility of websites and consumer trust in the internet. However, there is no evidence to date that any malicious hackers have taken advantage of it to grab information. In a blog post, Google said it has applied a security patch to defeat the flaw on its search engine, Gmail, YouTube, Wallet and Play store for mobile apps and other digital content. A spokesman said: ‘It’s good practice to use strong passwords that are unique to each of your accounts, but we don’t think our users need to change their Google Account passwords because of this bug.’ Amazon said simply: ‘Amazon.com is not affected.’ Facebook, along with a number of big name websites, was given advance warning that details of the security flaw were about to be made public. It appears its systems have been vulnerable for some time, however it has also now installed a security patch. A spokesman said: ‘We added protections for Facebook’s implementations of OpenSSL before this issue was publicly disclosed, and we haven’t detected any signs of suspicious activity on people’s accounts. 'We’re continuing to monitor the situation closely.’ The banks also tried to reassure customers. The British Bankers Association said: ‘If customers are worried about the security of their online account they should contact their bank to discuss those concerns directly. ‘If they are proven to have been the victim of a fraudulent online transaction then their bank will make sure they are granted a full refund of any money that has been stolen.’ By contrast, the British Retail Consortium was unable to offer any comment on the safety of online stores. Paypal, which is part of eBay, and responsible for handling millions of electronic payments every day insisted its system remains secure. Its chief technical officer, John Barrese, issued a statement saying customer account details were not exposed and there is no need for people to change their password. However, the problem is not resolved by simply improving site security. Experts at the American security and training company, the SANS Institute, suggested that the software that runs smartphones, tablets and laptops could have the same flaw. Spokesman Jake Williams said a malicious server could easily send a message to vulnerable software on phones, laptops, PCs, home routers and other devices, and retrieve a 64KB block of sensitive data from the targeted system. That would gather keystrokes which could, in theory, provide log-in and password details for internet banks and other sites. Mr Williams criticised companies with websites that are vulnerable to the Heartbeat bug for failing to admit the problem to consumers. ‘Too many vendors not communicating with their customers,’ he said. He suggested it could take the industry until 2020 and beyond to eliminate the problem.","A 2012 version of Google's mobile operating systems is susceptible to the glitch, which allows hackers to steal passwords .

"By . Richard Shears . Indian police say a 10-year-old girl has been raped on the orders of a village chief 'as punishment' after her father beat up a neighbour who broke into his house. According to reports, the girl's father attacked his 25-year-old neighbour after the man broke into his house drunk at around midnight and tried to molest his wife. The next day, the battered and bruised neighbour reported the 'assault' to elders in his village in eastern India's Bokaro district - and they permitted him to rape the girl as revenge. Scroll down for video . Horrific: The 'revenge' rape took place in a small village in the Bokaro district of eastern India, police said . According to The Times of India, the elders passed the horrifying sentence after deciding the girl's 'violent' father had to be punished. The newspaper said the 25-year-old dragged the girl into bushes a short distance away . and raped her, against the cries of the child's mother. Police told the newspaper that an hour later, the mother retrieved her daughter from the bushes, where she was found lying in blood. Urgent action: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said something must be done to stop India's rape crisis . Other villagers were reportedly too frightened to intervene in case they became targets themselves. However, police have released conflicting information on the alleged incident. According to the Hindustan Times, officers said the girl was 14 years old, not 10, and that she was the sister of the attacker, not his daughter. The distressing case adds to a list of shocking rape statistics in India, where government data reveals that a sexual attack occurs every 22 minutes. National Crime Records Bureau statistics for 2013 reveal that 24,923 rape cases were reported across the country in 2012. But women's groups say the figure is much higher because many women are too ashamed to go to the police. India's newly-electred Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month called for action against the country's rape crisis. 'Respecting and protecting women should be the priority of the 1.25 billion people in this country,' he said. In January this year a 20-year-old woman was gang-raped by 13 men in West Bengal on the orders of a village chief after she was accused of having a relationship with a man from a different culture.","Horrifying incident happened in a village in Bokaro district, eastern India .

"By . Sean Poulter . A specialist food crime unit should be set up to investigate fraud in the wake of the horsemeat scandal, an official inquiry said yesterday. To date, no individual or company has been prosecuted as a result of the discovery that millions of beef burgers and other products contained high levels of horsemeat. A government-commissioned probe has now found that the UK food supply system is ‘too vulnerable’ to criminals and has called for a major overhaul of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) – which was criticised over the way it and the Government handled the scandal. An official inquiry has found a specialist Food Crime Unit should be set up following the horsemeat scandal, where millions of beef burgers and other products were found to contain horsemeat (file picture) Professor Chris Elliott, of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen’s University Belfast, said not enough evidence is collected about crime in the UK’s £188billion food and drink market. As well as a unit to investigate serious fraud, he said there should be fresh guidance for catering companies to ensure they check the authenticity of food. He warned: ‘Estimates of the level of criminality vary, so further investigation needs to be a priority. We need a culture within businesses involved in supplying food that focuses on depriving those who seek to deceive consumers. Government, and in particular a more robust Food Standards Agency has a major role to play.’ There was confusion when the horsemeat scandal emerged in January as to which official bodies – the FSA, Defra or local councils – were responsible and what action should be taken. Some of the nation's biggest food companies and brands, including Tesco, Burger King, Asda, Findus, Birds Eye and Taco Bell were found to be selling horsemeat in beef products (file picture) Prof Elliott said the FSA needed an up-to-date ‘crisis management plan’ and must work more closely with government departments to ensure their respective roles are clear during a ‘major incident’. The FSA has so far effectively passed responsibility to police and local councils, which either do not have experience or the power to deal with the  issue. Yesterday, the FSA said it has already introduced measures to counter food fraud, while Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said work would  continue to ‘improve intelligence’.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss today rejected criticism of her appointment to lead an inquiry into claims of an Establishment cover-up of child sex abuse, despite her brother being in the Cabinet at the time. She is to lead a panel of experts investigating allegations that politicians, the police, the judiciary, celebrities, the BBC, the NHS and the Church conspired to cover-up abuse over several decades. But her brother, Sir Michael Havers, sat in the Conservative Cabinet as attorney general from 1979-87, the period in which much of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place. Scroll down for video . Former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss is to lead a panel inquiry into decades of child abuse, despite her brother Sir Michael Havers sitting the Cabinet as attorney general from 1979-87 . Downing Street refused to comment on whether Baroness Butler-Sloss's family connections were considered before announcing her appointment. Sir Michael was accused of a 'cover-up' in the early 1980s over a refusal to prosecute Foreign Office diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, who was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange. Sir Michael, who died in 1992, is said to have had a 20 minute argument outside the Commons chamber with Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in the 1980s in an attempt to stop him using parliamentary privilege to name diplomat Sir Peter  as a paedophile. Today Baroness Butler-Sloss brushed off the controversy this morning, telling the BBC: 'I know absolutely nothing about it,' she told the BBC. 'If people think I am not suitable, then that's up to them.' Foreign Office diplomat Sir Peter Hayman was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange but was not prosecuted in the 1980s . Baroness . Butler-Sloss has faced calls to step down after reports that Sir Michael . tried to prevent ex-MP Geoffrey Dickens airing claims about a diplomat . in Parliament in the 1980s. Labour . MP Simon Danczuk, who has led his own inquiry into abuse carried out by . former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, said: 'We want somebody in the chair . that exudes confidence and that’s not the case. 'She’s . part of the establishment and that raises concerns and the relationship . in terms of her brother, I think, is too close for comfort. I think . that’s the conclusion most people will reach,' he told the BBC. Mr Danczuk said she should 'consider her position', adding: 'I think she should consider her position. I find it quite surprising that neither she nor the Government realised that her relationship with her brother was connected with Geoffrey Dickens and all this palaver around it. 'It beggars belief that that hadn’t been considered in the first place.' Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, also said he was 'surprised that the Government has chosen a Member of the House of Lords no matter how distinguished to head the inquiry'. He added: 'She is a member of Parliament and is very closely related to a former Lord Chancellor.' Conservative Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons health select committee, said she did not doubt the peer's integrity but it was 'hard to see why Baroness Butler-Sloss would want to accept a role so many regard as conflicted at the outset'. Alison Millar, head of the abuse team at law firm Leigh Day, which represents alleged victims of abuse at institutions that will be examined by the inquiry, said: 'Whilst Lady Butler-Sloss is a person of enormous integrity, the concern really is that she is just too close to the establishment and, in particular, concern over her family connection to Sir Michael Havers. 'Justice must be seen to be done by those who are understandably the most reticent to come forward, those who have survived abuse. 'The panel needs to be reconsidered and must involve those working in the area of child abuse as well as survivors of abuse now working in that area.' But the government rallied round Baroness Butler-Sloss, a former president of the Family Division of the High Court who chaired the Cleveland Child Abuse Inquiry. Labour MP Simon Danczuk said Baroness Butler-Sloss should consider her position while Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said her appointment was 'conflicted at the outset' Harriet Harman today called for the child sex abuse inquiry to examine links between a civil liberties group she used to work for and the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. Labour’s deputy leader worked as legal officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties between 1978 and 1982, when PIE was one of its affiliates. Ms Harman said Baroness Butler-Sloss's inquiry should 'obviously' look into PIE. She told BBC Radio 4: 'The thing about PIE, which was so pernicious about it, is that they infiltrated organisations, so they infiltrated social work organisations, they infiltrated even the Home Office as it turns out, and obviously that is deeply regrettable. 'What they did is they said they were just for free speech and talking about sexual identity, but actually what they were doing was covering up for their own evil child abuse. 'So, yes, I'm sure that the whole issue of PIE will be looked at in this inquiry. They were a very evil organisation.' Shown a picture of an advert for the NCCL in a PIE magazine from the 1970s, she said: 'Obviously it is very regrettable that they even existed and peddled that line of argument, but worst of all that they were perpetrating abuse.' The Home Office said Lady Butler-Sloss's integrity was 'beyond reproach' and it stood 'unreservedly' by her appointment. The Prime Minister also insisted she was the right person to lead the inquiry. Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a Westminster media briefing: 'She commands the very highest respect for her professional expertise and integrity. 'His view is that she does command widespread respect and confidence, and rightly so.' However, Mr Cameron's spokesman declined to say whether Lady Butler-Sloss's relationship to Lord Havers had been discussed during the process of picking an inquiry chair. 'The focus was on finding a person with the right expertise and integrity,' said the Prime Minister's spokesman. 'That's exactly what we have in Elizabeth Butler-Sloss.' Asked whether Mr Cameron considered her family relationships relevant to her appointment, the spokesman said: 'There has been no change in the Government's and the Prime Minister's view about her suitability for the role.' Actor Nigel Havers, Sir Michael's son and nephew of  Baroness Butler-Sloss, also defended her appointment. He told BBC Radio 4: 'I know my aunt very well, and had she felt any form of bias or idea that she shouldn't be doing this inquiry, she would have pulled out this morning. 'The very fact that she hasn't means, to me, that she feels absolutely no political ties to my father and knew nothing about what was going on in the House of Commons at that time and therefore she has every right I think to continue to do the inquiry.' The Home Office said Lady Butler-Sloss's integrity was 'beyond reproach' and it stood 'unreservedly' by her appointment. And in a written statement to MPs, Mrs May said: 'Baroness Butler-Sloss brings with her many years of experience in the field of child protection and law, and I am confident that she will deliver the thorough, robust and independent review that I have promised. 'To ensure that the terms of reference for the inquiry are sufficient to deliver the robust review which is required, I have asked that Lady Butler-Sloss agree the final terms of reference with the full panel, when appointed. 'The inquiry will begin its work as soon as possible after the appointment of other members of the panel and I shall provide a further update in due course.'","Former High Court judge to lead panel inquiry into abuse allegations .

"By . Emma Innes . Facebook and social networking sites may be good for our social lives, but they can cause havoc in our romantic relationships, according to a new study. From emotional and physical cheating to break-up and divorce, researchers found 'Facebook-induced jealousy' significantly increased the risks for couples of all ages. Research found that conflict was much more likely to occur when the website was used excessively, because some people tended to jealously monitor their partner's activity or even to reconnect with ex-partners. From emotional and physical cheating to break-up and divorce, researchers found 'Facebook-induced jealousy' significantly increased the risks for couples of all ages . The study, led by Dr Russell Clayton, of the University of Missouri, U.S., surveyed Facebook users aged between 18 and 82, asking them how much they used the social network and how often they had bust-ups with their partners - past or present - that had been ignited by the site. Dr Clayton said: ‘Previous research has shown that the more a person in a romantic relationship uses Facebook, the more likely they are to monitor their partner's Facebook activity more stringently, which can lead to feelings of jealousy. ‘Facebook-induced jealousy may lead to arguments concerning past partners. ‘Also, our study found that excessive Facebook users are more likely to connect or reconnect with other Facebook users, including previous partners, which may lead to emotional and physical cheating.’ According to the study, published in the Journal of Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, couples who are just starting out should consider staying away from the site. Dr Clayton explained: ‘The findings held only for couples who had been in relationships of three years or less. Conflict is much more likely to occur when the website is used excessively, because some people tended to jealously monitor their partner's activity or even to reconnect with ex-partners . ‘This suggests that Facebook may be a threat to relationships that are not fully matured. ‘On the other hand, participants who have been in relationships for longer than three years may not use Facebook as often, or may have more matured relationships, and therefore Facebook use may not be a threat or concern. ‘Although Facebook is a great way to learn about someone, excessive Facebook use may be damaging to newer romantic relationships. ‘Cutting back to moderate, healthy levels of Facebook usage could help reduce conflict, particularly for newer couples who are still learning about each other.’","Excessive Facebook use increases risk of cheating, break-up and divorce .

"By . Nick Mcdermott . It should help end the debate around the office kettle. Although Britain drinks 165 million cups of tea a year, there is little agreement on how it should be served. In a bid to settle the centuries old argument, scientists have now got together to formulate a step-by-step guide for the perfect cup of tea. A nice cup of Rosy Lee: Scientists at University College London have managed to work out how to make the perfect cup of tea. Cup type, water temperature and timing are all crucial . And whether you prefer to brew your English Breakfast in a mug or teapot, there is one area in which the experts unanimously agreed - for the best results steer clear of disposable cups. Speaking on the chemistry of tea, Professor Andrea Sella from University College London said the perfect cuppa is about ‘patience, love and care’. But he said the smooth surface of a china cup or mug made not only keeps the natural tannins in the tea from sticking to the side, but the sounds, such as the teaspoon clinking against its hard surface were ‘comforting’. ‘You want a smooth, impervious surface, you don’t want cup to bind the tannins. And also from a psychological aspect, it provides a lovely association of things like drinking tea with your grandmother which foam cups do not.’ Using freshly drawn water in the kettle ensures the tea can express its full flavour, as repeated boiling reduces the oxygen content and makes the water harder, giving the brew a chalky film. Simon Hill, tea buyer from Taylors of . Harrogate said: ‘Always use freshly drawn water, as the longer it boils, . the less oxygen it has and the less flavour the leaves impart. A delicious infusion requires brewing the tea for between three and five minutes. This helps to optimise the balance of flavour and the strength of the drink . And as for temperature, let the kettle come to the boil and click off. Then give it a few seconds before pouring.’ Controversially, although harder water – common in the south and east of the country - results in a residue forming on the tea’s surface, for many connoisseurs it produces a better cup. ‘Although it doesn’t look nice, you may get a bit more flavour and body from the minerals reacting with the tea,’ said Mr Hill. Temperature also plays a crucial role, with the experts advising drinkers wait a few seconds before pouring the almost boiling water on the tea. For more delicate teas, such as green and white, waiting for the kettle to cool to 80c is essential to ensure the leaves are not damaged. Steer clear of plastic, disposable mugs and use a porcelain cup . Only use freshly drawn water for the kettle . Once water is boiled, wait five second before pouring into cup or warmed teapot . Brewing time between three to five minutes for optimum balance of flavour and strength . Add five per cent of semi-skimmed milk to the cup before adding tea . Wait for six minutes for the temperature to drop to 60C before drinking . ‘When the water is even 10c hotter, it doubles the rate of chemical reactions. In coffee for example, water at 100c can cause a bitter taste. With black tea, the temperature is less of an issue, but in green teas, it can damage the flavour,’ Professor Sella. It was the British that started first started drinking milk with their tea, and have never lost the habit. Speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival (must keep), Mr Hill said: ‘When tea was first imported to the UK in the 18th Century lots of people couldn’t afford the fine bone china services. The cups available couldn’t withstand the heat of the boiling water and would shatter, so milk was added first. It also helped to get rid of the bitter taste of some of the cheaper teas.’ Although brewing time in a mug is slightly reduced compared to a pot, scientists suggested three minutes allows the flavour to best develop. The experts recommend around five per cent of milk in the cup – and adding it first if pouring from a teapot – which helps bind with the harsh tannins and make it a smoother, more enjoyable drink. ‘The proteins in the milk clump together with the tannins, making a black tea much more easy to drink. But adding milk to hot water causes it too ‘cook’ slightly, so the ideal would be to pour the tea into your milk and then enjoy,’ said Professor Sella. ‘The ritual of tea making is also important. Making it in teapot and pouring it in porcelain cups invariably tastes better, even though from a chemical point of view it should be the same however you serve it.’ Finally, the secret is patience. Drinking your tea too hot just causes the mouth to burn. A wait of six minutes allows the brew to cool down to 60C, the perfect temperature for sipping.","Britain drinks 165 million cups of the beverage a year, but there is little agreement on exactly how a proper cuppa should be made .
Scientists say that the cup, freshness and temperature of the water as well as the precise moment the milk is added are all crucial to tea's chemistry ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Facebook pictures of 17 year old Elizabeth Thomas who was the victim of a fatal stabbing in Oxted in Surrey . A 17-year-old girl who was found stabbed to death has been named by police as Elizabeth Thomas. Detectives have arrested 16 year-old Steven Miles on suspicion of murder and he has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act following the stabbing on Friday. Friends have claimed that the Miles and Thomas were in a relationship and that Elizabeth had wanted to end it. Police were called to Miles' family home above a parade of shops in Oxted, shortly before 5pm on Friday. Elizabeth had just joined the highly rated sixth form - Oxted School - where Miles also studied. A post-mortem examination carried out yesterday confirmed that the cause of death was due to a stab wound. Detectives from the Surrey and Sussex major crime team have said the death of Elizabeth, from West Wickham, was an 'isolated incident'. Detective Chief Inspector Claire Pridgeon, of the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said: 'This is a tragic loss of a young girl’s life. 'Our thoughts are with Elizabeth’s family and we are providing support to them at this extremely difficult time. 'Oxted is a close-knit community and whilst this is being treated as an isolated incident, neighbourhood officers have been out speaking to local residents to provide reassurance.' The property where Elizabeth was found stabbed was still the focus of police activity, with Ms Pridgeon saying officers would be there for “the coming days”. Miles was arrested on suspicion of murder and sectioned under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act.

"Whistleblower Edward Snowden said NSA employees saw sharing such images as a 'fringe benefit' of their position . Whistleblower Edward Snowden has claimed a culture exists within the National Security Agency in which intercepted nude photos of people in 'sexually compromising' situations would be routinely passed around among workers. Speaking from exile in Russia, Mr Snowden said NSA employees saw sharing such images as a 'fringe benefit' of their position. The 31-year-old former NSA worker also spoke of his concerns for personal privacy and urged professionals to do more to protect themselves and the data they have. The former computer analyst has been living in Moscow since leaking thousands of top-secret documents about government surveillance practices in the US and beyond. During an interview with The Guardian he said: 'I'm much happier in Russia than I would be facing an unfair trial where I can't even present a public-interest defence to a jury of my peers.' When asked whether he witnessed anything that troubled him while working in surveillance he said: 'You've got young enlisted guys, 18 to 22 years old. They've suddenly been thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility where they now have access to all of your private records. 'Now, in the course of their daily work they stumble across something that is completely unrelated to their work in any sort of necessary sense - for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation, but they're extremely attractive. 'So what they do? They turn around in their chair and show their co-worker -- and their co-worker says ""hey, that's great, send that to Bill down the way."" And then Bill sends it to George, George sends it to Tom, and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people.' Mr Snowden said he had seen such instances on a number of times, adding: 'These are seen as the fringe benefits of surveillance positions.' He said it was 'reasonable to assume' he . was under surveillance, adding: 'Anyone in my position is surely subject . to some surveillance, but you take the precautions you can, so even if . you are under surveillance there's no sensitive information for you to . expose.' Mr Snowden has been living in Moscow since leaking thousands of top-secret documents about government surveillance practices in the US and beyond . A new data surveillance bill has been fast-tracked through Westminster that will give authorities greater powers to access mobile data for up to a year as part of security measures and checks. Mr Snowden is one of several high-profile figures calling for more rights to be offered to internet users to help protect their privacy. Earlier this year, Mr Snowden appeared on-stage via video link with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited with inventing the world wide web, to call for a 'bill of rights' to be introduced to protect global internet users. During the talk, Sir Tim called Mr Snowden 'a hero' for the work he had done for internet privacy, which led to the exposure of wide-scale surveillance networks involving the NSA in the US and GCHQ in the UK. However, Mr Snowden said he did not believe that technology and privacy were incompatible. He said: 'Technology can actually increase privacy, but not if we sleepwalk into new applications of it without considering the implications of these new technologies.' Mr Snowden also responded to claims that he was working for the Russian government. He said: 'If the government had even the tiniest shred of evidence that I was associating with the Russian government it would be on the front page of the New York Times by lunchtime.' Mr Snowden is wanted in the US on espionage charges but believes it would be hard for a jury to unanimously convict him on a charge where there was a public-interest defence.","Edward Snowden claims NSA workers saw sharing images as 'fringe benefit'

"By . Steve Doughty . The new Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, said criminal defendants could be allowed to take part in court hearings from home using Skype and FaceTime . Internet video calling software such as Skype and FaceTime could allow criminal defendants to appear in court from home, the country’s most senior judge has said. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the use of video links in hearings held before Crown Court trials would slash the cost of bringing to court prisoners, defendants on bail and their lawyers. But critics said criminals should not be allowed to appear ‘from the comfort of their living room’, while others said video links would demean the ‘dignity’ of the court. Lord Thomas, who took over as head of the judiciary in England and Wales last month, said internet video calls would be cheaper than the dedicated closed circuit TV systems which are often installed in court buildings because they are supposed to protect security. ‘There are innovative ways of providing open justice bearing in mind things such as Skype and FaceTime,’ said Lord Thomas in his first annual press conference since taking up his post. ‘We need to loosen up our use of Skype and FaceTime, which current IT systems don’t really allow. 'I am very keen that we should because with most of what happens in court you don’t have problems with security, and we can be much more open to use of Skype and FaceTime than we traditionally have been.’ Lord Thomas suggested lawyers, prisoners and defendants released on bail could all communicate with the court using the technology . He said he had singled out Skype and . Apple’s FaceTime on the basis of cost and said internet video programs . could not be used during full-scale criminal trials but at the pre-trial . hearings at which judges and lawyers prepare the ground for the trial. ‘A lot of the difficulties we have are that to make a court case work well you need a pre-trial hearing,’ he said. ‘But it is often very expensive to . get a prisoner or a person who is out on bail to come to court, to get . the lawyers to come to court and I think a lot of this can be solved by . the use of technology.’ However, Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: ‘I am shocked by this suggestion. 'Defendants appearing via Skype from . the comfort of their own living room for their trial is taking justice . on the cheap to a new low. Lord Thomas also revealed guidelines on dealing with face-veils in courtrooms would go out to public consultation. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and minister Kenneth Clarke (right) have both spoken out against women being allowed to wear veils while giving evidence in court . ‘It’s ridiculous that defendants . should be given the option of avoiding their day in the dock while . witnesses, including the victim, have made the effort to go to court. ‘Being charged with a criminal offence is a serious matter and should be treated as such by the defendant.’ Tracey Crouch, the Tory MP for Chatham and Aylesford, said: ‘This is lazy justice. It saves on time, trouble and money. 'There are innovative ways of . actually providing open justice bearing in mind things such as Skype and . FaceTime. We need to loosen up our use of Skype and FaceTime, which . current IT systems don’t really allow' 'But it diminishes the dignity of the legal system and I am worried about it.’ But James Clappison, a barrister and the Tory MP for Hertsmere, said: ‘Pre-trial hearings are often a formality. 'They are held to work out how long . the trial will last and who is required as a witness. It seems to me a . sensible area to look for ways to save money.’ Criminologist Dr David Green, of the . Civitas think tank, said: ‘At the moment, the process is expensive and . consumes a lot of time before the trial gets going. It is possible there . could be savings without any danger to justice. ‘It may be that Skype may lead to a . better use of the time of judges and lawyers, and less risk of prisoners . escaping when they are moved about to go to court.’ Lord Thomas also revealed that a . decision over guidance to be given to judges on whether women should be . allowed to wear the veil in court would shortly be made the subject of a . public consultation.","Lord Thomas said move could bring down cost of administrative hearings .

"By . David Mccormack . Rachel Jeantel was thrust in the national spotlight last June when she took the stand in the George Zimmerman trial as the prosecution’s supposed ‘star witness’. Instead, Jentel quickly became a target for public ridicule due to her demeanor in court and the fact she was outed as illiterate on national TV. In the months since then Jeantel has worked hard to turn her life around and in doing so keep a promise she had made to Martin to graduate high school. Scroll down for video . In the year that has passed since the George Zimmerman trial, Rachel Jeantel has worked hard to turn her life around and in doing so keep a promise she had made to Trayvon Martin to graduate high school . At the time of last June’s trial, Jeantel had a fourth-grade reading level. The child of immigrant parents, Jeantel speaks Haitian Creole, Spanish and English, but at times the court reporter and jurors struggled to decipher her dialect and street slang. Her speech on the stand often detracted from her testimony, as the then 19-year-old used terms such as ‘creepy’ and ‘cracker’ to describe Zimmerman, whom she said was aggressively following Martin before their phone call was silenced during the scuffle. It was during a break in Jeantel’s car crash of a testimony that her attorney, Rod Vereen, decided that he was going to help her. Rachel Jeantel was thrust in the national spotlight last June when she took the stand in the George Zimmerman trial as the prosecution's supposed 'star witness' Jeantel's attorney Rod Vereen, right, decided to ensure that she got the help she needed with her schooling . ‘I didn't like what took place in social media, and the attacks she received nationwide. I couldn't turn my back to that,’ he told ABC. ‘And I couldn't turn a blind eye to the problems that I knew she had.’ Vereen put in place a support network of people to help Jeantel with her schooling. The tutors worked with Jeantel for seven hours a day, and she described them as ‘very, very, very tough.’ But she added, ‘That's what I needed.’ Jeantel was sent to a new school and last month she graduated from high school. She was presented with her diploma in her hometown of Miami, less than three miles from where Trayvon is buried. Jeantel, 20, poses with Sybrina Fulton following her graduation from the Academy for Community Education (ACE) in Miami, Florida as her mother, Marie Eugene, looks on . George Zimmerman, right, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the death of Trayvon Martin, left, last July . The moment was made extra special of Jeantel because Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, attended. ‘Her coming is like having Trayvon there saying, “You did it. You proved people wrong,’” Jeantel told Yahoo. Jeantel now speaks with a new found confidence after everything that she has been through. ‘I did it,’ she said. ‘The witness who didn’t know how to speak English knows how to speak English through the 12th grade now. I never quit.’ She also earned her driver’s license a few months ago and is looking for a job. The plan is for Jeantel to continue working with tutors on precollege curriculum before enrolling at a university. Becoming a clothing designer could be in her future. 'When people see Rachel Jeantel now, I want them to say, ""Wow, there was something good that came out of something so tragic,""' Vereen said.

"By . Wil Longbottom . Updated: . 11:43 EST, 18 January 2012 . Tensions: Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Patrick Walsh has said claims by six Asian nations on the oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea could descend into conflict . The U.S. Navy's top commander in the Pacific has said disputes over oil rich waters in the South China Sea could blow up into serious military confrontations. Admiral Patrick Walsh said a diplomatic row between six Asian nations over the Spratly Islands could escalate into a 'state-on-state conflict' as countries attempt to seize new oil resources. The South China Sea - which is heavily travelled by shipping companies, including tankers transporting oil from the Persian Gulf - is vital to the Asia-Pacific region. Adm Walsh said there was potential for an incident to intensify, in the same way tensions between China and Japan spiked after two of their ships collides near the disputed Senkaku and Diaoyu islands in 2010. 'Quickly the event escalated from something that was local, containable, manageable, to something that became a state-on-state sort of conflict. 'No matter which perspective you adopt, it's (the South China Sea) critically important for security and stability. It is the critical node to all the economic activity. 'Any interruption there would create a real problem.' The disputed Spratly Islands are made up of more than 750 individual islands, with a total surface area of less than two square miles. The group of islands is spread over a 164,093 square miles area off the coasts of the Philippines and Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. None of them have any native population, although some have military personnel in bases. Disputed: An aerial photo of Pag-asa Island, one of more than 750 that make up the Spratly Islands disputed by Brunei, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, The Philippines and Taiwan . Ownership: China, Vietnam, The Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all claim the Spratly Islands . The six Asian nations - Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam - claim all or part of the islands. 18th and 19th century maps from China and Vietnam both claim the islands as part of their territory. There have been various recriminations between the nations over competing claims in recent years. In May last year, Chinese naval vessels fired on Vietnamese fishing vessels near East London Reef and Cross Island. Competing claims: Chinese structures built on one of the islands taken in 1998. Nine years ago the six countries in dispute were due to sign an accord preventing conflict . Security: Another photograph shows military structures built by China in 1995. In the last year there have been reports of Chinese naval vessels firing on Vietnamese fishing boats in the area . Originally, China claimed to have incorporated the islands in around 200 BC. But the modern history of the area began when Japan held the Spratly Islands during the Second World War, but left after surrendering. During the 1960s and 1970s, The Philippines and South Vietnam took control of several islands. China and Malaysia also began claiming some of the islands in the late 1970s. By the mid 1980s, China and Vietnam were clashing over some of the disputed islands, but the 1989 outrage in Tiananmen Square forced China to back down. All six Asian nations agreed the Manila declaration to avoid conflict in the area in 1992 and a similar move was extended in 2002. By 2005, Vietnam, China and The Philippines sign an accord to protect oil and gas in the region. But by last year, tensions are again raised after a series of stand offs between rival navy or other shipping. The Philippines and Vietnam have both accused China of attempting to sabotage oil exploration work in the area. The Philippines and Vietnam have accused . Chinese vessels of repeatedly intruding into areas they claim and of . trying to sabotage oil explorations in their territorial waters. China has denied the allegations, saying it has sovereignty over the South China Sea. And in June 2011, the Philippines renamed the South China Sea and the Reed Bank the West Philippine Sea and the Recto Bank. Two years ago, Japan arrested the Chinese captain of a fishing vessel after it collided with one of its coast guard ships on patrol. In retaliation, Beijing suspended ministerial-level contacts with Tokyo and postponed talks on the joint development of undersea natural gas fields. It later halted Japan-bound exports of rare earth metals used in high-tech manufacturing. Adm Walsh added: 'Just how quickly that escalated - it inflamed passions on both sides. That's my concern.' He is due to retire and hand over the Pacific Fleet command to Vice Admiral Cecil Haney on Friday. The islands are thought to have large oil and gas reserves around them, but they area also areas of rich biodiversity and wildlife, home to endangered species including sharks and turtles.","Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all claim the Spratly Islands .
