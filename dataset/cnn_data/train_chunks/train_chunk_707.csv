Analysts at the National Security Agency are able to secretly access real-time user data provided by as many as 50 American companies, ranging from credit rating agencies to internet service providers. According to two government officials familiar with the arrangements, several of the companies have provided records continuously since 2006, while others have given the agency sporadic access. The officials disclosed the number of participating companies in order to provide context for a series of disclosures about the NSA's domestic collection policies. Many of the details are unveiled by Mark Ambinder, co-author of a new book about government secrecy and surveillance, Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry. Storage space: NSA's Utah Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah, where government records of citizen's phone and internet usage could be kept . 'The idea is to create a mosaic. We get a tip. We vet it. Then we mine the data for intelligence,' one of the officials said to The Week. In a statement, Director of National . Intelligence James Clapper said that programs collect communications . 'pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, ' and 'cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other . U.S person, or anyone within the United States.' The NSA needs several different collection tools, of which PRISM is one. PRISM works well because it is able to handle several different types of data streams using different basic encryption methods. It is a 'front end' system, or . software, that allows an NSA analyst to search through the data and pull . out items of significance, which are then stored in any number of . databases. No knowledge: Internet giant Google said that it had never heard of the PRISM scheme before reports broke last week . From the different types of data, . including their credit card purchases, the locations they sign in to the . internet from, and even local police arrest logs, the NSA can track . people it considers terrorism or espionage suspects in near-real time. An internet geo-location cell is on constant standby to help analysts determine where a subject logs in from. Most of the collection takes place on . subjects outside the U.S, but a large chunk of the world's relevant . communication passes through American companies with servers on American . soil. What is more unclear is how the NSA interacts with the companies. Computer giant: Apple also said that it had never heard of the PRISM program until now but reports say it has worked contributed to discussions with the government concerning sharing information . Several of the companies mentioned in . past few days deny granting access to the NSA. Might be possibly be . lying or is it that the NSA's arrangements with individual companies are . kept so tightly that very few people know about it? One official likened the NSA's collection authority to a van full of sealed boxes that are delivered to the agency. A court order permits the transfer of . custody of the 'boxes.' however, the NSA needs something else, a . specific purpose or investigation, in order to open a particular box. Classified: The particulars of the PRISM data-mining program have been outlined in a top-secret PowerPoint presentation for senior intelligence analysts, which ended up being leaked . Participants: This graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined PRISM, with Apple being the latest addition in October 2012 . The chairman of the Senate . intelligence committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said the standard was 'a . reasonable, articulatable' suspicion, but did not go into details. The NSA can collect and store trillions of bytes electronic information revealed by American citizens. In the government's eyes, the data is simply moving from one place to another. It does not become, in the government's eyes, relevant or protected in any way unless and until it is subject to analysis. Bombshell: NSA and FBI have been extracting audio, video, photos, e-mails, documents and other data from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL and PalTalk . Key source: PRISM has been described by NSA officials 'as the most prolific contributor to the president's Daily Brief,' providing analysts with a wealth of 'raw material' A spokesperson for Apple also denied any knowledge of PRISM's existence. It was claimed that the Silicon Valley . companies involved in the PRISM program are Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, . Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL and the lesser known Internet company . PalTalk, which has hosted a lot of traffic during the Arab Spring and . the on-going Syrian civil war. However, . only Facebook and Google have been shown to have worked toward creating . 'online rooms' in which to share data with the government. The wave of disclosures about the NSA programs have significantly unsettled the intelligence community. Targets: The tech giants involved in involved in PRISM are Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL and the lesser known Internet company PalTalk . The documents obtained by the two . newspapers are marked ORCON, or originator controlled, which generally . means that the agency keeps a record of every person who accesses them . online and knows exactly who might have printed out or saved or accessed . a copy. The NSA in particular has a good record of protecting its . documents. The scope of the latest leak suggests that several people with top-level security clearances had to be involved. Clapper said in his statement that the disclosures about the program 'risk important protections for the security of Americans.' 'Reprehensible': Director of National Intelligence James Clapper branded the program 'reprehensible' and said it risks Americans' security . Mining for data: The NSA has been getting millions of phone records from Verizon on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order .","Companies are all compelled by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to hand over any information requested under the law, but they're not required to make access easier .

For years, doctors have been treating HIV patients using anti-viral drugs, the effects of which can sometimes be mixed. Now a group of scientists in New York have tried seeing if using powerful doses of radiation - a radioactive smart bomb - might be more effective, and the results are very encouraging. Researchers found that in patients who were blasted with a combination of antiviral drugs and radiation, the treatment was even more effective and made the HIV virus became undetectable in the body. Cell with HV: Nearly nine million adults worldwide live with HIV receive antiretroviral therapy which keeps the virus from multiplying by killing the virus in the bloodstream, but it does not completely eliminate the HIV-infected cells . Dr. Ekaterina Dadachova, Ph.D., from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York is behind this pioneering research which investigated the ability of radioimmunotherapy to kill white blood cells infected with HIV. The radio active antibodies were also able to kill significantly more HIV-infected cells in the brain whilst doing less damage to the brains delicate systems. 'Antiretroviral treatment only partially penetrates the blood brain barrier, which means that even if a patient is free of HIV systemically, the virus is still able to rage on in the brain, causing cognitive disorders and mental decline,' Dr Dadachova said in a statement. 'Our study showed that radioimmunotherapy is able to kill HIV-infected cells both systemically and within the central nervous system.' Combo: Ekaterina Dadachova, professor of radiology, microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, believes the combination of antiviral drugs and radiation could be the answer to cure . After 30 years of fighting the deadly and incurable virus, scientists think they may be able to find a way to really kill it. Earlier this week the White House and the National Institutes of Health announced a new, $100 million effort to try to find a cure. In the latest study, researchers tested a modified version of a therapy now used to treat leukemia on blood taken from 15 patients with HIV, and found evidence it could clean out infected cells. These so-called latent cells are the main reason that HIV cannot be cured – they lie low in the body, quietly resting until drug treatment stops, and then roar back into action. The team tried the new technique on 15 patients being treated for HIV. It killed the infected cells that were still circulating in the patients, and even penetrated into the brain – something that not many drugs can do. “The elimination of HIV-infected cells with RIT was profound and specific,” Dr. Dadachova said. “The radionuclide we used delivered radiation only to HIV-infected cells without damaging nearby cells.” The human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS infects 35 million people globally and has killed another 36 million, according to the United Nations. There’s no cure and experimental vaccines work only poorly. HIV infection: New findings show that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) could potentially eradicate HIV-infected cells in a similar method to how cancer is treated . Drug treatment called antiretroviral therapy can keep the virus suppressed to such low levels that patients are healthy and much less likely to infect others. However, the virus always seems to remain in the body somewhere, and if the drug treatment is stopped, the cells usually start pumping out more virus again. Reservoirs of latently infected cells persist in the body, preventing the possibility of a permanent cure. In a few extremely rare cases, patients appear to have been cured. RIT, which has historically been employed to treat cancer, uses monoclonal antibodies- cloned cells that are recruited by the immune system to identify and neutralize antigens. On route to a cure: A large red ribbon hangs at the North Portico of the White House, for World AIDS Day. The red ribbon is worldwide regarded the symbol of solidarity with HIV-infected and those suffering from AIDS . Antigens are foreign objects like bacteria and viruses that stimulate an immune response in the body. The antibody, designed to recognize and bind to a specific cell antigen, is paired with a radioactive isotope. When injected into the patient’s bloodstream, the laboratory-developed antibody travels to the target cell where the radiation is then delivered. “In RIT, the antibodies bind to the infected cells and kill them by radiation,” Dr. Dadachova said. “When HAART and RIT are used together, they kill the virus and the infected cells, respectively.” 'We found that radioimmunotherapy could kill HIV-infected cells both in blood samples that received antiretroviral treatment  and within the central nervous system, demonstrating RIT offers real potential for being developed into an HIV cure,' Because the study was only conducted in blood samples and lab models, researchers say the next step is to test the treatment in clinical trials with humans.","Antiviral drugs are usually used to treat HIV and AIDS  but radiation could make treatment even more effective .
Radiation treatment similar to that used to treat cancer appears to remove the body of HIV infected cells .
Combination of radiation and antiviral medication may be the answer .

Emily Booth needed surgery to remove part of her finger and had to have a metal plate inserted after her finger was sliced off in the mechanism. Her mother, Amanda, is now considering taking legal action against Mothercare which sold the buggy. Hurt: Amanda Booth with her baby Emily who got her finger caught in a Mothercare buggy . Amanda, 21, said: 'Emily started screaming - I pulled the pushchair back up into place and realised her finger was hanging off. 'It was awful, there was blood everywhere.' Buggy: Emily Booth needed surgery to remove part of her finger and had to have a metal plate inserted after the Mothercare pushchair closed on her finger . Emily was rushed to a medical centre on Higher Hillgate in Stockport, and then taken in an ambulance to the town’s Stepping Hill Hospital. The 20-month-old was then transferred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, where Amanda was told Emily would need surgery. The operation took place the following day. Amanda, from Marple, said: 'The staff at Stepping Hill tried putting butterfly stitches in, but it didn’t work, and they told me I would have to take her to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.

Journalists from The Guardian could face criminal charges for transmitting out of the country top secret documents containing the names of British spies, a senior counter terrorism officer signalled last night. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick confirmed she is investigating whether the newspaper breached terrorism laws in its handling of tens of thousands of highly classified documents stolen by former US government employee Edward Snowden. Her comments came as the newspaper’s editor appeared to accept he had allowed the documents to leave Britain – an offence under the 2000 Terrorism Act punishable with a jail term of up to ten years. Scroll down for video . Editor of The Guardian newspaper Alan Rusbridger was called to give evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on why he published files leaked by Edward Snowden . But Alan Rusbridger defended his newspaper’s actions, saying that publishing the stories had provoked an important debate about the activities of security and intelligence agencies in the UK and US. He also claimed there had been attempts from within Government and elsewhere to ‘intimidate’ the newspaper into stopping its reporting of stories based on the Snowden cache. Both he and Miss Dick appeared yesterday before MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee. Mr Rusbridger was praised by Liberal Democrat and some Labour MPs for his newspaper’s reporting of the contents of the Snowden files. But he was criticised by Conservative MPs, and accused of having broken the law. In heated exchanges, Tory Michael Ellis accused Mr Rusbridger of being ‘woefully irresponsible with secret information and therefore people’s lives’ – a charge Mr Rusbridger denied. Contractor Edward Snowden took 58,000 files from the National Security Agency in the US and handed them to The Guardian . Tory MP Mark Reckless said Mr Rusbridger had ‘admitted a criminal offence’ when he admitted allowing the documents to be sent to the New York Times. Mr Rusbridger said he had not redacted the names of spies from the documents before sending them, but the newspaper used ‘military-grade’ encryption to safeguard the files. He said: ‘No data was lost, we lost control of no data. 'No names have leaked from The Guardian.’ He accepted that on a separate occasion the newspaper sent some documents via the courier company FedEx. Earlier this year, MI5 director general Andrew Parker warned that revelations from the Snowden files about the work of GCHQ and other agencies were a ‘gift to terrorists’. But Mr Rusbridger cited security and government officials on both sides of the Atlantic who had said no damage had been done to national security from the newspaper’s actions. Mr Rusbridger told the committee only 1 per cent of the files the newspaper held had been published. Spy bosses (left to right) Andrew Parker, the head of M15, Sir John Sawers, the head of M16 and Sir Iain Lobban, GCHQ director, told MPS the Snowden leaks were being 'lapped up' by Al Qaeda . Miss Dick told the MPs her team of officers are examining a ‘large amount’ of material. She said: ‘It appears possible once we look at the material that some people may have committed criminal offences. ‘We need to establish whether they have or haven’t, but that involves a huge amount of scoping of material.’ Asked if potential offences include those under section 58a of the Terrorism Act 2000, she replied: ‘Broadly, yes.’ This states it is illegal to ‘elicit’ any information about members of the security services, including MI5 and GCHQ. The Met is also investigating whether any offences have been committed under the Official Secrets Act, she said.","Debate rages about dangers of Edward Snowden leaking US secrets .

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 15:53 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:03 EST, 25 November 2013 . A retired property mogul came close to losing out on a £5.5million tax break - because of his domestic goddess wife's 'great cooking'. James Glyn insisted he was resident in Monaco when he received a £29million dividend from selling off his family property portfolio. But Revenue and Customs were equally adamant that his heart remained in London's prosperous St John's Wood - where his wife, Sarah, as well as being a high-powered charity chief, was legendary with family and friends for her sumptuous home cooking. The tax authorities cited the couple's regular returns to London for Jewish festivals and traditional Friday night suppers with their grown-up children as evidence that they had never really left - and were thus subject to the full gamut of UK taxes. Plush: Circus Road, in St John's Wood, London, where Revenue and Customs claimed Mr Glyn actually lived and, as a result, owed millions in tax . The couple spent about 200 days in Monaco (pictured) during the tax year in question and Mr Glyn told the tribunal that, after his departure from England, Circus Road 'did not feel like home' any more . Now, however, a tax tribunal has handed victory to Mr Glyn, 64, ruling that he had truly made his home in the tax haven principality after more than 30 years managing the family's £60million property empire - a task which he viewed as 'drudgery'. Mr Glyn - described as a thoughtful and 'not particularly extrovert' man who 'devours' reference books and loves playing Scrabble - found himself suddenly at the helm of the family's business at just 21 when his father died prematurely. His 'meticulous and highly organised' mind - when combined with the 'more extovert' style of his wife and brother, Stuart - led to phenomenal success for the family's property business, the Milverton Group Limited. The couple made their home in a splendid town house in exclusive Circus Road, St John's Wood, filling it with furniture and fittings worth up to half-a-million pounds and bringing up their children, Toby and Georgina, there. But, by 2005, Mr Glyn had had enough. Describing his daily work life as drudgery', he said he had never much liked his job and believed he had enough money to retire, said tribunal judge, Howard Nowlan. His brother set about selling off the family's property holdings and, in May 2005, Mr Glyn received a £29million dividend. Mr Glyn and his wife enjoyed watching the Grand Prix and tennis tournaments in Monaco, once sitting close to Andy Murray in a restaurant. File pictures . Revenue and Customs said £5.5million in income tax was due on that bonanza but the judge said 'battle lines were drawn' in a 'hard-fought' case when Mr Glyn insisted he and his wife had moved to Monaco in April 2005 and did not owe a penny. The tax authorities pointed to the couple's fondness for their London home and continued close contact with their children and a large circle of friends as evidence that their hearts had remained in St John's Wood and that they had never lost their UK residence. Sarah Glyn had only reluctantly given up her role as Chairman of Jewish charity - the Women's International Zionist Organisation - and had had 'mixed feelings' about leaving her home and following her husband to Monaco. Revenue and Customs said the couple's regular returns to Circus Road - so that Mrs Glyn could cook for friends and family on Friday nights and Jewish feast days - showed that, in their hearts, they had never left. The couple's twin Mercedes cars had remained behind them in London and Mr Glyn had applied for a residents parking permit, confirming that he was resident in Circus Road. However, Judge Nowlan said the couple had bought two luxury flats in Monaco and, although Mr Glyn returned to Britain 22 times in the 2005/06 tax year, he had kept well below the 90-day limit for overseas residency. The couple enjoyed visits from their children and friends, entertaining them at famous venues, including the top floor restaurant at the Hotel de Paris. File picture . Ruling that the couple had made 'a distinct break' with Britain, the judge added that family and friends' enjoyment of Mrs Glyn's culinary prowess was just one of a number of motives for their return trips to London. Friday night dinners were 'an ingrained feature of Jewish family life' and the judge observed: 'It seems odd to suppose that sustaining Mr Glyn's claim to have become non-UK resident should require that the invariable Jewish tradition should be abandoned or artificially restricted.' Whilst they were 'very fond' of Circus Road, Mr Glyn had genuinely sought a 'more relaxed lifestyle' in Monaco, losing two stone through a healthy exercise regime of walking and swimming, while his wife loved combing the food markets for delicacies. A lifelong migraine sufferer, Mr Glyn said he had never endured one since setting foot in Monaco, where he and his wife enjoyed watching the Grand Prix and tennis tournaments, once sitting close to Andy Murray in a restaurant. Mr Glyn admitted that 'his lifestyle in Monaco might be regarded by some as not terribly fulfilling'. But the judge added: 'However, not only was it what he wanted, and what totally suited his more solitary personality, but it was in some ways more fulfilling than many other ways of spending one's early retirement.' The couple enjoyed visits from their children and friends, entertaining them at world famous venues, including the top floor restaurant at the Hotel de Paris, and travelled frequently into Italy and France. They spent about 200 days in the principality during the critical tax year and Mr Glyn told the tribunal that, after his departure from England, Circus Road 'did not feel like home' any more. Ruling that Mr Glyn had 'unquestionably acquired a habitual abode in Monaco', the judge said he and his wife had enjoyed the affluent, sun-filled, lifestyle and had taken full advantage of the countless attractions' the principality had to offer. They had intended to make Monaco their 'home in every sense' and had done so 'for various personal reasons, going well beyond merely camping abroad to avoid tax,' the judge added. The tribunal heard that, after Georgina gave birth to the couple's grandchild in 2009, Mrs Glyn was drawn more and more back to the UK and the couple returned to Circus Road permanently in May 2010.","James Glyn moved to Monaco after a £29million dividend from family firm .

Newsreader Jon Snow has revealed he still hasn't made his mind up about God - despite being the son of a Bishop . As the son of a bishop, you might think he would have made his mind up on religion long ago. But at the age of 66, it seems Jon Snow still prefers to hedge his bets when it comes to believing in God. The veteran newsreader – whose father was the Bishop of Whitby - has revealed he enjoys all the trappings of faith, but is still unsure whether he is religious. Despite claiming to go to a small Saxon church in Berkshire – where he spends his weekends – once or twice a month, he told the Radio Times [must credit]: ‘I like the contemplation, the hour of peace, the hymns and the community. Dunno if that makes me religious. I believe in the collective power of the human spirit. Is that who God is? I don’t think my father would say so.’ As a boy, Mr Snow spent five years as a chorister in Winchester Cathedral and attended the staunchly Anglican Ardingly College, where his father George D’Oyly Snow was headmaster. The Channel 4 anchor – who has two children with his former partner Madeleine Colvin – married for the first time aged 62. He and Zimbabwean academic Precious Lunga – who is 27 years his junior – tied the knot on a Caribbean beach instead of walking down a church aisle. Known for his brightly coloured ties while presenting the news, Mr Snow insisted he is a rebel at heart. He said: ‘If you asked people around here, they’d say I was one of the most conservative forces in the newsroom – that’s small ‘C’ – but there is a rebel in me. ‘I’m wearing a bright tie largely because they told me colours on television didn’t work. In old-fashioned colour TV they would blow out a bit. I wore them deliberately.’ And the newsreader – who claimed he . is a ‘poor presenter’ – admitted he secretly loves the attention that . comes with his high TV profile. He . said: ‘Either the camera loves you or it doesn’t, and if it doesn’t . there’s nothing you can do about it. If it does, you’re very lucky. And . if it loves you, you’ll love it. I love cameras and people coming up and . doing selfies.’ The 66-year-old, whose father was the Bishop of Whitby, said he goes to church once or twice a month. 'I like the contemplation, the hour of peace, the hymns and the community,' he told the Radio Times . In February, Mr Snow revealed he was abducted and abused by a member of staff at Ardingly College in 1953. He said: ‘I was six years old when a member of the domestic staff at the school, where my father taught, abducted me. ‘He took me to his room and undressed me, and then himself. Thank heavens someone saw the abduction and eventually a member of staff intervened and rescued me. ‘I remember to this day fretting over not being able to do my braces up. And I admit that I have found Savile regurgitating the guilt and confusion that I felt.’ In the past, Mr Snow has been reticent about his own religious beliefs but has frequently criticised the teachings of church leaders. He angered some Catholics in 2009 by saying the Pope was ‘condemning many millions of people to death’ by opposing condom use in areas afflicted by the Aids pandemic in Africa. He has also criticised the Church of England for refusing to allow women bishops, and in one blog post criticised religious believers of all faiths for resorting to ‘violent verbal dispute’ rather than arguing peacefully.","66-year-old's father was the Bishop of Whitby .

Well-paid BBC stars should stop criticising the corporation in public and get on with their jobs, one of its top directors said last night. In a thinly-veiled broadside at some of the BBC’s top talent - including David Dimbleby and actress Jennifer Saunders - the corporation's Director of Television Danny Cohen said staff who go public with their concerns undermine morale. Speaking at a press launch of the BBC’s Christmas Drama schedule, he said: ‘I’m finding a little too often that people who work for the BBC and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation in public rather than deal with any issues or concerns internally. Well -paid BBC stars should stop criticising the corporation in public and get on with their jobs, Danny Cohen, one of its top directors said last night . ‘The BBC is an imperfect institution and ‘critical friends’ are an important way for us to keep improving. We must never be immune to criticism or unwilling to learn from others. ‘But I know that BBC staff often wonder why some of our on-screen talent and some former members of staff choose to attack or undermine the BBC in public rather than express any concerns they have in private conversations within the BBC. In short, this drives BBC staff mad.’ Although Mr Cohen refused to give names, BBC insiders said he was particularly incensed by a recent interview given by Mr Dimbleby, 75, as well as comments by Absolutely Fabulous star Miss Saunders and former head of TV news Roger Mosey. Last month, Mr Dimbleby - who has been at the corporation for more than 50 years – publicly accused the BBC being ‘too big for its own good’ and criticised its ‘terrible’ coverage of last year’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant. It followed an outspoken attack by Miss Saunders in a magazine interview, in which she said the BBC’s management was ‘top heavy’, and a devastating critique by Mr Mosey in a leader column for The Times newspaper. The former executive accused the BBC of being too big and too left wing, and suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of TV channels reduced. But instead of welcoming their contributions to the debate over BBC management, Mr Cohen accused them of damaging the corporation. In a thinly-veiled broadside at some of the BBC's top talent - including David Dimbleby and actress Jennifer Saunders - Mr Cohen said staff who go public with their concerns undermine morale . He said: ‘I would also like to call on those who are paid by the BBC but criticise it in media interviews and in public to think hard before they join the daily chorus of BBC-bashing that takes place in some quarters. ‘It is damaging to an institution that I’m convinced they love and would not actually want to harm. ‘From now, I’d like to call on everyone who believes in the BBC to get behind it, to speak up for it, to celebrate its successes and help us explain why the BBC really matters and sits proudly at the heart of public service broadcasting and Britain’s creative industries - rather than find ways to undermine it.’ Last month, Mr Dimbleby - who has been at the corporation for more than 50 years - publicly accused the BBC being 'too big for its own good' He added: ‘When problems do arise, let’s deal with them in the most effective way we can and instead use the privileged platform enjoyed by those in public life to highlight the unique attractions of the BBC and help ensure it is as healthy, vibrant, impactful and creative in its 2022 centenary year as it has ever been.’ Speaking to the Daily Mail after his public speech, Mr Cohen denied he wanted to clamp down on free speech by preventing whistleblowers from speaking out. He said: ‘We welcome public debate about the BBC. ‘But those who work for us, and who are well paid for doing so, should come to their managers with their concerns. ‘We should be working to make the BBC better, rather than attacking it.’","Danny Cohen: 'staff who go public with their concerns undermine morale'

Lord Judge: The Lord Chief Justice said issues such as prisoners' voting rights were a matter for Parliament alone and not the ECHR in Strasbourg . The former head of Britain’s judiciary last night demanded sweeping reforms to the Human Rights Act to make it clear our courts do not have to follow European rulings. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice until September, said issues such as prisoners’ voting rights were a matter for Parliament alone and not for the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. He warned that a dangerous ‘democratic deficit’ was emerging, adding: ‘My personal belief is that sovereignty on these issues should not be exported.’ Lord Judge accused the ECHR of seeking to expand its role into a US-style ‘Supreme Court of Europe’ and said: ‘In my view, the Strasbourg court is not superior to our Supreme Court.’ Last night, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – who would like to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act but  cannot while in Coalition with the  Lib Dems – welcomed the judge’s speech. It came just days after another senior judge, Lord Justice Laws, called on British courts to stop deferring to Strasbourg on every issue and develop their own rulings. Ministers are still deciding what to do to comply with a European  court decision on prisoner votes originally made in 2005. Strasbourg said the UK’s blanket ban was contrary to prisoners’ human rights, but the Commons has voted in favour of continuing to deny all prisoners the vote. Speaking at University College  London, Lord Judge said: ‘You can argue for and against prisoner voting rights. You can argue for and against the whole-life tariff. Reasonable people will take different views. ‘My personal belief is that sovereignty on these issues should not be exported, and we should be wary of the danger of even an indirect importation of the slightest obligation on Parliament to comply with the orders and directions of any court, let alone a foreign court. ‘Ultimately this is a political, not a judicial, question.’ The former Lord Chief Justice said Britain’s unwritten constitution included the core principle that Parliament is sovereign over the Supreme court. But recent judgments made it unclear whether it was the same case for Strasbourg. Justice secretary: Chris Grayling said the ECHR¿s role in the UK needs to be ¿curtailed¿ and the Human Rights Act replaced . ‘My profound concern about the long-term impact of these issues on our constitutional affairs is the democratic deficit,’ he said. ‘Are we – are they – prepared  to contemplate the gradual  emergence of a court with the equivalent jurisdiction throughout Europe of that enjoyed by the Supreme Court in the USA? Thomas Jefferson would have strongly advised us against it.’ Lord Judge concluded changes should be made to the 1998 Human Rights Act to make it clear that Britain’s Supreme Court is ‘at the very least, a court of equal standing with the Strasbourg court’. Mr Grayling said the ECHR’s role in the UK needs to be ‘curtailed’ and the Human Rights Act replaced.","Lord Judge said issues like prisoner's voting was for Parliament alone .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:00 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:00 EST, 4 December 2013 . A teenage girl says she became suicidal after hackers broke into her Facebook account and added hundreds of male strangers. Hannah Buckley, 16, said she was too scared to leave the house after vile messages were sent to her friends by the hacker. The once confident school girl said she was abused in the street by former friends who believed the taunts had been sent by her. Hannah, from Basildon, Essex, says she will be scarred for life by the experience. Hannah Buckley says she contemplated suicide after hackers broke into her Facebook account and sent vile messages to her friends and invited hundreds of men onto her page . The situation became so unbearable for Hannah that her mother put her on suicide watch, fearing she would kill herself. In August, shortly after she finished secondary school, Hannah was tried to log into her account but it said her password had been changed. Soon afterwards she was flooded with calls from friends, asking if she was ok. She said: 'My friends were so confused - they wanted to know why I was saying such horrible things on Facebook. I didn’t know what they were talking about and it was really upsetting.' Hannah immediately used her friend’s account to log on to Facebook and was devastated when she discovered the faceless hacker had filled her page with horrific posts. One read: 'I used to cut myself with glass, the things I do for attention... I must say them scars do look lovely'(sic) In another message, the hacker wrote: 'I only slag of the boys in Basildon because there’s no-one left to f***' (sic). Hannah's mother, Sally, became so concerned about her daughter's moods she put on her on suicide watch . Hannah said: 'I couldn’t believe anyone would do something so malicious to someone else. 'At the time I wasn’t scared, I was just . humiliated. I couldn’t bear to think what all my friends on Facebook . thought about me after seeing all the horrible stuff that had been . written.' The cyber bully then began sending abusive messages to her friends, pretending to be Hannah. One read: 'I hope your diabetes kills you and if you ask me if I sent this, il just deny it and say someone hacked me. (sic)' The hacker wrote to boys claiming Hannah had their baby or aborted their baby - even though she’d never had a relationship with them. And the number of friends on Hannah’s page doubled as hundreds of strangers were added to the page - mostly men. Hannah contacted Facebook and the company sent numerous emails advising her. However, she said it took her three months to get the account disabled because Hannah believes the hacker deleted the emails from Facebook. The hacker has never been identified. Hannah has since started an animal care course at college but says she has been scarred for life by the experience . Hannah said she tried to reassure friends and family that the account had been hacked but she was still bombarded with abuse. One person called her ‘evil’, while another said she was ‘a waste of sperm’ and one described her as ‘low life scum.’ She was even abused in the street after her friends persuaded her to go out to cheer herself up. Hannah said: 'My friends said I was . being silly but then we bumped in to a group of people that I had known . at school, I had been friends with them but when they saw me they . started jeering and hurling abuse at me. 'I went straight home and ran to my room. I wanted to pretend that nothing that had happened, I wanted it all to go away. 'I had heard about girls killing themselves and boys hanging themselves because of things that were said about them on Facebook. 'I understood how they’d felt. I’d been humiliated and made to look like somebody I wasn’t. 'I . thought about suicide, how it would make everything alright and how . nothing would matter anymore. I didn’t even think anyone would miss me . because everyone hated me. 'It seemed so pathetic but I didn’t know what do to, how to make it end. I thought about hanging myself or jumping off a bridge - It just seemed like the only way to deal with it. 'I felt so helpless because I couldn’t stop what was happening to me - I couldn’t shut my own page down. 'All I could do was watch while this person wrote more and more nasty messages on my wall.' She did not leave the house for two . months after the confrontation and her mother Sally said it was then . that she put her daughter on suicide watch. Her mother said: 'I really do think this will be the hardest thing that she’ll ever have to go through in her life. Her account was disabled after three months but the hacker has not ever been discovered . 'I had heard about other kids taking their own lives and I was so worried I made sure we watched her day and night. 'We were determined to get her through it. I told her she didn’t have to do it alone and we’d be there for her no matter what.' The 46-year-old added: 'I’m so grateful that we managed to support her through it and I would encourage more parents to be available for their kids and aware of this bullying that does happen sites like Facebook.' Hannah, who has since started an animal care course at college, said she now finds it difficult to trust people and is wary of social media sites. She said: 'I don’t want to go through it all again. Now I don’t really go on Facebook at all and I think I’ll just leave it alone all together. I won’t touch Twitter or anything else like that. 'I used to be really outgoing and confident - I’d be at the front of the classroom chatting to everyone.'

"By . Alasdair Glennie . PUBLISHED: . 18:23 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:23 EST, 4 December 2013 . James Harding, the BBC's new director of news, told the corporation 'we don't punch our weight in current affairs', during his first speech since taking over in August . The BBC does not ‘punch its weight’ in current affairs despite employing more than 5,000 journalists, its director of news admitted yesterday. In his first major speech since joining the corporation, James Harding called on staff to ‘change how we work’ in the wake of a series of recent scandals over its news coverage. The former Times editor - recruited by BBC in August on a salary of £340,000 – said he wants his team to focus anew on investigative reporting, ‘story-getting’ and improving the diversity of its presenters. Describing current affairs as the ‘backbone of BBC news’, he said: ‘We have a reputation for our commitment to current affairs. And yet, I don’t think we generally punch our weight. ‘Let me be clear what I mean by that. We’re a weighty organisation, and I’m very ambitious for our current affairs output. I want us to investigate, to analyse and explore the most significant stories we can find.’ ‘How do we achieve that? The vital first step is that we need to be as sure as possible that we’re aiming at the right targets. That means shifting the balance between the time we spend researching a story and producing it.’ Mr Harding made his comments in a speech to assembled staff at the BBC’s London headquarters - New Broadcasting House - yesterday morning. In recent years, BBC journalists have been the focus of intense criticism, starting with the failure of flagship current affairs programme Newsnight to unmark predatory DJ Jimmy Savile in 2011. The debacle triggered a series of recriminations that led to former news chief Helen Boaden offering her resignation amid accusations of ‘chaos’ and ‘meltdown’ in her department. In the wake of the scandal, Newsnight was again castigated for its failings when it wrongly identified Tory peer Lord McAlpine as a paedophile, prompting a £185,000 payout for damages. Mr Harding called on staff to 'change the way we work' in the wake of a series of high-profile scandals over coverage, including the failure of Newsnight to unmask predatory Jimmy Savile in 2011 . Its sister programme Panorama also came under the spotlight in April when an investigation into North Korea was accused of using students from the London School of Economics as a ‘human shield’. Urging the BBC to improve the ‘diversity’ of news presenters, Mr Harding raised eyebrows with one example – Laura Kuennsberg. Despite . inheriting her unusual name from a German-born paternal grandfather, . the Scottish journalist – recruited from ITV to present Newsnight last . month –can hardly count herself in a disadvantaged minority. But . it did not stop Mr Harding using her recent hiring as an example of . what is currently being done to put people with a broad range of . backgrounds on air. Her . name was listed alongside Radio 4 presenter Ritulah Shah – whose parents . are Bengali - and Today programme host Mishal Husain – whose whose . parents are Pakistani. He . said: ‘We want the BBC to look and sound more like its audiences: while . it’s been good to see Ritula Shah appointed to take over from Robin . Lustig on the World Tonight, Laura Kuenssberg rejoining the BBC and . Mishal Husain taking on Today, let’s be under no illusion that we are . going to have to be very determined to address diversity on air and, . equally, off it.’ A BBC . insider said Mr Harding was using Miss Kuenssberg as an example of a . successful female journalist, and wanted to see more women on air as . well as people from ethnic minorities. But Mr Harding warned his reporters not to lose faith in original journalism as a result of the scandals, saying: ‘Our response to Savile and McAlpine should not be that we shy away from investigative reporting and the coverage of difficult issues. In fact, we must renew our commitment to curious, inquisitive journalism in the public interest.’ Although he insisted the BBC is ‘the best news organisation in the world’, the news chief added: ‘The question is this: is it good enough? Do we break enough stories? Do we tackle important issues with sufficient impact? Are we keeping up with or setting the pace in mobile and social media?’ The BBC’s news division employs a total of 8,000 people – including support staff – of whom 5,500 are journalists. Although the corporation does not release departmental budgets on the grounds it is ‘commercially sensitive’, BBC News is thought to receive around £500million of the licence fee every year. Mr Harding warned staff would have to spend less in future as the BBC makes savings. He said: ‘It is unsettling and wearying to go through these rounds of cost-cutting. The reality we face, like so many other services and businesses, is that we are going to have to deliver more for less.’ However, he urged his reporters not to be ‘cowed’ by their critics, saying: ‘They say we are too big, too lazy, too wasteful, too left-wing – (a few say we’re too right-wing) - too monolithic, too insensitive, too white, too male, too old. And we have no business being defensive or, even worse, dismissive of such criticism. ‘We must, genuinely, be alive to our critics, but we must not be cowed by them. Ultimately, our answer to them is and will be our journalism.'","In his first speech James Harding called for a focus on investigative reporting, 'story-getting' and improving the diversity of its presenters .

James Leslie, 37, was held in connection with a shooting at 4am today on Cardigan Road in the Hyde Park area of the city. Two uniformed officers were called to a disturbance when they were confronted by a man, believed to be Leslie, who then fired at them. One female officer received serious but non-life threatening injuries to her face, neck and right hand, police have said.

He said he later heard multiple shots. The . teenager said the suspect came to his house, which backs on to the scene of . the shooting, complaining that someone was shining a torch through his . window. 'He was shouting his mouth off and all that, saying he was going to pop bullets in us and slice us up and all that,' he said. 'That . argument died down but he was carrying on for about five or six hours. He was going on and on and on, slamming his doors and going 'Come out, . you faggots, come out, you faggots, I'm going to put bullets in you'.' Crime scene: Armed police guard a sawn-off shotgun in Leeds at the scene where James Leslie was arrested following the shooting of a WPC in the early hours of today .

Row: Kieran Williams, near the scene at Cardigan Road, said he had been in a row with Lesley last night and claims the suspect threatened to shoot him and friends . He went to bed but was woken by a loud bang at between 2.30am and 3am when Leslie threw a bottle through his window. He . said that at about 3.30am he heard 'one clean shot and then, like he . was holding the gun in the air, like he was firing shots everywhere'. He said the police had come round earlier to talk to the people in the house about the broken window. He . said: 'The policewoman's come out of out house and gone round there to . the disturbance, to the man that's threw the bottle through the window . and been shot, obviously, hasn't she?' Resident Ro Tabrez, 21, said: 'I was half asleep when all of a sudden there was a loud bang which sounded like somebody slamming a garage door shut. 'There was a ten second gap and then another two or three loud bangs followed. It was enough to wake me up fully. 'I didn't think much about it at the time, as it's a student area, so there's always noise around here at all times during the night and day, and the last thing you'd think would be a gunshot.' Smashed: A forensic officers pokes their hand through a broken pane of glass likely to have been damaged when a West Yorkshire officer was shot in the face . Investigation: Forensic officers search the grounds near a house where a female police officer was shot in Leeds overnight . Speaking . at the scene, Chief Superintendent Paul Money said the female officer . suffered 'serious' injuries to her face, neck and right hand. 'Her condition is described as poorly but stable and not life-threatening,' he said. 'Her colleague, her male colleague, was uninjured but thankfully was able to provide immediate care and remove the injured officer from harm's way and also summon assistance from other officers. 'Additional officers were dispatched to the scene and earlier this morning, as a consequence of support from those officers and from members of the public, the suspect has been arrested. 'A firearm has also been recovered. 'This is quite obviously an incident that is thankfully rare in Leeds but nonetheless very shocking.'He said police were in control of the situation 'very quickly'. 'We are not looking for anybody else in connection with this incident,' he said. 'Officers are still deployed in this community, reassuring people.' Arrest: Police descended on Wood Lane, close to where the shooting happened and arrested the wanted man close to a primary school . Scene: Two officers attended a disturbance call at 4am today on Cardigan Road (pictured) in the Hyde Park area of Leeds when they were attacked, which is being guarded by armed officers today . Office worker Ash Hayden told MailOnline he saw Leslie caught after armed police pinned him to the ground close to his office. 'We heard the helicopter circling and then there were shouts from police telling a man to get on the floor. 'There were six police cars and the sound of dogs barking. Obviously they were using them to hunt for him.' Assistant . Chief Constable Geoff Dodd said: 'Officers made an arrest at 10.10am on . Wood Lane, Leeds, and I can confirm that we have recovered a firearm. 'This followed information provided to us by a member of the public that a man fitting the description had been seen nearby. 'The . officer has sustained a very serious injury and her wellbeing is of . paramount importance to us. The thoughts of colleagues remain with the . officer and her family at this very difficult time. 'It is right . to say that incidents where police officers face threat from firearms . are thankfully very rare but that does not lessen the shocking impact . when an officer is injured in such a way.' Manhunt: Police used a team of armed officers, dogs and a helicopter to hunt for Leslie, who they urged to give himself up before he was caught . Police presence: Officers hunting for Leslie cordoned off this house on Cardigan Road, which was photographed this morning by Graham Carr, who works across the road . After the shooting Mr Leslie was last seen he was on a bicycle heading towards Victoria Road away from Cardigan Road. Ned Liddemore, vice chairman of the Police Federation, said: 'This was a cowardly attack on two unarmed police officers dealing with a so called 'routine' call. 'As has been shown in the early hours of this morning, there is no such thing as a routine call when it comes to police officers. 'We will be supporting the officers and their families through this traumatic time.'

'He had told Mr Winser she had taken the drugs an hour and a half earlier at 9.50pm and he had sat with her as she took it.' Miss Hole had previously spoken to local newspapers as part of Tick Prevention Week to warn against the dangers of tick bites. She told Newbury Today website in 2009: 'My life was unbearable for a number of years but I never gave up hope. 'John cared for me for a number of years. He did all the cooking, everything and pushed me around in my wheelchair.' Mr Mladenovich had been due to answer . bail in July this year following his wife's suicide, but was found dead . in May, the inquest heard.

'The police found a note on the door saying ""I’m in the living room, I have taken my own life’,' Mr Salter told the inquest. 'He was found curled up on the sofa holding three pictures of his deceased partner.' Mr Barrick, who had befriended Mr Mladenovich . in 2012, added: 'He was clearly distraught about about what happened to his wife. 'He talked about how he could not carry on without her and wanted to end his own life.' Debilitating: Lyme disease is spread to humans by infected ticks. Above, Lyme disease spirochetes . Suicide notes were later discovered under a radiator and on a nearby computer, along with Mr Mladenovich's belongings neatly packed up and labelled, the inquest heard.

Pouting from behind her Gucci skiing goggles, posing on the slopes in fur-trimmed ski-wear, and showing off her tan in designer dresses - Gemma Harvieu's Facebook photographs boast of a life of glamour and luxury. But today the 29-year-old Selfridges beautician was facing a possible jail sentence after admitting assisting her fugitive armed robber boyfriend Andrew Moran, 31, after he fled an English courtroom for life on Spain's Costa del Sol. The gangster's moll dramatically changed her plea on the third day of her trial at Preston Crown Court, where she admitted charges of assisting an offender and money laundering. Life of luxury: But today Gemma Harvieu, 29, faces a possible jail term after admitting assisting an offender and money laundering . Jet-set lifestyle: Harvieu enjoyed holidays by the sea and on the slopes, but today admitted her guilt in court . Together: Gemma Harvieu with Andre Moran - she had denied knowing he was a fugitive or criminal . Harvieu, who will be sentenced on Friday, admitted her guilt after a jury heard how she would join Moran - who jumped out of the dock at Burnley Crown Court in 2009 while on trial for robbing a Royal Mail van at gunpoint - at a string of exotic locations during his four years on the run. In one 12-month period alone, the former lap dancer flew to Alicante to see Moran 23 times whilst earning a modest wage working on the cosmetics counter of the department store at the Trafford Centre, near Manchester. Preston Crown Court was told that despite her relatively small income, Harvieu enjoyed a jet-set lifestyle and would regularly shop in the expensive stores on London's Bond Street.  She visited Paris, Pisa, the Alps and Vienna, where she bought a pedigree dog, the court heard. Inquiries revealed Harvieu, of Chorlton, Greater Manchester, was helping wire money from Western Union outlets to Spain where Moran, from Salford, collected it using an assortment of false identities, it was said. Before Moran escaped she was banking only £7,000 a year in her personal account. Yet after he fled the UK, her account was used to field a string of deposits of up to £2,000 including a series of cash payments totalling £22,000 to help fund his life on the run. Devoted: The glamorous brunette, a former lap-dancer, flew to Alicante to see Moran  23 times in 12 months . This image, retrieved by police, shows Harvieu and her boyfriend having fun before they were caught by officers . It all ended on 10 May this year when Moran and Harvieu were caught in a police swoop as they relaxed by a pool at a villa near Alicante. Armed officers found firearms, live ammunition, mobile phones and evidence false identities. 'This just wasn’t some rich boyfriend she had picked up in Spain who was treating her to a celebrity lifestyle In the Costa Del Sol away from her life back in Manchester,' said prosecutor Tim Brennand prosecuting. 'There was much much more to this. Moran was very much living the clichéd lifestyle of a resident of the so-called Costa Del Crime, and the inference is she was living out a life effectively as a gangster’s moll. 'The couple were spending time with one another. It is inconceivable that she was ignorant of the life she had chosen for herself with Moran. She was inextricably linked to his flight from justice and criminal lifestyle.' Scroll down for video . Day job: Harvieu worked on the cosmetics counter at Selfridges in Manchester, pictured . Moran had gone on the run in March 2009 as he was standing trial over a £25,000 gunpoint raid on a Royal Mail delivery van. Realising he was about to be remanded in custody at Burnley Crown Court, he vaulted over the dock and ran out into the street before officers had the time to take hold of him. He later fled the UK after he used a false passport to buy a ticket for a Monarch Airlines flight to Alicante. But while police were hunting Moran, from December 2009 to May 2011 Harvieu flew 22 times with Monarch from Manchester to Alicante- sometimes twice a month - allegedly to see him. In 2010 she flew to Alicante 23 times with some of the flights paid for by Moran, his sister and his friends. She would arrive back in the UK after trips only to return shortly after by Eurostar. Expensive tastes: Jurors at Preston Crown Court heard Harvieu enjoyed shopping on London's Bond Street . A European arrest warrant was issued for Moran in 2010 and in November 2012 Spanish police set a road block to trap him. But Moran spotted the officers in uniform, rammed his 4x4 car through the police cordon and drove off in the wrong direction away from the trap set for him. Police searched his flat and found firearms, cash, drugs and false identities were seized but the trail went cold until he was tracked down to the villa in Alicane with Harvieu. Captured: Andrew Moran, pictured, was arrested by police in Spain earlier this year . Mr Brennand added: 'He was using a variety of false passports, and mobile phones and they were enjoying the high life. Photos showed a variety of cars and motorcycles and Andrew Moran posing with weapons. 'It demonstrates more about the brazen personality of Andrew Moran and a fascination for ammunition and drugs and that he had done very well for himself after leaving the dock at Burnley Crown Court.' Police analysed Harvieu’s Halifax Ultimate Reward Current Account and spoke to work colleagues who said she had no longer wanted to work at Selfridges after meeting a man in Spain. Between March 2009 and November 2012 a total of £38,930 in cash deposits were made including cash payments totalling £22,335 in 2010. She was entrusted to send money to allocated names in five transactions totalling £4,000 between November 2010 and 7 December 2010 all being collected in Spain. Mr Brennand said: 'The cash lodgements were the sort that would not trigger money-laundering alarm bells. It was deposit after deposit after deposit. 'The location was consistent, we can see spending in shops, establishments in Manchester, Bond Street in London and locations in Spain and Europe where money is going in and out of the UK. Escape: Andrew Moran flees a trial at Burnley Crown Court in 2009 . The court heard Harvieu denied ever knowing Moran was a fugitive or a criminal - even though his escape was reported in newspapers and on BBC’s Crimewatch programme. Mr Brennand said: ’The television is a funny thing, when it touches you the natural thing we do is tell friends, family, you tell anybody and everybody you possibly can. 'Looking at their relationship, it is simply inconceivable that she was not aware of who he was or what he was. Applying commonsense she would have discovered the truth.'

Pervert: Robert Perez left one woman 'afraid to go outside' after plaguing her with sexually explicit calls . A Harrods chef who bombarded five women with perverted calls and sex texts has avoided a prison sentence. Robert Perez, 31, left one woman ‘afraid to go outside’ after plaguing her with calls at her home so that he could live out his ‘sexual fantasies’. The married cook, from Bletchley, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire,  made groaning noises and touched himself as he whispered obscenities to his horrified victims, Isleworth Crown Court heard. In one of the scores of calls Perez made over a 16-month period, he told one terrified woman: ‘I’m the one you want to f*** in the a***’. Perez kept a several SIMs so he could phone his victims on different numbers, the court was told. One card was found in his work locker at Harrods, while another number he used was from a phone belonging to his wife’s friend. Perez told police he did it for his own sexual benefit and admitted masturbating and touching himself while on the phone to the victims. Judge Martin Edmunds QC, allowed the pervert to escape jail with a three-year community and supervision order. ‘It would have been a suspended sentence but I don’t have the power to suspend it for three years’, he told Perez. The court heard that Perez was either at home or visiting family in Harrow, northwest London, when he made dozens of calls to the five women from May 2012 until September 30 this year.

At a previous hearing at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court, District Judge Paul Clark described Perez’s crimes as ‘appalling’. ‘I am quite sure your victims were appalled by your behaviour and scared at least one of them who was afraid to go outside.’ Perez admitted five counts of stalking involving serious harm or distress to five different victims.

If you want to make sure your Christmas cards arrive on time, spending an extra 10p on a first class stamp seems like the obvious thing to do. But you’ll be wasting your money, a consumer champion warned yesterday – because of a little known get-out clause in Royal Mail’s delivery targets. The rules, laid down by the regulator Ofcom, state that Royal Mail must aim to deliver 93 per cent of first class post on the next working day. But between December 2 and December 31, these rules are scrapped. First class: Last year, only one in two Christmas cards posted first class arrived the next working day, although Royal Mail beat its target between April and September (file picture) Last year, only one in two Christmas cards posted first class arrived the next working day, although Royal Mail beat its target between April and September. In fact, over the festive period, second class post is typically more reliable. Under the regulator’s rules, Royal Mail must aim to deliver 98.5 per cent of second class letters within three working days. Last Christmas, it achieved a rate of 93.1 per cent – yet second class stamps are 10p cheaper than first class, which currently cost a record high of 60p. Robert Hammond, director of postal policy at Consumer Futures, the watchdog which published the research, said ‘cheaper second class’ post is a ‘super savers tip’. His advice came as Royal Mail promised that postal workers will not strike over ‘the whole of the Christmas trading period’. Yesterday’s announcement triggered a sharp jump in the firm’s share price, which closed yesterday at an all-time high of £5.90. Strikes: Royal Mail promised that postal workers will not strike over the whole of the Christmas trading period . That’s 80 per cent higher than when it was privatised last month, further fuelling fears that the company was sold too cheaply. The low price has been widely criticised by MPs, amid fears the sale has robbed the taxpayer of billions of pounds. Bankers involved in the flotation told MPs on the . Business Select Committee the strike threat was the main reason the shares were priced as low as £3.30. James Robertson, managing director of UBS, said: ‘It [the strike threat] was the most significant factor in terms of the pricing of the deal.’ Richard Cormack, managing director of Goldman Sachs, said: ‘I would say at that point, as we have just discussed, the threat of industrial action and the fact that the strike ballot was due just after the closing of the original timetable was a factor.’ But Royal Mail and the Communication Workers’ Union have finally reached a deal following marathon talks, which began last year, about workers’ pay, pensions and terms and conditions. No details of the agreement were published yesterday because they must first be considered by the CWU’s bosses and be agreed by its members in a ballot. A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘The CWU has confirmed that there will be no disruption through industrial action during the ratification process of the proposed agreement, including the whole of the Christmas trading period.’ This year the last posting date for second class mail is December 18. For first class it is December 20, and for the more expensive ‘special delivery guaranteed’ service it is December 23.","Royal Mail must deliver 93 per cent of first class .

Prolific film and music pirate Keith Tamkin, 52, of Felpham, Sussex, was jailed for 18 months after admitting infringing copyright and other charges . A film and music pirate who ran a vast illegal downloading operation has been jailed after police found his stash of thousands of knock-off films and albums. Cyber-criminal Keith Tamkin, 52, downloaded an estimated 150,000 movies and songs onto more than 100 computers before copying them onto CDs and DVDs and selling them to a network of clients, Chichester Crown Court heard. Tamkin, of Felpham, Sussex, was sent to prison yesterday after admitting infringing copyright, money laundering, transferring criminal property and possessing prohibited weapons. He was caught when police and anti-piracy investigators from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) raided two addresses in November 2011. They discovered more than 100 computer hard drives, filled with an estimated 150,000 CDs and films, and eight computers set up to burn as many DVDs at once as possible. His hoard, found at his home in Felpham and a flat in Bognor Regis, was so vast it took police more than a year to sort through it, the court was told. Tamkin pleaded guilty to one count of distributing articles infringing copyright, two of money laundering involving £140,000, and one of transferring criminal property. He also admitted possessing prohibited weapons - a pepper spray and a stun gun - and was jailed for 18 months. Speaking after the hearing David Wood, of the BPI said: 'This case was significant in that it was the largest domestic factory uncovered to date in the UK. 'It had the capability of manufacturing and distributing counterfeit product on a truly commercial scale.' Detective Inspector Chris Neilson of the Sussex Police Economic Crime Unit said: 'Detectives and Financial Investigators from our Unit worked closely with the BPI and were able to establish Tamkin’s full role in this case. Tamkin was jailed for 18 months at Chichester Crown Court, pictured, after admitting video piracy (stock image) 'Intellectual Property (IP) crime and associated offences of money laundering will be pursued by Sussex Police in a co-ordinated way with partners involved in tackling IP Crime, including the Intellectual Property Office, in order to disrupt this type of criminality.'We will now be seeking a court confiscation order against Tamkin under the Proceeds of Crime Act to take back for society his criminal profits.' Video and music piracy, or illegally downloading films and music, is a significant problem in Britain, where an estimated 7million people visit sites that offer content illegally each month. Pirates can use peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in which individuals share files with each other, or cyberlockers, where individuals can upload songs or films for another to download. Online music thieves can use stream-ripping applications, which record music played digitally over the internet, while both music and films can be recorded via unlicensed streaming services. Illegally copying film and music is a big problem in the UK but authorities are cracking down (file image) Usually the people involved in generating these illegal sources of content charge for the service. Authorities have noticed a relative reduction in the number of people accessing this illegal content recently, largely thanks to some of the most popular sites being shut down or restricted. Megaupload, which had more users than any other locker site in the UK, with around 1.3million visitors a month,  was shut down last year. Filesonic restricted its service and then shut down in the wake of Megaupload being closed, while another site called RapidShare restricted its service in a move to avoid illegal downloads.

A campaigner is shining a light on the emotional, physical and sexual abuse young girls experience at the hands of their peers and campaigning for change. Children as young as 11 are being groomed, bullied, beaten and raped by boys not much older than themselves and Carlene Firmin, 29, from north London says government policy does not protect them. 'We have a child protection system that is designed to look at risk in the home and assess a child there,' she argues. 'But in the files I’ve looked at, the primary risk - in terms of sexual abuse, physical assault and risk of offending - comes from their peer group.' Carlene witnessed effects of gang violence first-hand when six murders occurred in her home town . Victims of child-on-child sexual abuse tend to be between 11 and 13 . when it starts, perpetrators between 13 and 15, Firmin outlines to the Evening Standard. She explains how young girls are victim to extreme sexual bullying upon joining secondary school and made to feel that in order to fit in, they must comply with the culture. But why boys are motivated to rape their peers is 'quite complicated' - especially when they operate as a group. For her research, the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have given Carlene access to their files on violent cases among the young. She also talks to victims first hand. 'When someone trusts you with their story, you honour that trust,' says Carlene, who has worked with female victims attached to gangs since 2005. The most harrowing tale she can recall comes from a 20-year-old whom she met in a refuge. The young woman, who can no longer have children due to her injuries, had two relationships with gang members as a teenager. They broke her legs and collar bone, . beat and cut her with knives. They both raped and filmed her in front . of their friends, and she was even 'sold' to clear a drugs debt. The young woman thought her gang association would mean she wouldn't be taken seriously. Young girls are made to feel in order to fit in, they must comply . 'She thought she'd brought it on herself . because she gained something from the relationships: her ex was giving . her coke... She couldn't acknowledge she was a ""worthy"" victim,' says Carlene. This young woman contributed her story to Carlene's nationwide research project, where she interviewed around 800 men and women from 2005 to 2008. Her report eventually earned £1.2 million of government funding towards services that protect and work with young people at risk of gang-related and sexual violence. There are now 13 new posts around the country, largely thanks to Carlene's work. To earn the trust of her interviewees, Carlene would need to make repeat visits to refuges, prisons and schools and give talks. She was initially interviewing people on the impact of gangs, and sexual violence seemed to be the  hidden piece of the jigsaw. When she put out a call for focus groups on young people and weapons, she was shocked when half the attendees were women. She work tirelessly and listens to the most horrific stories, but says progress keeps her going . 'They told us about being coerced to carry guns and knives, sexual violence and exploitation,' says Carlene. 'One girl told us, ""They stop and search young men, but you can't stop and search for rape"".' Passionate for change, Carlene has achieved a staggering amount in her eight years, propelling issues surrounding young women, weapons and gang violence firmly onto the government's agenda and working on projects ensuring they are safer and their voices are being heard and taken seriously. She witnessed the effects of gang violence first-hand in 2005 when six murders occurred in just seven months in her home town. It was this that inspired her to attempt to make changes on a national level. 'People in government making the decisions had no idea what it was like to live in an area like that, but I did,' Carlene says. She work tirelessly and listens to the most horrific stories, but says progress keeps her going . 'Before my research there was nothing in government policy to deal with gang violence with women.' But upon uncovering the full impact of violence on young women, she was sent to a UN conference to present her findings and later awarded an MBE. 'There are funds for violence against women, but not for . this particular group... A 15-year-old girl who needs . protection from 20 young men is in a very different situation. There . were lots of issues not being addressed,' she says. 'We quickly had a significant impact.' She launched the MsUnderstood Partnership on August to address gender inequality among the young, and last week advised the Office of the . Children’s Commissioner after launching the highly-publicised national inquiry into sexual exploitation of girls by gangs. 'At the moment it's just me working with an intern and an advisory panel who assist. We want to secure more funding and hire three young women in the New Year,' she says. Her next task is writing a PhD tackling child peer-on-peer abuse at Bedfordshire University. 'I'm lucky that we've seen significant . changes in government policy. Securing change is what spurs me on, but . so much more work needs doing... 'There's only so much MsUnderstood can do. We need to not be needed, and for the work to be delivered without me there. I want a national strategy to tackle the issue.'

Accident: Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor, a keen horsewoman who was crushed to death by a hay bale at a farm near Morecambe . A farmer’s wife has been given a suspended jail term after a woman died under a half-ton bale of hay at her stables. Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor was crushed under the bale at the equestrian centre and pony club owned by Carol Hill on the Beaumont Grange Farm run by her husband Stephen near Morecambe, Lancashire. Hay had been provided for horses at the stables in a large hay trough - but this was frequently left empty, Preston Crown Court heard. Instead it had become common practice for customers to go to the hay stack, five bales high, cut open the black plastic wrapping on the bottom bale, and take hay from there for their horses. As more hay was taken it lead to the stack becoming dangerously unstable, the court heard. On May 31, 2011 Mrs Conroy-Taylor, 45, was killed by a bail at the stables where her daughter, Zara, 12, kept her horse, Flash. The court heard Carol Hill was aware of the practice of taking hay from the bottom bale, but failed to recognise the dangers - with tragic consequences. Hill, 54, a leading member locally in the Pony Club, admitted at an earlier hearing a single charge under the Health and Safety Act of failing to ensure the safety of persons not in her employment. Her husband, aged 55, admitted the same charge relating to another hay stack, not involved in the fatal accident, on a different part of the farm. Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor was crushed under the bale at the equestrian centre and pony club owned by Carol Hill (left) on the Beaumont Grange Farm run by her husband Stephen (right) The bales of hay, one of which fell and killed Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor . Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell QC said: 'On the 31st of May, 2011 Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor lost her life at the age of 45 in shocking circumstances, witnessed by her 12-year-old daughter. 'The family’s loss can’t be under-estimated.' Referring to Carol Hill he added: 'Having known hay was being taken from the bottom stack she failed to recognise it represented a risk. 'It was a tragically wrong assessment and if proper thought had been applied her conclusions would not have been drawn.' He gave Hill an eight month jail sentence, suspended for two years, with 200 hours unpaid work and ordered her to pay £10,000 in prosecution costs. The accident happened at Beaumont Grange Farm. If the health and safety regulations had been followed the death would not have occurred, the court heard . Her husband was sentenced to a £2,500 fine and ordered to pay the same amount in prosecution costs. Earlier Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said the Hills, married for 29 years with two adult sons, ran the farm with Mr Hill taking care of the 450 livestock and his wife running the equestrian centre. Mr Hill had originally stacked 220 bales at the equestrian centre on the farm, with 38 left when the accident happened. Mr Berlin said Mr Hill should have taken a bale from the top of a stack so it could be distributed. And Mrs Hill knew people were carrying on an 'unsafe practice' by taking hay from a bottom bale and this made her 'highly culpable' he told the court. Children had also been seen climbing on the bales and taking hay, he said. If the health and safety regulations had been followed the death would not have occurred, the court heard. 'These failures were systemic and persisted over a considerable period of time,' he added. Mark Saville, defending Carol Hill, whose deceased father was a local farmer, councillor and magistrate, said in mitigation, her passion was horses and the equestrian centre her 'life’s work'. He said Hill did not appreciate the risks of people taking hay from the bail as they did. 'She got it wrong, and of course we know the consequences of that tragic mistake. She is devastated by the loss of life and her appearance before the court today.' Bernard Thorogood, defending Stephen Hill, said his offence was not related to the death of Mrs Conroy-Taylor - and related to the collapse of another stack on another part of the farm after the accident happened. The court heard the Hills had sold their house in Carnforth for a 'substantial sum' to build another home on their farm. But their lawyers said they were heavily indebted and did not make much money from the farm and riding business so could not pay large fines. The family of Mrs Conroy-Taylor are understood to be suing the Hills for damages in the civil courts.","Charlotte Conroy-Taylor was crushed as she got hay for daughter's horse .

He hit him with a cleaver and stabbed him in what was a ‘prolonged horrific and very violent attack and his body was terribly mutilated,’ Nigel Pascoe QC, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court. Several doctors assessed Addo as being profoundly mentally ill and borderline insane. He mutilated the body of Mr Marquez to stop him recovering from his injuries, the court heard. Sentencing Addo, a judge told him it was common ground he was dangerous. He said Addo would serve the minimum term but also imposed an indefinite restriction under the Mental Health Act. ‘The result of the sentence I have imposed is that the public now has the double protection provided by the Mental Health Act and the involvement of the parole board,’ Mr Justice Burnett said. Family: Sergio Marquez with his mother Maria Carmen Marquez Torres, who said her son was 'a kind, good-hearted and beautiful man who touched the lives of everyone who met him' ‘You will be detained for at least six and half years but will not be released unless the relevant authorities conclude that is it safe to do so. Praise: Sergio Marquez was a 'bright 23-year-old Spaniard who was living and working in Bournemouth' ‘Given all that I have heard, you must recognise that there is a real possibility that such a conclusion will never be reached.’ Engineering graduate Addo, who was born in Britain but had also lived in the US, absconded from the Huntley Mental Health Centre in Central London where he was a voluntary patient the day before a mental health tribunal in October 2011 decided he should be sectioned. Addo then ‘disappeared’ from mental health services before he moved to Bournemouth in May 2012. He killed Mr Marquez, a hotel waiter, on July 17 last year - nine months later, the court previously heard. The headless body of Mr Marquez, which had also been eviscerated, was found by other flat mates who ran screaming from the flat. Police officers arrested Addo nearby covered in blood, the court was told. He had fled the flat when the others had returned. Flatmates told police that Addo had been acting strangely, that he used to steal food from them and had used book pages as toilet paper. He had not paid his rent and had been told to leave by the landlord, the court heard. Mr Marquez had sent a note about his anti-social behaviour and Addo resented it, the court heard. The victim had tried to defend himself from the attack but was cornered in a room. A neighbour heard some of the attack and Mr Marquez saying ‘please Karl, please Karl’, furniture being dragged around and then Addo laugh, Mr Pascoe said. Reaction: Residents are talked to by police near the scene of Mr Marquez's death in Bournemouth in July 2012 . He was decapitated and disemboweled after he died, the court was told. Addo, of no fixed abode, pleaded not guilty to murder on Monday but guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility. 'The brutal killing of this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family' Mr Justice Burnett . The prosecution said the plea was acceptable because Addo had been severely mentally ill when he killed Mr Marquez, who lived in Coin near Malaga in Spain and had come to England to find work. The judge paid tribute to Mr Marquez. ‘He was a bright 23-year-old Spaniard who was living and working in Bournemouth. 'In particular, he wished to improve his English and so his general prospects, not least because of the very difficult economic position in Spain in recent years. Emotional: Maria Carmen Marquez Torres (right) poses with her partner Francisco Segado Ramos following the death of her son Mr Marquez (left) ‘The brutal killing of this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family.’ Speaking after the case, Mr Marquez's mother Maria Carmen Marquez Torres said: ‘Sergio was a kind, good-hearted and beautiful man who touched the lives of everyone who met him. ‘I have lost my son and the world has lost a wonderful man. I believe that I have received justice for me and for Sergio. ‘No sentence would ever be sufficient and nothing will ever compensate me for the loss of my son, but I find comfort in the fact that Mr Addo will not have his freedom for a long time and inflict this pain on any other family.’","Karl Addo, 30, from Dorset, was suffering from delusions of persecution .

Five nurses were today found guilty of neglect at a care home where malnourished pensioners lived on porridge and had pressure sores so deep that their bones were exposed. The abuse came to light after five residents aged between 83 and 100 died in just two weeks at the scandal-hit Parkside House Nursing Home in Northampton. Home manager Phyllis Johnson and nurses Anastacia Madulu, Girlie Franklin, Maria McKenzie, and Mary Ombui, were all found guilty of failing to provide basic care to ten residents between them. Nurses: Anastacia Madulu (left) and Girlie Franklin (right) were found guilty of failing to provide basic care . Johnson was also found guilty of not reporting the deaths of three residents to the Care and Quality Commission, and failing to provide them nutritious meals and ensure staff were adequately trained. The residents died at the site between July 22 and August 6, 2009, after being left malnourished, immobile in bed, and with putrid pressure sores, a hearing was told. Concerns were first raised when an elderly woman was admitted to Northampton General Hospital on July 21, 2009 with severe pressure sores on her heels exposing her bones and tendons. She was unresponsive and died the next day, exhibiting signs of dehydration and malnourishment. Another resident with severe pressure sores died on the same day at the home, while three people were shipped out of the home over fears for their health. The third vulnerable pensioner died in a community hospital on July 28 while two died in separate care homes on August 4 and 6. Alzheimer’s sufferer Doreen Sheridan, 83, died on August 4 after contracting bronchopneumonia which doctors said was caused by a lack of movement. Neglectful: Mary Ombui (right) admitted all allegations against her on the basis that Maria McKenzie (left) prevented her from providing basic treatment to patients at the care home . Healthcare manager Karen Stagg undertook an assessment of some of the residents on July 24 following ‘serious concerns’ about the care provided. Mrs Stagg reported a series of fundamental failings, including staff who could not use basic equipment, residents fed ‘mainly porridge’ and meaningless care plans that were out of date. One female pensioner who suffered from physical and mental disabilities had skin which ‘appeared to be paper thin and dry’. Mrs Stagg had told the panel that an elderly woman at the home had a sore that was ‘necrotic and yellow, slow to heal and granulating’. One pressure sore she inspected was 2.8in across and 2.4in deep - deep enough to ‘feel the bone’, the panel heard. Parkside House’s remaining residents were moved elsewhere and its registration was later cancelled. A serious case review into the deaths found the ‘causes considered to be consistent with the effects of severe neglect’. Madulu, who represented herself at the hearing, and Ombui, who was with her representative, admitted all allegations against them on the basis that McKenzie prevented them from providing basic treatment to patients. Accusations: The abuse came to light after five residents aged between 83 and 100 died in just two weeks at the scandal-hit Parkside House Nursing Home (pictured) in Northampton . McKenzie and Franklin were found guilty of the bulk of the charges relating to the residents - referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G H, I and J - including failing to provide adequate care. But the pair were cleared of charges including not completing nutrition risk assessments for certain residents, failing to monitor the weight of some residents and not using documentation to help monitor care. Johnson, who denied all the charges, did not attend the Central London hearing and has now retired to Trinidad and Tobago. She was found guilty of the majority of the charges against her and cleared of failing to review procedures and policies at the home and failing to notify the CQC when Residents A, B and C were admitted to hospital. If the nurses are found guilty of misconduct, they could face being barred from the profession. Two other Parkside House nurses, Alice Nojozi and Nobuhle Moyo, were let off with cautions following earlier Nursing and Midwifery Council hearings. The hearing continues with the panel set to decide on whether the charges amount to misconduct tomorrow, before moving on to sanction.","Abuse came to light after five residents died in two weeks at nursing home .

A prolific criminal who stole from an elderly, one-legged man after he mistakenly thought she had entered his house to deliver food has been jailed. Sonia Eyres, 42 crept into the bedroom of the 63-year old housebound victim as he lay asleep and stole his wallet just hours after two carers had visited the property. The frail man woke up and spotted Eyres but he assumed she was from the delivery service and inadvertently allowed her to prowl around his home. The carers returned at lunchtime and became suspicious when the victim claimed Meals on Wheels had been to give him lunch. They checked his bedroom and discovered his wallet containing £510 cash had been taken. The raid occurred on August 5 after workers visited his home in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool, Lancashire, to check on him. Before they left, the unnamed victim asked them to leave the door on the latch because he was feeling unwell and wanted any visitors to let themselves in, so he did not have to go to the door himself. The man did not know Eyres and had not invited her in. Assuming she was an employee of the meals on wheels service, he asked her whether she was delivering a week’s worth of provisions for him. But Eyres failed to correct his assumption and instead she asked to use the toilet. She then left with his wallet which had been left on a bedside table. Eyres, from Blackpool, Lancs, was given a three year prison sentence she pleaded guilty to burglary. Preston Crown Court was told she was a serial burglar who had previously carried out nine other similar sneak thefts. Jailed: The prolific burglar was given a three year sentence at Preston Crown Court . In February last year she was given a 30 month sentence for similar burglaries against vulnerable victims. In . one raid she pretended to be a pet lover looking for a lost dog and and . snatched a cheque book, stamps and a black leather pension book whilst . an elderly man was fetching her a glass of water. Police carried out a forensic examination of the scene and matched a footprint to Eyre’s trainers. In mitigation she claimed she was in poor physical and mental health due to a drug habit. But Judge Michael Byrne told her: 'This is a bad case. You took advantage of a vulnerable victim'. Det Sgt Fiona Jackson of Lancashire Police said 'This was a disgraceful crime where Eyres has taken advantage of a vulnerable victim’s circumstances. 'Eyres should be ashamed of herself, and I welcome the custodial sentence given to her. 'Burglary offences in Lancashire are low, but I would urge all of our residents to take every opportunity they can to make their homes as secure as possible. 'In particular, something as simple as making sure your doors are locked will always help to keep burglars out. 'As part of improving their chances of not becoming a victim of burglary, I would also encourage our residents to fit door chains to their front doors if possible so they can safely check callers before letting them in too.'","Sonia Eyres, 42, crept into the 63-year-old victim's bedroom as he slept .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:19 EST, 3 December 2013 . Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell, two corrections consultants concluded following a review of his death released on Tuesday. The conclusion rejected earlier suggestions that he may have died accidentally while seeking a sexual thrill. Castro's September 3 death was likely not the result of auto-erotic asphyxiation, an act in which individuals seek a thrill by choking themselves into unconsciousness, according to the report by the nationally regarded consultants. Ariel Castro breaks down during his trial for the abduction of three girls he kept locked in his Cleveland home for a decade. Castro, 53, later committed suicide in his prison cell . A review by the state prisons agency earlier this fall suggested that possibility. The report said all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment. Subsequent reviews by the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Franklin County coroner reached the same conclusion, the report said. 'In conclusion, based upon the fact that this inmate was going to remain in prison for the rest of his natural life under the probability of continued perceived harassment and threats to his safety, his death was not predictable on September 3, 2013, but his suicide was not surprising and perhaps inevitable,' the report said. The consultants said it was likely Castro was harassed by guards, based on interviews with inmates who said they had heard such harassment. Castro was serving a life sentence plus 1,000 years when he committed suicide . None of the multiple health assessments that Castro received indicated anything that would have required suicide-prevention measures, the consultants said. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction is committed to following recommendations in the report, spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said in a statement. Those recommendations include beefing up staff training on suicide prevention and ending the use of online training. Castro, 53, was found kneeling in his cell with his pants down and hanging from a sheet attached to a window hinge, according to an earlier prison report. He had just begun serving a sentence of life plus 1,000 years. He pleaded guilty in August to imprisoning three women in his Cleveland home for a decade while repeatedly raping and assaulting them. He fathered a girl with one of the victims. Some inmates - who had not seen Castro - suggested his pants slipped because of his 10-pound weight loss since entering prison, the report said. But one nurse interviewed by the consultants said Castro was completely naked, while a supervisor said it was not uncommon for Castro to be naked in his cell, according to the report. Two prison guards were placed on paid administrative leave during the state's investigation into Castro's death. The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction alleged the two falsified logs documenting the number of times guards checked on Castro before he died. House of horrors: The house in Cleveland, Ohio where Ariel Castro held Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and the daughter he fathered with her captive for years . The consultants' report criticized the falsification but said it didn't contribute to Castro's death since he was seen alive minutes before he hanged himself in a check that met prison standards. The union representing prison guards says the state is scapegoating front-line employees for supervisory failures. Castro abducted the women from the streets of Cleveland from 2002 to 2004 when they were 14, 16 and 20. He periodically kept them chained in rooms, sometimes in the basement, and restricted access to food and toilets. Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus were rescued May 6 when one of them broke out part of a door and called for help. Castro told a judge at sentencing that he suffered from addictions to sex and pornography. 'I'm not a monster. I'm sick,' he said.","All evidence .

But these images show the moment police in riot helmets carried out a dawn raid, sweeping into his room and arresting him on suspicion of burglary. He is believed to be one of the youngest targets of a dawn raid and was held along with his 37-year-old father as part of a crackdown on gangs in Coventry. Scroll down for video . Child: Police in Coventry have arrested a burglary suspect aged just ten in a dawn raid. Footage shows officers searching his drawers next to a pack of biscuits, a games console and an Alvin and the Chipmunks DVD . Dawn raid: Police swept into the house belonging to an alleged crime family just after 6am yesterday . Arrest: A heavily tattooed man was shown being arrested. The boy and his father, 37, were both held as burglary suspects. One alleged raid took £400,000 of Apple gadgets from a warehouse in Leicester . Computer equipment, phones, clothing and a substance were seized by police from the property in Wood End, Coventry. The pair were questioned in connection with a house burglary on September 9 in Lapworth Road, which is in their neighbourhood, and bailed yesterday pending further enquiries. Detective Inspector Nick Dale, speaking outside the house, said: 'We believe this family are responsible . for considerable crime and disorder within this community, and members . of the community are intimidated by their activities. 'We're . here to send a message that this is not acceptable. It's not acceptable . that people are intimidated within their own neighbourhoods and we will . take action. 'It . must be incredibly frustrating for hard-working, law-abiding members of . the community to see people who have no legitimate income living . apparently beyond their means. 'They . might be able to afford a nice car or expensive clothes and there will . be question marks over how they have afforded that lifestyle.' The father and son were arrested as part of an 'intensive assault' on gangs who allegedly raided 'numerous' shops and pubs in Coventry. Detective Inspector Nick Dale said: 'It must be incredibly frustrating for hard-working, law-abiding members of the community to see people who have no legitimate income living apparently beyond their means' DVDs found in the house included the violent comic book-style film Sin City. Several items were seized by police . A gang also stole £400,000 worth of Apple iPads, iPods and iPhones from an electronics warehouse in Leicester. West Midlands Police seized computer equipment, phones, clothing and 'a substance' from the home during yesterday's joint raid just after 6am, a spokesman said. The video released by the force shows officers in blue riot helmets using a battering ram to smash through the front door, which had been reinforced. A heavily-tattooed man with his tracksuit top half-open, believed to be the boy's father, is seen being put in handcuffs. And officers are pictured searching through clothes in the boy's bedroom drawers next to a half-eaten packet of biscuits, a games console and several DVDs. Officers questioned the youngster on suspicion of being involved in a burglary of a nearby house on September 9. His father was quizzed on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

Officers in blue riot helmets burst through the door within seconds and arrested the 10-year-old just after 6am .

The boy was only just old enough to be arrested, as in England and Wales children only reach the age of criminal responsibility when they turn ten. Before that they cannot be arrested or charged with a crime, even for violent or sexual offences. Yesterday's operation came two weeks after a number of other dawn raids on nearby homes. Detective Inspector Dale said: 'We want the community to sit up and take notice of our efforts to tackle organised crime. Law-abiding citizens can rest assured we’re taking strong action against suspects, whilst criminals should be asking themselves: ""am I next?"" 'We’ve embarked on an intensive . assault on Coventry’s crime gangs. These are individuals who seem to . think they’re above the law, are involved in anti-social behaviour and . who often ""rule"" their communities through intimidation. No-one should . feel threatened or worried in their own community.

'We would like to encourage people to . come forward with information about activities whether it be crime or . disorder and that information will be taken seriously and will be . investigated.

The Oyster Perpetual Submariner Rolex, one of less than 50 in the world, fetched £86,000 when it went under the hammer . A man's watch has smashed the record for the world's most expensive Rolex of its kind, selling at auction for £86,000. The extremely rare, steel-cased timepiece, fetched the record-breaking price when it went under the hammer at Anderson and Garland in Newcastle. The Oyster Perpetual Submariner, which features an explorer-style dial, sparked a frenzy in the salesroom. Bidders in person, online and on the phone all desperately sought to secure the desirable lot. The watch was manufactured in the early 1960s, and all those buying the model were given the option to upgrade the standard Submariner model with the 369 explorer dial. Very few people took up the offer, which was then discontinued after 1964. The record-breaking Rolex was marked with the model number 5513 and the serial number 1103633. Dated 1964 on the back of the case, it is widely believed to be one of less than fifty left in the world. Andrew McCoull, managing director of the auction house Anderson and Garland, said the price was a great result for their client.

Textbooks are dying out in classrooms because teachers see them as 'regimented and old-fashioned', Elizabeth Truss said yesterday. The Education Minister said rampant ideology in schools that teaching should be 'unstructured and free-flow' meant just one in ten ten-year-olds are issued with them now. Among 14-year-olds studying science the figure falls to an astonishing eight per cent - one in 12. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said children's education is being harmed as teachers are making up their own materials instead of using textbooks . The 'anti-textbook orthodoxy' is damaging children's education as they are coming home with 'dog-eared worksheets' that give them no sense of the context of what they are learning. Some teachers of 'essentially writing their own materials' by collecting vast amounts of 'different worksheets and bits and pieces of paper', she added. Ms Truss was reacting to figures which showed the UK had the lowest use of textbooks out of 50 nations in a survey . Unions dismissed the claims yesterday, saying constant 'meddling' in education meant schools were reluctant to invest in books. But education experts said the practice was driven by Left-wing ideology which allowed teachers to pursue their own agenda. The data was buried in a report last year by the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement showed England has the lowest use of textbooks among the 50 nations that were surveyed. They are used by 99 per cent of teachers in South Korea, 86 per cent in Germany and 78 per cent in Poland - all of which outperform England academically. 'This country has fallen out of love with the textbook. They are perhaps seen as regimented and old-fashioned,' she said in a speech to the British Educational Suppliers Association. 'I know many frustrated parents who have found bits of worksheets covered in orange juice at the bottom of their child's school bag. 'Why not have a good textbook that can help lead the parent and the child through the learning of the course?' She added: 'I think it's partly down to issues of ideology and education philosophy... child-centred learning. The idea that there is not a best way to teach something, that actually it should be unstructured and free-flow.' Official textbooks give pupils 'a sense of ownership over what they are studying' and allow them to 'catch up or read ahead or study core concepts on their own', she argued. And the failure to provide children with a book that acts as a 'map or guide' is creating a 'free-for-all' that is handing an advantage to England's international rivals. 'High-performing countries are creating great textbooks and make sure children flourish only if they understand essential concepts and knowledge,' Miss Truss said. 'In Shanghai, textbooks are a given. In [South] Korea they've got a programme where they're introducing digital books. South Korea, Poland and Germany all used more textbooks and rank above England academically . They use multimedia content, animations, virtual reality - all of which can be altered to fit each student's ability level. But the actual material is the same. 'The principle of a good textbook is as important as ever - a structured progression through essential knowledge.' Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, claimed other countries benefited from 'stability' in their education systems. 'They can invest in textbooks and plan for the future with confidence. Schools in England suffer constant change, meddling and interference in the curriculum,' she said. But Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'Textbooks give structure to learning but if you have an alternative agenda they are not always the best vehicle for that. 'The decline in textbooks has been pretty disastrous. Children are suffering from death by a thousand worksheets.'","England had lowest use of textbooks in 50 nations surveyed .

Louise Gill, 45, of Edgeley, Greater Manchester, spent four days with her husband Tony and son Billy looking for her six-year-old cat Charlie, after it went missing last month. After asking around the neighbourhood, speaking to vets and putting up 'missing' posters, she was contacted by a neighbour who had seen a cat run over on the road and reported it to the council.

But after various phone calls, she was eventually told Charlie had been taken to a tip in Bredbury - and when she rang there, she was told her pet had been cremated in line with their policy. Mrs Gill said Charlie - whom she had owned since he was a kitten - was micro-chipped and should have been scanned after the body was picked up, so she could be contacted. She added: ‘It is a disgrace to all pet owners who pay to have their pets micro-chipped for the council just to throw them away like a piece of rubbish at the tip. ‘It has been such a distressing experience throughout.

Ed Miliband has shelved his pledge to take on Labour’s union paymasters over fears that they could cut off the party’s cash supply in the run-up to the election. The Labour leader infuriated union bosses in the summer by vowing to weaken the historic links between Labour and the trade union movement. But last night it emerged that the reforms will be delayed for at least five years, pushing them well beyond the next election in 2015. Shelved: Ed Miliband has shelved his vow to tackle union paymasters until 2018 because he fears they could cut off the party's funding . The Tories seized on the move as evidence that Mr Miliband remains in hock to the unions, who have supplied 80 per cent of the party’s donations since he took over as leader. Mr Miliband ordered a review of Labour’s links to the unions following devastating allegations that the Unite union tried to rig the selection of a candidate in the safe Labour seat of Falkirk. He proposed ending the controversial system in which many union members are automatically signed up as party ‘affiliates’, with part of their annual subscriptions diverted to Labour. He prefers an opt-in system, despite warnings it would lead to a huge drop in the value of affiliation fees from the unions. At the time, his aides said the reforms would be brought in before the next election. But Labour sources last night said a five-year implementation plan had always been ‘mentioned as a possible time scale’. Former Labour general secretary Ray Collins has been appointed to draw up reform proposals in time for a special conference next spring. Paymaster: Len McCluskey of Unite. Mr Miliband ordered a review of Labour¿s links to the unions following devastating allegations that the Unite union tried to rig the selection of a candidate in Labour seat of Falkirk . Tory chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of ‘buckling under pressure from his union paymasters’ including Unite leader Len McCluskey, adding: ‘Once again Ed Miliband has shown he’s too weak to stand up to the union barons fixing his own party’s selections. And if he’s too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey, Ed Miliband’s too weak to stand up for hard-working people.’ But the decision to kick the reforms into the long grass also led to soul-searching within Labour.Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential website Labourlist, said a climbdown was ‘inevitable’ given the scale of the union opposition. He added: ‘What’s worrying is that so far no real sense of a preferred and genuinely workable solution seems to be emerging. The question is, “Has the (Labour) review actually made any progress yet?”. Nothing concrete seems to have emerged – it certainly didn’t at conference. All we’ve got are old, vague plans that look like a fudge being rehashed.’ Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said the reforms were shelved as a direct result of the party’s financial dependence on the big unions. ‘From the moment Labour’s leader . announced his decision to end the current affiliation relationship with . the unions, everyone from the shadow cabinet to back bench Labour MPs to . constituency chairs has been asking the same question – “Where is the . cash going to come from to keep the party running and fight an election . in 2015?”' - Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges . He said: ‘From the moment Labour’s leader announced his decision to end the current affiliation relationship with the unions, everyone from the shadow cabinet to back bench Labour MPs to constituency chairs has been asking the same question – “Where is the cash going to come from to keep the party running and fight an election in 2015?”. ‘The answer is, “Nowhere”. Labour’s anti-business rhetoric is terrifying potential private-sector donors.  State funding is a political non-starter. That’s the main reason Miliband is preparing to kick his reforms into the long grass. He literally can’t afford not to. Either the unions continue to fund the Labour Party, or there is no Labour Party.’ Labour is considering getting unions to adopt the system used by Unison to affiliate members to the party. Unison asks those who join whether they want to contribute to the union’s Labour fund or its fund for general political campaigns. About 435,000 members of its 1.3million members join the Labour fund. Unison said the system showed affiliation to Labour would not necessarily collapse if the union movement switched to an opt-in system. A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should doubt the radical nature of these reforms. We are moving from trade union levy-payers being automatically affiliated, to those individuals instead able to make an active choice on whether to be part of the Labour Party.’","Labour leader infuriated unions in the summer by vowing to weaken  links .

We may think of vanity as a quintessentially human trait - but these photographs show that the animal world can be just as self-obsessed. When this penguin in the Antarctic caught sight of its reflection in a pool of water, it stood staring at itself for a whole 10 minutes. It paraded up and down the edge of the pool in the inlet of Neko Harbour - and although it repeatedly turned to leave, it kept rushing back to admire itself again. Vain: This penguin spent 10 minutes admiring its reflection in a pool of water in Neko Harbour, Antarctica . Intrigued: The bird appeared to be absolutely fascinated with the sight of itself in the water . Rare: It is unusual to get 'mirror calm' conditions because of the Antarctic's stormy weather . Anthony Pierce, the photographer who captured the remarkable snaps, said: 'The penguin was standing there for at least 10 minutes in total. 'It was turning its head from side to side and looking itself up and down repeatedly. It was actually looking itself in the eye sometimes. 'Some of the other penguins came to the water's edge, but they just drank some water from the pool and moved on. None of them looked at their reflection. 'Then the vain penguin came along. I was quite surprised by its behaviour.' Obsessive: The penguin kept walking away and then returning to look at itself once more . Fascinated: Other penguins went to the pool to drink, but did not stop to stare at themselves . He added: 'It almost seemed to have a bit of a strut as it left. 'Penguins are amazing animals. They have enormous character and personality on camera, which always makes for interesting photographs. 'They are also incredibly tough and resilient creatures; surviving in one of the harshest environments on earth.' Mr Pierce said that it was rare to see such a sight, because the conditions in the Antarctic are usually so windy that pools are almost never 'mirror calm'. Handsome? The penguin derived endless entertainment from the sight of itself . Strut: The penguin appeared pleased when it finally walked away, according to photographer Anthony Pierce . He said: 'It's really unusual to have perfect conditions like this. There has to be no breeze at all for a reflection shot like this to work.

The BBC has spent more than £1.3m on return flights for workers going between London and Manchester since many of its programmes were moved north. Bosses at the corporation admitted that following the opening of MediaCityUK in Salford in May 2011, the broadcaster has spent thousands of pounds every month flying staff between the capital and the new base. Around 2,300 staff work at the Salford Quays site, where Match Of The Day, BBC Breakfast, Radio 5 Live, Blue Peter and CBBC are produced. Home from home: The BBC has spent £1.3million on flights between London and Manchester since the corporation moved to the MediaCityUK site in Salford Quays in May 2011 . The programmes, and many others, had previously been made at the BBC's iconic Television Centre in White City, west London, which closed in March this year. It was sold in July 2012 for £200 million and developer Stanhope PLC plans to turn the building into a modern studio centre, hotel, apartments, as well as a home for the commercial headquarters of the BBC. A Freedom of Information request revealed today shows that the BBC spent £377,000 on flights between May 2011 and March 2012. Between April 2012 and March of this year, that figure rose to a staggering £605,000, and from April to September this year the corporation has spent a total of £312,000 - making a grand total of £1,294,000 in just 29 months. The works out as an average of £44,620 spent every month on flights to and from the capital and MediaCity UK. The total figure spent could even be . hundreds of thousands of pounds more as the data only includes flights . booked through the BBC's central booking system. Many . staff book flights to and from the two bases themselves - meaning their . reservations do not go through the central booking system - and then . claim the cash back on expenses. A BBC source, who asked not to be named, said: 'We all knew the travel costs would sky-rocket when Salford opened.' Iconic: The BBC's former London headquarters at Television Centre closed in March this year . A spokesman for BBC Procurement said: . 'Spend on flights is subject to rigorous scrutiny and staff are . encouraged to use alternatives to travel such as video conferencing . wherever possible, but when travel is necessary staff should use the . lowest cost of travel and fare.' 'The . BBC is a national broadcaster and travel is an integral part of our . core spend in bringing high quality programmes to our viewers (and) much . of these costs will have been programme related. 'BBC . North at MediaCityUK is the BBC's largest creative hub outside of . London, and is home to 24 BBC departments, including Children's, Sport, . Radio 5 live and BBC Breakfast.' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the campaign group TaxPayers' Alliance, said that the BBC should ensure . that licence fee payers do not lose out because of the money spent on . flights. He said: 'The move to Salford meant that it was inevitable that travel costs for BBC guests and staff would increase. 'But . bosses at the broadcaster must ensure that travel between the two . cities represents value for the licence fee and that staff have a duty . to book cheapest option. 'Flying . between Manchester and London should only be done in exceptional . circumstances, and only when it represents the best deal for licence fee . payers.' The BBC has previously been criticised for paying staff a total of £24million in allowances following the move to Salford. On the ball: Many BBC programmes, including Match Of The Day, are now made in Manchester . A report by the public accounts committee of MPs, released in October, said many of the allowances were ‘excessive’ and ‘difficult to justify’ to licence fee payers. In total, the corporation spent . £942million setting up a new northern base to help redress a perceived London-centric bias in its coverage, but has had to offer 900 staff an average . of £28,000 each to persuade them to move. Some staff were offered perks including a guaranteed minimum price on their old home if they sold it and moved north. They could also claim a two-year ‘remote location allowance’ worth £1,900 a month to cover the cost of travel and renting a property . in Salford if they were unwilling to commit to move. Other staff were offered a one off . payment of £5,000 to help them move, while homeowners could claim £3,000 . towards household goods. Despite the huge expense of moving to Salford, the BBC does not own its new office space or studios. Instead, it rents them from real estate giant the Peel Group.The PAC also raised concerns about the 10-year arrangement, saying the BBC could risk locking itself into making payments for buildings it may not use.","New headquarters in Salford Quays was opened in May 2011 .

Gerry Adams has been accused from beyond the grave of ordering the murder and secret burial of a mother of ten children. The Sinn Fein president was identified by former Belfast IRA commander Brendan Hughes in a conversation recorded seven years before his death in 2008. In it the paramilitary boss, once a close friend of Mr Adams, pointed the finger at him over the killing of Jean McConville in 1972. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has been accused by Brendan Hughes of ordered the killing of Jean McConville in 1972 in a tape released after his death . He said: ‘There’s only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. That man is now the head of Sinn Fein.’ The tape recording will be broadcast tonight as part of an investigation into victims of the Troubles whose bodies have never been found, known as the ‘disappeared’. Many of them were killed after being accused of passing information to the British security services. Mr Adams denies being either a senior leader of the Provisionals in Belfast or ordering the murder of Mrs McConville. ‘I had no part to play in either the abduction, the killing or burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other people. Brendan is telling lies,’ he said. In the recording Hughes says: 'There's only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. That man is now the head of Sinn Fein.' Allegations linking Mr Adams to the notorious murder are made in clandestine tapes recorded by Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries. They were handed to police this summer after more than a decade gathering dust in the archives of the Burns Library in Boston College in the U.S. Mr Hughes, who died in 2008, made his claim seven years earlier on the condition that it would not be published until after his death. He also said Mr Adams went to the McConville children after their mother was abducted and promised an internal IRA investigation. He said: ‘That man is the man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. I did not give the order to execute that woman. He did.’ A second IRA member, Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price, who died earlier this year, also made a recording implicating Mr Adams in the murder. She claimed that she helped to transport the 37-year-old victim to the Irish Republic where she was tortured, tied up and shot. The remains of Mrs McConville were recovered more than three decades after she was abducted at Shelling Beach, Co Louth in August 2003. Forensic tests revealed she had been badly beaten and shot in the back of the head. He discovery is now part of a live criminal inquiry. One of her children, Michael McConville, 51, said he is still fighting for those responsible to be brought to justice. ‘If I lived for 200 years I still don’t think I could describe how I felt when we got my mother’s body back,’ he said. ‘They took my mother from her house. To bring her down to a beach with her hands tied behind her back and to put a gun to the back of her head and shoot her - that’s an execution. ‘They knew exactly who they were killing and what she was leaving behind. That was a war crime and the people responsible should be brought to The Hague.’ Mr McConville can still vividly remember the day his mother was dragged from their home with his siblings clinging to her arms and legs. Micheal McConville, the son of murdered Jean, says he will never forget the day the IRA took his mother away and shot her . A gang of up to 20 IRA men and women were involved, including two neighbours who knew the children by name. He then endured a three-hour ordeal at the hands of the IRA’s youth wing as a warning to stay silent. ‘I was going to give the names of the ones who were not wearing masks to the police,’ he said. ‘They said they were going to shoot me if I told anything about any member of the IRA. That they would shoot me or shoot a member of the family.’ At least 17 people were abducted, killed and secretly buried in unmarked graves in remote locations by republican paramilitaries. In some cases they weighed down their bodies with heavy stones to ensure they would not be found if the bogs they were buried in dried up. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains (ICLVR) has so far found eight of the ‘disappeared’. The first of the ‘disappeared’ to be found was north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, whose remains were discovered in 1999. Speaking yesterday, senior Sinn Fein member Martin McGuinness said families of the ‘disappeared’ have suffered a ‘despicable ordeal’. He said: ‘What happened to those families was totally and absolutely wrong. I believe it was cruel, I believe it was unjustified. Of course the IRA were responsible.’ The Disappeared, a co-production between RTE and the BBC, will be broadcast tonight (TUES) on BBC4 at 10pm.","Brendan Hughes, former Belfast IRA head, made accusation in tape .

Rail companies are drawing up controversial plans for officially sanctioned 'third class' travel, a senior Government figure has admitted. Earl Attlee admitted the Department of Transport was considering the proposal, which was ditched in Britain by the former nationalised British Rail in June 1956. It has sparked a new class-war row in . the wake of Chancellor George Osborne's recent spat after he sought a . place in First Class after buying only a standard class ticket. The third way: A 1930s' third class coach on an electric train in Ireland . Can it get much worse? Many commuters are already left with standing room only on their journeys . Unions said the Government was 'winding back the clock' fifty years. Earl Attlee, who speaks on behalf of the Government in the House of Lords, was responding to a question on whether invitations to bid for new rail franchises permitted the introduction of a third passenger class. A Tory peer, the Earl is the grandson of Labour post-war Prime Minister Clement Attlee, elected in 1945, whose government nationalised the railways. The question and answer are recorded in Hansard, the official record of the Houses of Parliament under the heading: 'Railways: Third Class Travel'. Former Labour Minister Lord Myners . asked the Government 'whether invitations to bid for new rail franchises . permit the introduction of a third passenger class.' Earl Attlee replied that it did, noting: 'The current franchising . system allows bidders to propose the introduction of a third passenger . class as long as these proposals comply with the ticketing and . settlement agreement and franchise agreement.' Open-topped: It was only in 1844 that the law was passed to ensure third-class carriages were covered. This drawing appeared in a newspaper in 1847 . Squeeze: Little has changed in more than 160 years when it comes to second-class travel . Luxury travel: First class was, as ever, the domain of the well-to-do . Third class travel first became an option in 1838. Six years later an act of parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class. The 1844 Railway Act stipulated that all third-class passengers should be carried in covered accommodation. Railway companies also began providing lighting in third-class carriages. However, whereas there were several oil lamps in the first class carriages, third-class carriages only had one. In 1844 the railways introduced Parly & Gov class for government workers. The Pullman car, introduced in Britain in 1874, created a new level of comfort. Midland Railway abolished second class travel in 1875, upgrading third class passengers to second class standards. Other railways followed the example. Second class disappeared from fare tables until 1956, when third class was renamed second. British Rail later renamed this standard class. But . the Department for Transport insisted the answer had been deliberately . 'misinterpreted' by union critics, insisting the Earl had meant a third . and additional class of travel between the existing first and standard . classes – broadly equivalent to a 'premium economy' class on airlines. But critics said that if there were three classes – the bottom class would by definition be 'third class.' Bob Crow, left wing leader of the RMT . transport union said: 'Now we know, the door is open for the train . operators to introduce third passenger class as and when it suits them. 'We knew that this Government was winding the clock back on employment, benefits and legal rights but now they are opening up the option to dive back in time more than 50 years to the days of third class rail travel.' But Lord Myners said:'I was astonished by the response which suggested there could be a cattle class carriage at the back or one for toffs at the front'. But a Department for Transport spokesman said: 'It is completely untrue and deliberately misleading to claim that this Government wants to introduce 'third class' fares. 'It absolutely does not.

Women spend almost twice as much as their men on their sexy Christmas lingerie, according to a new survey. In the hope of becoming a sexy Mrs Claus this year, ladies will spend £47 on new lingerie over the festive season. However, if men are in charge of buying the gifts, they spend almost half as much - just £24. Nervous: Men spend half as much as their partner on sexy Christmas lingerie because they are terrified their lover will hate their choice . But the difference in spending isn't because men are skinflints - they are . worried of completely misjudging their lover's tastes so they tend to . opt for the first sexy slip that they see and leave it at that. Women are more confident about their purchases and happily splash out on three times as many pieces as their men. Big spenders: Women are more confident about their purchases and happily splash out on three times as many pieces as their men - spending £47 over Christmas . The study also found that the most generous female lingerie shoppers are in Carlisle, followed by London, Guildford, Liverpool and Edinburgh. Men in Cardiff spent the most on their women - followed by Sheffield, Manchester, London and Chelmsford. The most popular item chosen by both sexes was classic black suspenders and stockings, followed by black or pink briefs, a sheer black teddy, a red satin body bow and basque. And it seems that sexy lingerie is big business; last year, the UK female lingerie market was worth £1.5 billion. It was also revealed that women spent a total of £15,000 on lingerie in their lifetime - buying 13 new pairs of knickers a year. A spokesperson for Bluebella, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Women today know what they want and are feeling more empowered than ever before to enjoy buying beautiful underwear which makes them feel gorgeous and confident not just in the bedroom but in the boardroom too. 'The fact they buy three times as much as men is great for both parties - she feels fabulously sexy and confident in lingerie that suits her perfectly and he gets to enjoy the new view. 'Men tend to impulse buy when it comes to underwear and go for the first sexy slip they see. They're probably unsure if their partner will like their choice so they prefer to spend less. If he gets it wrong, it can put him off buying lingerie for a while but it doesn't have to be this way. 'If he gets it right, it is the gift that keeps on giving.'

Whether it's a wrinkly decolletage or wobbly tummy, fretting about errant body parts can kill the mood when it comes to spending time in the sack. Now a spa has launched a package that claims to banish bodily woes and boost confidence in bed, courtesy of treatments that deal with everything from loose vaginal muscles to a less-than-lovely cleavage. But it doesn't come cheap - a boudoir-ready body will cost £850, although you can have each treatment individually. New look: London's EF Medispa can give your nether regions and your cleavage a new lease of life . First on the menu is the spa's Neckline Define Peel, £350 per treatment, which involves using Pyruvic acid and Acetyl glucosamine to smooth and hydrate the neck and bust, ironing out wrinkles in the process. Once your decollete has been given a new lease of life, London's EF Medispa will give your legs some love courtesy of permanent laser hair removal, which costs £270 per session and will leave your pins fuzz-free forever. Lastly, the spa will give your lady area a makeover with the AQ Vaginal Rejuvenating System, which tightens and lubricates your nether region. The serum, which costs £220 for a month's supply, was originally developed as a cream for wounds by the University of California Irvine's Professor Ahmed Al-Aqhtani and contains ethically sourced 'progenitor foreskin stem cells', which are thought to help boost cell renewal. New package: The EF Medispa is offering a combination of treatments designed to boost bedroom confidence . Anti-ageing: The cleavage peel will give you a smooth bust area like Kelly Brook and Sharon Stone . Laser: The final part of the package includes having the hair on your legs permanently removed with a laser . Inventor: Founder Esther Fieldgrass is behind the rejuvenating combination of treatments . Other ingredients include jojoba and rosemary oils, both of which have hydrating properties, and smoothing lactic acid. ‘In America, it doesn’t stay on the shelves because it is so popular and we have found it to be a very similar case at EF Medispa,' revealed founder Esther Fieldgrass. 'This treatment gives absolutely amazing results to both older women and younger women, because not only does it work to naturally rejuvenate the vagina and restore and improve the vagina’s natural lubrication, it also encourages blood flow to the area, which intensifies pleasure.' Although not part of the £850 package, the spa also offers other body-boosting treatments, among them an 'Instant Butt Lift' injection which involves taking fat from the stomach and inserting it into the buttocks. The new body-boosting package is the latest in a series of treatments designed to perfect the nether regions. Most, among them vaginal steaming, which is said to leave the nether regions squeaky clean, and the vaginoplasty, which reshapes the area, first appeared in the USA before making their way to Europe. The original vajacial, the brainchild of San Francisco waxing bar owner, Katherine Goldman, was launched in 2010 and is designed to tackle ingrown hairs via a papaya enzyme mask, a deep cleanse and extractions done with tweezers.","The package has been created by London's EF Medispa .

Breakthrough: The new test can distinguish between life-threatening tumours and less serious ones, allowing doctors to tailor treatment. File picture . Thousands of women could be spared unnecessary and invasive breast cancer treatment thanks to a test being developed by British scientists. The test, which could be available on the NHS within five years, can distinguish between life-threatening tumours and less serious ones. The technique is used for a type of tumour linked to breast cancer that affects 4,800 women a year. About half of patients with these tumours go on to develop breast cancer, which may later spread to other organs. But the other half have non-aggressive tumours that aren’t life-threatening. At present, doctors have no way of distinguishing between the tumours, so all women have surgery and most also have debilitating radiotherapy. This means about 2,400 a year are having operations needlessly, a fifth of whom will lose their entire breast. Now researchers at Queen Mary University, London have discovered that women with aggressive tumours also have high levels of a certain molecule in the glands of breast tissue. They have developed a £200 test in which doctors check the levels of this molecule in a biopsy of the tumour through a microscope. Those with high levels would be referred on to surgery and possibly radiotherapy, while those with lower levels would be advised to have regular check-ups. They believe that 2,400 women a year with this type of tumour – called Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) – could be spared treatment. Professor Louise Jones, from the Bart’s Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University, said: ‘At the moment we treat everybody who has a diagnosis of DCIS in exactly the same way, as though their disease is likely to progress. ‘They will have surgery and they may have chemotherapy and it’s really quite distressing for women. ‘They are told, “You have cancer” – but it’s not quite cancer – and some of them are also told, “You need a mastectomy”. ‘They find this very hard to understand and ultimately this disease may not have done any harm.’ Just under 50,000 women develop breast cancer every year, making it by far the commonest form of the disease. It leads to 11,500 deaths annually . Presently all women with suspected breast cancer have a biopsy, in which a small sample of tumour is removed and sent away for further examinations. These let doctors know which type of cancer a woman has, and this determines her course of treatment. This new test would just be carried out at the same time as the existing ones, which is why it would be so cheap.By comparison, surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer costs between £3,500 and £6,600. Breast cancer surgery is particularly upsetting for women – especially a mastectomy – as they can feel as if they are losing their femininity. Around 70 per cent will have radiotherapy afterwards, which involves daily trips to the hospital for up to eight weeks and can lead to sickness, fatigue and pain. Just under 50,000 women develop breast cancer every year, making it by far the commonest form of the disease. It leads to 11,500 deaths annually. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign, which funded the research, said it could be 'life-changing' The researchers will now carry out thorough checks of the test on at least 600 women to ensure it properly distinguishes between the two types of tumours. If these go to plan, they hope the test will be available on the NHS in about five years. Early trials of the test on 700 women have shown that, for those with DCIS, it accurately diagnoses whether they have non-aggressive or aggressive breast cancer. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign, which funded the research, said: ‘This research could be key to the hunt to develop a life-changing reliable prognostic test for women with DCIS. ‘Such a test would mean women with DCIS would finally be able to make informed decisions about their treatment. ‘They would no longer face the agonising choice between risking their breast cancer becoming invasive or facing treatment without knowing whether their DCIS will become life-threatening or not. ‘A test won’t be available in the clinic overnight, but we’re hopeful that ongoing research will allow this to happen in the future, which will signal a pivotal moment in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.’ Dr Gillian Farnie, of the Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, said: ‘The exciting research makes significant steps forward in our understanding of the biology of DCIS and its progression to invasive cancer. ‘These results, if validated by other research groups, could provide a new marker for identifying DCIS that are more likely to progress to invasive disease, however more importantly may highlight a group of patients where no treatment is necessary. ‘This would be a major breakthrough in the management of DCIS and although this research is not ready for clinical application yet it shows great promise for the future.’ But Professor Peter Barrett-Lee, of the Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff, said: ‘This is an interesting new scientific finding and could prove important in the future, but at the moment the results of the study need to be replicated by others, and so any potential prognostic uses and treatment related to this may be many years away.’","It could prevent around 2,400 woman a year from needless operations .

A 15-year-old 'model pupil' who robbed a bank was locked up for 40 months today after being shopped to police by his own mother. The schoolboy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, brandished an imitation firearm as he burst into the Barclays bank in Liverpool, Merseyside. District Judge Ian Lomax told Liverpool Youth Court last month that the teenager was 'acting like a real-life action video game' when he carried out the raid in the week Grand Theft Auto V was released. Scroll down for video . Raid: The boy burst into the Barclays Bank in Liverpool last month brandishing an imitation fire arm and demanded that staff hand over money . But today Judge Goldstone said 'it was not that sort of case at all' as the boy's family would not allow him to watch 'inappropriate' television programmes, films or video games. The boy walked into the bank with his hood pulled up tight, and said: 'Don’t do anything stupid. I just got out of prison after five years. I’m not ****ing messing around.' He fled with more than £2,000. As the cashiers filled a bag with money they added a 'dummy . bundle' which is designed to detonate and spray dye over the cash when . it leaves the building, Liverpool Crown Court heard. His mother found a stash of cash stained with dye and a fake firearm in his bedroom and turned him over to police. Kim Egerton, prosecuting, told . Liverpool Crown Court that after being questioned by family members the boy . admitted he had carried out a bank robbery. 'She . (his mother) had raised him to understand if he did something wrong . there would be consequences and though she loved her son it was the . right thing to do,' she said. The court was told cashiers Steven Riley and Abbi Melling had been terrified. In a victim impact statement, Mr Riley said he had since found it difficult to sleep and had been having counselling to help him deal with the stress of what happened to him and the worry that it might happen again. Robbery: The boy made off with more than £2,000 following the raid but was handed over to the police by his mother who was shocked to find a stash of cash, stained with dye, and a fake firearm in his bedroom . 'He said that he was extremely afraid at the time when the gun was being pointed at him,' Miss Egerton said. Miss Melling said that during the raid she felt 'completely helpless'. 'She . was so scared she didn't even press the panic alarm,' Miss Egerton . said. The cashier said the raider did not appear scared and she thought . he was 'blase'. She said . she felt 'dread' and 'anxious' that it might happen to her again and . since the robbery she has been thinking it could happen again. Theresa Loftus, defending, said: 'The facts of this case are as striking as they are tragic.' She said the case was tragic for the victims of the defendant's crime, but also for his own family, who turned the boy in to the police when they had no other evidence against him. 'As such, my lord, the honesty, integrity, and decency of this family shone through by their actions on September 22 this year. They were instrumental in bringing this young man to justice,' Miss Loftus said, adding that they were 'brave and exceptional actions'. The boy's mother has been unable to work since due to stress, the court heard. The youngster was ordered to serve 40 months in a Young Offenders' Institution for carrying out the raid on September 20. Passing sentence, Judge Clement Goldstone QC, the Honorary Recorder of Liverpool, told the boy: 'However innocent you look now, as you sit in your smart suit, you did not look innocent when you held up bank staff at gunpoint and terrified them.' Ultra violent: An image from the video game Grand Theft Auto V. The robbery was carried out in the same week the game was released . Judge Goldstone said the teenager had planned the robbery at that particular branch because he thought it would be a 'soft touch'. The court heard that the boy wanted cash because he 'envied' the material possessions of his friends but also to reduce the financial burden on his family, who were having to pay for private tuition for him as his school grades were declining. The judge said the boy 'carried on with his young life as if nothing had happened' after the raid. 'Two days later, your mother found the money which you had hidden away, and then, later the same day, the gun,' the judge told him. 'It was your mother who bravely and in a remarkable display of public spirit decided to take you to the police station, despite you pleading with her not to.' Judge Goldstone said the actions of the boy's mother were 'all the more commendable' when he compared it to other cases where some parents were prepared to lie to protect their children when they knew they had committed serious crimes. He said he accepted the boy's remorse was genuine but that custody was necessary, not simply to punish the defendant but to 'show other boys that, if they choose to commit offences of this kind, they will be sent to detention'. The boy, who was said to have been doing well in school before his grades dipped this year, admitted two charges of robbery and one of possession of an imitation firearm, a realistic looking BB gun. Wearing a black suit, white . shirt and tie, he sat impassively in the dock as the sentence was passed. He looked briefly over to his mother and the rest of his family as he . was led down. Judge Goldstone refused to lift the boy’s anonymity, saying the family had 'been through enough'.","Boy stole £2,000 when he held up the Barclays Bank, in Liverpool .

A young mother who has battled leukaemia twice has been denied 'life-changing' hair replacement therapy on the NHS. Samantha Green was left with alopecia after being treated with super-strength steroids when the disease returned in 2010. But the 29-year-old has three times been refused a £2,000 treatment to improve the appearance of her thin and patchy hair - despite the backing of her consultant at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Battle: Samantha Green, 29, (left before her hair loss) was left with alopecia (right) after being treated with super-strength steroids when fighting leukaemia for the second time . The Central Midlands Commissioning Support Unit, which advises on NHS spending, decided her case was not exceptional. Administration worker Samantha, who was training to be a nurse until she was taken ill, said the verdict had crushed her remaining confidence. 'Hair makes a woman feel feminine,' she said. 'A lady who had a double mastectomy would not be refused a breast reconstruction. Yet someone who suffered alopecia due to intense chemotherapy is classed differently. 'The therapy would change my life. You never get used to wearing a wig.' Recovery: Ms Greene first fell ill in August 2005. She underwent two rounds of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow transplant, but after this, her hair grew back fine . The hair replacement therapy, called the Intralace system, lasts two years. It works by fitting a mesh over any area with little or no hair, pulling the existing hair through the mesh and plaiting tiny wefts of fine real hair to it. Unlike normal hair extensions, it doesn't place stress on the remaining strands. Ms Greene, who has an eight-year-old daughter called Madison, had thick dark hair before she first fell ill in August 2005. She underwent two rounds of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow transplant which involved . total body radiation treatment. After this, her hair grew back fine. Fight: The second time round she lost her hair. She has now been refused a £2,000 treatment to improve the appearance of her thin and patchy hair - despite the backing of her consultant at Birmingham¿s Queen Elizabeth Hospital . She . relapsed in 2010 when she had another two bouts of chemotherapy and . another bone marrow transplant. This time she was treated with Busulfan which she . thinks caused the alopecia, but it was the only treatment available to . her at the time. Despite . the agony of her hair loss, Ms Greene has been told she will not benefit . from the treatment any more than other patients who also qualified. But she said she was struggling to cope with her alopecia on a daily basis and now hoped to set up a fundraising page to help other women in the same situation. Denied: Despite the agony of her hair loss, Ms Greene (with daughter Madison) has been told she will not benefit from the treatment any more than other patients who also qualified .

Dr Dan De Rosa, chairman of Wolverhampton Clinical Commissioning Group, which spends almost £1m a day on the city’s healthcare, said: 'The decision in this case was made following detailed assessment by a panel of clinicians who took into account a wide range of factors.

When her health appeared to improve in . April - after she had a tumour removed from her womb - they booked the . Ryanair flights to the Canary Islands.

Dream holiday: The Parsons had booked a break to Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands before she died . 'She loved travelling and it was the thought of the holiday that was keeping her going.’ Ryanair is the largest low-cost carrier in Europe and flies to 145 destinations, including 15 in the UK. However, it has repeatedly come under fire over its hidden charges for passengers for everything from booking online to checking in bags. Last month, it emerged pilots were ordered to fly more slowly in a bid to save money on fuel after a fall in the airline’s quarterly profit. This month it was revealed that following an internal survey of 1,000 pilots, two-thirds said they did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through the airline’s internal system, while nine out of ten said it did not have an ‘open and transparent safety culture’. Most recently staff have been told to increase the company’s profits by avoiding giving change back to passengers when selling them things from the trolley. In the past Ryanair has talked of replacing 10 rows of seats with a standing area as well as introducing a coin-operated toilet on some planes. When Mr Parsons asked Ryanair for a . refund, it offered its ‘condolences’ but said Mrs Parsons had breached . its terms and conditions. The letter read: ‘Unfortunately, we . regret to advise you that in accordance with Ryanair’s General . Conditions of Carriage detailed below we cannot refund your booking’ It included a section from its terms . and conditions regarding bereavements that states: ‘In the case of a . bereavement of an immediate family member (spouse, civil partner, . mother, father, brother, sister, child, grandparent or grandchild) within 28 days of intended travel we will... make a refund.’ Last night the airline backed down and . apologised to Mr Parsons after he threatened to take the flight and . strap an urn containing his mother’s ashes to what would have been her . seat. A spokesman said: ‘He was entitled to a . full refund, and this has now been sent to him, with our sincere . apologies for the incorrect letter and inconvenience caused to him and . his family.’ Mr Parsons said he was pleased that Ryanair had changed its mind. He said: ‘It was never really about the money. It was all about the principle. ‘If they had not given me the money . back, I would have booked my mother’s ashes on to the flight and . strapped her in the seat that I had booked for her. ‘She had a valid passport so I don’t think there was any way they could have refused to take her ashes. ‘I would also have put the ashes in . the wheelchair that I had reserved for her at the airport, and I would . have filmed everything and posted the video on YouTube. ‘You expect to get a rough ride with . these cheap airlines, but you don’t expect to get tied to a contract . which is so far bent in the airline’s favour that you can’t conceivably . win.’ He added that he will never travel with Ryanair again.","Beryl Parsons, 78, died four months before holiday to the Canary Islands .

Now founder Steve Dayman MBE, who launched his fight against the deadly . disease after losing his baby Spencer to meningitis in 1982, said ‘The . availability of the lifesaving vaccine in the UK is a watershed moment . in the fight against the deadly disease. ‘The vaccine is one of the . most significant leaps forward in the fight - it’s taken decades to . develop and stands to save thousands of lives and spare so much misery. ‘We . welcome that it is now available privately, but believe every parent . should have the choice and chance to vaccinate their baby - not just . those with means. ‘Universal vaccination is the best way to stop the disease. ‘We . must also consider herd immunity, when a large proportion of people are . vaccinated, it removes a great chunk of the disease and helps to . protect those who haven’t had the vaccine.’ Campaigners claim, in . extreme cases, it can cost £3million in support and treatment for each survivor of the disease. Campaigners are calling for the treatment to become routine throughout the NHS . Figures earlier this year showed £28million was paid out in compensation . to the families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis . missed by GPs between 2008 and 2012. Sue Davie, chief executive of the charity, said ‘We are asking the Government to not only consider costs of treating the disease, but the cost of bereavement support for families and after-care for survivors from prosthetic limbs to lifelong support through school and adult life.’ The vaccine Bexsero is licensed for infants aged two months and over - babies being most susceptible during the first year of life - and older children. It has taken 20 years to develop the jab using a revolutionary new approach against a range of disease-causing strains.Bexsero has been tested in more than 7,500 patients including infants, toddlers, adolescents and adults across the world. Studies show most vaccinated infants and teenagers develop a strong immune response. Novartis offered earlier this year to make the vaccine available at cost to the NHS, which is understood to be far lower than the price on the private market. Andrin Oswald, Division Head, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, said ‘While we are delighted that MenB disease is now vaccine preventable in the UK, it is our belief that the greatest public health benefit can be achieved through the introduction of the vaccine onto the National Immunisation Programme. ‘We hope that the Department of Health will make the vaccine universally available as soon as possible.","Bexsero is the first jab to protect against meningitis B .

A young bride has spoken of the huge dilemma she faced over whether to have her large intestine removed, meaning she would need an ileostomy bag for the rest of her life. Lauren Henderson was just 25 when doctors said she would need surgery to treat Crohn's disease, which causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed. Her condition had become so bad that doctors said she would need surgery to relieve pressure on the large intestine, instead fitting her with a bag to collect solid digestive waste. Brave: Lauren Henderson (on her wedding day earlier this year) was told she would need surgery to remove her large intestine and replace it with an ilesotomy bag . She said: 'I debated whether to get the . surgery. I kept turning over in my mind whether it would change my . image. 'I feared the unknown - what people would think, whether my . relationships would change.' She eventually decided to go ahead with the surgery and, far . from hiding from the consequences of her illness, wore her ileostomy . bag on honeymoon as proof that she survived her life-changing Crohn’s . disease diagnosis. She said: 'After everything, it’s been perfectly . manageable and I’m so glad I had the surgery. I can’t believe I went for . so long being in such pain.' Mrs Henderson, who has a three-year-old . son, Teddy, was diagnosed with the condition four years ago. She . said: 'At first, I thought my upset tummy was due to food poisoning. It . started getting particularly bad during my final year of university. I . was so ill that I was crying in front my tutor.

'It . felt like there was a hot stone bouncing around in my lower abdomen. It . was mortifying to have to run to the loo so frequently, sometimes . mid-conversation. 'When the . diagnosis finally came I was relieved I didn’t have cancer, but for a . while I was in denial about how I would need to deal with Crohn’s for . the rest of my life.' Mrs Henderson, a drama teacher, met her husband Kieran, an IT specialist, on a plane to Benidorm in August 2011. In the first few weeks of their relationship, Mrs Henderson, now 26, hesitated from informing her new partner about the full extent of her incurable condition. Awareness: Far from hiding from the consequences of her illness, Mrs Henderson wore her ileostomy bag on honeymoon as proof that she survived her life-changing Crohn’s disease diagnosis . She said: 'I tried to hide what was going on, but it became increasingly difficult. 'Exhaustion . made my life a misery.

Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon). Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon. It isn’t fully understood what causes it but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role. There is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system.here are currently at least 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease in the UK. Crohn's disease can affect people of all ages, including children. However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30. 'He was completely unphased. He simply told me how brave I was, and how he’d always support me.' Mr Henderson, 22, proposed in January 2012, the day before Mrs Henderson decided to go ahead with the surgery to separate her large intestine from her small intestine. The operation in June 2012 resulted in her being fitted with an ileostomy bag, which collects all solid digestive waste. In December, the change was made permanent when surgeons removed her large intestine. Despite the life-changing surgery, Mrs Henderson refused to let the modification to her body stop her from enjoying life to the full. She said her wedding in March 2013 and her subsequent honeymoon to Jamaica helped to restore her confidence. She said: 'I had picked out the . perfect wedding dress, and I was worried how whether the surgery would . stop me from wearing it. As it turned out, I had absolutely nothing to . worry about. Quite the opposite. 'I . attended my brother’s wedding as a bridesmaid before the surgery and . that occasion was utterly ruined by the symptoms after I ate something . which didn’t agree with me. 'The surgery allowed me to enjoy my . wedding to the full. I could eat what I wanted and was free to be . myself. It was absolutely wonderful.

A woman who has spent the month growing a moustache has been so pleased with people's reactions that she's considering keeping it. Sarah O'Neill was once dubbed 'Mac3' due to having an excess of facial hair as a result of suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). One of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones (androgens), which leads to hair growth, meaning she would spend hours shaving and waxing her face. Scroll down for video . Sarah O'Neill has facial hair on her upper lip and chin as a result of suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome. She decided to grow a moustache for Movember to highlight the problem and raise awareness . But Miss O'Neill, 29, decided to ditch the razor at the start of the month and embrace her moustache for Movember, and raise awareness of her condition. She said: 'It was a spur of the moment decision after coming home from work feeling very embarrassed about how my facial hair had come through.' While she would usually be clean-shaven and use tweezers to remove stray hairs, she hasn't touched her facial hair for 30 days. Miss O'Neill, from Hull, said: 'I decided that it's part of me, so why should I hide it to please other people? 'I wanted people to know that I'm not lazy or unclean, it's just a medical condition.' Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the main cause of excess hair in women. It's estimated to affect 10 to 15 per cent of women and is when the ovaries don’t work properly and are covered . in small cysts. As a result, eggs are released erratically or not at . all, causing irregular or missed periods, and often reduced fertility . and acne. One of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones (androgens), which leads to hair growth. Comfortable: Miss O'Neill, with her fiance Tina, said: 'I felt really self-conscious at first, but when I told people my facial hair was due to a medical condition, they understood and were actually really supportive' Miss O'Neill, who works for a kitchen and beds company, was diagnosed with PCOS in 2006, after she started suffering with other symptoms, such as such weight gain and irregular periods. As Movember loomed closer this year, she decided it was time to banish the myth that only men grow moustaches and take part in the charity event. The fundraising challenge is usually reserved for men and sees people being sponsored to grow their facial hair for prostate cancer and men's mental health. Miss O'Neill said: 'I felt really self conscious at first but I found that if I told people who started staring at me why I was doing it and that it was due to a medical condition, they understood and were actually really supportive. 'The hair has been really itchy and prickly but now it's come through more I'm getting used to it.' She is now considering keeping the moustache after her confidence grew. She added: 'I have had so much more confidence towards the second half of the month. Support: Miss O'Neill says she has been 'overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers' who have donated to her cause, and thanked her for bringing the condition to light . 'I feel a lot more comfortable in my own skin. I'm . not sure what to do now. It has brought me a lot of happiness having . this on my face and being able to tell people about it, and I don't want . to undo any good work. 'I might keep it because it's part of who I am and it's OK to be me. The only downside is I look like my brother.' 'I moved jobs at the start of the month and told my manager straight away, and everyone at work has been right behind me.' She has currently raised around £800 over the month, and she is planning on donating the cash to men's charities. 'It's raising the profile of the condition and getting the issue out there,' she said. 'My money is still going towards the men's charities - I've just taken part in it.' She said she has been 'overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers' who have donated to her cause, and thanked her for bringing the condition to light. 'It's something you have to deal with and people have felt ashamed, as I did in the past, but I think I have brought it to the fore,' she said. 'People have experienced shame but I've highlighted that it's a medical condition, and most people have understood. 'I have been amazed with how generous people have been and I'm really thankful to everyone who has donated money for such a good cause.' She added that her fiancee Tina had been a great source of support. 'Tina has been my rock, and I couldn't have done it without her.

'If . excess hair is due to a hormonal imbalance, then it tends to occur in . areas such as the chin, upper lip, sideburns, chest and inner thighs,' says Dr Rina Davison, an endocrinologist from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, with a special interest in excess hair. 'These are areas of the skin that are more sensitive to testosterone. The hair is also likely to be coarse and dark.' Given . the implications for fertility, women worried about excess hair should . see their GP, advises Steve Franks, professor of reproductive . endocrinology at Imperial College, London and an endocrinologist at St .

'Often, excess hair . is a symptom of PCOS, but it also can be indicative of less common, but . potentially more serious, hormonal disorders, or tumours of the ovary . or adrenal gland - the two parts of the body that produce testosterone. 'Women should not be afraid to ask for a referral to a specialist.' The . alarm bells should ring for a GP if a woman comes in with a growth of . facial hair that has developed within the past six months, he adds.","Sarah O'Neill, 29, suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)

Three carers have been found guilty of abusing  vulnerable patients at a nursing home for ‘laughs’. Carol Ann Moore, Katie Cairns and Gemma Pearson mocked, bullied and assaulted eight residents with severe dementia because they would have no memory of the abuse, which lasted 16 months. One man was slapped on the face and tipped out of his wheelchair, Preston Crown Court heard. Another had his foot stamped on while a third was humiliated by having his nipples twisted.Residents were also pelted with balls and beanbags. Guilty (from left to right): Gemma Pearson, 28, Katie Cairns, 27, and Carol Ann Moore, 54, mocked, bullied and assaulted eight residents with severe dementia because they would have no memory of the abuse . The abuse took place at the privately run Hillcroft home in Slyne-with-Hest, Lancashire, between May 2010 and September 2011. Despite complaints from staff, the abuse was covered up by managers and came to light only after whistleblowers contacted the Care Quality Commission. The CQC informed the local authority’s adult safeguarding team but it took five months for the complaints to be passed on to police, who immediately launched an investigation. The scandal comes just a year after the jailing of 11 carers who were secretly filmed abusing vulnerable adults at the notorious Winterbourne View home in Bristol. Hillcroft team leader Moore, 54, and nurses Cairns, 27, and Pearson, 28, had all denied the ill-treatment or neglect of residents. All three had worked on the day shift on the Coniston Unit at the home, which housed ‘vulnerable and challenging’ patients. A fourth member of the team, Darren Smith, 35, of Lancaster, admitted abusing eight residents. Kathryn Johnson, prosecuting, said: ‘They mocked them, bullied them and on occasions deliberately assaulted them.’ She said bean bags were thrown so hard and fast at the residents that they were unable to catch them. Cleaner Lisa Bateman told the court she saw Moore slap resident Harry Bell across the face because ‘she wanted to get her own back’ after his wife had complained about the lack of activities in the home. The abuse took place at the privately run Hillcroft home in Slyne-with-Hest, Lancashire, over 16 months . Miss Bateman and laundry assistant Sharon Ormerod also saw Pearson tip Mr Bell out of his wheelchair when he failed to stand up, causing him to stumble. The court heard that Cairns stamped on resident Ken Heywood’s foot and singled out another victim, Harry Pullar, by pulling the loose skin on his neck. Mr Pullar also suffered bruising around his nipples as if they had been twisted and Cairns was seen to flick them, the court heard. Moore, 53, of Lancaster, denied three counts of abusing residents under the Mental Capacity Act. ‘I’ve never abused a patient or a resident in my care and I never threw any balls at them,’ she told the court. She described herself as a ‘model carer’. Cairns, of Morecambe, also denied three counts of abuse. She dismissed allegations she stamped on Mr Heywood and mocked Mr Pullar. Pearson, of Carnforth, denied one count of abuse, saying it would have been impossible for her to tip Mr Bell out of his wheelchair because he weighed 25 stone. They will be sentenced on January 10. Bosses at Lancashire County Council admitted there was a delay in reporting incidents of abuse at the care home to the police after they were alerted by the CQC. A spokesman said the council had improved its procedures following an internal review.","Carol Ann Moore, Katie Cairns and Gemma Pearson mocked, bullied and assaulted eight residents because they would have no memory of the abuse .

"By . Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 18:16 EST, 15 December 2011 . President Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as the 36th president of the United States- just hours after President John F. Kennedy had been publicly assassinated- on board Air Force One, surrounded by press and photographers. But no one thought it important to actually record where the plane stood at the exact moment of the transition of power. Now, 48 years later, historians have finally taken the time to determine the precise location of the plane on the tarmac of the Dallas, Texas airport. Swearing in: President Lyndon Baines Johnson took his oath of office on Air Force One in the Dallas airport . Accuracy: Air Force One is the centre plane in this photo taken at Love Field Airport on November 22, 1963, just hours after JFK was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. (See box below for more details) The scene: This archival shot shows the location of Air Force One (centre) when President Johnson was sworn in. The hearse that carried President Kennedy's body is even seen below the plane's tail . The photo above is one of six slides donated to the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas by airport employee Noel Cook. This is the widest shot of the batch, and shows three planes sitting on the tarmac on that historic afternoon. The centre plane is Air Force One, which the Kennedys flew into Dallas that morning. The plane to the left is Air Force Two, used by Mr Johnson when he arrived in Texas just before the Kennedys that morning. The third plane, on the right, is the Pan Am plane used by the press. When looking at the close-up of Air Force One, viewers can see a white box-like object below the tail of the plane: that is the back of the hearse that brought President Kennedy's body to the airport from Parkland Hospital. Photo: Noel Cook Collection/Courtesy The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza . The search began last year when a Congressman that represents neighboring districts suggested that some type of historically commemorative marking be placed at the location of the plane to insure that the event is remembered. The site is historic after all, as President Johnson was one of only five presidents to take his oath of office outside of Washington. (The others were George Washington, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge.) Dallas Love Field Airport is due for major renovations, so it would be easy enough to construct a marker to distinguish the historic spot. The prospect, surprisingly, left airport officials stumped. No one thought to dig through the archives to ascertain the spot until Representative Dan Branch suggested it last year. Nearly a year of on-and-off research . later, the spot has been determined using photographs taken by . a Federal Aviation Authority employee who was working on that fateful . day. The worker, Noel Cook, . climbed up on to the roof of the terminal and took photos of the plane . once everyone had gotten on board for the swearing-in ceremony. Moments before: President John F. Kennedy was the second U.S. president (to Abraham Lincoln) to be killed while in office . Mr Cook donated his film to The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, located in the portion of the former Texas School Book Repository where Oswald fired his three shots at the president, in the 1999 though he did not expect them to be of any relevance. 'He kept apologizing over and over, . saying, “I know they’re not very good,”' the museum’s curator Gary Mack . told The Dallas Morning News. 'And . I kept assuring him that all pictures were important; you don’t know . what researchers in the future will be interested in,’ Mr Mack . continued. Mr Mack turned . over scans of Mr Cook’s slides to the architects who are in charge of the Love . Field Airport construction, and Jonathan Massey, the principal architect . for Corgan Associates, took over. No indication: Air Force One arriving at Love Field Airport with President Kennedy on board hours before he was shot . Breaking news: Kennedy's death caused headlines and much confusion initially, and AP wire reports were the first to confirm the death. The incident caused the longest period of uninterrupted news on television until 9/11 . Times have changed: A recent photo of Dallas Love Field runway 13L shows how the area looks different from 1963 . ‘I crawled all over the roof with my camera and tripod, holding up the photo to get things to match up with the way things are now,’ Mr Massey told The Dallas Morning News. Massive construction on the airport since 1963 caused quite a few impediments to his angled view, but finally he figured out where the plane stood. Then the next layer of details arose when he had to figure out where exactly President Johnson was standing on the plane. That led to conversations with the archivists in charge of the Boeing . 707 used during President Kennedy’s time, which is now on an Air Force . base in Ohio, which lead to hours pored over the original floor plans, . and breaking down witness accounts and photos of President Johnson’s . swearing-in ceremony. After measuring out the tiniest details- like the 18 inches he allotted . for each of the passenger rows- Mr Massey had found the X that marked . the historic spot. Sombre arrival: The body of President Kennedy is removed from the plane at Andrews Air Force base in D.C. President Johnson was standing at 96 . degrees, 50 minutes, 49.85 seconds of west longitude and 32 degrees, 50 . minutes, 42.22 seconds of north latitude when he was sworn in. Though . the architects have not yet determined how they will memorialise this . exact location- FAA restrictions limit the options given that the runway . is still in constant use- they at least now know where to look when . thinking back to that day. Number 36: President Johnson was sworn into office in the cabin of Air Force One in 1963 . Historians are thinking of other ways that the city can plan ahead to tastefully embrace the event that has long marred Dallas' past. In preparation for the 50th anniversary in 2013, the city is proposing a refurbishment of Dealey Plaza, the road where the presidential motorcade was driving as President Kennedy was shot.  Organizers plan to host a large event there on the anniversary, and are hoping to raise $2.2million for the road’s restoration. 'I don't want to interpret for anyone the events, whether there was a conspiracy or not,' said Willis Winters, who works in the design and construction office of the Dallas park and recreation department. 'What I do want to achieve is that Dealey Plaza is in pristine condition so that when millions of people come there, they're going to see a well-restored site — not peeling paint, broken light fixtures and broken-up side walks,’ Mr Winters told The Los Angeles Times. In the past, the city has almost shunned its association with the shooting, with some citizens feeling a sense of guilt that they let an extremist go about his evil plan with no safeguard. Formal ceremonies on the November 22 anniversary have been avoided in the past, with the city sometimes saying that it is at the request of the Kennedy family. The lack of festivities has not . stopped the tourists from coming to the city to pay homage, however, as . the Sixth Floor Museum hosted 330,000 visitors in 2010 from 133 . countries. The past fifty . years have come with significant change to Dallas, and many of the . people who were there that day have greyed, died, or moved away. New leader: President Johnson (center) meets with Martin Luther King Jr. (left) during his presidency . The city is now becoming less and less of a cowboy-hat-and-big-hair-city and is being branded more as an urban metropolis, in fitting with the fact that it is now the fourth largest city in the country. 'Dallas is still scarred and wounded,' Sixth Floor Museum executive director Nicola Longford said to The LA Times. 'For Dallas, this is an opportunity to look back and not ignore it, to move through it and be inspired,’ Ms Longford continued. November 22, 196312.29pm Central Standard Time: The presidential motorcade turns onto Dealey Plaza in Dallas. The open-top limousine has a driver and security guard in the front row, Texas governor John Connally and wife Nellie Connally in the middle row, and President John F Kennedy and wife Jaqueline in the back row. 12.30pm: Witnesses testified that three shots were fired. The famous video recording of the event filmed by onlooker Abraham Zapruder shows that first Kennedy clutches his chest and seems to gasp before another shot hits his head. Governor Connally is also hit. Mrs Kennedy immediately begins climbing towards the back of the vehicle, apparently in an effort to grab part of the President's skull which flew back after he was shot. The Connallys reported that Mrs Kennedy said 'I've got his brains in my hand!' 12.33pm: Shooter Lee Harvey Oswald exits the Texas School Book Depository, where he fired the shots from a sixth floor window. 12.38pm: The presidential limo arrives at Parkland Hospital. 1pm: President Kennedy is pronounced dead. A Catholic priest had been found and he performed his last rites. Doctors said that while they tried extremely hard to save his life, the wounds were too great by the time he arrived in the hospital. 'We never had any hope of saving his life,' said Dr. Malcolm Perry. 1.15pm: Oswald shoots and kills police officer J.D.

Police have censored a 2009 interview with Jimmy Savile by redacting all mentions of the royal family, it has been claimed. Transcripts from the Surrey Police report were released last week with 96 lines blacked out. But according to the Daily Star Sunday, they had first gone to Buckingham Palace to vet, as they were 'mentioned' in the documents. Shamed: Savile abused hundreds of young girls over a period of decades but never faced justice . It was only revealed after an information officer working for the force 'let slip' that they had been sent to the palace. It took seven months for the papers to be released. In an internal report released in January, Savile referenced the cousin of the Queen - but in the documents released on Tuesday there was no mention of her. Other mentions of royalty looked to have been erased also. Savile often boasted of his Royal connections, claiming to have had a close friendship with Prince Charles and Diana, and to have helped Fergie through her marriage break up. Savile was awarded an OBE by the Queen in 1972, and then a knighthood in 1990. He wrote in his 1974 autobiography of his friendship with the same cousin of the Queen he mentioned in the 2009 police interview. Interview: The transcript of Surrey Police's interview with Savile in 2009 was released this week . He told officers he visited the Surrey school  - where it is said he abused girls  - with Princess Alexandra. They were attending a garden party. In his autobiography he wrote: 'Princess Alex is a patron of a hostel for girls in care. At this place I'm a cross between a term-time boyfriend and a fixer of special trips out.' The paper claims that Savile's references to the princess are within the redacted lines of blacked out text. Nineteen of 32 deletions were taken out because they contained personal information, and the other 13 because they contained information sensitive to criminal investigations. Sixty-four were removed as they contained details of allegations from three women. A Palace spokesman declined to comment. A Surrey Police spokesman said the information had taken seven months to release as it contained personal information about witnesses. She added: 'Personal information was redacted and the transcript was shared with partners prior to its release, however there is a full report on our investigation in to Jimmy Savile which was published in January.' Details of the 56-minute interview, carried out two years before he died, came to light last week . Details of the 56-minute interview, carried out two years before he died, came to light last week. The 83-year-old said accusations from three of his teenage victims were the ‘complete fantasy’ of people ‘looking for a few quid’. He boasted he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’. The transcripts have led to accusations that the officers treated Savile with kid gloves. In March the policing watchdog HMIC identified 11 failures in the case, including the ‘lack of challenge to Savile’s assertions’. The transcripts were released by Surrey Police following a freedom of information request. A major review of the decision not to charge Savile in 2009 concluded in January there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories, or that they were unreliable. The report by senior CPS lawyer Alison Levitt, QC, was released in tandem with an official police probe into the DJ’s 60 years of abuse. It was revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight. The HMIC said it was wrong to allow Savile to choose where and when his ‘ineffective’ interview took place. Savile was interviewed under caution on October 1, 2009, in his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where police now believe he abused scores of patients he was supposedly helping through his volunteer work. At the beginning of the interview, the officers politely asked Savile whether it was ‘OK’ to call him Jimmy and thanked him for ‘kindly’ letting them use his office to conduct the interview. 'People are looking for money, and they will try blackmail and they will write letters, saying I will say you’ve done this and you’ve done that. 'We always get something like this coming up for Christmas because we want a few quid. Normally you can brush them away like midges'","Transcripts from Surrey Police report were released with 96 redactions .

Argentine researchers have discovered that dogs eavesdrop on what their owners are saying about their food, in order to decide whether they want to eat it or not. They conducted a series of experiments to find that dogs watch and listen to the way people interact with one another to work out who will provide the tastier meal. Researchers found dogs use information gleaned from the interactions of one human with another. In picture A a man tells the woman how tasty the cornflakes were, in B he returns the 'disgusting' cereal and in C the dog approaches the woman with the tastier cornflakes . The research, described in the PLoS journal, builds on another study, which demonstrated that dogs carefully watch the behaviour and emotions of people. The new study, conducted by scientists at the University of Buenos Aires, found dogs use information gleaned from the interactions of one human with another, instead of a person’s direct interaction with them. Scientists are undecided about how much dogs really understand the actions of humans . In the experiment, dogs watched a man ask two different women for a bowl of cornflakes. While both women supplied the man with cornflakes, he told one woman how delicious the cereal was and returned the bowl with the same food in it to the other woman, telling her it was disgusting. After his interactions with the women, he left and a dog that had been watching the exchange was let off its lead. The animal preferred the woman who had provided the 'tasty' cereal. However, in some repetitions of the test some  dogs did not approach either of the women, suggesting that the outcome of the experiment was not entirely clear cut. Other studies have found that puppies can tell if their owner is happy by looking at their facial expression, compared with a neutral one, Popular Science reported. Dogs have also been found to prefer people who share food, and in one study by the University of London, Goldsmiths, sought out the company of crying people instead of those who talked or hummed. Researchers found the canines sniffed, nuzzled and licked crying strangers. While there is an argument that dogs . only watch interactions between people, instead of a person’s reaction . to an object, a previous study discovered that dogs are able to pick out . boxes that excited a person.

Admission: The captain of the stricken cruise ship Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, told his bosses on the night of the disaster: 'I have messed up' The captain of the stricken Costa Concordia reassured coastguards that he would be the last to leave the cruise ship, a new recording has revealed. But Captain Francesco Schettino did not keep his promise and ended up fleeing the vessel while passengers were still on board. Schettino, 52, who is under house arrest facing charges of abandoning ship and multiple manslaughter, promised coastguards that he would be the last person off the ship - minutes before he fled in a lifeboat, leaving hundreds of passengers on board. In . the recording, released by Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper, an official . asks Schettino whether everyone is going to abandon ship. Sounding . breathless, the captain replies: ‘I’m going to stay here.’ The coastguard asks again: ‘So only you are going to stay there?’ Schettino replies: ‘I’m the only one who will stay here.’ Signing . off, the coastguard says:  ‘Very good, Captain. Continue with the . evacuation and we’ll speak later. Keep your mobile with you.’ In . another tape recording released last week, an exasperated Gregorio De . Falco, head of the local coastguard, ordered Schettino back to his ship . to co-ordinate the rescue. The captain later told investigators he ‘tripped and fell’ into a lifeboat. It has also been revealed Schettino made a frantic telephone call to a senior company executive just after the incident. Sources said he told Roberto Ferrarini, Costa Cruises’ operations manager: ‘I’ve messed up. We have touched the bottom [of the sea]. I am telling you the truth. We sailed past Giglio and we took a hit.’ Sources say the captain’s call was made 23 minutes after the liner ran aground, tearing a gaping 230ft hole in its hull. Twenty people are still missing and the number of people dead has risen to 12. The body of a woman was found by divers on Saturday in a submerged corridor on the fourth deck of the  £372 million vessel. The . victim – who was wearing a lifejacket – was taken to the island of . Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany, where the Concordia hit rocks nine . days ago.

Sad news: The body of a woman has been found by divers in a submerged corridor on the fourth deck of the £372million vessel .

Prosecutors claim the captain  was on an unauthorised course to perform a ‘salute’ to islanders. In legal documents forming part of the case against Schettino, the father-of-one confirmed that 30  minutes before the tragedy he had dined in the ship’s exclusive Club restaurant with Moldovan blonde  Domnica Cemortan. At the time of the impact at 9.42pm last Friday, Schettino said that Ms Cemortan, 25, was ‘in a side room’ close to the bridge.

A teenage girl who was allegedly starved to death by her mother ran away to Walmart and spent the night cowered beneath the shopping carts, new evidence has revealed. Tragic Markea Blakely-Berry, 16, fled her home in Georgia and the next day employees found her wandering through the aisles. The teenager was so hungry that on trips to shops with her mother she would even open cans of food as they walked through stores, it is claimed. In a harrowing diary entry, the starving girl says she would rather live at the Walmart store than at home with her mother. Tragic: Markea Blakely-Berry, pictured left as a young girl, has died after apparent neglect from her mother Ebony Berry, right. The teenager ran away to Walmart she was so hungry, files have revealed . Desperate: A Walmart store similar to the one that starving Markea Blakely-Berry ran away to and spent the night huddled under shopping carts . Markea was found dead on June 15 . weighing just 40lbs amid claims from relatives that she was routinely . 'punished' by her mother Ebony Berry. Berry, 38, faces charges of murder and . first-degree child cruelty after Markea, who was mentally disabled, was . found dead at home. Child protection documents have now . revealed the harrowing plight of the teenager, and how her mother . thwarted the authorities' efforts to intervene. The teenager told police who collected . her from the Walmart that she had run away from home because she did . not want to be a 'burden' on her mother. But the girl was under strict orders from her 'controlling' mother not to speak with 'outsiders'. Happy family: Markea, left, plays with a relative at a family gathering before her abuse began. The teenager was told not to speak with 'outsiders' Haunting: This image of Thanksgiving dinner drawn by Markea shows the family with empty plates . Well-stocked table: But Markea was once so hungry she ran away from home and stole food from Walmart . Berry locked Markea in her bedroom at night with 'pee pads' to prevent her from leaving and to stop other visitors from seeing her, the files allege. There were multiple . investigations over almost a decade by child protection workers in . Michigan and Georgia, according to ajc.com. But the case was closed two months after the Walmart incident in 2010, leaving the teenager's condition to become worse. Officials were in touch with the . mother after Markea had ran away to the supermarket and . concerns about undernourishment were raised. But Berry is then said to have prevented her daughter from receiving medical treatment. Within two years the youngster was dead. DFCS Director Ron Scroggy said that the death 'should never have happened' and that the case 'should have remained open'. He said that the caseworker who had been involved with Markea left the agency a year ago. 'No matter how intimidating a person . is, the caseworker's ultimate responsibility is to make sure the child . is safe,' Mr Scroggy said. Devastated: Markea's father Mark Blakely, left, and grandmother Cheryl Goree, right, spoke of their grief . The case files claim that Berry was . aggressive towards officials and had previously fled from Michigan after . complaining about them 'prying'. The mother was deliberately obstructive by refusing to answer the door or pick up the phone, it is claimed. Shockingly, she even blamed the . problems on her daughter, telling caseworkers that it was down to her . premature birth and mental disabilities. Berry told them that her daughter was 'unruly'. Markea was prevented from asking for . help from the authorities because her mother gave orders for the . children not to speak with 'outsiders', the files allege. Former state Child Advocate Melissa Carter branded the state's handling of Markea's case 'shocking'. Mrs Carter said that from 'a humane . standpoint' there should have been some follow up when there are . concerns that a child is not being fed. Alice McQuade of the advocacy group Better Courts for Kid said it was a 'horrendous case'. ' 'It's just so hard, the idea of her slowly starving to death,' she added. After Berry's arrest, Markea's family noticed that she had links via Facebook to a group which encourages hunger, according to WOOD. Ms Goree described how Markea had sent her a haunting drawing of Thanksgiving dinner - with a table heaped with food, but completely empty plates. Markea's father Mark Blakely said he was shocked at the apparent abuse. 'I can't even understand it,' he said. 'How could anybody do that to somebody? You wouldn't even do your worst enemy that way.' The 'cult' is run by Dr Andrew Chung, a cardiologist who . graduated from one of the most prestigious medical schools in the . nation. It mixes scripture with his medical advice and encourages his . followers to eat just two pounds a day -- less than half what the . average American consumes. Police questioned Mr Chung about the girl's death. He denies his teachings are a 'cult'.

Hundreds of armed police have been placed around Paris' major tourist monuments because of an influx of criminal gangs from eastern Europe. It follows a huge increase in the number of aggressive beggars and pickpockets flooding into the French capital from Romania and Bulgaria – countries whose citizens will soon have unrestricted access to the UK. The Louvre alone now has 20 permanent uniformed officers patrolling its galleries, with five of them placed at the entrance. Guard: Officers at the Louvre, one of a number of attractions in Paris where security has been tightened . They arrived at the weekend, after staff went on strike to complain about youngsters attacking them as they steal from visitors. Similar patrols have been placed around sacred monuments including Notre Dame Cathedral and the Sacre-Cœur, the Eiffel Tower, the Pompidou Centre, and even the Palace of Versailles, west of Paris. Explaining the Louvre deployment, deputy director Herve Barbaret said: 'The presence of uniformed police officers has a significant deterrent effect. 'We hope they will stay as long as possible, for several months, until the situation returns to normal.' Mr Herve said plain clothes officers were . also mingling with some of the eight million plus people who visit the . Louvre every year – many of whom are from Britain. Safety: Louvre staff went on strike complaining they were being attacked by youngsters stealing from visitors . The number of surveillance cameras has . also increased, with Mr. Barbaret saying his staff were working with the . Paris prosecutors office to 'get the networks (of criminals) dismantled.' Gangs of Roma thieves – many of them young children – can now be seen all over Paris, the most popular tourist city in the world. 'Do you speak English?' is their usual opening gambit, and then they surround victims, helping themselves to money and possessions. Two years ago, France's then Interior . Minister said that the vast majority of street robberies in Paris were . being carried out by the children of Roma immigrants from Romania and . Bulgaria. Police presence: Hundreds of extras officers have been deployed at monuments including the Eiffel Tower . Claude Gueant said . the notoriously poor and corrupt eastern European states were . responsible for exporting some of the most notorious sneak thieves in . the world. Many operated in gangs around the Gare du Nord Eurostar station, preying on British travellers as they arrived by high-speed train from London. France has shut down illegal camps full of Roma gypsies which have sprung up around the French capital, but crime remains a huge problem. Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 but faced restrictions on immigration which are set to be lifted next year, leading to an expected influx into countries like Britain. A Paris police spokesman said: 'There has been a huge increase in the number of criminal gangs of pickpockets and other thieves operating in the city in recent years.

The consultation period required before large-scale redundancies are made is being halved. The move was applauded by business lobby groups but unions said it was ‘utter madness’ at a time of job insecurity and a stuttering economy. Cuts: The consultation period required before a boss can make large-scale redundancies will be reduced from next April . At present, a 90-day consultation period is needed before a boss can make 100 or more redundancies. From April, it will be cut to 45 days under regulations to be drafted early in the new year. A company will be allowed to consult for a longer period if it wants to, but 45 days will become the new minimum consultation period. The rules for smaller companies making 20 or more redundancies will not change, remaining at 30 days. There are no rules for firms making fewer than 20 redundancies. Employment Relations Minister Jo Swinson said it was sensible to change the law ‘to respond to an ever-changing employment landscape’. She said: ‘There is a strong argument for shortening the minimum period which is backed up by hard evidence.’ 'A shorter consultation period will reduce uncertainty for staff and allow businesses to focus on the future more quickly' Neil Carberry, CBI director for employment . The plans come at a time when official figures show the number of people working in the private sector has hit an all-time high of 24million. But there are still 2.5million unemployed. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the change, which it believes will help to cut the red tape that businesses say strangles their ability to grow. Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy, said: ‘In the 21st century, requiring a business to spend a quarter of a year consulting on how to restructure is unnecessary, frustrating and potentially disastrous. ‘The new rules will encourage firms to focus on quality consultation with staff and enable timely but fair decisions. This greater flexibility to change direction more swiftly reduces uncertainty for employees and customers and may help to prevent further job losses where the survival of the business could be at risk.’ The CBI said it was a positive move and was preferable to allowing the consultation period to drag on for months, which can be unsettling for workers. Neil Carberry, director for employment at the CBI, said: ‘The priority for businesses is meaningful consultation. ‘A shorter consultation period will reduce uncertainty for staff and allow businesses to focus on the future more quickly.’ Fury: Unite general secretary Len McCluskey described the 'regressive' measure as 'utter madness' But trades unions reacted with fury to the proposal. Britain’s biggest union, Unite, insists the current 90-day rule gives bosses, their workers and unions the best chance of trying to protect jobs through negotiation. 'This is one of the most regressive, anti-job measures ever taken by any government' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey . General secretary Len McCluskey said: ‘This is one of the most regressive, anti-job measures ever taken by any government. ‘To be taken in the depths of this financial crisis when the economy faces a triple-dip recession is utter madness. ‘Scything back the consultation period for larger scale redundancies, from 90 days to 45 days, is akin to hanging a massive “exit here” notice across Britain’s businesses.’ Bronwyn McKenna, assistant general secretary of Unison, said: ‘The recession has led to fear in the workplace. The Government is adding to those fears by cutting short the opportunity for meaningful talks to take place. ‘Any worker facing redundancy needs time to plan, to mitigate the impact on them and their family finances. Making arrangements to cover mortgages or rent, sort out bills, re-train and apply for new jobs all takes time and this cut will leave families facing financial hardship.’","The consultation period required before bosses can make large-scale redundancies is being cut from 90 to 45 days .

An Illinois high school has started random testing of drugs and alcohol in its students in a bid to stop students from taking the substances. The private St Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Chicago, will start testing its students this week by taking hair samples. Samples from 10 to 20 students will be chosen through random student ID selection by a third-party company each week, according to CBS Chicago. New protocol: Students at the private St Viator High School in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights are now subject to weekly random drug and alcohol testing . No more boozing: The tests will show whether the students have had a beer or other type of alcohol in the past 90 days . No hiding: The tests will show if a student has smoked marijuana, left, in the past 90 days by taking a sample of their hair, right . School administrators say the tests will reveal if a student has had alcohol or used drugs like ecstasy, cocaine or marijuana in the past 90 days. However, the test can't detect small amounts of alcohol, like sips of communion wine, according to The Daily Herald. The results take about five days to come back, and if a student is found to be positive, the school plans to either discipline them or provide counselling. Parents were informed of the new policy over the summer, with mixed reactions to the school's move. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is not particularly enthused either, saying it should be parents who have the responsibility of watching their children’s habits when they are not at school. ‘We have a mechanism for controlling the behavior of young people outside school — they're called parents,’ ACLU Illinois spokesman Ed Yohnka told the Tribune in August. Opponents: St. Viator Principal Reverend Corey Brost, left, says the students welcomed the test because it gives them an excuse to turn down drugs and alcohol. American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Ed Yohnka, right, says he doesn't think there is a 'need for schools to be acting as uber-parents' ‘I don't think we need for schools to be acting as uber-parents.’ However, St Viator is free to conduct the tests since they're a private institution. St. Viator Principal Reverend Corey Brost says students welcome the tests because it gives them an excuse to turn down drugs and alcohol if it is offered to them. ‘We want to give kids a good reason to say, ""No, I can't drink, St. Viator tests for alcohol"",’ Brost told the Herald. The school has randomly tested students for drugs since 2007, but the random tests for alcohol are new this year.","The private St Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Chicago, will start testing its students this week by taking hair samples .

Steven Moylan was found on the floor of the Bargain Booze, in Birkenhead, by staff after the alarm was set off in the store. The 35-year-old was trapped behind the glass-fronted cashier area after he fell when the ceiling above the store collapsed. CCTV footage shows Steven Moylan as he was arrested after being found unconscious after falling through the ceiling of the Bargain Booze store . Moylan fell through the ceiling after he broke into the upstairs flat and started prising up the floorboards . He was arrested by police who brought him round, but claimed to have no memory of how he ended up there. The store's deputy manager Kathryn Birks said: 'I came out for the call and couldn’t see anything at first. I went in and turned off the alarm and then noticed the ceiling hanging down. 'I thought it must’ve collapsed under its own weight. Then I noticed what looked like a pile of clothes, then thought ""hang on, there’s a head!""

He appeared before Wirral Magistrates' Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing with intent to commit damage, and another of entering the Bargain Booze store with intent to steal. The court heard he claimed to be living with his parents in Birkenhead, but they denied he was living there. Tessa Hinder, defending, said Moylan had been drinking all day and didn’t remember anything else, but accepted he must have done it. She said: 'It is one of the most poorly planned-out burglaries I have heard of.' Moylan was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing next month for a pre-sentence report to be drawn up.

New charges: Derek Medina appears Monday in court to face upgraded charges of first-degree murder . The accused killer reportedly previously admitted to shooting his wife six to eight times, but now claims the shots were fired in defense. Forensic evidence gathered by investigators contradicts that claim, and shows the murdered woman was on her knees with one arm raised as she was executed. Mr Medina told police Alfonso threatened him with a knife. Authorities previously seized a stun gun, a.380-caliber pistol and two other pistols and ammunition and a large knife from the kitchen, The Miami Herald previously reported.

Controversial: Former Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell recruited his ex-colleague within weeks of arriving at the BBC . A former Labour Cabinet Minister hired by the BBC on a £295,000-a-year salary is spending thousands of pounds a week employing an outside consultant he used to work with. James Purnell, who resigned from Government in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown, joined the Corporation as a director in March. The Mail on Sunday has learned that within weeks of his arrival he recruited 34-year-old ex-colleague Jean-Paul Petranca. Mr Purnell and Mr Petranca worked together at Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy,  as recently as January. Last night the appointment was criticised by Conservative MP Alun Cairns, who said it raised serious questions about the BBC’s employment practices. Neither the BBC nor Mr Petranca’s company was willing to discuss the nature of his work for Mr Purnell, which is believed to be coming to an end after six months. But one insider estimated that the BBC has been paying the consultancy firm, which describes itself as the world’s leading adviser on business strategy, about £14,000 a week. Mr Cairns said: ‘This sort of situation undermines recent commitments made by the BBC to be more transparent. There have already been questions about the manner of James Purnell’s own appointment. ‘For us to find out that he secretly recruited someone from his former company gives the BBC a bad name and raises further doubts about its openness and transparency.’ Battle: Mr Purnell resigned in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown . The news of Mr Petranca’s BBC work comes weeks after it was revealed Mr Purnell had recruited another ex-colleague. Godric Smith, 48, one of Tony Blair’s former spin doctors, is being paid £150,000 a year by the Corporation as a part-time PR adviser. The appointment infuriated Tory MPs as the BBC already has 140 staff in its PR department, with a salary bill of around £5 million. Mr Smith was hired to help restore the BBC’s reputation after the scandal over Jimmy Savile and a £25 million redundancy bill for senior managers. Mr Petranca declined to discuss his BBC . role. ‘I’m afraid I can’t talk about that,’ he said. Boston Consulting . Group said Oxford graduate Mr Petranca was a ‘principal’ in the . company’s London office ‘and remains a permanent employee of the firm’. Transparency: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said the BBC needs to explain why the money is being spent . The BBC was under scrutiny last night after paying a management consultancy firm £5.7 million during the first eight months of this year. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that Deloitte receives an average of £163,000 a week. Margaret Hodge, chairman of  the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘If the BBC is dishing out these amounts of money, it has to be transparent  as to why.’ The Mail on Sunday obtained the figures under a Freedom of Information Act after  a whistleblower raised concerns. The source said: ‘The whole finance and operations department is crawling with Deloitte consultants. The bill must be in the tens of millions in recent years.’ A Corporation spokesman said: ‘We are always conscious that we are spending public money, and consultancies are appointed through a fair tendering process.’","James Purnell worked with Jean-Paul Petranca at Boston Consulting Group .

The British public has fallen out of love with the NHS in dramatic fashion, according to a 'social attitudes' report. Satisfaction with the way the health service is run fell from 70 per cent in 2010 to 58 per cent in 2011, the survey published by the King's Fund, found. The authors of the report said the drop was the biggest fall in one year since the survey began in 1983. The British Social Attitudes 2011 which questioned 1,096 people about their views on health care between July and November last year, found that satisfaction with GPs dropped slightly from 77 per cent in 2010 to 73 per cent in 2011. It also found slight drops in satisfaction with inpatient, outpatient and accident and emergency services. However, satisfaction with NHS dental services improved by five percentage points - from 51 per cent in 2010 to 56 per cent in 2011. King's Fund chief economist John Appleby said: 'The value of this survey is that it has tracked public satisfaction over a long period, providing an important barometer of how the public view the NHS. 'The run of year-on-year increases in NHS satisfaction had to come to an end at some stage, and it is not surprising this has happened when the NHS is facing a well-publicised spending squeeze. 'Nevertheless, it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly. This will be a concern to the Government, given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its NHS reforms.' Health Minister Simon Burns said: 'Our latest survey of over 70,000 patients shows that an overwhelming majority - 92% - say that their overall experience of the NHS was good, very good or excellent. 'The British Social Attitudes survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors. By its nature, it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients. 'Our own polling of the general public, undertaken independently by Mori, shows that satisfaction with the NHS is broadly stable at around 70 per cent over a similar and more recent time period.' Health Minister Simon Burns said their latest survey had shown 92% patients rated their care as good to excellent . NHS Confederation chief executive Mike Farrar added: 'These results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the NHS. 'It would appear very likely that much of this relates to the understanding and support for the recent reforms. 'It is really important that politicians and NHS leaders are engaging the public in the major debate about the NHS and how we need to change in order to sustain and improve the services they have come to expect and value over recent years. 'Any drop in confidence in the service or confusion about the nature of current reform is therefore troubling. 'Over the coming months, it is going to be more important than ever that the Government and the NHS communicate effectively the financial and service challenges we face.' Royal College of Nursing Chief Executive & General Secretary, Dr Peter Carter, said: 'These findings are disappointing but not surprising. Over the past couple of years we have seen tens of thousands of posts stripped out of the health service. Staff are working under huge amounts of stress and pressure. 'This is a particular issue in accident and emergency settings and sadly we have heard many cases of patients being regularly treated on corridors. 'The RCN has consistently said that the programme of huge reform coming at a time as the service in England struggles to save £20 billion will have negative consequences. This survey now bears this out and the Government will have to sit up and take notice of these findings.'",Health Minister said survey not accurate reflection as targeted general public rather than those who had recently used the NHS .

The UK’s first cat DNA database has been set up to help solve criminal investigations – after cat hair was successfully used to trap a killer. The database, which currently holds records of 152 pets’ DNA, was started after hairs were found on the dismembered body of David Guy. Mr Guy’s torso was discovered in July 2012 wrapped in a curtain containing eight cat hairs. Breakthrough:  David Hilder, left, has been convicted for manslaughter after hairs from his pet cat were discovered on the dismembered torso of David Guy, right . Genetic tests suggested they could belong to Tinker, a cat owned by a suspect called David Hilder. Hampshire police sent the hairs to California for analysis where scientists examined the cat’s DNA. The results confirmed that Tinker had the same rare genetic code as the hairs found on the body. Scientists were able to prove that . the variety was unusual, by showing that none of the 493 randomly . sampled animals in a US cat database shared the same type of DNA. To help strengthen their case in . court, police were keen to know if the result would also be rare in the . UK. They tracked down Dr Jon Wetton – who had created a similar database . of UK dogs while working with the Forensic Science Service. Dr Wetton said: ‘Hampshire police . wanted to know the evidential strength of the match. I explained that . could only be determined with reference to a database of UK cats – which . did not exist at the time.’ The team were able to get 152 samples . from a company that analyses blood samples for vets. Only three of the . samples matched the hairs from the crime scene. This confirmed that the DNA type was also rare in the UK, making it easier to prove that the hairs came from the suspect’s cat. The evidence was presented at . Winchester Crown Court as part of the prosecution case that successfully . convicted Hilder of manslaughter. Dr Wetton said: ‘This is the first . time cat DNA has been used in a UK criminal trial. We now hope to . publish the database so it can be used in future crime investigations. 'This could be a real boon for forensic science, as the 10 million cats in the UK are unwittingly tagging the clothes and furnishings in more than a quarter of households.' Grim: Mr Guy's body was found wrapped in a curtain on a beach in Southsea in July last year. This picture shows detectives carrying out a fingertip search of the beach . Although the U.S and Canada have used cat hair in crime cases . before, the findings have never been collated in one database. Dr Wetton said: 'Having produced a similar database for dogs during my previous . employment with the forensic science service, we proposed creating a cat . database from scratch. 'Within each cat hair are two types of DNA, individual-specific ""nuclear . DNA"" detectable in the roots of some larger hairs, and ""mitochondrial . DNA"" which is shared by all maternally-related individuals and can be . found even in the finest hair shafts. 'Animal DNA offers a way of linking people to places and items through the transfer of their pets’ hairs.' Fellow researcher Barbara Ottolini said: 'The police were lucky in this case, as most mitochondrial types are common when tested with the technique we used here. 'We would like to use cutting-edge DNA sequencing methods to identify further variation in cat mitochondrial DNA to maximise the discriminating power of the evidence.'","David Guy's body parts found wrapped in a curtain on a beach in Southsea .

Women across the country are to have the right to find out if their boyfriend has a secret violent past. Clare’s Law, which enables them to ask police for background checks that could reveal whether they are at risk of attack or abuse, will be extended nationally within months. It also gives potential victims a ‘right to know’, which allows police to disclose sensitive information about a partner even if an individual has not asked for it. The expansion of Clare’s Law nationally comes after a successful 14-month trial in Manchester, Gwent, Wiltshire and Nottingham during which 400 women were given sensitive information such as details of a partner’s criminal record or complaints about them. History of violence: Clare Wood, left, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton after she dumped him. She had no idea of his violent past . The scheme is named after Clare Wood, 36, who was strangled by George Appleton after meeting him on Facebook four years ago. Appleton was freed by police, who dismissed him as a ‘quiet, mild mannered man’, just 72 hours before he set her body on fire and hanged himself. Her family later discovered he had convictions for violence against women, including kidnapping at knifepoint. Clare’s father Michael Brown, who has campaigned for women to receive more protection, yesterday said the law could have saved her life. Home Secretary Theresa May said 'domestic abuse shatters lives' ‘I’m hoping that at the very least there is going to be a substantial drop in the death figures,’ he added. ‘Clare’s Law is not a panacea, we have never suggested that it will stop all domestic violence. ‘But what it does do is give women and men in that situation a reasonable chance to make an educated assumption about what they should do in the future – go or stay.’ Some 88 women were killed by a  partner or former boyfriend last year, according to the Government, and the rise of dating and social networking websites has left many unaware of their partner’s background. Under the scheme, which is expected to come into force in March, police could take up to five weeks to disclose records. Women will be warned that repeating sensitive details to others could be an offence. In Wiltshire, 118 applications for disclosure were made and 22 granted in the trial. Police also piloted domestic violence protection orders, which ban abusive partners from going near their home for up to 28 days. Critics including domestic violence charity Refuge have said the initiative could waste police resources. Others said it may lead to malicious claims. But Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Domestic abuse shatters lives – Clare’s Law provides people with the information they need to escape an abusive situation before it ends in tragedy.’","All women in England and Wales to check criminal past of partners .

Charlie Harris, 32, was greeted with a swathe of lush ryegrass, planted on a bed of earth, sprouting between his computer, coffee cups and stationery. The elaborate prank was planned by Daniel Hurlbert, 33, who carried it out with the help of colleagues at the DIY marketing company in Austin, Texas, where the pair work. Scroll down for video . Charlie Harris, 32, of Austin, Texas, returned from a three-week holiday to find his desk turned into a lawn of lush ryegrass - a practical joke masterminded by colleague Daniel Hurlbert, 33 . Bit of a surprise: The finished grass desk as it awaited Charlie on his return from holiday . How it started: The desk before Daniel and his co-conspirators laid the grass seed . Mr Hurlbert said: 'After many years of honing our pranking skills this was perhaps the best one yet. 'The idea came fairly organically - I asked the engineering team for an epic prank for Charlie, as he was going on holiday for so long. 'We bounced ideas around until eventually I said, 'he's going to be gone so long, we should just grow a lawn on his desk.' 'We immediately knew it was the right idea.' Using artificial lighting and fast-growing grass seeds Mr Hurlbert, a senior manager at the company, managed to grow thick green turf all over the desk of Mr Harris, a software engineer. 'The grass grew extremely well even though the conditions we provided were terrible for it. It took a week for the grass to start sprouting up decently. By the second week it was really thick. When Mr Harris went on holiday, the team set to work painstakingly designing the grassy desk and buying supplies . Taking root: The first green shoots start growing on Charlie Harris's desk . 'Charlie was shocked when he saw the desk, but he laughed. He was impressed by how much work we had put in. 'He kept the grass on his desk and still hasn't removed it. He claims it's fairly comfortable.' The prank was the culmination of a series of escalating office pranks between the engineering staff at Home Improvement Leads. Mr Hurlbert said: 'After many years of honing our pranking skills this was perhaps the best one yet' Using artificial lighting and fast-growing grass seeds Mr Hurlbert, a senior manager at the company, managed to grow thick green turf . 'When . I went on holiday earlier this year, my team put hundreds of pictures . of Nicolas Cage all over my office,' said Mr Hurlbert. 'To this day, I still find pictures of Nic Cage hidden in books and drawers. 'When Charlie said he wanted to go on a long vacation to Prague and Germany, I knew we had to step up our game.' The team set to work painstakingly designing the grassy desk and buying supplies. Work colleagues replaced all of Charlie's possessions - but on top of a newly-grown patch of grass . Watering the indoor desktop lawn and bathing it in artificial light became a part of Mr Hurlburt's daily routine . Mr Hurlbert said: 'We did some research on what types of grass would grow the fastest and we discovered that ryegrass can sprout in less than one week and would be tough enough to survive artificial lights. 'Everyone in the team chipped in some cash to buy all of the required material. I think we spent around $75.' Watering the indoor desktop lawn and bathing it in artificial light became a part of Mr Hurlburt's daily routine. He said: 'For two weeks, we would water the grass twice a day using a sprayer. We ran growing lights for half the day every day.' Mr Harris said he was impressed but vowed revenge.

After spending his third Thanksgiving in five years in jail, a judge will today decide whether the world's most arrested man will remain incarcerated for the holidays. Henry Earl, 64, from Lexington, Kentucky, has been arrested more than 1,500 times in his career of criminality, which began in the 1970s at the tender age of 20. However, his epic law-unabiding - mostly public drunkeness - has made the homeless man nicknamed 'James Brown' something of a legend in his city of 300,000, and many of the locals are hoping for a 'Christmas miracle.' Christmas in the clink: After spending his third Thanksgiving in five years in jail, a judge will decide Thursday whether the world's most arrested man, Henry Earl, pictured left and right, will remain incarcerated for the holidays . Arrests: Earl, 64, from Lexington, Kentucky, has been arrested more than 1,500 times in his career of criminality, which began in the 1970s at the tender age of 20 . Earl, who also spent his 64th birthday behind bars in October, is scheduled to appear in a Fayette County court for a probation revocation hearing today after being arrested for alcohol intoxication last week. 'He is somewhat of a superstar in his own little world,' Fayette County Detention Center Officer John Casey told ABCNews.com. Earl's arrest history goes as far back as July 1970 when he was in his twenties for carrying a concealed weapon, according to The Smoking Gun, which has followed his career. He would go on to be arrested 33 more times that decade. Since then, Earl has been gradually increasing his frequency of arrests. In the 1980s, Earl picked up the pace . with 230 arrests, most due to public drunkenness or disorderly conduct. But it wasn't until 2008, that Earl gained national attention when he . found himself in court for his 1000th arrest for public intoxication. The man with many mugshots: Earl never takes the same mugshot twice, as evidenced in the above collage from just a few of his arrests in Kentucky . Judge Gary Payne made it an occasion by sentencing Earl to 1000 days in jail 'for your anniversary'. While . Judge Payne was under the impression that it was Earl's 1,000th arrest, . The Smoking Gun later discovered that it was actually number 1,333. The . website tallied that he has spent some 6,000 days in jail for his . arrests. 'It's a weekly, if not every-two-or-three-days thing,' Lexington police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts told CNN. 'He's never doing bad or illegal things purposely... He's just so highly intoxicated that he's posing a danger to himself.' There have even been times when Earl was released from the Fayette County Jail - which The Smoking Gun believes should be renamed in the man's honor - in the evening, only to return by midnight. Earl's sentences were shorter enabling him to rack up dozens of arrests in a year, jail spokeswoman Jennifer Taylor told CNN. However, . these days judges have begun handing down harsher sentences, some of . which have lasted up to three months. As such, he's only been arrested . five times this year. Day in court: Earl, who also spent his 64th birthday behind bars in October, is scheduled to appear in a Fayette County court for a probation revocation hearing after being arrested for alcohol intoxication last week . Famous: Earl's epic law-unabiding - mostly public drunkeness - has made the homeless man nicknamed 'James Brown' something of a legend in his city of 300,000, and many of the locals are hoping for a 'Christmas miracle' 'Most people on the streets of Lexington know who he is,' Taylor said. One person who is praying for his release, and him to turn around his wayward antics, is Ginny Ramsey, co-founder of Lexington's Catholic Action Center, who calls the 'very pleasant' Earl her friend. 'You can't help but love him, I tell you. ... He's as honest as the day is long,' she told CNN. 'With Henry Earl, you're going to hear the truth.' She said, when he's not in the clink, the man, who local band the Dangles, even wrote a song about, occasionally drops by the center for a bed or a bite to eat. But she said he was 'pretty independent.' She said the center's staff were 'within an inch' of getting Earl to kick his booze habit last year, but Earl told her, with a trademark smile on his face, 'I'm not ready,' she said. She's hoping this year will be different. 'I don't think it's going to take many more winters, and this one may be the one,' Ramsey told the network. 'There's never going to be a time when I'm not going to find something, even if it's one of our couches, for Henry Earl.'","Henry Earl, 64, has been arrested over 1,500 times .

Arizona fire officials knew the storm which fanned flames around team of 19 'hotshot' elite firemen who were killed in the blaze, was on its way an hour before it hit but did nothing pull out their men, a report had found. The investigation by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health has recommended $559,000 worth of fines are paid by the state's Forestry Division, citing poor communication between those directing crews on the ground. The leader of the investigation Marshall Krotenberg said: 'The storm was anticipated, it was forecasted, everybody knew it. But there was no plan to move people out of the way. Tragedy: Winds from a thunderstorm fanned the flames toward the tragic 19 hotshots, but fire chiefs did not pull out their men in time . Destroyed: The report said that by keeping crews on the mountain they were prioritizing the safety of property before the lives of its firefighters . In addition, senior fire managers had already determined that the town they were battling to save was indefensible, he said. The finding was a rebuke to an earlier investigation commissioned by the Forestry Division, which found that state fire officials communicated poorly during the disaster. Now the Forestry Division itself has been linked to the death of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, who  were killed in a blaze near the small community of Yarnell northwest of Phoenix. The team were trapped as the flames they were battling changed direction in a fierce thunderstorm June 30. All but one member of the crew died. The Arizona State Forestry Division oversaw the fight against the blaze that sparked on state land. The ADOSH investigation found that state fire officials lacked key personnel to battle the Yarnell Hill Fire at critical times. Krotenberg, the safety agency's lead investigator, told the commission there should have been officers to ensure firefighters' safety, a planning section chief and a division supervisor, who wasn't replaced after he abandoned his post. Kevin Woyjeck, left, and Wade Parker, right,  lost their lives in Yarnell Hill, Arizona in April this year . Wade Parker (left) followed his father Captain Danny Parker (right) of . the Chino Valley Fire District to become a Hot Shot and was in his first . year when he died . Krotenberg told commissioners that fire managers should have removed firefighters an hour before the thunderstorm arrived. The commission's chairman, David Parker, said he believed the fire management team on site did everything in its power to defend the community and provide for the safety of people. He said: 'But it's not the intention of the people that (is) in question, it's that employees remained exposed after they no longer should be exposed.' Heroes: A group photograph shows members of the Prescott Granite Mountain Hotshots . Carrie Dennett, a spokeswoman for the Forestry Division, said the agency fully cooperated with the investigation and declined comment. The Forestry Division now has 15 working days to appeal. Gov. Jan Brewer's office also declined comment, citing pending litigation. The mother of one of the firefighters has filed a $36 million notice of claim against the state, Yavapai County and the city of Prescott, saying their negligence led to the death of her son. The safety agency's review occurred simultaneously but separately from a three-month investigation by national experts into the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Tragic: Chris Mackenzie (right) also died in the inferno on June 30. He had followed in the footsteps of his father, Mike MacKenzie (left), who was once the fire captain of Moreno Valley, California . That report was released in September and found lapses in communication from the crew in the hour before the firefighters died. It also found that proper procedure was followed but did not say whether deaths were avoidable nor did it place blame. The ADOSH investigation found that the state Forestry Division didn't respond to a request the evening before for two safety officers, key positions in large firefighting efforts. Krotenberg said the oversight was the result of an unknown mistake. 'Apparently, it got dropped... the ball got dropped.' Killed: Travis Turbyfill, pictured with his family, also died with his team on the mountainside . Fallen: Scott Norris, pictured, was one of the 19 victims . Firefighting crews were still battling the fire even after the incident command post was evacuated, according to the ADOSH report. The bulk of the proposed fine is $475,000 - $25,000 for each of the 19 deaths. That money will be paid to the firefighters' families. They were employed by the city of Prescott but working under a standing contract with the state Forestry Division for the Yarnell Hill Fire. The ADOSH investigation found that the city of Prescott was in compliance with standards for training and crew rest. Missed:  Fallen firefighter Andrew Ashcraft, pictured, had been married for seven years and had four children . The crew members had been in a relatively safe position on a ridge top. For an unknown reason and without notifying anyone, they moved down the mountainside through an unburned area where they were trapped by a wall of flames when winds shifted the fire in their direction. They deployed their emergency shelters but perished in the scorching heat. The surviving crew member, Brendan McDonough, was away from the others and acting as a lookout. He might have suffered the same fate had he not been picked up by another crew leader who happened to be driving by after McDonough radioed in to say he was retreating, Krotenberg said. Highly trained: Members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots (pictured last year) had been fighting wildfire in New Mexico and elsewhere in Arizona . 'Essentially, it was in the nick of time, and he didn't have to deploy his shelter' Krotenberg said. The report praised the Granite Mountain Hotshots for remaining 'alert, unimaginably calm, thinking clearly and taking decisive action.' While the crew followed most of standard firefighting guidelines, the safety agency faulted the men for not scouting or timing alternative escape routes, not having a lookout as they moved toward a ranch property identified as a safety zone, and not notifying their supervisor of their movements. The fire destroyed more than 100 homes and burned 13 square miles before it was fully contained on July 10. David Parker, right, Chairman of the Industrial Commission of Arizona looks over the report which was a damning criticism of fire chiefs . Moving: Juliann Ashcraft, widow of Andrew Ashcraft, one of the 19 fallen firefighters from the Yarnell Hill Fire, looks skyward during the hearing . Dan Parker, whose son Wade Parker was killed, is a firefighter himself in northern Arizona. He said it's time for the state 'to change the coach.' He said: 'As far as blaming somebody at this point, right now, on a personal level, I think it's futile' 'But having been a captain on a fire engine, and worked in the fire service as long as I have, I know that if I was involved in an incident where somebody was injured or killed, then my butt would have been on the hot seat and I would have been held accountable.' Family members who attended the hearing sobbed softly when the names of the dead were read. Juliann Ashcraft, whose husband, Andrew Ashcraft, was killed, said the report provides important insight. She said: 'Finally, people that are educated, that are experienced, that have researched it and have a less biased opinion - they're just there objectively - that they get it.'","Investigation said agency knew about storm which fanned flames towards tragic 'Hotshots' team .

A new study has shown persistent noise may hinder the development of young children by interfering with the growth of blood vessels in the brain. File picture . It may be all too tempting to put a baby in front of the television or play music to soothe them - but scientists fear it might be doing them permanent damage. Repetitive, persistent noise may have a long-term impact on the development of a child’s brain, new research suggests. Scientists warn that even relatively low sound - such as a television turned on quiet or the background noise of a washing machine - may cause harm if it is left on for more than a few hours. They think it could alter the development of babies and toddlers under the age of two, creating potential problems in later life. Neurologist Dr Jaime Grutzendler said persistent noise of more than ten hours a day may stop blood vessels being formed in babies’ brains. Long-term impacts could include an increased susceptibility to diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and accelerated ageing. Researchers at Yale University played low noise to young mice for ten hours a day, for a period of ten days. They found that the stimulation reduced the number of blood vessels being formed by 10 to 15 per cent, significantly reducing the oxygen that could reach the brain. Dr Grutzendler said: ‘The most striking relevance of this paper is that humans in a modern society are exposed to sounds that are quite similar to the ones that we played to the mice. ‘There are children that are exposed to this kind of constant noise through environmental noise and persistent music.’ Recordings played to the mice included a random assortment of sounds, including static ‘white noise’ and mouse noises. The sounds were played at 40 to 60 decibels - the volume of normal conversation, a vacuum cleaner or a quiet television. Dr Grutzendler said: ‘They sounds were not very loud but very persistent. ‘It was not enough to cause any ear damage - babies are probably exposed to much louder volumes. ‘And it had a very, very dramatic effect on the formation of new blood vessels. Researchers at Yale University warned even relatively low sounds, including having the television turned on quietly, could cause harm. File picture . ‘The interesting part is that the effect only occurs if you stimulate the mice at a particular age - before one month after birth, which is the equivalent of a one-to-two-year-old human.’ He added: ‘These repetitive sounds didn’t really exist 100 years, 200 years ago. But in modern society we are exposing kids to these repetitive sounds. ‘They are continually exposed to environmental noises, music, video games, television.’ The study, published in Nature, also found that putting a mouse on a treadmill for several hours or repeatedly stimulating their whiskers had the same effect on blood vessel growth. Dr Grutzendler said: ‘The results indicate that there is a general principal that too much stimulation of the nervous system by this repetitive stimulation causes an implication for the formation of blood vessels. ‘Mild stimulation - what you would call normal or healthy stimulation - does not cause any effect on blood vessels. ‘But what is not perfectly fine is to have these repetitive noises which are persistent. That is a stressful situation for the brain when it is vulnerable because it is developing these new connections and new blood vessels.’ He said more research is needed to firmly establish whether the findings were applicable in humans, but he added: ‘This is a public health issue which we think should be taken seriously.’","Scientists at Yale University discovered noise stimulation in young mice reduced the number of blood vessels being formed in the brain .

Harris, announced on Tuesday that the most commonly awarded grade at Harvard is, 'actually a straight A.' Shockingly, the median grade is lower than the most common grade at an A-. Harris addressed the faculty on Tuesday in response to a question from government professor Harvey C. Mansfield '53 regarding the college's apparent grade inflation, reported The Harvard Crimson. At Harvard University the most commonly awarded grade is an A . Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield (left) confronted The Dean of Education Jay M. Harris (right) on Tuesday about the rise in A's and the lowering of educational standards . During the meeting's question and answer period, Mansfield piped up and said, ' a little bird has told me that the most frequently given grade at Harvard College right now is an A-' He called Harvard's grading practice 'indefensible.' 'If this is true or nearly true, it represents a failure on the part of this faculty and its leadership to maintain our academic standard,' he continued. Harvard University is an Ivy League school known for academic excellence . Mansfield told The Harvard Crimson that he was 'depressed' upon hearing that an A was the most commonly awarded grade but said he was not 'surprised.' 'I thought the most prevalent grade was an A-minus, which is bad enough,' Mansfield said Tuesday to Boston.com. When I asked the question [about the most frequently given grade], it was worse,'he said. 'Nor was I surprised at the embarrassed silence in the whole room and especially at the polished table (as I call it),' Mansfield said in regards to the table at the front of the room where high-ranking administrators sit. Terrell Woods class of 2011 gave their opinion to MailOnline. 'In regards to the grade inflation scandal at the moment I would say I personally never felt my grades were inflated. I think that’s something everyone might say. I 'd say if there were any credence to the story it would have to do with departmental differences. In larger departments, students are more able to choose course work they’d be better at succeeding in. Economics, for instance, is one of the largest departments at Harvard. I studied visual and environmental studies which are much smaller departments.’ Harvard's grading policy was also criticized in 2001 but little has been done to curb inflation . Mr Mansfield believes that the grade inflation takes away merit from the University's most talented students. He told Boston.com that he actually awards students two separate grades: the one that will go on their transcript and the one that they 'deserve.' 'I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade,' he said, adding that administrators must be the ones to change the grading methods. Boston.com spoke to students who didn't necessarily recognize the grade inflation. 'I just find that hard to believe because it’s pretty hard to get an A in any class,' said Connor Mangan, 20, a junior neurobiology major. A Harvard economics major Seiste Goffard, 20 said,'I think it [grade inflation] definitely exists.' 'I think students and faculty, the data they have all point to the fact that it’s an issue here more than elsewhere,' she continued. This is actually not the first time Harvard went under fire for a lackadaisical grading policy. In 2001, John Stossel did a story for ABC on how grades, 'don't mean what they once meant' at Harvard. Mansfield was quoted as saying back then, 'To a give a student a C is like plunging a sword into his vitals.' Mansfield said he's been fighting the inflation battle for years--years before 2001. One student named Jimmy Davis told Stossel that he knew students who were awarded a B  or B- for doing less than 5 per cent of the coursework. Grading measures have drastically changed over the years at Harvard. In 1969, 25 per cent of students got C's and lower. Only 7 per cent got A's back then. In 2001 only 9 per cent got a C or lower and over 26 per cent got A's. One cheeky Harvard student told Stossel that perhaps students are smarter now than the Harvard students in the 1960s. Yale University wants to tackle its grade inflation problem but fears that toughening standards will sway students towards attending other schools . Is this Just a Harvard problem? Apparently not. Schools such as Princeton and Yale have openly discussed their schools' own grade inflation. Yale Daily News reported that last spring, Yale's ad hoc committee found that 62 per cent of Yale College grades between 2010 and 2012 were in A range. There was a similar grade inflation problem at Princeton. When the school took measures to implement a new policy, It wasn't an entirely positive outcome. Critics call Yale's attempts to lower grades, 'grade deflation.' The New York Times reports that when Princeton implemented a stricter grading policy to curb A's, less students applied/ enrolled in the school for fear that an overly competitive school (more so than equally regarded schools with more lenient grading policies) would hurt them in the future Job market . Princeton students reported that they were unhappy due to lower grades and fear that they will have trouble competing against Ivy League peers (at equally regarded schools) in the job market . In 2009, students in the A range at Princeton fell below 40 per cent. In 2010, 32 per cent of students said the grading policy was their top source of unhappiness followed by lack of sleep at 25 per cent. The dean of the undergraduate college at Princeton in 2010, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, said that the goal was to have no more than 35 per cent of grades in classes be in the A range. The Yale Daily New reports that ever since Princeton implemented the strict grading policies, Princeton's admissions yield dropped from 73.1 per cent for the class of 2007 to 68.7 to the class of 2013. When the Mail Online tried to contact several Ivy League schools about their mean and median grade point averegages, all of the schools said that they could not 'disclose that information.' Gradeinflation.com had some scattered data about grade inflation at Ivy League schools. Data was measured based on a scale of 4.0 being the highest--or an 'A'. The average G.P.A at Dartmouth in 1931 was 2.33. There was a dramatic increase over the years. In 2007 it went up to 3.42. At Columbia university the average G.P.A was 3.20 in 1982 and went up to 2.42 in 2006. Cornell saw an increase in G.P.A in more recent years.  In 1990 the average G.P.A. was 3.13 and in 2006 it went up to 3.36. Perhaps grade inflation is not a Harvard problem, but a problem of the current generation of college students at Ivy League Schools and beyond.","Government professor Harvey C.

Another large oil spill has hit Nigeria's already devastated Niger Delta region, killing precious mangrove swaps and wildlife. While the spill happened near ENI's Brass facility, the company says it has been unable to confirm the cause of this latest disaster. Many spills in the region are caused by pipe sabotage or theft from the pipelines, as many people live in poverty and try to cash in on the valuable natural resource. A large oil spill near ENI's Brass facility on the Niger Delta was reported on Monday, similar to this one which was caused by oil thieves in March . Oil spills are a recurring problem in the area, with precious mangrove swamps, home to some of the planet's rarest wildlife, being left blackened and dead as a result . While many spillages are the result of theft from the pipelines by a population which lives mostly in poverty, many of them are due to loading accidents and decrepit infrastructure . The problem has become so bad that Nigeria's Government is considering tough new laws to fine companies that are found to be responsible for the disasters . If passed the legislation could cause Western-owned companies to be fined hundreds of millions of dollars each year . However loading accidents, coupled with decrepit infrastructure, have also been found to be behind several, with companies usually forced to pay for a cleanup operation and for compensation to the locals affected. The Government is now considering passing laws which would impose harsher fines on those responsible, meaning many Western-owned businesses could incur fines totalling tens of millions of dollars every year. Vast stretches of the delta's unique mangrove swamps, home to some of the planet's rarest wildlife, are blackened and dead from oil pollution. At the moment companies found to be responsible are forced to pay for a cleanup operation and for compensation for any locals affected . Oil is the largest contributor to the economy in Africa's most populous nation but has been marred by corruption since the reserves were discovered in the 1950s . Those who live around the Delta rely on fishing for their main source of income, an industry badly damaged by the spills which wipe out life in the rivers . Royal Dutch Shell is the biggest operator in the region, followed by ENI. In 2000 their trade accounted for 98 per cent of all export revenue in Nigeria . According to the Huffington Post, ENI said in a statement: 'During loading operations on a tanker on Nov. 27, an oil spill in the sea was seen. Operations were immediately suspended and resumed only after it was verified that the vessel's structures were not damaged and were not leaking.' Francis Clinton Tubo Ikagi, chairman of the Odioama fishing community in Bayelsa, where a large part of the Niger river fans out through creeks into the Atlantic, told journalists on the scene that he saw a large oil slick on Nov. 20. 'I saw a very thick layer of crude oil on the river,' he said. 'The community is affected seriously. Our women and men whose main livelihood source is fishing are complaining bitterly to us that the whole river is full of oil.' Hi-lighting the extent of the theft, this illegal refinery was destroyed by the Joint Task Force at Nembe Creek in Niger Delta in March . In 2011, the Nigerian government said there had been more than 7,000 oil spills in the country between 1970 and 2000 that could take up to 30 years and $1billion to clean up. Fishing boats were abandoned on Bodo waterways which were polluted by spilled crude oil allegedly caused by Shell equipment failure in Ogoniland in 2010 . Corruption among Nigeria's politicians has meant that only a small amount of the profits made from oil have trickled down into the communities from which it is taken . Estimates of Nigeria's oil reserves make it around the tenth most oil-rich nation on Earth and the most affluent in Africa . In 2011, the Nigerian government said there had been more than 7,000 oil spills in the country between 1970 and 2000 that could take up to 30 years and $1billion to clean up. In Nigeria's Akwa Ibom State, an ExxonMobil pipeline ruptured on May 1 2010 and spilled over a million gallons of oil. The leak continued for seven days before it was stopped. In December 2011 there was another spill near the coast of Nigeria, and was was reported as 'likely the worst to hit those waters in a decade.' Here fluorescent trickles of oil can be seen in the main river while to the right, more devastation can be seen in the blackened forest . Shell was the first company to strike oil in Nigeria at Oloibiri and in 1958 began drilling. This is Shell's Awobo flow station in the Niger Delta . Nigeria has the highest concentration of mangrove forests in Africa, covering nearly 14,000sq miles, though many have been destroyed by the spills . Many communities, such as this one, are surrounded by rivers and are almost wholly dependent on them for survival, so are badly affected when oil spills occur . After two days, it had affected 115 miles (185 kilometers) of Nigerian coastline. Several days after the December 20 spill, Shell reported that the leak -- which occurred about 75 miles offshore -- had been contained before it reached the Nigerian coast. The spill, which covered 350 square miles of ocean at its peak, was reported as having released less than '40,000 barrels -- or 1.68 million gallons' of oil.","Another large oil spill was reported near an ENI facility in Nigeria yesterday .

This is the idyllic garden bridge that Londoners could one day be able to cross for a moment of calm in the heart of Europe's busiest city. The leafy walkway, packed with flower beds and trees, was first suggested by actress Joanna Lumley following Princess Diana's death as far back as 1997. But now a new public consultation has been launched meaning the bridge could open as soon as 2016, providing a new river crossing from Temple  to the South Bank. Groundbreaking: Consultation opened today for Londoners to give their say on 370-ft aerial oasis actress Joanna Lumley thought up in 1997 . To mark the occasion, a new image of the 370-ft landmark has been released for Londoners to have a look at.  The consultation will ask for verdicts on every little detail including the colour, the shape, the location, and whether dogs can be allowed on. It would be the first new crossing over the Thames since the 'wobbly' Millennium Bridge opened in 2002 and London's answer to New York's High Line, where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park. It would also give stunning views . along the river of St Paul's Cathedral and the City of London to the . east. With lauded architect Thomas Heatherwick CBE at the helm, famed for his Olympic cauldron for London 2012, everyone from George Osborne to New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have weighed in to show their support. According to Boris Johnson, it could . be the iconic piece of green infrastructure that he has been looking for . to give London a high-quality image. Designer . and Horticulturalist Dan Pearson, appointed to oversee the gardening . side of things, has also attracted interest from politicians and donors. According to the Garden Bridge Trust, the crossing will have trees, plants and even 'intimate walkways', as well as a direct link between the Southbank and Soho . Delighted: Artist Thomas Heatherwick (left), awarded a CBE after the Olympics,  has given weight to the proposal suggested 15 years ago by Joanna Lumley (right) The project, which is being developed with engineering firm Arup, will go ahead only if Heatherwick can raise money from private backers and will not receive public funds. A trust, set up to oversee the construction, is currently in the process of seeking charitable status, but private donors are said to have offered to foot almost half the bill already. Desperate to make sure the structure does . become a reality, Heatherwick has drawn up a specific time scale - . seeing construction start in 2015 and end, at the latest, in 2017. Plan: Desperate to make sure the structure becomes a reality, architect Thomas Hetherwick has a detailed time-scale that ends in 2017 at the latest . He told the Evening Standard: 'If people want the bridge to happen, then it has to happen now. 'Otherwise, it will just be one of those nice things that didn’t happen.' He adds that the flower meadow Danny Boyle created for the opening ceremony last year has further inspired the project. He told the Standard: 'What I thought was that of course the venues were impressive, and the Games amazing, but what I won’t forget is the wild planting. 'We are used to quite a harsh experience in the architectural landscape around us. Often environments don’t have a human scale, but plants give you that.

A Las Vegas-based animal charity is celebrating after recently sending its 1,000th rescue dog to Canada to start an exciting new life with pet lovers north of the border. The usual arrangement was the brainchild of Everett Croxson, who launched Foreclosed Upon Pets International (FUPI) after learning about a serious problem with unwanted pets in his native Las Vegas and at the same time a shortage of small dogs in Canada. Croxson launched the charity in 2008 in the midst of the foreclosure crisis when people were abandoning their animals as their homes were being foreclosed. Many owners turned their dogs out onto the streets, while others cruelly left them to die trapped inside their former homes. While Las Vegas suffers from an excess of unwanted pets, the situation is rather different in Canada where stricter rules require owners to spay and neuter their pets . Everett Croxson, right, launched Foreclosed Upon Pets International (FUPI) after learning about a serious problem with unwanted pets in his native Clark County, Las Vegas and a shortage of small dogs in Canada . The majority of evicted animal in Las Vegas end up at the Lied Animal Shelter, which claims to be the highest-volume single-site animal shelter in the country and takes in an average of 117 dogs and cats every day. While Las Vegas suffers from an excess of unwanted pets, the situation is rather different north of the border where stricter rules require owners to spay and neuter their pets. As a consequence, backyard and professional breeding do not exist to the same extent that they do in the United States. The ingenious idea of unwanted American dogs emigrating to . Canada started when one dog lover from Vancouver visited the Vegas . shelter and said that she wanted to help save the lives of as many of these poor, unwanted animals as she could. Some of the dogs rescued in the Clark County area of Las Vegas include Spunky the Poodle, left, and Max and Dolly, right . Pono, the dog on the left, a three-year-old male Pomeranian mix, was the 1,000th American dog to emigrate to Canada, here he is with his new family . She introduced Croxson to Richard Kaga, the executive vice president of Petcetera, a Canadian chain of pet stores. For the past two and a half years, FUPI has shipped between eight and 16 dogs every week to Canada, almost exclusively small dogs which are in short supply north of the border. 'For whatever reason, we have a shortage . of small dogs here, and to be quite honest, we were shocked at the size . of the problem in Las Vegas,' said Kaga. In September FUPI celebrated sending it . 1,000th dog north of the border, that special animal was Little Pono, a three-year-old male Pomeranian mix. Since the program started in 2010, . Croxson said he has exported as many as 1,100 small dogs, with nearly . three-fourths of them Chihuahuas, followed by terrier mixes, then . poodles. FUPI was launched in 2008 in the midst of the ecomonic crisis when people were abandoning their pets as their homes were being foreclosed . Other dogs available for adoption include Boots, left, a Shepherd Collie mix and Buddy, right, a chi mix . 'I consider Las Vegas the Chihuahua capital of the world,' Croxson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The dogs are flown to Vancouver, where they are then distributed by Petcetera for adoption through the chain's 18 big-box stores in places such as Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia. The rescue dogs are fostered by Petcetera until adopted to new homes that adhere to the FUPI adoption agreement. Owners paying $499 (U.S.) per dog. The money, says Croxson, helps cover the costs of the animals' transportation, spaying or neutering, shots, health certificate, plus their care and boarding at Petcetera. While the financial situation in the U.S. may have improved since the dark days of 2008, Las Vegas continues to have the second largest number of foreclosures in the U.S. and FUPI continues to send a steady steam of unwanted pets to start new lives in Canada. In 2011, the Lied Animal Shelter in Las Vegas took in 50,000 animals, while last year it was 43,000, while an average 65 animals every day are exterminated because they can't be found a loving home.

Wildlife workers in boats struggled Wednesday to coax nearly four dozen pilot whales out of dangerous shallow waters in Florida's Everglades National Park, hoping to spare them the fate of 10 others that already have died. Six of the whales were found dead, and four of the whales had to be euthanized Wednesday, said Blair Mase, coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's marine mammal stranding network. At least three could be seen on the beach, out of the water. The whales are stranded in a remote area near Highland Beach, the western boundary of Everglades National Park and about 20 miles east of where they normally live. Beached: Pilot whales are stranded on a beach in a remote area of the western portion of Everglades National Park, Florida. Federal officials said some whales have died. The marine mammals are known to normally inhabit deep water . No chance: A dead pilot whale lies near the beach in a remote area of Florida's Everglades National Park. Federal officials say 10 of the dozens of whales stranded in Florida's Everglades National Park are now dead . It takes more than an hour to reach the spot from the nearest boat ramp and there is no cellphone service, complicating rescue efforts. 'We want to set the expectation low, because the challenges are very, very difficult,' Mase said. Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said rescuers were trying to surround the whales, which were in roughly 3 feet of salt water about 75 feet from shore, and herd them back to sea. 'They are not cooperating,' Friar said. Tragic: Four of the whales had to be euthanized Wednesday, and six others already had died. Necropsies were being preformed this afternoon . In Danger: A frantic rescue operation has begun along a remote beach at Everglades National Park, where 51 whales have become trapped in the shallows and 10 have died . Workers also tried to nudge the whales out to sea earlier in the day with no success. The short-finned pilot whales typically live in very deep water. Even if rescuers were able to begin nudging the 41 remaining whales out to sea, Mase said they would encounter a series of sandbars and patches of shallow water along the way. This particular whale species is also known for its close-knit social groups, meaning if one whale gets stuck or stays behind, the others are likely to stay behind or even beach themselves as well. 'It would be very difficult for the whales to navigate out on their own,' Mase said. Federal officials were notified about the whales Tuesday around 4 p.m. Because of the remote location, workers were unable to access the site before dark. They arrived Wednesday morning and discovered 45 whales still alive. Officials in boats monitor the scene: The rescue strategy is to keep the whales alive during low tide and then use the rising waters of high tide to get the creatures to swim back to deeper, and safer waters. Six whales have been rescued so far . Miffed: For reasons not yet known, a pod of them penetrated the maze of shoals and sand flats on the Gulf side of the park, cutting themselves off from their usual habitat and food supply . 'There were some that were very compromised and in very poor condition,' Mase said. Four were euthanized with sedatives, and more could be put down Thursday if their condition deteriorates, Mase said. She described the remaining whales as swimming and mobile but said scientists don't know how long they have been out of the deep, colder water they are accustomed to and could be impacted by secondary consequences, such as dehydration. 'I don't think we have a lot of time,' Mase said. Necropsies were being done Wednesday on the deceased whales. Scientists will look for disease or other signs to indicate how whales got stuck in the shallow Everglades waters. As workers tried to coax the animals to deeper water, at least one could be seen a few feet from shore floating upside down with its head bobbing up and down. Three to four more could be seen on the beach bleeding. Grim: Officials are pessimistic about the prospects of the 41 that remain, saying they will try to herd them to freedom through a 20-mile labyrinth of sandbars and shallow water, but that it's very difficult, particularly in a remote spot . Twenty-two pilot whales became stranded in Florida's Avalon State Park in Fort Pierce in 2012. Residents, state and national officials attempted to rescue them, but only five could be saved. 'It's not uncommon,' Friar said. 'But it's not something that happens a lot.' Mase said NOAA was consulting with experts in different counties with experience in herding whales to see if there were other options, but said she was not optimistic. 'The outlook ultimately does not look good,' she said.","45 stranded whales may have to be euthanized .

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said she would close down a trouble-hit scheme worth millions of pounds . The British government accidentally gave £80,000 to the disgraced Zimbabwe regime in the last two years, ministers admitted today. International Development Secretary Justine Greening blamed ‘serious errors’ for the money going to Robert Mugabe’s government, in contravention of official UK policy. She has ordered a project to eradicate fruit flies to be shut down and will try to claw back £42million from a troubled funding scheme. Some of the money was directed to Zimbabwe's Ministry of Agriculture by a third party agency but was originally from British taxpayers. In a written statement to MPs, International Development Secretary Justine Greening blamed mistakes in planning and implementation under the last Labour government when it set up the TradeMark Southern Africa (TMSA) project. She said of a £67 million fund of UK aid money for the scheme, £42 million had never been spent and would now be reclaimed by the Treasury. And the project would be shut down, Ms Greening added. Outlining specific problems, Ms Greening said: ‘Weak governance also resulted in payments amounting to £80,000 via ring-fenced accounts held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Zimbabwe from 2011. ‘Although our investigations show this money was used appropriately and as intended for a fruit fly eradication project to promote trade and reduce poverty, this payment was in contravention of UK Government policy.’ The problems have been uncovered by the Department for International Development's (DFID) own audit department and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI). A DFID spokesman said the £80,000 was handed to Zimbabwe's Ministry of Agriculture by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, a partner with the TMSA project, which was given money by DFID. It is understood seven payments were made to the Ministry of Agriculture between July 2011 and May 2013. The UK government has a policy against aid money going to the Zimbabwe government of President Robert Mugabe . The UK Government funds a direct aid programme in Zimbabwe but does not channel funds through the government infrastructure in the country as a matter of policy. In her statement to MPs, Ms Greening said ‘serious flaws in the governance and programme management of the TMSA’ have been uncovered. ‘While we have found no evidence of fraud, these investigations have revealed a number of serious concerns including weakness in delivery, management, oversight and financial monitoring,’ she said. Ms Greening said the whole point of ICAI was to identify problems and ensure they were dealt with. And she pledged to MPs: ‘I am fully prepared to stop funding to programmes that do not offer value for money or that fail to achieve their objectives. ‘I have given notice to commence shutting down TMSA with immediate effect. ‘In parallel, DFID is exploring alternative, more effective mechanisms to support the important steps being taken in the region to drive trade and regional integration.’ Internal audits at DFID will be strengthened, Ms Greening said, to enhance a ‘risk-based approach’.","Ministers admit money was given to Robert Mugabe's regime .

Inquiry chief Judge Peter Smithwick said he was 'satisfied there was collusion in the murders' As well as confirming long-held suspicions of the IRA mole in Dundalk, the judge accused Garda chiefs of trying to undermine a retired superintendent who testified that he passed intelligence on the Buchanan death threat to the highest ranks. ‘The integrity of and confidence in An Garda Siochana can properly be maintained only if suggestions of inappropriate or illegal conduct by members are taken seriously, transparently and thoroughly investigated and, above all, not tolerated or ignored on the basis of some misguided sense of loyalty to the force or to its members,’ he said. William Buchanan, son of the murdered RUC officer, said it was incredible and shocking to think his father had effectively been set up to be murdered. The Breen family said their respected RUC husband and father had been betrayed by his police counterparts in the Republic. Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore, Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister, apologised to the families and said the country must confront the grave findings. ‘I am appalled and saddened by this finding. It is a matter of grave public concern,’ he said. Unionist politicians said the tribunal will have major implications for how the past is dealt with while Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she would raise the findings with the Irish Government.","Judge Peter Smithwick said he was ‘satisfied there was collusion'

Men's emotions are stirred more by the sight of a beautiful car than a crying baby, according to state-of-the-art brainwave analysis. But women are clearly governed by maternal rather than motoring instincts as their emotional response to the wail of an infant was found to be double that of the brain activity observed when looking at a car, the study revealed. The research shows that men are 'genetically programmed' to drool over a flash motor, said car giant Volvo, who commissioned the tests. Stirring: Men's emotions are affected more by flash cars than crying babies, according to a study published on Thursday . Some may argue that the test results are self-serving for Volvo, but sophisticated technology was involved in the study, with both men and women being wired up to specialist machines that monitor the electrical impulses in the brain. The impulses indicate the brain's emotional responses - the stronger the impulses, the greater the emotions being felt. The volunteers were then shown visual images of cars considered to be plain, ugly or beautiful – they included a futuristic Volvo prototype, not the functional saloons the maker is famous for - 1950s models and Robin Reliants. They were also shown photos of men and women and crying babies. Female feelings: Women reacted strongest to the image of a baby . It found the strongest brain impulses among men was to a picture of a beautiful woman, followed by that of a curvy 'concept' coupe with a crying baby picture down in third. Women, however, reacted strongest to the image of a baby and then to the picture of an attractive man more than any feelings towards a beautiful motor. Volvo, which claims the experiment to be the first of its kind, said it shows how the design of a car and evoke powerful feelings 'on a par with the most basic of human emotions'. The Swedish company said it was trying to design models that would build an 'emotive connection' with owners. In a separate survey of 2,000 adults, four in ten (43 per cent) men said the design of a car was more important than added extras or the feel of the interior. Volvo design chief Thomas Ingenlath said: ‘This survey finally proves what we've always suspected. ‘Beautiful car design can elicit strong emotional responses ranging from a positive frame of mind to a sense of empowerment.’ Neuroscientist Dr David Lewis said: ‘Appreciating an aesthetically pleasing design is an experience which combines understanding and emotions. ‘These are so closely intertwined that it is impossible to distinguish between them. ‘Aesthetic experience involves a unity of sensuous delight, meaningful interpretation, and emotional involvement.’","Volunteers had their brainwaves analysed in a test commissioned by Volvo .

Mary Riggans, who played Suzie Sweet in Balamory (pictured) and Effie Macinnes in Take The High Road, has died . Take The High Road and Balamory actress Mary Riggans has died at the age of 78. The Sony Award-winning actress died peacefully in her sleep on Monday. She was best known for her role as Effie Macinnes in the STV soap opera Take The High Road, in which she starred from the early 1980s until the last episode in 2003. Riggans also played Suzie Sweet in the BBC children’s programme Balamory from 2002 to 2005 and appeared in other television shows such as Rab C Nesbitt and Taggart. Her death was confirmed by Martin Hunt, a friend and spokesman for the family. 'She died peacefully holding her daughter’s hand at 4.40pm on December 2, 2013,' he said. Riggans had a stroke in April last year, which left her with speech and movement difficulties. Her first acting role was in 1946, a radio voiceover at the age of 10 and her first TV role came in 1954 in the TV movie A Nest Of Singing Birds. The Glasgow University arts graduate then went on to star in many TV, radio and theatre productions. In 1983 she won a Sony Award for her radio acting in a performance as Jean Armour in Till A’ The Seas Run Dry. Riggans is survived by her daughter Samantha and a grandson. Actress Julie Wilson who played Ms Hoolie in the children's programme (centre in green) said Riggans (second right) was 'a brilliant actress' who will be remembered 'fondly' Bobby Hain, director of channels at STV, said: 'We are very sorry to hear of the passing of Mary Riggans who was a much-loved actress and a popular cast member of Take The High Road. 'Take The High Road remains one of the longest-running drama series in the UK and Mary played a key part in its success.' Actress Julie Wilson Nimmo, best known for playing Miss Hoolie in Balamory, said: 'I’m shocked and saddened to hear about Mary’s passing. We worked together for years.

"By . Antonia Hoyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:02 EST, 21 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:04 EST, 22 August 2013 . Suzanne Morris off to sleep at 2am as her tiny two-month-old son George lay beside her. With him snuggled between Suzanne and her husband David, the fledgling family seemed the picture of contentment. But a couple of hours later Suzanne awoke with a start and realised George was no longer by her side. Her shock had turned to panic by the time she discovered him under the duvet at the bottom of her and David's marital bed. 'He'd either wriggled there or we had pushed him down in our sleep,' says Suzanne. 'I get a cold sweat when I think about it. George could have been smothered. He was sound asleep and it was just a lucky coincidence I woke up. Who knows what could have happened? He could have died and become a statistic.' Dangerous bonding: Babies can be squashed or suffocated if they sleep in the same bed as their parents (posed by models) The statistic to which Suzanne refers is the number of babies who die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) each year. They were given a disturbing new focus recently when researchers revealed that babies who share a bed with their mothers are up to five times more likely to die than those who sleep separately. SIDS - the sudden and unexplained death of a child under the age of one - kills 300 babies a year in Britain. It has been long known that premature babies and those with breathing and heart problems are more susceptible, while parents who smoke, take drugs or drink to excess are known to put their baby at risk. But it now transpires that even the most diligent mothers, like Suzanne, are also jeopardising their baby’s safety by co-sleeping. 'Babies have been squashed or wriggled under the duvet and can die from being overheated' The comprehensive review - compiled with data from five previous studies and after examining nearly 1,500 cases of SIDS - revealed that an estimated 88 per cent of deaths that occurred while a child slept with their parents would not have happened if the baby had not been bed-sharing. 'Deep down, I suppose we knew it was risky,' says Suzanne, 40. 'It wasn't a choice to co-sleep that night. We were just so tired. I was absolutely mortified and still am.' An adult bed can be a dangerous environment for a baby, as Alison Edwards, a senior lecturer in midwifery at Birmingham City University, explains: 'Babies have been squashed or wriggled under the duvet and can die from being overheated.' Yet 50 per cent of all mothers share a bed with their baby at some stage, despite Department of Health guidelines urging them to place an infant in its own cot for the first six months. Risk: Half of all mothers share a bed with their baby at some stage, despite Department of Health guidelines urging them to place an infant in its own cot for the first six months . This is, perhaps, due to the popularity of trendy 'attachment parenting', as espoused by psychologists such as Penelope Leach and celebrity mothers from Angelina Jolie to Heidi Klum. It encourages mothers to feed their babies on demand and never let them out of their sight. The 'breastapo' also has a case to answer: pressure on women to breastfeed has led to a huge rise in co-sleeping, with 80 per cent of mothers succumbing to it. Because breast milk is easier to digest than formula, babies grow hungrier faster and need to be fed more often than their bottle-fed peers. Many mothers feel the only way they can get any sleep at all is to keep their child by their side. Suzanne, an event manager, who lives with David, 42, a chartered surveyor, and George, now seven, and Ruby, four, in Hove, East Sussex, admits that's what happened to her. 'I was desperate to breastfeed and was advised by my parenting class to keep George on my breast non-stop to get feeding established,' she says. 'When I think of what could have happened I feel sick. I now fully appreciate how dangerous co-sleeping can be' 'But he never got enough milk. I was feeding every two hours. I would never have slept.' George was given a bottle and his own cot in their room, but Suzanne is still haunted by the incident. 'When I think of what could have happened I feel sick. I now fully appreciate how dangerous co-sleeping can be.' Yet plenty of professional bodies still promote its benefits. Rosemary Dodds, senior policy advisor at the National Childbirth Trust, insists the organisation does not advise new parents on whether to sleep with their baby, but adds: 'We are aware of the advantages of bed sharing for a baby in terms of reassurance and establishing breastfeeding. 'For parents it works very well because they get more sleep. Historically and culturally babies have slept close to their parents.' Certainly, until the advent of the cot in the 19th century, co-sleeping in Western society was de rigueur. Parenting expert Sarah Ockwell-Smith, author of BabyCalm, insists that co-sleeping poses no added risk if planned properly. 'It is the most common way of sleeping in Japan and they have the lowest SIDS rate in the world,' she says, claiming that mothers instinctively form a protective 'frame' around their baby with their body. But Ockwell-Smith admits there are caveats. Babies should always be put in sleeping bags above, never under, parents' duvets. Three's a crowd: Sleeping with your baby can drive a wedge between couples . They should sleep on their mother's side of the bed, as research shows fathers are less attuned to their child's movements and more likely to roll on top of them. And formula-fed babies - without the immunity-boosting properties of breast milk - should not co-sleep at all as studies have shown them to be at a higher risk of SIDS in the first place. Professor Helen Ball, who runs the Parent-Infant Sleep Lab at Durham University, says she has also discovered that breastfeeding mothers instinctively position their babies more safely in their bed than those who have never breastfed. 'Mothers who have only bottle fed place their baby up near their face, rather than at their chest, so they are on the pillow and at risk of suffocation,' she says. 'Your partner will start to feel left out if you have a little person with you 24 hours a day. There is never time to be a couple' Some co-sleep for the feeling of closeness as much as to facilitate breastfeeding. 'The increased skin-on-skin contact releases a hormone called oxytocin that promotes bonding,' says Ockwell-Smith. Kate Kirrane, 40, a company director from London, co-slept with her daughter Iyla, now three, after her birth in September 2009 until her son Isaac, now 18 months, was born in February last year. Now he still sleeps with Mum if teething or fretful. 'It feels unnatural not to,' says Kate. 'He wants to be close to me - why would I deprive him of that?' She says health visitors and midwives were already aware of the dangers at the time she gave birth. 'It was rammed down my throat I shouldn't do it but I have always been mindful of safety and my natural instinct won over,' she says. 'It is wrong that mothers are made to feel guilty.' And what of the husbands in this arrangement? Co-sleeping inevitably creates an added barrier to spousal relations which are often already strained by a newborn. Kate admits that there were times when her husband Michael, 43, a company manager, 'put his foot down'. 'But at the end of the day it’s not him getting up in the night, is it?' She claims co-sleeping has had little impact on their romantic life, however. 'I sleep better this way so I'm happier, which means I'm a better mother and wife.' But maternity nurse Rachel Waddilove, author of Sleep Solutions, is adamant co-sleeping has a ruinous effect on a relationship: 'Your partner might enjoy it for the first few days but he will start to feel left out if you have a little person with you 24 hours a day. There is never time to be a couple.' Attachment parenting advocates as much skin-on-skin contact as possible . Colette Burgess couldn't agree more. She and her husband Dave, a welder, agreed long before their son Ben was born in July 2009 and daughter Chloe came along two years later that there was no place in their family for co-sleeping. 'I adore my children but don't want to spend every waking moment with them,' she says. 'Our bedroom is the only place we can get away. There is barely enough room for two of us without a baby in the middle.' Ben and Chloe both slept in a cot at the bottom of the bed before moving into their own rooms at four and eight months respectively. Colette, 33, breastfed each for eight months and says that the safety implications of co-sleeping worried her almost as much as the invasion of her marital privacy. 'I'd go downstairs to feed so I didn't risk falling asleep on our bed,' she says. 'I was paranoid about suffocating them and no matter how tired I was I'd never feed lying down.' Colette, a primary school teacher from Manchester, was brought up by her own parents never to enter their room and is now training Ben and Chloe to do the same. The upshot is that neither wakes in the night, she adds. 'I have friends who have co-slept and their children are now six and still getting into their bed. At what point do you draw the line and say they need to sleep on their own?' It is a controversial question. But based on the latest scientific findings, it seems that sooner would be infinitely safer than later.","Babies who share a bed with their mothers are up to five times more likely to suffer Sudden Infant Death Syndrome .

Outraged child advocates are blasting NORAD's new 3D Santa Tracker program because it includes a fighter jet escort for jolly old Saint Nick. Some say the new online portrait could give kids the wrong impression about Santa Claus - associating him with the military and violence. But Pentagon officials argue the North American Aerospace Defense Command is a military organization - its purpose is to track incursions of the airspace over the U.S. and Canada - and the inclusion of fighter jets into Santa's new digital flight across the world is a nod to NORAD's true mission. Scroll down for video . Missile-toe: Santa's sled is escorted by a pair of fighter jets in this still image taken from a NORAD animated video . Josh Golin, associate director of the . Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, says the new . campaign is ‘reprehensible’ since it played on children's fears by . suggesting that Santa Claus was vulnerable to attack. ‘It's a backdoor way of marketing to kids when they are not supposed to be recruiting until they are much older,’ he said. Allen Kanner, a child psychologist with the same group, told the Boston Globe: 'Children associate Santa with gifts and fun and everything else that is positive about Christmas. 'They are associating this with the military in children’s minds. It is completely out of line.' Amy Hagopian, a professor of public health at the University of Washington, told the newspaper: 'If the military wants to keep its ranks stocked, it needs to appeal to children. The military knows it can’t appeal to adults to volunteer. It is like the ad industry.' The program sponsored by NORAD drew . 22.3 million visitors last year and generated 114,000 phone calls from . around the U.S. The . 2013 video shows Santa – call sign ‘Big Red One’ - guided by Rudolph . the Red-Nosed Reindeer, zooming over snowy mountains with two warplanes . on either side. ‘It's still cutesy since it's for . kids, but we don't want people to lose sight of our true mission,’ Jeff .

Operation Santa: A video on the NORAD website shows military personnel seemingly preparing for a test flight by Santa . In the NORAD video showcasing the preparations for Santa's flight, Old St Nick has been assigned the call sign 'Big Red One' Davis said NORAD videos had linked fighter escorts and Santa since the 1960s, but 2013 marked the first time the planes had been shown in an animated version. A video on the NORAD website shows military personnel seemingly preparing for a test flight by Santa, also known as ‘Big Red One.’ ‘We all know that Santa travels faster than starlight,’ an officer says in the video, 'but this is nothing that our technologies can't handle.’ The addition of the fighter jets is not the only new twist for NORAD’s holiday-themed mission this year. The agency has teamed up with Microsoft to redesign its Santa Track website, which went live Sunday. The high-tech website comes with all the latest bells and whistles, including a 3D globe, a holiday countdown and interactive games. The redesign team has added a touch function to the site, allowing smartphone users to pinch and zoom in on Santa’s destinations, according to Microsoft. Google will be offering its competing Google Maps Santa Tracker, which made its debut last year. It all started in 1955 when a local media advertisement directed children to call Santa direct – only the number was misprinted. Instead of reaching Santa, the phone rang through to the Crew Commander on duty at the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center.  Thus began the tradition which NORAD carried on since it was created in 1958.

Initiative: Italian computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report Mafia activity . Italian computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report Mafia activity. The new site, Mafialeaks, will encourage victims, or even former mobsters, to relay information to police, anti-mafia magistrates and journalists without fear of reprisal. Mafialeaks is aimed at people such as shopkeepers or business owners forced to pay protection money, as well as members of the public who have uncovered mafia activity and former criminals who want to spill the beans on their bosses or partners. Based on the Wikileaks website, information provided to the site is directed through an anonymous coded network, to protect the identity of informants, and is then passed on to sources such as the police. The volunteers behind the new site have also kept their own identities a secret in order to protect themselves against any possible retaliation from those exposed by Mafialeaks. 'There are fewer than 10 of us, with families,' one of those behind the operation told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. 'Everything we do to do with Mafialeaks we do after work, using money from our own pockets.' A message on the website, which was down in 'maintenance mode' today, proclaimed that the purpose of the site was to collect information on mafia activity directly, with words in English reading 'if you know something, say something'. The site is accessible to anyone, with informants making their anonymous reports to 'receivers'. Site users are directed to one of three categories - 'whistleblowers', for those inside the mafia clans, 'victims', and 'know something', for those who have become aware mafia activity. They are encouraged to provide documentation of their claims, such as photographs, audio clips and other data. The information is then sent on to 'trusted persons', who will receive an alert that it has been posted. It is hoped that the list of trusted persons will include prominent law enforcement officers, journalists and anti-mafia campaigners. Volunteers hope that the site could provide information such as the location of Mafia bosses in hiding, or those behing extortion rackets. Origins: The Sicilian Mafia emerged in the 19th century, with activity prevalent in more prosperous areas such as the capital Palermo . However, there have been fears raised that the site could be abused by those involved in organised crime, and that mafioso themselves could deliberately give false information to confuse investigators. Magistrate Nicola Gratteri told La Repubblica: 'Mafialeaks could be a good way of spreading a certain type of information and shattering the wall of silence.' However, he also said it could be used to mask 'desires for vengeance'. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections.","New site will encourage victims and former criminals to come forward .

An Avon Lady and her husband who quit their jobs and started selling cosmetics to pay off their debts are now living a luxury lifestyle with an income of £125,000-a-year. Nadine Rowlands, 44, first started selling Avon make-up to her friends and family as a means to pay off her £30,000 debts. However, after leaving her role as a legal secretary to sell the firm's cosmetics full-time, and convincing her husband Wayne to do the same, she is now Avon's top saleswoman with the pair earning almost as much as the Prime Minister. A pretty penny: After quitting their jobs to work for Avon, husband and wife Wayne and Nadine Rowlands make £125,000-a-year and have bought this Jaguar XK - complete with personalised number plate . When Mrs Rowlands, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, started selling door-to-door in 1996 she could not even afford to buy the products she was selling. She and Mr Rowlands, 54, were living in as cramped rented attic room, and struggling to pay off debts, let alone save enough money for a deposit on a house. However, Mrs Rowlands decided her only option was to throw everything into her new business venture, quitting her £20,000-a-year job at a law firm eight years ago so she could commit all her time to selling for Avon. Avon Calling: Mrs Rowlands is now the company's top saleswoman, but says she still enjoys visiting customers door-to-door . She said: 'I was clutching at straws, and we were really desperate to pay off our debt and be able to afford a deposit to buy our own house. 'The first few months were tough, but I knew in my gut I was going to be successful. 'I was earning about £20,000 a year as a legal secretary, and Wayne about £28,000 as an engineer - but we really threw everything into the business. 'Our family and friends thought we were mad. 'Secretly I think they were worried that everything was going to come crashing down again, but we knew it was the right thing to do and we took a leap of faith.' Her decision paid off, and now the award-winning sales leader, manages 1700 representatives across the UK, although she still enjoys visiting customers door-to-door. Through working for Avon, Mr and Mrs Rowlands have paid for an extension to their home, bought a Jaguar XK, complete with registration plate 'AV04 REP' and go on regular holidays abroad, including to the Algarve in Portugal. Mrs Rowlands success story mirrors that of a fellow Avon rep, Jeanette Stewart, 34, from County Durham, who now has an annual turnover of £1million, after taking up selling make-up to pay of a credit card debt of £60,000. Single mother Gail Reynolds, another Avon Lady, built a £5.5million empire through selling cosmetics in her hometown of Weymouth, Dorset, while Rebekah Testar, from Burbage Leicestershire, has sold more than £4million worth of make-up. Self-confessed workaholic Mrs Rowlands says that the healthy bank balance comes does come at a price and says she still works until 11pm most evenings. She said said: 'Before I started Avon, I hadn’t been on an holiday abroad for more than 14 years. 'But now, it’s not uncommon for me to be lying on the beach with a cocktail answering my work emails. Team effort: Mr and Mrs Rowlands were living in a cramped rented attic room when they started selling products for the cosmetics firm, only to become two of Avon's most successful sales reps . 'When I used to work full time and do Avon in my spare time, many of nights would I spend knocking doors, talking to people and I saw them as my friends not just customers. 'Not a lot has changed, I still do my rounds but extra duties like training other budding representatives also fall under my sales leader role, and I embrace every new challenge that comes my way. 'Some people ask us how we’ve done it and want a slice of the high life, but the truth is me and Wayne have worked hard to get where we are now, it didn’t just happen overnight and I wouldn’t have it any other way.'

The Georgia man who shot dead a 72-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer may not be charged if he pleads self defense under the controversial 'Zimmerman law'. The provision, which states that a person has 'no duty to retreat' when faced by an assailant, came under global scrutiny this year after Miami community watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot dead teenager Trayvon Martin and walked free after claiming he had the right to stand his ground. The Georgia version of the law could be used in the case of Joe Hendrix, 34, who shot at Air Force veteran Ronald Westbrook, 72, after the elderly dementia sufferer tried to enter his home at 4am. Mr Westbrook was said to have been wandering around in the cold for hours with his two dogs. He was stopped by a police officer who asked him why he was out at 2am, two hours before the shooting. Mr Westbrook is said to have told the officer he was picking up his mail. But after the officer left, the unwell veteran continued to walk around. Eventually he headed towards the home of Mr Hendrix, who had only moved into the area days earlier. After the shooting which followed, one of Mr Westbrook's dogs laid down on its owners body and had to be pulled away by officers who arrived at the scene. In the southeastern state, the law reserves the right for a member of the public to take pre-emptive action if they feel their life is threatened. Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson told Fox News he believed Mr Hendrix did feel threatened and that the state's Stand Your Ground law may apply. Under the law, a person is permitted to use force if they feel they are under physical threat. They do not have to retreat, even if backing down is a possibility. Crime scene: Ronald Westbrook wandered into the yard of this Georgia home . Confused: Ronald Westbrook, who had Alzheimer's, may have walked to the Georgia house because the porch light was on . Mr Westbrook, who was married and had . three children, knocked on the door of the rented house Mr Hendrix and . his fiancee had moved to only two weeks ago. 'He . had traveled about 2.6 miles from his home to the shooting location by . foot with a wind chill of about 20 degrees, very loosely clothed with . his two dogs,' Sheriff Wilson told WRCB TV. As . Mr Hendrix called out commands Mr Westbrook, who talked slowly, . continued to walk towards him, The Times Free Press reported. When he failed to get a response, Mr Hendrix then fired his handgun four times, killing Mr Westbrook. A post-mortem examination is due to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, tomorrow, and the circuit district attorney could bring charges after reviewing the evidence. 'Mr Hendrix is clearly saddened and . heartbroken. Mr Hendrix has to live with his . actions for the rest of his life,' Sheriff Wilson said. He added: 'In my personal opinion, I believe that . he should have stayed inside the house. Did he violate any . laws by exiting the house? No.' George Zimmerman, above, used the Florida version of the 'stand you ground' law after he was charged with the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin last year . Mr Westbrook, who was wearing a straw hat and light jacket when he was shot, had been stopped by police a few hours before after being spotted standing at a mailbox close to where he used to live.

Admission: Joe Biden admitted America is 'deeply concerned ' about Beijing's exclusion zone in the East China Sea . America is 'deeply concerned ' about Japan and China's territorial row in the East China Sea U.S. Vice President Joe Biden admitted during a talk in Tokyo today. Biden, who is at the start of a three-nation tour of Asia, said he will be talking 'in great specificity' with Chinese leaders about Beijing's sudden declaration last month of an air defence zone, including over islands disputed with Japan. 'We, the United States, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea,' Biden told reporters in a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 'This action has raised regional tension and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculations.' Tensions in the region are at their highest in years, with China and Japan squaring off over a chain of uninhabited islands in a feud that has some observers warning of the danger of an armed confrontation. The US, bound to Tokyo by a security treaty, is looking on alarmed at the growing chances of limited hostilities between the world's second largest economy and Washington's chief ally in the Asia-Pacific. Observers say rising China, buoyed by its surging economy, is becoming more confident and the dispute with Japan is part of a larger effort to stamp its authority on a region long dominated by the US. Nerves are particularly frayed after Beijing's proclamation of an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), in which it says all aircraft must obey its instructions or risk unspecified 'defensive emergency measures'. Scroll down for video . Concern: 'We, the United States, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea,' Biden told reporters in a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe . The move was flatly rejected by the governments of the US, Japan and South Korea. 'This underscores the need for crisis management mechanisms and effective channels of communication between China and Japan to reduce risk of escalation,' Biden told reporters. 'I will be raising these concerns in great specificity directly when I meet with the Chinese leadership the day after tomorrow,' he said. And he vowed that the United States, which has a security treaty that compels it to come to Japan's aid if it is attacked militarily, would stand by its ally. 'We will remain steadfast in our alliance's commitment,' he said. Abe has been looking for robust backing over his position that Beijing is being unreasonable and aggressive.

'We... confirmed that we should not tolerate the attempt by China to change the status quo unilaterally by force and we will continue to work closely in dealing with the situation based on the strong US-Japan alliance,' the Japanese premier said. 'We reaffirmed that policies and measures, including those on operation of Self Defense Forces (Japan's military) and US forces, are not changed and that we will maintain close cooperation.' Beijing's announcement of the ADIZ also provoked anger in Seoul, which, like Tokyo and Washington sent official planes into the zone without notifying China. The shared reaction in Japan and South Korea marked a rare moment of harmony in a relationship marked by friction over shared history that hobbles US attempts to bring its two chief regional allies together.

'We believe that Northeast Asia will be strongest when its two leading democracies work together to meet common threats, and when the three of us - the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea - work together to advance common interests and values,' Biden told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper ahead of his trip. Some analysts believe the declaration of the zone was a far-sighted move by Beijing in its campaign to undermine Japan's claims to control disputed islands, and ultimately, push the US out of the western Pacific. Others, however, say it looked more like an over-reach by an administration that did not fully anticipate the vehemence of the reaction.

'Washington does not want to take the risk of damaging its bilateral ties with China,' he said.'Biden will deliver the message to the Chinese side but may also seek to play a role in mediating,' he added.

A group of mothers in wealthy Beverley Hills, California, is trying to change the perception that drugs and parenting don't mix. These 'marijuana moms' meet regularly for lavish cannabis-infused dinners. Many of them smoke marijuana several times a day to relax and cope with chronic pain. They say the drug, which is legal with a prescription in the state of California, makes them better parents and better wives. Many of the women in the group are married. Most have young children. Some are wealthy stay-at-home mothers. Others work part-time as bartenders or in the service industry. One is the wife of a police officer. Scroll down for video!

'We've all come up against people who say marijuana is for dirty druggies, but we are proof you can be good parents and productive members of society and use it,' Cheryl Shuman, a 53-year-old mother of two, said. 'I like to think we are bringing some glamor and exclusivity to marijuana use.' She compared ingesting marijuana on a regular basis to mothers in the 1960s who took 'mother's little helper' pills - Valium - to help them cope with the daily strains of motherhood and running a household. 'Taking marijuana is just the same, it helps us get through the day,' she said. Shuman . throws marijuana-themed dinners every month for her friends, most of . whom are mothers with children.

Doing it right: Cheryl Schuman, 53, poses with chef David Schanhals, who has hired to help put together marijuana-themed dinners at her home in Beverly Hills, California . Schuman hopes to turn her dinner parties into a business if recreational marijuana use if legalized. Currently, California law only allows people with a prescription to use the drug . Marijuana has been decriminalized since 1975, when the state legislature passed a bill making the possession of the drug a $100 civil fine - not an arrestable offense. In 1996, California voters passed a bill that legalized marijuana possession for medical purposes. Doctors are allowed to prescribe the drug to anyone with certain chronic medical conditions. Californians with a prescription can obtain an ID card that allowed the poses, grown and consume the drug. Fifty-five percent of voters approved the measure at the time. However, voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. A 2010 ballot proposition that would have legalized all possession of one ounce of marijuana or less for adults age 21 and over. It would also have allowed for the establishment of marijuana cafes and other businesses. The measure failed 54percent to 46percent. Federal law still prohibits the possession and use of marijuana - despite state laws allowing it. Federal agents have raided marijuana dispensaries and growing operations that are legal under California state law. After the meal, the women gather to sample new strains of marijuana and smoke together. January Thomas, 37, says she smokes marijuana five times a day while she looks after her two-year-old daughter Zenna. She said the drug has become such an important part of her life that she has started to teach her daughter about it. 'Marijuana makes me a better and more creative parent. It puts me in the moment with Zeena and stops me worrying about everyday problems,' she said. 'I want her to understand the benefits of cannabis so I read her books like 'Mommy's Funny Medicine' and 'It's Just a Plant' to teach her.'

But Townsend tweeted on Thursday morning to insist that 'no offence' had been meant by Hodgson or taken by him. Apology: England manager Roy Hodgson has apologised for making a joke about a monkey during the team's World Cup qualifier against Poland on Tuesday night . Nonplussed: Andros Townsend tweeted to say there was no offence meant or taken . Defence: Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to stand up for Hodgson . A series of video stills which show Townsend emerging from the tunnel for the second half . Good show: Townsend put in a good performance against Montenegro before he was substituted .

England’s head coach is believed to have . upset an unnamed player in the dressing room during the 2-0 win over Poland that . secured England’s World Cup place. The FA have confirmed that Hodgson did . make the remarks, but are disappointed that it has been interpreted by . some as a racial slur or innuendo. Hodgson said on Wednesday night: ‘I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. ‘There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. ‘I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. ‘He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.’ VIDEO: Watch the players emerge from the tunnel at half-time . Clash: The joke came in a half-time team-talk during the crunch game at Wembley Stadium . The joke, which is believed to have been told in full at half-time, is as follows. ‘NASA decided they would finally send a man up in an capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions. ‘They fire the man and the monkey into space.’ ‘The intercom crackles “fire the retros”. ‘A little later, “Monkey, check the solid fuel supply’ ‘Later still “Monkey, check the life support systems for the man”. ‘The astronaut takes umbrage and radios NASA. “When do I get something”.’ ‘NASA replied – in 15 minutes, feed the monkey.’ England’s head coach is furious and . insists it was an analogy about NASA sending a monkey into space and . cannot be interpreted in any other way. Townsend has been spoken to by the FA and insists he has no issue with the joke. His father Troy works for the Kick It Out campaign and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son. Hodgson is understood to be distraught . by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading England to . the World Cup finals on Tuesday. Although he is known for lengthy team . talks to his players at times, Hodgson’s decision to make an attempt to . tell a joke at the break does seem unusual. The 66-year-old is a man of . vast experience but is dealing with a much younger dressing-room in a . modern climate. Success: The England team secured their passage to next year's World Cup in Brazil by the 2-0 victory . Goalscorer Wayne Rooney jumped to . Hodgson's defence on Thursday morning, he tweeted: 'Seen the story on . roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.' West Ham boss Sam Allardyce did not think that it was an issue. He said: We are a politically correct country and we have to be careful about what we say today. But if we continue to wipe it up and promote everything in the press, nobody will be able to say a word shortly. 'We'll have to keep ourselves quiet and not express opinions. We shouldn't be saying anything wrong but you have to be very careful today. I'm sure with what Roy said he didn't mean any offence or any harm.' Former England international Stan Collymore, meanwhile, insisted the joke makes no reference to race. 'If Roy has said that phrase in the dressing room then it is in the context of the story,' he told talkSPORT. 'People . are walking on egg shells, worried about everything they say. Why would . the word ""monkey"" have a racist feel for someone in the dressing room, . or any player? I can’t see the link, can you? 'We’ve . all got the right to feel offence, but this is really spurious. What . are you actually offended by? The word ""monkey""? I don’t see any . reference to race. You have to look at the big picture. 'Is . Roy Hodgson, from what we know of him over the last 30-40 years, the . sort of man to go out of his way to be stupid enough to cause offence? I . would say no.' Star: The remark came as Hodgson urged players to pass to up-and-coming star Townsend . The row has taken the gloss off . England’s qualification and came as it was revealed that Hodgson is in . line for a huge bonus after leading England to Brazil. If he is successful next summer, the . cash reward he will receive could touch the £1million mark. Hodgson . accepted a basic package worth £3m a year when he was released by West . Bromwich Albion to take the team to Euro 2012 following Fabio Capello’s . exit. His salary is less than half the .

Colorado's ski resorts are taking the offensive in ensuring the multi-billion-dollar-a-year industry isn't hurt by recreational marijuana stores that are set to open at about the same time many families begin planning their winter vacations . For some skiers and snowboarders, hitting the slopes with a joint or pipe tucked into a winter coat has long been commonplace. But with the stores set to open Jan. 1 near resorts across the state - and a handful of companies offering cannabis-themed ski trips - the future is a bit hazy. Will a pot tourism industry flourish or will families decide to go to resorts in states where marijuana is outlawed? Slippery slope: New pot laws, which were passed last year legalize marijuana possession in small amounts for adults over 21, including out-of-state visitors . For an industry already worrying about global warming, avalanches or simply a bad snow season, the stakes are high. Jennifer . Rudolph of Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade association that . represents 21 resorts in the state, says the ski industry generates . about $3 billion in tourism revenue annually and Colorado had more than . 11 million skier visits last year, more than any other state. 'We are being proactive in educating the public in what to expect when they come to Colorado to ski,' she said. She . added: 'We're getting the word out that we have a lot of things to . offer guests, but smoking marijuana is not one of them. ... We have so . much to offer our guests that outweigh the legality of possession of . marijuana.' Skiing and smoking don't mix: Ski industry officials note that it's still illegal to smoke marijuana in public and on federal land, where 90 percent of Colorado's ski resorts are located . Rudolph says her organization is informing visitors through social media and its blog about the new pot laws, which were passed last year and legalize marijuana possession in small amounts for adults over 21, including out-of-state visitors. Some resorts also are addressing the issue with their respective towns and chambers of commerce. Rudolph said she hasn't heard of anyone deciding not to come to Colorado because of the new pot laws, and it's too early to tell what resorts can expect to see after Jan. 1. 'That's why we're doing some education now to let people know what they can and can't do,' she said. 'The bottom line is guests should not expect to smoke marijuana in public at a ski resort.' But that expectation may not be realized in the Colorado counties that are home to some of the state's most popular resorts. In those counties, the measure to legalize pot passed by overwhelming margins. Pot stash: Mountain managers are concerned about safety and their tourism image. The fear is that some of the more conservative, family-run resorts will see a backlash from people who don¿t want to be in a cannabis cloud . Aspen's home county approved the measure by margin of more than 3 to 1, and more than two-thirds of voters also approved marijuana in the home county of Colorado's largest ski resort, Vail. A whopping eight in 10 voters in the home county of Telluride ski resort favored marijuana legalization. It's also relatively easy to smoke marijuana at resorts without getting caught. Wooded areas off some of Colorado's slopes already are dotted with 'smoke shacks,' old mining cabins that have been illicitly repurposed as places to use the drug out of the cold and wind. Still, industry officials hope visitors will respect that it is still illegal to smoke marijuana in public and on federal land, where 90 percent of the state's ski resorts are located. Anyone who is caught risks having their pass taken away. It's still illegal: industry officials hope visitors will respect that it is still illegal to smoke marijuana in public and on federal land, where 90 percent of the state¿s ski resorts are located.

'It would certainly be done in private. We obey the law,' the 39-year-old entrepreneur said. 'We don't give people the opportunity to flout it.' Johnson, who founded the company in March, said he is dealing with 'a large backlog' of mostly out-of-staters who are interested in booking a cannabis-themed ski trip this winter. But he doesn't think the new laws will change much of anything at resorts. 'I think most people are pretty considerate. I think most cannabis users are pretty considerate,' he said. One other issue that put Colorado in the news this year aside from the new marijuana laws was flooding, but skiers don't need to give that a second thought: No major resorts were affected.","Major destination ski areas go on the offense as legal pot stores get ready to open near resorts .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:35 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:46 EST, 3 December 2013 . With Republicans calling for the Obamacare law's . repeal in greater numbers, and even some Democrats calling for major . changes, President Obama stuck to his guns Tuesday before a partisan, cheering . crowd, insisting that he won't agree to ditch the law no matter what. Looking more like a campaigning candidate than a sitting president, his speech was an attempt to re-boot public interest in the Affordable Care Act while vowing that 'we're not walking away from it.' 'We're not repealing it as long as I'm president,' he insisted defensively as his fans gave him a standing ovation. 'We will make it work for all Americans.' Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell fired off a press statement within moments of Obama's conclusion. 'Another campaign-style event won’t solve the myriad problems facing consumers under Obamacare,' McConnell said, claiming that the president's system 'is broken beyond repair.' Tarnished halo: President Obama was forced to defend his health insurance law in the face of widespread criticism about rate hikes, cancelled policies, limited coverage and a crash-prone website . Land of second chances? Obama begged Americans to give healthcare.gov a second chance, following an online performance that was nothing short of disastrous . 'The only ""fix,"" he added, 'is full repeal followed by step-by-step, patient-centered reforms that drive down costs and that Americans actually want.' The president's focus on beating back calls for scrapping his signature legislative achievement follows two months of disastrous performance from the website designed – at enormous public cost – to help Americans find new medical insurance. Obama insisted that, now, 'the website is working well for the vast majority of users.' But he hinted at the underlying reality that even as state- and federal-level marketplaces begin to function and enrollment numbers grow, a majority of Americans are choosing free Medicaid coverage instead of buying private health insurance. 'After just the first month, despite all the problems in the rollout,' Obama said Tuesday, 'about half a million people across the country are poised to gain coverage through the marketplaces and Medicaid.' 'That number is going to keep increasing every day.' In October, that first month, just 106,200 people enrolled in private health plans through state and federal online marketplaces. That leaves approximately 400,000 on Medicaid, which taxpayers fund at no cost to eligible subscribers. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Obamacare system will need 7 million new private insurance enrollees by the end of March in order to remain solvent. Among them, the government needs to find more than 2.7 million young people whose relative good health will balance out the higher medical costs of the old and sick. Mystery panel: Obama spoke in front of a group of supportive Americans, but the White House didn't say who they are or whether they have purchased Obamacare coverage . Obama's last live-audience foray into Obamacare defense came on Oct. 21, where his speech came complete with a fainting pregnant woman and a supportive panel -- only a few of whom had enrolled . But Obama promised to stick with his plan, saying that 'whatever comes up, we're just going to fix it.' 'We're just getting started with the exchanges,' he told his audience. One attendee was a baby who let out a short yell, and Obama improvised. 'Yes, you agree with me,' he quipped. And then America's insurance-salesman-in-chief tried to close the deal and encourage Americans to help him generate interest in the Affordable Care Act's insurance offerings. 'Now that we ... are getting the technology fixed,' he asked, 'we need you to go back, take a look at what's actually going on.' 'I'm going to need some help in spreading the word. ... tell your friends. Tell your family.' The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Tuesday that more than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov on Monday, the first weekday following its self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline to fix a host of unresolved technology problems. Sen. McConnell hopes potential Obamacare participants will remember Obamacare's early headaches instead of cutting the White House any slack. Loyal opposition: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell continues to call for a total repeal of the Affordable Care Act . 'The American people have been learning about the impact Obamacare will have on individuals and families in the form of higher premiums, disrupted insurance, and lost jobs,' he said. 'Consumers ... really didn’t need . Obamacare’s cancellation of millions of plans that people already have . and like in order to provide help to those with preexisting . conditions.' The president was introduced by Monica Weeks, a young woman who praised the president for enacting a law that allowed her to remain covered through her parents' insurance until she turned 26. Obama hosted a similar event in Oct. 21 in which a fan of his health insurance overhaul plan introduced him before a brief Rose Garden speech. But unlike that event, the White House did not distribute a list Tuesday of the people who stood behind the president as he spoke on-stage. MailOnline revealed that only three of the 13 people appearing during the Oct. 21 event had actually enrolled in the Obamacare system.","Obama continues to draw attention to Republicans' demands for a complete repeal of his signature medical insurance reform law .

Once the preserve of elderly relatives, it seems that sherry has shaken off its staid reputation . Once the preserve of elderly relatives, it seems that sherry has shaken off its staid reputation and has become trendy among the young. But rather than the brown, sticky syrup imbibed by granny at Christmas (for medicinal purposes, of course) demand is being driven by a thirst for pale, dry varieties. Marks & Spencers has announced that sherry sales are already up by a third on last year, ahead of the festive season. According to the Times, among the biggest sellers is PX - a premium aged style, which has seen sales up 180 per cent on last year. Sherry is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the town of Jerez de la Frontera in Spain, and it has been imported by Britain since the 15th century. Since 2010, specialist sherry bars have been opening around the country, with 35 alone in London in the past three years. And the number of importers selling sherry in the UK has doubled since 2006, according to Graham Hines - director of the Sherry Institute. He told the Times: '[Sherry] is an old friend which is being seen in a new light. 'It used to be served in a measly, little Elgin glass, always warm, always up at the back of the bar, under the lights... Now it is being served properly, in decent glasses, at the right temperature.' In its home country, sherry is named vino de Jerez. The English term 'sherry' comes simply from an anglicisation of the word Jerez. After fermentation of the wine is complete, sherry is fortified with brandy. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later (in contrast to port wine, for example, which is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol). Marks & Spencer has announced that sherry sales are already up by a third on last year . Sherry is produced in a variety of styles, ranging from dry, light versions such as finos to darker and heavier versions known as olorosos, all made from the Palomino grape. Sherry is a protected designation of origin product in Europe - like Champagne - meaning all wine labelled as 'sherry' must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, which is an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María.In 1933 the Jerez Denominación de Origen was the first Spanish denominación to be officially recognised in this way.","Marks & Spencers reports sherry sales already up by third on last year .

And their bosses have asked for a slate of legislative . options by the end of the brief Thanksgiving recess. 'Somebody . has to make sure the Middle East doesn’t explode,' an adviser to a . senior Senate Democrat said Monday morning, 'and no one else seems to . have their eye on the ball.' Even Senate Democratic leader Harry . Reid has promised to look at passing even tougher sanctions on Iran that . would go into place if the Islamic republic doesn't keep up its end of . the bargain. The debate will begin as soon as Congress returns to . session on December 9. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Defense: Obama said that 'tough talk' is easy to do 'politically' as he faced down critics during a speech in San Francisco on Monday . Public enemy number one? Iran's President Hassan Rouhani is on Congress' front-burner as members for both sides of the aisle consider legislation that could force President Obama into a veto showdown over a new sanctions deal . 'The weakest plan on the table': Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Robert Menendez backs a six-month trigger to give Iran ample time to keep -- or break -- its promises under its deal with the U.S. and other world powers . Such an action is explicitly discouraged in the six-month nuclear agreement reached this weekend in Genva, Switzerland. On Monday, Obama rose to defend the agreement, which he has made a cornerstone of his second-term foreign policy. 'Tough . talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically, but it's not . the right thing to do for our security,' he said at an event in San . Fancisco. The president called the deal 'clear-eyed and principled diplomacy. An aide to a senior House Republican said that he had already begun working with 'an outside expert' to draft legislative language that would be circulated among 'a small, select group' of congressmen. 'But this isn't your usual ""us versus them"" deal,' the aide said. 'Senior Democrats will see this draft too. And I'm betting it would be the only one making the rounds by the end of the week.' Some Republicans on the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol are also spoiling for a fight over the Obama administration's surprising pact with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Is the devil in the details? Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday that '[t]here is now an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions' despite the White House's posture, 'until Iran completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities.' Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has so far limited his . comments to an endorsement of what another House aide told MailOnline is 'the . weakest plan on the table,' one that would include a six-month trigger . to give Iran ample time to keep – or  break – its promises under its deal with the . U.S. and other world powers. 'I expect that the . forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will . provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before . imposing new sanctions on Iran,' Menendez said Sunday. President Obama echoed this line in his speech Saturday night. 'If Iran does not fully meet its . commitments during this six-month phase, we will turn off the . [sanctions] relief and ratchet up the pressure,' he said. But . this approach won't meet with approval from many House Republicans who are . just as eager to force Obama into a veto showdown as they are to . demonstrate a tough-on-Iran posture going into the 2014 election season. An anti-Iran video caught online fire over the weekend, depicting the Islamic republic's regime as virulently anti-American and hinting that Obama's deal with Rouhani is a foolish one . Not impressed: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the nuclear agreement with Iran as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within Tehran's reach . South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham captured Capitol Hill's fears about the Iran nuclear deal, worrying that a huge carrot will help Iran ignore a tiny stick. 'we had a chance to deliver a body blow,' he said . 'We're . going to be the stick in the mud,' predicted the second GOP staffer, who works for a House . Republican on the Foreign Affairs committee. 'The president . has committed us to a dangerous course of action, I think, and we're . setting ourselves up to lose Israel as an ally. Lots of members here . will be happy to paint Obama into a corner and make him veto tougher . sanctions that what he just let Rouhani weasel out of.' Peace for our time? U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (R) shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (L) at the United Nations Palais in Geneva November 24, 2013 . 'And none of this six-month-grace-period nonsense,' he added. 'Let's do it now.' Global reactions have been muted, with most world leaders expressing tepid support. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said his country 'has consistently called on Iran to exercise flexibility on the matter. We want to keep a close watch in a way to help implement this agreement.' Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said his nation 'welcomes the prospect of resolving questions related to Iran's nuclear programme through dialogue and diplomacy.' Closer to the Middle East region, reactions were more strident. Syria 'considers it to be a historic accord which guarantees the interests of the brotherly Iranian people,' the Islamic regime's foreign office said. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that '[w]hat was achieved yesterday in Geneva is not a historic agreement but rather a historic mistake.' Added pressure on U.S. lawmakers is coming from a YouTube video that has been seen by more than 1.1 million people since Friday. Titled simply 'Iran Facts,' the anonymously authored video contains a laundry list of anti-American statements from Iranian leaders, read over a series of editorial cartoon-style drawings and a soundtrack full of riotous crowd noises. During his recent presidential campaign, according to the video's narrator, Rouhani said that 'saying ""Death to America"" is easy; we need to express ""Death to America"" with action.' Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the video's creator – who requested anonymity – said that Americans 'need to know the Iran threat is not focused on Israel. That is a distraction.' 'Imagine if Israel did not exist,' he said. 'Then imagine what we would be thinking about ""Death to America"" [statements' from people who commit suicide on a regular basis and have a deliverable nuclear weapon.' House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called the deal 'dangerous' on Monday morning, noting that it fell short of the recommendations of the UN Security Council . Appearing Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' program, Secretary of State John Kerry wouldn't respond directly to a . question about whether the president would veto any new Iran sanctions . Congress might pass. 'I . believe Congress will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal . of benefit in it, and I look forward to going up and working with our . colleagues on the hill in order to try to persuade them that this is not . the moment to increase sanctions,' Kerry said. Kerry met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Sunday after taking part in the breakthrough talks that are temporarily curbing Iran's nuclear activity . Several Democrats in the Senate, . where Kerry served before joining the Obama administration, have already . expressed dismay at what they see as a lopsided deal between the White . House and Rouhani. 'This . disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that . Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional . sanctions when we return in December,' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck . Schumer said Sunday in a statement. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday on CNN that 'we had a chance to deliver a body blow,' against Iran, since 'the sanctions [already in place] actually worked.' 'But this interim deal gives the Iranians $7 billion in cash,' he complained, 'and it leaves in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs around.' House Speaker John Boehner hinted on Sunday that America must maintain as much pressure on Tehran as the White House will allow. Otherwise, Boehner said, 'we will look back on the interim deal as a remarkably clever Iranian move to dismantle the international sanctions regime while maintaining its infrastructure and material to pursue a break-out nuclear capability.'","Legislators are readying bills that would force Obama to choose between backing off from his Iran deal and vetoing tough new sanctions .

The Seattle Seahawks fans have set a new noise record for loudest outdoor sports stadium, with their stomps and cheers so loud Monday night they triggered a detectable earthquake. A University of Washington professor says the noisemaking of Seattle Seahawks' fans registered on a nearby seismometer with the same energy as a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake during Seattle's 34-7 Monday victory over New Orleans. The homemade temblor is dubbed the Beast Quake and Seahawks fans have rocked it before – in another game against the Saints in 2011. 'Beast Quake': A Seattle fan holds a sign that reads LOUDER as he yells during Monday's game. The combined cheers of fans were measured at a record-breaking 137.6 decibels . A University of Washington earth sciences professor says the legendary noisemaking of Seattle Seahawks' hometown fans registered on a nearby seismometer with roughly the same energy as a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake. John Vidale is director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. He says it's hard to compare the fans' half minute of stomping, jumping and shouting during a first quarter fumble return for a touchdown to the quick ‘pop’ of a small earthquake. Still he says, ‘the energy is very roughly the same.’ Vidale says the seismometer registered ’three or four more good bursts,’ which always coincided with Seahawks' touchdowns. The UW seismometer in question is located just north of CenturyLink Field. Thunderous: Fans at CenturyLink Field (pictured) literally rocked the earth Monday when they caused the equivalent of a magnitude 1 or 2 Earthquake . Loud league: Seahawks fans took back their title of loudest in the NFL Monday when they beat the previous record of 137.5 decibels by the Kansas City Chiefs by just .1 decibels . Seahawks fans previously set a record for audience noise at an outdoor stadium on September 15 with a roar that reached 136.6 decibels in a win over San Francisco. The mark was topped by envious Kansas City Chiefs fans in October with 137.5 decibels. According to NOLA.com, the Chiefs were so bent on beating the Seahawks fans record that prior to their attempt they flew in a Guinness Book of World Records adjudicator. Now the crown has back to Seattle with an official Guinness measurement of 137.6 decibels at the December 2 game. To put that in perspective, a jet engine at 100 feet is about 140 decibels. The most intense rumble came after Seahawks' defensive end Michael Bennett recovered a fumble by New Orleans' quarterback Drew Brees in the first quarter and ran it back for a touchdown, said Vidale.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Agence France-presse . PUBLISHED: . 14:20 EST, 21 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 21 November 2013 . The Senate has taken the dramatic step of trying to override the Republican’s ability to outrun the nomination approval process. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the move, known in Washington as the 'nuclear option,' to end what he considers long-standing abuses of blocking procedures that for more than two centuries have required a 60-vote threshold -- instead of a simple majority vote -- to overcome. For years, filibusters have been used by those in the minority party to push back the approval of measures that they do not like. Today, Reid put an end to the tactic and President Obama came out in support the move. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Enough is enough: Frustrated with Republicans' repeated use of filibusters to avoid confirming judicial nominees, Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid took the 'nuclear option' and got rid of the procedural tool . ‘It’s no secret that the American people probably have never been more frustrated with Washington,’ the president said in a press conference this afternoon. Support: President Obama gave a statement endorsing the Senate's move saying that it will help get more done . He said that since he took office in 2009, there has been an ‘unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress’ by politicians who ‘abuse arcane procedural tactics.’ The president said that as a former senator, he values the chamber's powers. But he says some rules are now being used as a tool to 'grind business to a halt.' Reid, who launched the effort under a parliamentary maneuver scripted in advance, accused Republicans of 'unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction' of Obama's selections to fill court vacancies and other offices. 'It's time to change the Senate, before this institution becomes obsolete,' he said. His Republican counterpart Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused Democrats of . exercising raw power and said they would regret it when political . fortunes switched. He . likened the effort to the president's since-discredited promise that . Americans who like their health care can keep it under Obamacare, noting . that Reid promised last summer he wouldn't seek to change the process . for approving appointees. 'He may as well just have said, ""If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them,""' McConnell said. If the filibuster ban is upheld, it could dramatically ease the bottleneck on stalled nominees including federal judges. It would also- and will almost certainly- curtail the influence of the Republicans as they are in the minority of the Senate, which could lead to an escalation of already-frustrating levels of partisanship. Bipartisan bickering: Seen here the day before the filibuster debate, Republicans Mitch McConnell (left) and House Speaker John Boehner (right) are against the procedural change . 'I think you'll see harder-edged . partisan choices, and the filter that exists today to kind of weed those . folks out is going to be less,' said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Democrats . led by Reid sought to change proceedings so that only a simple majority . was required to clear the way for a final vote. The Senate vote was 52-48, with three Democrats voting against the rules change. A motion to overturn the change failed. Republican . were livid about the sudden moves by Reid, who earlier this year made . similar threats to use the nuclear option but was averted with a . last-minute compromise. 'This is a power grab,' argued Senator Lamar Alexander. 'It's another partisan political maneuver to permit the Democratic majority to do whatever it wants to do. Taking away leverage: Senator Lindsay Graham has used filibusters as a way to prevent judicial appointments until he got more information about the attack in Benghazi . 'In this case it's to advance the president's regulatory agenda, and the only cure for it that I know is an election.’ Republicans contend that Reid used complex procedural tactics to break Senate rules that require that any changes to those rules be made by a super-majority of two-thirds of senators. The change is the most far-reaching since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was lowered to 60 votes. Though the phrase may suggest the beginning of an international arms race, it has nothing to do with weapons. The 'nuclear option' is a term that was coined to describe how the majority party would be able to unleash a political explosion of ill-will. Because switching the rules from requiring 60 votes to a simple majority of just 51 votes, the majority party will be able to pass anything they want. When the Republicans were the majority party in the Senate, they threatened to pull the proverbial trigger, but cooler heads prevailed. The maneuvering occurred after a decade in which first one party, then the other, nursed a lengthening list of grievances over delays in confirmation for nominees to the courts. McConnell noted that Democrats sought to thwart some of President George W. Bush's conservative appointees, while Democrats say the GOP has done the same to Obama's appointees. In a sign that a showdown was imminent, dozens of senators filed in to listen to Reid and McConnell swap accusations and then cast votes on a complicated series of parliamentary moves. Even so, there was no doubt about the outcome, if Reid insisted. Democrats control 55 seats, compared with 45 for Republicans. ‘These nominees deserve at least an up-or-down vote. But Republican filibusters deny them a fair vote,’ he said. To . which McConnell noted that the Senate has confirmed 215 of Obama's . picks to the courts since he became president, and rejected two. ‘That's . a confirmation rate of 99 percent,’ he said pointedly. The clash capped a period of increasing irritation on the part of Democrats. ‘They . have decided that their base demands a permanent campaign against the . president and maximum use of every tool available,’ Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, a leading advocate of revamping filibuster rules, said Wednesday of Republicans. Flip-flopping: When the Republicans were the majority, they threatened to 'go nuclear' and now they are complaining that the Democrats did (Mitch McConnell at right and Lamar Alexander at left on Thursday) He said that consideration ‘is trumping the appropriate exercise of advice and consent’ by GOP senators. The D.C. Circuit Court is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in power because it rules on disputes over White House and federal agency actions. The circuit's eight judges are divided evenly between Democratic and Republican presidential appointees. Senior Democrats wary of future GOP retaliation until recently opposed the move, but growing numbers of them have begun lining up behind Reid's effort. In addition, two dozen groups, including the AFL-CIO and Sierra Club, wrote lawmakers Wednesday supporting the change, saying that ‘rampant, ideology-based obstructionism is the new norm in the U.S. Senate.’","Senators regularly stall nominations or votes by using filibusters to 'run out the clock' and stall the process .
Today the Democratic majority leader effectively banned the tactic .
The change means that they don't need 60 votes from the 100-person chamber, and now they only need a simple majority of 51 to pass measures .
Because there are 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans, that means that Democrats could possibly win every vote they put up .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:51 EST, 3 December 2013 . The family of a 93-year-old man claim they were prevented from being at his bedside during his final moments because of security guards at a New Jersey hospital. When Angelo Romeo's daughter and grandson accidentally used the wrong door in the hospital on November 23, security guards gave them a lecture about 'correct procedures'. The delay meant that by the time they reached Mr Romeo's room, the nurses and doctors were waiting outside to tell them it was too late, and Mr Romeo had already died. Last goodbye: John Urbaniak with his grandfather Angelo Romeo, who he helped care for . 'They really need to revise their security policies - and at least have some empathy and compassion,' Mr Romeo's grandson, John Urbaniak, said. The 33-year-old, who lived with his grandfather and helped care for him, told NJ.com that more than a week after the family's loss, they were still waiting to hear from the New Brunswick hospital's Patient Advocacy department. The traumatic experience began when Mr Urbaniak and his mother Fran rushed to the critical care unit in Robert Wood John University Hospital after hearing that Mr Romeo's health was failing. A security guard buzzed them through the first door, but as they entered an elevator a second security guard yelled that they couldn't use it and reached inside to stop the doors closing. 'I said, ""My grandfather’s dying! We just got a call"". And she didn’t even care,' he said. She forced them to use their hospital's main entrance, but when they reached the lobby three security guards waiting there accused them of assault because Mr Urbaniak had knocked the hand of the guard who tried to stop the elevator. Delays: John Urbaniak claims security guards at Robert Wood John University Hospital prevented him from reaching his grandfather at a crucial moment . Despair: The family say the security were heavy handed at their time of grief . 'He didn’t assault her,' Mr Urbaniak's mother, Fran, said. 'My son and I are not threatening-looking. We’re both little.' The pair told the guards they were rushing to be with a dying relative and handed over their ID, but they claimed that a security official ordered them to sit down and lectured them for several minutes. 'This is not how you . conduct yourself in a hospital,' he told them, according to Mr Urbaniak. Mother and son were then escorted through the hospital to where Mr Romeo was being cared for. When they arrived a doctor and the nurses were waiting outside the room. 'They said, ""We're sorry. He just passed,' Mr Urbaniak said. The grieving 33-year-old said he then verbally lashed out at the security guards, telling them they had robbed him of his final minutes with his grandfather. He claimed the guard responded by saying: 'This is not our fault. This is your fault.' Mr Urbaniak expressed his frustration at their treatment on the hospital's Facebook page, telling the hospital: 'I never got a chance to say goodbye to him thanks to your heartless security.' 'In our time of deep sorrow and grief, we were showed no sympathy, no compassion, no care for the loss of someone so close to us. We were treated like animals and shown no mercy whatsoever - and for no reason at all,' he said. Family ties: Angelo Romeo with his grandson John Urbaniak . He added that even after being told his grandfather had died, the security guards continued to follow the family, waiting outside the relatives' room as they comforted each other, and following Mr Urbaniak when he asked a nurse when the family could see the body. In a tribute to his beloved grandfather, Mr Urbaniak explained how Mr Romeo survived being a prisoner of war in the Second World War and then came to the U.S. from Italy without a cent to his name. He worked hard to raise the money to bring his wife and two daughters out a few months later, and was described as being a gentle and kind-hearted man who loved gardening and animals. Two days before his death, the widower had been fitted with a pacemaker and appeared to be recovering by Saturday night. Because he had appeared to be doing well, Mr Urbaniak and his parents went out to dinner, leaving Mr Romeo chatting happily to a careworker. 'He waved bye to me, he was happy,' Fran Urbaniak said. But shortly after he took a turn for the worse and . the carer called the family and told them to rush to the hospital. The hospital responded to Mr Urbaniak's Facebook complaint, and offered its condolences. In . a statement sent to Mail Online, a spokesman said: 'We extend our . deepest sympathies to the Romeo and Urbaniak families at this time. We . strive to provide a welcoming and safe environment for all patients and . visitors at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and take the . families’ concerns very seriously.' Complaint: John Urbaniak claims his family were treated without compassion . It added that Mr Urbaniak and his mother had been redirected to the main lobby for security reasons and said 'the family was not detained'. 'Our security personnel took this action in the spirit of maintaining a safe and secure environment for all patients and visitors.' The spokesman added that after speaking with the family and completing a review, the hospital will determine if changes to security policies or enhanced training is needed.","Angelo Romeo died alone after daughter and grandson were stopped by officials .

He later died in hospital . A 22-year-old Florida man has died after he was shot in the chest by his girlfriend in a tragic accident. Police said Erin Steele, 20, picked up a firearm thinking it wasn't loaded and it went off, shooting her boyfriend Justin Holt in the chest at their friend's Boca Raton apartment. He later passed away in hospital. A chilling 911 call, in which the owner of the gun and another friend frantically beg for help, was released by Boca Raton police Tuesday. 'Please help me, ma'am!' a man shouted at the start of the call, according to the Sun Sentinel. 'There was an accident; there was a very bad accident. Someone picked up my firearm by mistake, ma'am, and someone got shot. Please, please come.' According to WPBF, Joshua Henry, 23, brought a pistol over to another friend's apartment where the group was hanging out and they all practiced dry shooting it. When they were finished playing, Henry reloaded the gun and put it on the counter, according to Boca Raton police. Later, Steele picked up the gun, pointed it at Holt and fired, hitting him in the chest. Officers arrived at the Boca Raton apartment within minutes of the 911 call and Holt was rushed to Delray Medical Center where he died soon after, according to police. Steele has not been charged in connection with the shooting, and his family say they believe it was an accident and feel sad for her. They told police they don't want her to face charges. 'We have a lot of compassion for her . because she's got to live with that, no matter what she does, for the . rest of her life,' Holt's grandfather, 82-year-old Michael DiFiore, told . the Sun Sentinel. According to friends and family, Holt and Steele were very much in love. They had started dating almost immediately after being introduced about a year ago and were nearly inseparable. On Thanksgiving, Steele and Holt ate dinner at DiFiore's house with Holt's family. Justin Holt's mother Maria, 56, said her son was a family guy who just wanted to find a girl and settle down. And Steele was that girl. 'They met and then that was it, they were together,' Maria Holt said. 'From day one — day one — he was in love with her.' Playing around: Joshua Henry, 23, brought a pistol over to another friend's apartment, pictured, where the group was hanging out and they all practiced dry shooting it . In the 911 call, Holt's friends are breathless and sobbing and the phone is passed from the gun's owner, Henry, 23, to a woman who said she was the owner of the apartment. The dispatcher repeatedly told the group to calm down and asked for their address, but they were too distracted to answer. They said Holt was coughing up blood and were unable to tell if he was breathing. 'Ma'am, the kid's dying,' the man said breathlessly. 'Please help ma'am, please.' Sirens can be heard at the end of the call and the man told the dispatcher he was trying to flag officers down. 'Right here, right here!' he shouted before begging again, this time to police, 'Please, please help me.' 'It was a stupid accident,' DiFiore said. 'It never should have happened.' 'He was my whole life,' the young man's mother said.","Police said Erin Steele, 20, picked up a firearm thinking it wasn't loaded and it went off, shooting her boyfriend Justin Holt in the chest at their friend's Boca Raton apartment .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 05:56 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:45 EST, 25 November 2013 . House prices in Britain leaped up by as much as £7,430 last month, new figures reveal. The average family home is up £5,583 and London properties have shot up by more than £7,000. Experts claim the Help to Buy scheme has provoked a wave of new buyers, pushing prices up. Soaring: The average London house price has broken the £400,000 barrier for the first time in history . The increase of £1,300 a week is the biggest jump in the market since 2010, according to leading real estate analyst Sequence (UK). However, the change in October has not put off would-be homeowners as each house now has seven people fighting for it. In London, where the average sale price is higher than ever, 14 people compete for every property. It comes as the Council of Mortgage Lenders said last week the number of homes sold this year will be more than one million for the first time since the financial crisis began in 2007. Sale prices: This map of sale prices by Sequence shows London, Wales and the South East had the biggest leaps . Rent prices: Letting prices are also up, with the average UK rent at £785 - 41 per cent of the average wage . There has been ‘a particularly severe contraction’ in the number of homes bought and sold in Britain, it said, nearly halving from 1.6million in 2007 to just 886,000 in 2010. But the market has dramatically recovered, with more people keen to buy than at any time since the recession began. Mortgage applications also rose by six per cent last month, and almost doubled in the past year. David Plumtree, Sequence (UK) chief executive, said: 'The appetite to buy property across the UK has risen to record levels. This has impacted on property prices as competition for every new instruction intensifies.' Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, said: 'Help to Buy has opened a flood of new buyers, causing prices to surge upwards.' Appetite: Experts claim the Help to Buy scheme has provoked the wave of new buyers in the past six months . Mortgages: Buy to Let mortgages have also rocketed this year, which has contributed to the price rise . Mortgage: Despite the increase in price, mortgage applications rose by six per cent in October . The government scheme, which launched in April, initially helped people to buy newly-built homes by offering a shared equity loan. The average price of a property bought under the scheme was £194,167, with an average equity loan of £38,703. Out of the 5,375 sold so far, the highest number of Help to Buy sales have been in Leeds, Wiltshire, Milton Keynes and Reading, according to the DCLG. Critics warned the UK-wide second phase of the scheme, which began last month and is not restricted to new-builds, would cause a housing bubble. It guarantees 15 per cent of the value of the home loan. Driver: Experts claim the Help to Buy scheme, which entered its second phase last month, has opened a flood of buyers and driven up prices. The new phase is UK-wide and not restricted to newly-built homes . Climb: New buyer figures have moved up dramatically in the last month as people show no sign of holding off . Offers: Estate agents are now advising people how to submit secret bids as the number of offers per sale rise . In a bid to handle the 'inevitable' increase, estate agents have been advising desperate buyers on how to submit 'sealed bids'. For the first time in its history, the National Association of Estate Agents last week published guidance about how sealed bids work and how to boost your chances of beating other buyers. A sealed bid is when a buyer has so many people who want to buy their home - or wants to generate this level of interest - that they ask for secret bids to be submitted. Renting: There has been a national rise in the number of new tenancies . Viewings: In London, there are fewer viewings per property now compared to October 2011 . The highest bid does not necessarily get the property, as the buyer might also evaluate who is in the best position to buy the property. That is, a cash bidder might beat a buyer who needs a mortgage, or needs to sell a property before being able to buy a new home. Rent prices have also rocketed, with an annual increase of 11 per cent to £785 - 41 per cent of the average UK wage.","House prices went up by £7,000 in October as buyers' appetite soars .

Detroit is eligible to shed billions of dollars of debt that accumulated during the city's decades-long decline, including cutting pensions for thousands of workers and retirees, a judge ruled on Tuesday in a decision that shifts the epic bankruptcy case into a new and delicate phase. Judge Steven Rhodes, who wondered aloud why the bankruptcy had not happened years ago, said pensions can be altered just like any contract because the Michigan Constitution does not offer bulletproof protection for employee benefits.

'It the same time, it also has an opportunity for a fresh start.' The ruling came more than four months after Detroit filed for Chapter 9 protection. Rhodes agreed with unions and pension funds that the city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, had not negotiated in good faith in the weeks ahead of the July filing, a key condition under federal law. But he said the number of creditors - more than 100,000 - and a wide array of competing interests probably made that 'impossible.' The city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, is accused by city workers of not negotiating in good faith in the weeks ahead of July's bankruptcy filing . Detroit 'could have and should have filed for bankruptcy long before it did. Perhaps years,' the judge said. The decision set the stage for officials to confront $18 billion in debt with a plan that might pay creditors just pennies on the dollar and is sure to include touchy negotiations over the pensions of about 23,000 retirees and 9,000 workers. Orr says pension funds are short by $3.5 billion. Rhodes promised that he would not 'lightly or casually' sign off on just any cuts. The city has argued that bankruptcy protection will allow it to help beleaguered residents who for years have tolerated slow police responses, darkened streetlights and erratic garbage pickup - a concern mentioned by the judge during a nine-day trial that ended Nov. 8. Before the July filing, nearly 40 cents of every dollar collected by Detroit was used to pay debt, a figure that could rise to 65 cents without relief through bankruptcy, according to the city. Retiree Cecily McClellan talks to the media outside the federal courthouse in Detroit on Tuesday after Judge Steven Rhodes ruled on the city's bankruptcy filing . Orr praised the judge's ruling and pledged to 'press ahead.' He also acknowledged that pensions would be a sensitive issue because they represent a 'human dimension' to the crisis, with some retirees getting by on less than $20,000 a year. City truck mechanic Mark Clark, 53, said he may look for another job after absorbing pay cuts and higher health care costs. Now a smaller pension looms. 'Most of us didn't have too much faith in the court. ... The working class is becoming the have-nots,' Clark said outside the courthouse. 'I'm broke up and beat up. I'm going to pray a whole lot.' Marcia Ingram, a retired clerical worker, said she may need to find work but added: 'How many folks are going to hire a 60-year-old woman?' The judge spoke for more than an hour in a packed courtroom, reciting Detroit's proud history as the diverse, hard-working Motor City devoted to auto manufacturing. Detroit is officially bankrupt after suffering double-digit unemployment, catastrophic debt deals, thousands of vacant homes and wave after wave of population loss . But he then tallied a list of warts: double-digit unemployment, catastrophic debt deals, thousands of vacant homes and wave after wave of population loss. Behind closed doors, mediators led by another judge have been meeting with Orr's team and creditors for weeks to explore possible settlements. The judge has told the city to come up with a plan by March 1 to exit bankruptcy. Orr has said he would like to have one ready weeks earlier. The city is so desperate for money that it may consider auctioning off masterpieces from the Detroit Institute of Arts and selling a water department that serves much of southeastern Michigan. 'We need to recognize that this decision is a call to action,' Gov. Rick Snyder, who supported the bankruptcy filing, said on Tuesday. 'We are confronting fiscal realities that have been ignored for too long.' Sharon Levine, attorney representing the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said city officials got 'absolutely everything' in Judge Steven Rhodes' decision and is planing to appeal . Minutes after the ruling, a union lawyer said she would appeal. City officials got 'absolutely everything' in Rhodes' decision, she told reporters. 'It's a huge loss for the city of Detroit,' said Sharon Levine, an attorney for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents half of city workers. Orr, a bankruptcy expert, was appointed in March under a Michigan law that allows a governor to send a manager to distressed cities, townships or school districts. A manager has extraordinary powers to reshape local finances without interference from elected officials. By July, Orr and Snyder decided bankruptcy was Detroit's best option. Detroit, a manufacturing hub that offered well-paying blue-collar jobs, peaked at 1.8 million residents in 1950 but has lost more than a million people since then. Outgoing mayor Dave Bing will be replaced in January by former hospital executive Mike Duggan, he first white mayor in largely black Detroit since the 1970s, in January . With more square mileage than Manhattan, Boston and San Francisco combined, the city does not have enough tax revenue to reliably cover pensions, retiree health insurance and buckets of debt sold to keep the budget afloat. Donors have written checks for new police cars and ambulances. A new agency has been created to revive tens of thousands of streetlights that are dim or simply broken after years of vandalism and mismanagement. Former hospital executive Mike Duggan takes over as mayor in January, the third mayor since Kwame Kilpatrick quit in a scandal in 2008 and the first white mayor in largely black Detroit since the 1970s. Orr is in charge at least through next fall, although he's expected to give Duggan more of a role at city hall than the current mayor, Dave Bing, who has little influence in daily operations.","Judge Steven Rhodes ruled that city is eligible to shed billions of dollars of debt that accumulated during the city's decades-long decline .

Schoolchildren in the UK are still far behind their peers in other countries despite the money pumped into the education system by successive Governments. The results of international tests published today reveal that Britain's performance has not improved over the past three years, with countries such as Japan and Singapore leading the global league tables. Business leaders said the disappointing figures should be a 'wake-up call', adding: 'School leavers in the UK are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world.' Poor performance: Britain is lagging behind many other countries in education league tables . The tests, part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), measure the achievement of 15-year-olds in maths, science and reading. The latest results show that girls are far behind boys in maths lessons, with female pupils less likely to enjoy studying the subject. And figures from Wales are particularly worrying, as its students performed worse on every measure than those in other parts of the UK. Wales is falling behind the rest of the UK in reading, maths and science, the new league tables show. The nation's teenagers scored lower results on average in each of the three subjects than their counterparts in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Scotland leads the way in the UK in maths and reading, while England is ahead in science. The figures show that 15-year-olds in Wales scored 468 points on average, compared with 498 in Scotland, 495 in England and 487 in Northern Ireland. In reading, Scotland scored 506 points on average, England scored 500, Northern Ireland 498 and Wales 480. In science, England's average points score was 516, compared with 513 in Scotland, 507 in Northern Ireland and 491 in Wales. The OECD report concluded that for each of the three subjects, 'performance in Wales was lower than the rest of the United Kingdom'. The results come despite the billions of pounds invested in education by Labour, and the decision by the Coalition to 'ring-fence' Britain's schools budgets while making deep cuts in other public services. Education Secretary Michael Gove blamed the disappointing figures on the previous Government, but his Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt said it showed the importance of improving the standards of teachers. The UK is in 26th place for maths, 23rd for reading and 21st for science in the PISA league tables for 2012, which focus on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge. The findings show that the UK's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, roughly average for all countries and on a par with the Czech Republic, France and Norway. Britain did better in science with an above-average 514 points, similar to Australia, Ireland and Slovenia. However, on every measure the country lags behind leading nations including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Shanghai in China. The OECD, which conducts the tests, said that Britain's performance was strikingly similar in 2006 and 2009, the last two times the league table was published. 'In essence you can say that the UK stands where it stood in 2009,' said Andreas Schleicher, special adviser to the OECD's secretary-general. Business groups were sharply critical of the results, arguing that there is an urgent need to raise the standards in British schools. Opposition: Conservative Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, and Labour's Tristram Hunt, right, disagree on how to improve the UK's educational performance . Mike Harris, head of education and . skills at the Institute of Directors, said: 'The generation of young . people tested for the latest OECD PISA report will be looking for jobs . in a competitive and unforgiving global race. 'Unfortunately, thanks to historic complacency, the UK appears to have its feet shackled at the starting line. 'We . know from previous OECD skills surveys that, despite billions of pounds . of investment in education over the last 15 years, school leavers in . the UK are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world. 'This . latest report highlights these historic failings yet again, and raises . further questions about the UK's attitude to education.' Girls in the UK perform worse than boys in maths and are less likely to enjoy the subject, according to the results of the PISA tests. British boys scored an average of 12 points more than girls, a greater gender gap than that seen in most countries. The findings also show that girls find the subject less enjoyable and are more anxious about studying it. Overall, 59 per cent of boys said that they are interested in learning maths, compared to 53 per cent of girls. The study adds that across all OECD countries, greater anxiety about maths is linked to lower scores in the subject. In the UK, the proportion of students who had high levels of maths anxiety was lower than the OECD average, but girls were more anxious than boys, it says. Boys also did better than girls in science with a gender gap of 13 points, larger than the OECD average of one point. But girls performed better in reading, scoring 25 points more on average, significantly less than the OECD's average gender gap of 38 points. Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said: 'High-performing schools are the best way to support economic growth and greater opportunity. These figures should be a wake-up call. 'UK schools are treading water when we know that matching the very best could boost the growth rate by one percentage point every year. 'No issue matters more to the UK economy over the long term than the quality of our education system.' Britain's poor performance comes despite its above-average spending on education. The UK spends an average of £59,889 per student, compared to an OECD average of £50,951. The report shows that around one in eight (12 per cent) of UK teenagers are considered 'top performers' in maths, nine per cent in reading and 11 per cent in science. By contrast, more than a fifth are 'low performers' in maths, meaning they can only solve the simplest problems. Mr Gove said: 'These poor results show the last Government failed to secure the improvements in school standards our young people desperately need. 'Labour poured billions of pounds into schools and ratcheted up exam grades - yet our education system stagnated and we fell behind other nations.' He added that the performance 'underlines the urgent need for our reforms'. However, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that only a crackdown on unqualified teachers could boost pupils' performance. 'What we have under this government is a series of policies which lead to the deprofessionalisation of teaching,' the Shadow Education Secretary said. 'It is scandalous that schools can advertise for unqualified teachers.'","UK remains in the mid-ranks of PISA league tables behind Asian leaders .

A waiter was cheated out of a tip on Saturday after serving a group of Alabama football fans who appeared to be in a sour mood after their team lost. Instead of leaving a tip on the $20.25 bill at a Tennessee wing restaurant, the customer scrawled Alabama's motto 'Roll Tide' in the gratuity box and berated the waiter for being 'proud' of Auburn. Forrest Swan, a 22-year-old university student, said he hadn't realized the customers were Alabama fans and was just making small talk when he commented on the game. But his comment touched a nerve with the guests, with one of them writing: 'Don't talk about being proud of Auburn to an Alabama fan. There's your tip!' The 22-year-old, who was working a double shift at the restaurant, told Busted Coverage the group was made up of two men and a woman in their early 20s. 'They weren’t even wearing any Alabama stuff or anything that would tell me they were Alabama fans,' he said. When a friend tweeted a picture of the receipt, some people cast doubt on its authenticity, but Mr Swan and Vaughan Crittenden, who posted it online yesterday, confirmed it was real. Dramatic finale: Auburn run out of the end zone and away from a tackle by Alabama at Saturday's Iron Bowl . Mr Swan, who supports Virginia Tech, said he was just making small talk with the customers and had said Auburn deserved to win after the last-second touchdown in the Iron Ball. 'I just walked away. I wasn’t even talking s***, like ""Alabama sucks"" or ""you guys lost"",' he said. According to Busted Coverage, the customer contacted the restaurant later to say that he had tried to leave a $4 tip but that it hadn't gone through.","University student shocked as customer takes out Iron Bowl loss on him .

Ministers have launched a crackdown on bogus 'health and safety' rules which ban innoucuous activities, in time for the festive season. In previous years, workers have complained about being banned from decorating their offices because of supposed Government regulations. But officials insist there are no restictions on popular Christmas traditions, and they are encouraging members of the public to report the most ridiculous cases to an official website. Danger? Ministers have urged bosses not to ban office Christmas decorations over health and safety fears . As well as bans on decorations, health and safety regulations have in the past been cited to restrict activities such as carol singing and children's snowball fights. In addition, over-zealous jobsworths have apparently tried to stop people donating second-hand toys and putting coins in Christmas pudding. Mike Penning, the minister responsible for health and safety, expressed frustration that bogus cases undermined the importance of rules which are intended to safeguard the public. 'Every year, I hear of more bonkers ""excuses"" that ban hard-working people from the traditional hanging of Christmas decorations at work - which does nothing more than spoil the festive fun,' he said. 'My message to everyone is - use your common sense. Don't just invent a health and safety myth because you think it's easier than giving a real reason - this gives real safety rules a bad name.' Myth busting: The Health and Safety Executive has launched a new panel which aims to expose businesses using the excuse of health and safety to impose restrictions on customers . Anger: Minister Mike Penning is leading the crackdown on abuses of legitimate regulations . Mr Penning has written to managers at the Department of Work and Pensions reminding them not to be overly strict when ruling on workplace decorations. Official advice to the public states that there is no need to take Christmas lights to be tested, and that people should simply examine devices to make sure there are no obvious defects. The minister urged people to report unreasonable applications of the law to the new 'myth busters' panel at the Health and Safety Executive. The panel has ruled on more than 220 cases since being launched earlier this year in a bid to improve the reputation of health and safety laws, which have been tarnished by years of abuse. Among the absurd cases which the HSE denounced were pubs which refused to offer glasses with handles, and a restaurant removing toothpicks from its tables. One school banned shredded paper from the lucky dip stall at its fete for 'safety' reasons, while a hotel chamber maid refused to make up a cot bed on similar grounds. In the most recent case, concerning a steam train which blamed health and safety for its failure to accommodate customers' dietary needs, the panel said that workers were 'using health and safety as an excuse for poor customer service'. Army veteran Doug Speller, 74, was told he was not allowed to stand for the National Anthem during an RAF band concert. Morris dancers in Bacup, Lancashire face having their annual Easter show cancelled because it is so popular that the crowds sometimes spill into the street. Binmen refused to collect rubbish from the Wright family, in Midlothian, because their bin was open by one inch. Heavily pregnant Amanda Burch was banned from wearing a vest top while swimming at a leisure centre - but other women were allowed to keep theirs on for 'religious reasons'. Ellie Sandywell, 11, had her Help for Heroes wristband confiscated at school because teachers feared it might get caught on a door handle. Thames Water installed a life ring next to a brook in Surrey in case people fell in - even though it is just three inches deep. Albert 'Dusty' Miller, an 89-year-old Navy veteran, is no longer allowed to lead Royal British Legion events because his age means he cannot be insured. A postman in London refused to deliver a letter because the pathway to the house was blocked by a spider's web. Alan Chittock was suspended from his job as a customer service assistant at Southend railway station after he leaped on to the train tracks to rescue a disabled woman who had fallen. Dozens of schools are reported to have banned pupils from playing conkers, even though the HSE says the risk posed by the traditional playground game is 'incredibly low'.","In previous years, workers have reported bans on office decorations .

Susan Edwards was detained along with her husband, Christopher, three weeks after police discovered the bones of her ‘reclusive’ parents, who had not been seen since the late 1990s. Police officers began digging at the semi-detached home that formerly belonged to William and Patricia Wycherley after receiving a tip-off about an ‘incident’ at the house that had taken place up to 15 years ago. Murder inquiry: The outside of the semi-detached house in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where police three weeks ago found the remains of William and Patricia Wycherley buried in the back garden after a tip-off . Neighbours said Mr Wycherley, a former . merchant sailor who would now be 100, and his wife, who would now be . 79, ‘disappeared’ from the property in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in . the late 1990s. Rumours later circulated locally and . within their extended family that the couple had moved to either Ireland . or to the Lancashire coast.

'If anything happens to me tonight just let my kids know I loved them dearly and tell my momma I love her,' Michelle Rowling, 25, posted on Monday. Family and friends say the message referred to her ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old Montrell Cooper, who was released from jail that day. He had been locked up for assaulting Rowling in August. On Saturday, police were called to her housing complex in East St Louis, Missouri to investigate a disturbance at around 9pm when they found the young mother with multiple stab wounds.

The Baltimore man who claims to have inspired HBO's The Wire was arrested on federal drug and gun charges last month. Nathan ‘Bodie’ Barksdale, AGE, had been working for Safe Streets, a city Health Department program in which former criminals help rid the streets of the violent crime they once perpetuated, when he was arrested. Barksdale had been successful in the program, Johnson said, but he was terminated after not showing up to work on November 25, the same week he was arrested. Smooth criminal: Nathan 'Bodie' Barksdale, right, has allegedly survived 21 gunshots during his career as a criminal, some of which were fired while Barksdale was in hospital after a prior murder attempt . Back in jail: The Baltimore-born Barksdale was arrested on federal drug and gun charges last month . The Drug Enforcement Agency said Barksdale didn't cease his role as a drug boss as he has long claimed, but was instead a high-ranking official of the prison and street gang, Black Guerrilla Family. He was arrested last month on heroin and gun charges, according to The Baltimore Sun. Barksdale was a drug dealer in West Baltimore who purportedly survived twenty-one gunshots, some of which were fired while Barksdale was in hospital after a prior, failed murder attempt. When he was young, a man ran over Barksdale’s leg with his truck after Barksdale stole from him. As a result, Barksdale underwent an amputation and subsequently became addicted to opiates. 'Still a criminal': The Drug Enforcement Agency said Barksdale is still a high-ranking official of the prison and street gang, Black Guerrilla Family, despite his claims that he's gone clean . Imposter? Barksdale had been working for Safe Streets, a program in which former criminals help rid the streets of the violent crime they once perpetuated, when he was arrested . In 1985, Barksdale was sentenced to fifteen years in state prison for battery. In 2003, he was acquitted of a federal charge of being a felon with a gun. David Simon, the creator, executive producer and head writer of The Wire, denies that Nathan Barksdale or any other individual is the basis for any specific character in the show. However, in his director's commentary to the first episode of The Wire, Simon said they tended to 'mix the names up'.

Douglas Hewitt has put up the same Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it in 1929 . A great-grandfather has put up his Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it from a toy shop in 1929. Douglas Hewitt, 84, has celebrated every Christmas with the artificial tree since he was born and he and his wife Mavis, 82, have once again put it up this year. Mr Hewitt's father bought the tree from Redgates toy shop, in Sheffield, just months after Douglas was born. The 4ft tree has been kept in its original red stand throughout the years and remains the centrepoint of the Hewitt family household during every festive season. Mr Hewitt, of South Anston, South Yorkshire, said: 'It reminds us of my childhood, our children's childhood and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's after that. 'They all come and look at it and smile, it's become part of the furniture. 'If we didn't put that Christmas tree up, it wouldn't feel like Christmas. It would be different.' The tree was passed down to Mr Hewitt when he married Mavis in 1951. Mrs Hewitt said: 'Douglas was born in 1929 and they went into Redgates and asked for a Christmas tree and they didn't have any. 'The only one that was left was in the widow so his father said, ""right, we will have that"". 'Year after year we have just carried on using that one. You have to be a bit more careful with it now as it's a little fragile.' Sadly, it may be the last year that the tree makes an appearance in the Hewitt household, as it stands on its last legs. Scroll down for video . Mr Hewitt and his wife Mavis (pictured in 1980) have once again put the artificial tree up, 84 years after it was first bought . Mr Hewitt has said the tree used to have more branches on it and had 'seen better days' but it is once again standing pride of place in the Hewitt family home . Their daughter June Murphy also has fond memories of the Christmas tree. Mrs Murphy, 60, said: 'It was in my grandparents' home and then it was given to us. 'The lights that are on there now have been there since we went to a three-pin plug. 'It's looking a little thin now as each time you get it out something else falls off. 'It's become a bit of a family joke. Each year someone has to comment ""not again!"" but it's a Christmas . tradition of getting the tree out that we all love.

Nearly two-thirds of people who have retired in Britain expect to leave an inheritance when they die of around £180,000, a report revealed yesterday. The research shows British people are far more generous - or simply far richer - than people in many other countries, with their children typically being the lucky beneficiaries. Of 15 countries which were investigated in the research, the UK came out third in the league table of inheritance windfalls around the world. It was beaten by Australia and Singapore where retired people expect to leave an average of £322,000 and £238,000 respectively. Of 15 countries which were investigated in the research, the UK came out third in the league table of inheritance windfalls around the world . By comparison, the average amount that retired people expect to leave as an inheritance windfall is £95,000. All the figures are based on the inheritance after taxes have been paid and include the value of any property. Overall, it found 64 per cent of people who have retired in Britain expect to leave an average inheritance of £182,144, which is nearly twice the international average. But many plan to be even more generous. One in five expect they will leave ‘over £250,000’ to their children or other beneficiaries, such as a charity, the local church, a more distant family member or a friend. The report, from the banking giant HSBC, also reveals how the future of retirement will dramatically change for today’s workers.

"By . Guy Adams . PUBLISHED: . 19:27 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:23 EST, 3 December 2013 . The phone call to Tom Daley’s biographer came a few weeks before the start of the 2012 Olympics. Chas Newkey-Burden recalls how a reporter from a red-top Sunday newspaper was on the phone, asking him about internet rumours that the then 18-year-old diver was in a long-standing gay relationship with a fellow member of the British diving team. ‘They rang me several times, looking for information about Tom’s sexuality,’ he told me yesterday. Revelations: Tom Daley has revealed he is dating a man in a heartfelt video message on his YouTube page . Supportive: Tom posted this image with his mother Debbie on Sunday night with the caption 'So lucky to have such a supportive mum! I love you!' ‘It surprised me that someone was . interested in running that kind of piece so close to an Olympics, given . the effect any scandal might have had on his chances of a medal. I . didn’t help.’ Sources close . to Daley are understood to have also denied rumours of the gay . relationship (which are, indeed, believed to have been unfounded). And . no article ever found its way into print. In . London a few weeks later, Daley won bronze. Touchingly, he dedicated it . to his beloved father and mentor, Rob, an electrician who had died, . after a long battle with brain cancer, at the end of 2011. Yet despite the outwardly happy ending, uncomfortable memories of the awkward episode have clearly lingered. 'He would be happy for me': Tom insisted his late father Rob would be proud of him no matter what . Indeed, . yesterday’s frank and fearless YouTube video, in which Daley declared: . ‘I’m dating a guy and I couldn’t be happier’, marks an effort to blow . away a cloud of speculation that had begun to hover over his private . life. Daley, born in an . unpretentious suburb of Plymouth, took up diving at the age of seven, . and quickly displayed a precocious talent. Aged ten, he won a national . youth title. By 12, he was beating adult pros. Aged . 14, he was selected for the Beijing Games, becoming the second youngest . male athlete ever to represent Great Britain at Olympic level. The . achievement brought instant celebrity. But fame can be a double-edged . sword: For like any other child star, he was forced to negotiate the . hurdles of adolescence under an unremitting public gaze. ‘In . common with quite a lot of gay or bisexual men, Tom has spent his . teenage years wrestling with his sexuality, trying to work out who he . actually is,’ a family friend tells me. ‘In his case, that was of course made particularly difficult by the fact that he’s famous.’ With . a hectic media schedule, partly attributable to lucrative sponsorship . deals with the likes of Adidas and Nestle, Daley was soon forced to . become adept at parrying questions about his romantic life. He talked of . being ‘married to my trunks’ or ‘too busy’ for a ‘proper girlfriend’. On other occasions, he allowed rudimentary details of relationships with . girls to appear in print. A . childhood flame from Plymouth was loosely hinted at. And a brief . dalliance with US diver Mary Beth Dunnichay, to whom he gave a ‘proper . kiss’ during the Beijing Olympics, was detailed in his autobiography. Inevitably, . perhaps, his sexuality became a matter of debate in cyberspace, where . Daley has become a target for gossip and taunts from those apparently . jealous of his fame and success. But reporters largely refrained from . raising the question in interviews. Sporting hero: Olympic athlete Tom put an end to years of speculation by admitting that he is bisexual . Still as motivated as ever: Tom insisted that the new relationship has done nothing to stop his motivation ahead of the Rio Olympic games in 2016 . Behind . the scenes, Daley endured a string of personal setbacks. In 2009 it . emerged that he was being mercilessly bullied at Eggbuckland Community . College, his state school, where peers called him ‘diver boy’ and . ‘Speedo’, and launched attacks that Daley’s family claimed had ‘a . physical dimension’. ‘Though . Tom never said as much, I do feel that the motivation for that bullying . had a homophobic element to it,’ adds Newkey-Burden. Soon after, Daley . moved to the fee-paying Plymouth College. And . in 2011 it emerged that his father Rob had been diagnosed with the . cancer which would later kill him. ‘Rob was a laid-back man,’ says a . reporter who knows the family well. ‘I don’t know if Tom ever discussed . his sexuality with Rob, but he’d have been very supportive.’ The . death left Daley, who has two younger brothers, as the eldest male in . his family, and the major breadwinner (his mother Debbie is a . housewife). Former loves: Tom previously dated US diver Kassidy Cook . Romance rumours: He was also romantically linked to teammate Tonia Couch, but she later denied the claims . ‘As a diver, . that’s tricky, because it’s not a sport where you ordinarily make a huge . amount of money,’ adds the reporter. ‘So after the 2012 Games, Tom . began to actively pursue a TV career, and to do that these days, you . need a celebrity profile.’ In . August 2012 Daley began stepping out with another American diver, the . Texan Kassidy Cook. He took her to the The Lion King musical in London’s . West End, and the Funky Buddha bar in Mayfair. Late . last year he was pictured hand-in-hand with reality TV star Lauren Pope . outside a paparazzi-friendly London nightclub. A public flirtation with . singer Cheryl Cole, via Twitter, generated headlines. And . there was no lack of female interest in his reality TV show, Splash!, . which attracted six million viewers when it debuted this year. Setting the record straight: Tom insisted he wanted to break the news in a video so his words could not be twisted and his fans would know the truth . 'Not been an easy decision': Tom tweeted a link to the video on Monday morning . On . Twitter, however, there were unpleasant incidents of homophobic abuse . which last year led to two arrests. His decision to ‘come out’ yesterday, with an at times very moving statement on YouTube, was . overwhelmingly well received, with many praising his courage  and . honesty. The former Wales . rugby star Gareth Thomas, who came out as gay in 2009, tweeted: ‘When . the dust settles Tom will realise today is the start of an amazing life. Congratulations.’ I gather . that Daley’s management had been considering the move, at his request, . for most of the year. Friends say it’s been on the cards since June, . roughly two months after he began a relationship with his current . boyfriend during time off from revising for A-levels (he achieved three A . grades). Daley’s coach Andy . Banks was one of several members of Daley’s advisers consulted in . advance of the move. ‘I responded in the same way many other people have . done,’ he tells me. ‘I just said, “Congratulations”.’ Screen star: Tom is also preparing for the second season of Splash!, and is seen here watching Gemma Merna prepare for a dive .","Tom Daley revealed the news in a heartfelt video on his YouTube page .

Lapwood claimed: 'I don’t think it was dangerous. I used it for about ten minutes, and it’s not as though I set any of my friends on fire. 'I used it well away from anyone, I never took it inside and I dismantled it after I used it.

They brought in counselors to soothe shattered nerves and parents to comfort the distraught. But authorities know they cannot erase the lingering effects of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School - students and faculty members still on edge, still traumatized by the sounds of gunshots and by the horrors they survived. In the new school building in the neighboring town of Monroe, police remain a presence. Signs ask people to close doors softly and not to drag objects across the floor. Since January the surviving students have attended a new school building in the neighboring town of Monroe, where police remain a presence . 'There are reactions to noises, doors slamming, things being dropped have a strong startled response,' said Newtown School Superintendent Janet Robinson. 'We're really just trying to have the whole school be as calm as possible.' A group of Sandy Hook Elementary School third-graders attending a Brownie meeting on a recent day heard a loud noise and looked around nervously. Though the troop leader assured them it was probably just someone pushing a cart, one girl began to cry. Parents have been volunteering as hall monitors at the Newtown school to help comfort the students still traumatized by the horrific events of Dec 14 . 'You can tell that every little sound that is made in that school, the kids are still extremely scared,' said Brenda Lebinski, parent of a third-grader who witnessed the episode. At home, Robinson said, parents say children have cried and asked, 'Is the bad man coming back?' 'Having your safety shattered for everyone involved - kids, parents, teachers, administrators - I think it's going to be very difficult to recapture that sense of safety,' Robinson said. Parents have been volunteering as hall monitors and aides to help comfort the students. Teachers, still coping with their own trauma, also struggle to make the children feel safe. 'I think they're exhausted, mentally, physically,' said Wendy Davenson, a therapist working with school staff. Newtown School Superintendent Janet Robinson says her students are still startled by loud noises such as doors slamming . 'It takes ages to create a safe environment after something like this. I think the teachers are trying so hard to do that for the students and yet some of them may not really feel particularly safe either.' On the morning of Dec. 14, a 20-year-old gunman entered the school and slaughtered 20 first-graders and six staff members before killing himself. Gunshots resounded through the school on the public address system; teachers hid with students in classrooms until they were rescued by police, and some passed the carnage on their way out. When the students returned to school on Jan. 3, it was in a different building - the former Chalk Hill Middle School. It had been refurbished, and desks and other equipment were brought in from Sandy Hook. But there was no way to pretend that the shootings did not happen.

Kiki Leyba, a teacher who survived the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, spoke last month to about a dozen Sandy Hook staff members. Leyba said he told them how he couldn't sleep, jumped at noises and looked for exits wherever he went, even church. Sandy Hook educators shared similar experiences, describing how they were jumpy around noises and had trouble sleeping and concentrating, Leyba said. 'I just can't say it strongly enough, if they spare no expense taking care of that staff, no one will ever regret it,' he said. 'The students will feel the benefits of that, the parents will feel the benefits of that. That staff is so traumatized.' Mental health services have been available from the beginning and will continue to be offered, Robinson said. Specialists trained in child trauma have been brought in, she said.

A few teachers have taken short periods of time off. 'We understand that this is a trauma that people take different lengths of time to get over and it may re-occur with some memory, so we're trying to be very understanding about that,' Robinson said. Survivors of such shootings can experience nightmares, flashbacks, hyper-vigilance in which they are constantly on the lookout for danger and startled responses, said Russell Jones, a psychology professor at Virginia Tech who counseled survivors of a mass shooting at his school. Between 8 to 15 percent of those who experience traumas such as mass shootings develop PTSD, but about half of them no longer have the symptoms after three months, he said. Sounds and smells associated with mass shootings can bring back memories of the horror, said Carolyn Mears, author of the book 'Reclaiming School in the Aftermath of Trauma.' Missed: Twenty children, all pictured, and six female staff members were gunned down on December 14 . Mears, whose son survived the Columbine shooting, said the high school for years had a sign on its entrance declaring the building a balloon-free school because the popping of balloons sounded like the echo of gunfire. The school also changed the sound of its fire alarm so that students and staff would not be reminded of the sound from the shooting, she said. 'The one message I would give to the parents, the teachers, the community itself it is possible to live through this kind of uncertainty and grief and loss and shattering experience and make a future that holds happiness and joy,' Mears said, noting that it will take time. Brenda Lebinski said she's heard from other parents that some children have outbursts they never had before. When she hears gunshots on TV, Lebinski's daughter tells her mother to turn it off immediately. Lebinski is coping by keeping her daughter busy with sports and other activities. Students returned to school on Jan. 3 to a different building which had been refurbished with desks and other equipment brought over from Sandy Hook . Another parent of a survivor, Stephen Delgiudice, said his 8-year-old daughter doesn't talk about the shooting, but appears to be doing well. 'The transition has been really nice. They've done everything one can imagine for the kids,' Delgiudice said. 'So far we're very pleased with the security at the school.' He himself turned to acupuncture and counseling to help him deal with the anger he felt. 'How could someone do this to these children?' Delgiadice said. 'How could this happen?'","Months after the horrifying massacre in which 20 children and 6 teachers were killed, the surviving students and faculty members remain on edge .

A new study has found people have a tendency to hide their problems for fear of being judged by others. File picture . If someone tells you they're fine, chances are they are anything but. Putting on a brave face and refusing to off-load problems on to family and friends were the trends that emerged when a charity examined the everyday problems and worries of 2,000 people. The results highlighted a tendency to hide feelings of worry or avoid 'showing weakness' for fear of being judged by others. The study showed the average person's approach to dealing with serious stress and worry and found we regularly seek to hide problems even from those closest to us to avoid being a burden. When putting on a brave face, the average Brit is most likely to bury serious concerns around health, financial problems or general mounting stress and utters the throwaway phrase 'I'm fine' eight times a month when in reality they aren't . The figures emerged in a study carried out by mutual healthcare provider Benenden Health in conjunction with the charity Beating Bowel Cancer. It also emerged six in ten admit to regularly 'putting on a brave face' in times of serious worry, while a quarter thought it embarrassing to show any signs of weakness with fears of being judged or labelled common. Paul Keenan, Head of Communications from Benenden Health, said: 'Putting on a ""brave face"" can often be our default mode when we are faced with issues which worry us out of a fear of appearing weak. 'But when this impacts our health and wellbeing we really need to address our reluctance as a nation to open up about these concerns and seek appropriate help. 'Speaking out an early stage when something is concerning us, particularly if that's a medical issue, can greatly increase our peace of mind and reduce the risks of the problem worsening. We shouldn't be afraid to talk about issues that worry us and ask for support to help us through the difficult times.' The study also found that the average person says something six times a day that they don't really mean,with telling people ""they're ok"" when it's far from the truth, the most common white lie told. And results showed 85 per cent think acting fine when really they're not is a common British trait. The research showed a fifth of those surveyed had been diagnosed with a serious ailment but told no one. File picture . No surprises then that nearly two thirds have put on a brave face at work and four in ten confess they have buried big problems in the past out of hope they would fade away. Worryingly, one third of people feel that they have no one to turn to in their personal life that they could share serious worries with. The trend extends even to those closest to us - more than half of those who participated in the study admitted to regularly masking pain from others and two thirds have kept a troubling health worry from a partner. A fifth said they've had a serious illness or ailment and told absolutely no one and the same number said they would always choose to keep a serious worry to themselves. Benenden Health conducted the research in conjunction with charity Beating Bowel Cancer to highlight the many health worries Brits fear talking about or sharing with people because of stigma and the fear of judgement. Mark Flannagan, Chief Executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said: 'It's worrying to see that people still aren't talking about their health concerns and are putting a brave face on things. Unfortunately bowel cancer is still a taboo. 'A deeply embedded fear of cancer and the embarrassment of talking about poo and bottoms sadly mean that too many people leave it too late to talk to their doctor. 'Over 90 per cent of cases can be treated successfully if caught early so it's essential people don't keep their health worries to themselves.' Even with loved ones we feel it necessary to hide our real problems- 63 per cent said in times of serious worry or stress they always opt to pretend that everything is ok in front of family or a partner. More than two thirds of people agreed that there is a common tendency to make assumptions about people who are troubled by certain illnesses or ailments. While over three quarters thought many illnesses or medical problems are still considered taboo and come with a great deal of stigma attached.","Study of 2,000 people revealed a tendency to put on a brave face .

Colorado, the state which has suffered two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, has approved a raft of new gun laws. After months of debate both chambers of the majority Democratic Colorado legislature approved a package of four gun-control measures yesterday. The most controversial of the bills, now headed to the desk of Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper, is a ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds, which the governor said he will sign into law. Reform: Colorado has passed four new gun control measures which include a ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds . Deadly history: People visit a memorial for the victims of the Colorado movie theatre shooting . The passage of the bills could push Colorado to the forefront of a national gun control debate reignited by several mass shootings last year, including the December massacre of 20 children and six adults at a school in Newtown, Connecticut. President Barack Obama has put forward a number of gun control measures in the wake of the Newtown school shooting. The sponsor of the Colorado magazine-limit bills, state House Representative Rhonda Fields, told fellow lawmakers in a floor debate on Wednesday the proposal was about 'saving lives.' Next step: The laws will now head to Governor John Hickenlooper who has indicated he will support most of the measures . 'These are weapons that should be used . in a theater of war and not in our local theaters,' said Fields, a . Democrat whose district includes the suburban Denver movie theater where . a gunman killed 12 people in a shooting rampage last July. Colorado was also the site of the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School, where two teenagers shot dead a teacher and 12 other students before committing suicide. Other bills included in the package of gun-control laws approved by Colorado lawmakers included a measure to make firearm buyers pay for their own background checks and a ban on online certification for concealed-carry permits, both of which Hickenlooper has said he supports. Another measure would bar gun purchases by people convicted of domestic violence crimes. Hickenlooper had previously said he was undecided about that until he could see the final version. One remaining gun-control measure to require background checks for all firearms transfers was sent to a conference committee yesterday, so that both chambers could hash out differences between the Senate and House versions. The proposals that won final approval had received little Republican support. Republican House minority leader Mark Waller issued a statement after the bills' passage, calling Democrats 'out of touch' with their constituents. 'More than 200,000 Coloradans are out of work but Democrats are more concerned with passing legislation that will send hundreds of jobs out of our state without any increase in public safety to show for it,' Waller said in a statement. Suspect: John Holmes, 25, is charged with the shooting of 12 people at the screening of a Batman movie at a theatre in Colorado . President Barack Obama has put forward a number of gun-control measures in the wake of the Newtown school massacre . Waller was referring to Magpul, a Colorado-based manufacturer of ammunition magazines that has vowed to leave the state and take away its hundreds of jobs if the magazine-limits bill becomes law. The Colorado legislature's action follows the passage in New York state in January of a sweeping gun-control law that bans assault weapons and magazines that hold more than seven rounds of ammunition, requires gun owners to register most guns with the states and requires universal background checks. On Tuesday, a divided U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee advanced to the full Senate a measure endorsed by Obama that would require criminal background checks for all gun buyers.","Includes ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:50 EST, 29 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:30 EST, 29 November 2013 . Violent Mexican drug cartels have muscled in to the country's lucrative mining industry during a mafia-style takeover of great swathes of the economy, officials warned. The criminal gangs looking to diversify their businesses long ago moved into oil theft, pirated goods, extortion and kidnapping, consuming an ever larger swath of the country's economy. But the true extent of their penetration into Mexico's massive mining and iron ore exporting industry, which feeds many Chinese mills, has now been revealed. Pressure: The Mexican authorities have been under intense pressure to crack down on the drug cartels operating in the country. (File picture) Such large-scale illegal mining operations were long thought to be wild rumor, but federal officials confirmed they had known about the cartels' involvement in mining since 2010. They also revealed that the military . takeover of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico's second-largest port, in November, . this year, was aimed at cutting off the cartels' export trade. That . news served as a wake-up call to Mexicans that drug traffickers have . penetrated the country's economy at unheard-of levels, becoming true . Mafia-style organizations, ready to defend their mines at gun point. Three . Michoacan state detectives were wounded in an ambush earlier this week . when they were traveling to investigate a mine taken over by criminals. When . reinforcements arrived, those officers were also ambushed, part of a . string of attacks on police in Michoacan on Wednesday and Thursday that . left two officers dead and about a dozen wounded. War on drugs: Mexican authorities have been waging a bloody war against the drug cartels for decades . The Knights Templar cartel and its predecessor, the La Familia drug gang, have been stealing or extorting shipments of iron ore, or illegally extracting the mineral themselves and selling it through Pacific coast ports, said Michoacan residents, mining companies and current and former federal officials. The cartel had already imposed demands for 'protection payments' on many in the state, including shopkeepers, ranchers and farmers. But so deeply entrenched was the cartel connection to mines, mills, ports, export firms and land holders that it took authorities three years to confront the phenomenon head-on. Federal officials said they are looking to crack down on other ports where drug gangs are operating. 'This is the terrible thing about this . process of (the cartel's) taking control of and reconfiguring the . state,' said Guillermo Valdes Castellanos, the former head of the . country's top domestic intelligence agency. 'They . managed to impose a Mafia-style control of organized crime, and the . different social groups like port authorities, transnational companies . and local landowners, had to get in line.' New tricks: Drug cartels are diversifying their business, away from narcotics, a tonnes of which are burnt by authorities after being seized in this image, to illegal mining, oil theft, pirated goods, extortion and kidnapping. (File picture) Valdez Castellanos said that even back in 2010, the La Familia cartel would take ore from areas that were under concession to private mining companies, sometimes with the aid or complicity of local farmers and land owners, then sell the ore to processors, distributors and even, apparently, foreign firms. Mexico's Economy Department said the problem was so severe that it prompted the government to quietly toughen rules on exporters in 2011 and 2012 and make them prove they received their ore from established, recognized sources. Many exporters couldn't. In 2012, the . department denied export applications from 13 companies, because they . didn't meet the new rules. And the problem wasn't just limited to . Michoacan, or the Knights Templar cartel. 'Since . 2010, evidence surfaced of irregular mining of iron in the states of . Jalisco, Michoacan and Colima,' the department said in a statement to . The Associated Press. 'That . illegal activity was encouraged by the great demand for iron by . countries such as China, to develop their industries,' according to the . department. 'Many trading companies began to build up big stockpiles of . legally and illegally obtained iron (ore), that was later shipped out . for export.' Profits: The Mexican cartels, which have built up a massive arsenal of weaponry are making huge profits by moving away from drugs and into other lucrative operations, including kidnapping, mining and extortion . A Mexican federal official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the cartels would use a combination of threats and outright theft to get the ore from mines. He said the nexus between the cartels and export companies was key. 'They extort the merchandise from mining companies and then export it through legal companies, or they rob trucks full (of ore) that later turn up in a legal manner,' the official said. Ofelia Alcala, a resident of the Michoacan mining village of Aquila, said that since 2012, the Knights Templar cartel has demanded residents hand over part of the royalty payments from a local iron ore mine operated by Ternium, a Luxembourg-based consortium. Alcala, a member of a self-defense group that rose up in arms in Aquila this summer to kick the cartel out, said the cartel also had been hiring people to extract the ore without permits, and then exporting it through another Pacific coast port, Manzanillo. 'They weren't content with getting our money and robbing our trucks, so they began secretly extracting our minerals,' said Alcala. Under attack: Bullet holes are seen over a police vehicle and a police station wall after an attack by members of a local drug cartel - one of many which is seizing control of swathes of the economy. (File picture) Ternium said in a statement that it has received reports of irregular mining near its operations in Aquila. 'Those have been passed on to the appropriate authorities,' the company said in a statement. Government figures show the amount of iron ore being exported to China quadrupled between 2008 and the first half of 2013, rising to 4.6 million tons per year, precisely during the period the La Familia cartel and later the Knights Templar cemented their control over Michoacan. In 2008, Lazaro Cardenas handled only 1.5 percent of Mexico's iron ore exports to China; by mid-2013, the seaport was shipping out nearly half. In 2010, the attorney general's office estimated the cartels shipped 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore abroad that year. Officials said the export scheme may have involved other sea ports, and that more military takeovers may be necessary. The cartel mining issue also resurfaced last year in the coal-mining state of Coahuila bordering Texas. The former governor, Humberto Moreira, called a press conference to claim that Heriberto Lazcano, leader of the Zetas cartel, was running illegal coal mining ventures and partnering with legitimate ones. So far, none of the accusations have been proven. The only known arrests related to cartel mining operations occurred in Michoacan in 2010, when Ignacio Lopez Medina, an alleged member of La Familia, was accused of selling ore illegally to China, the federal Attorney General's Office said at the time. But the arrest apparently came to little; the Attorney General's Office could not say whether Lopez Medina had been tried or convicted of that crime, nor could The Associated Press determine if he is represented by a lawyer or is still in custody. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce did not immediately respond to requests for information on companies that have been involved in buying ore from cartels, knowingly or otherwise. The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on whether China had any measures in place to ensure the legal provenance of such imports. The iron ore, meanwhile, has both swelled the cartels' bankrolls, giving them more money to buy guns and bribe officials, and fed the hunger of Asian steel mills. And it may be a two-way trade: Precursor chemicals the cartel uses to make methamphetamines often arrive from China at both the Lazaro Cardenas and Manzanillo ports.","Criminal gangs muscled into mining sector as early as 2010, officials admit .

No matter how you dress them up, Brussels sprouts are one Christmas tradition that many children could do without. Over the years, attempts have been made to improve the flavour, adding sweet glazes, chestnuts or pieces of smoked bacon, but in many, many cases to no avail. Now Waitrose has worked with growers in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire to develop two varieties that they insist are ‘kid-friendly’. Charlie Heath, four, says he likes these Brussels sprouts, but not 'the yukky ones Mummy makes' According to scientists, children are not just being fussy when it comes to the knobbly sprout - reluctance to wolf them down stems from survival instinct, as harmful toxins tend to have a bitter taste, just like sprouts . The kid-friendly sprout, which has a nuttier, sweeter taste, hits Waitrose shelves next week for a limited period, and it is hoped that children themselves will be piling them into the parental shopping trolley . Importantly, they have a milder and less bitter taste, making each mouthful a sweeter experience. The poor little sprout is often rejected by people both little and large alike due to its perceived bitter taste, so the supermarket giant has worked secretly with its farmers over the past year to create a milder flavour sprout that is low on bitterness and high on sweetness. The Waitrose 'kid-friendly' sprout will arrive in branches this week for a limited period in the run up to Christmas. Pugh . According to scientists, children are not just being fussy when it comes to the knobbly sprout. Reluctance to wolf them down stems from survival instinct, as harmful toxins tend to have a bitter taste, just like sprouts. Sweetness, on the other hand, usually indicates that something is safe to eat, which is why children adore biscuits, cakes and Haribo. But there is a good reason why parents ought to urge their little poppets to eat Brussels sprouts: they have twice as much vitamin C per 100g than oranges do, approximately 115mg as opposed to 54mg. Amy Lance, Chief Sprout Taster at Waitrose says: 'The humble Brussels sprout is a wonderful bundle of deliciousness, but so often overlooked by children or picky eaters. 'We have worked hard over the past year to develop this sprout which we believe will win over even the most ardent sprout haters. We hope it will get a massive thumbs up from children this Christmas and encourage them to ""eat their greens"".' Charlie Heath, age four, said: 'I like these sprouts. I don't like the yucky ones my Mummy cooks.' Over the course of the sprout season Waitrose will sell approximately 15 varieties of sprouts, including the flower sprout and red sprout.

Brussels sprouts sales are booming and prices are falling, which means the traditional festive favourite is set for a revival this year, new industry figures show. Better weather this season has led to a bumper crop of the vegetables that children love to hate at Christmas, which means better supplies, lower prices and bigger sales, it reveals. Year-on-year sales are up 23 per cent by volume and 18.5 per cent by value, said analysts Kantar, looking at the most recent trading period covering 12 weeks to mid November. Better weather this season has led to a bumper crop of the vegetables that children love to hate at Christmas, which means better supplies, lower prices and bigger sales . This is a major recovery on the same time last year when bad weather had led to a failed crop which in turn saw prices rise just as households were cutting budgets. But this year's glut, after warmer, drier, weather means prices are coming down in time for Christmas. The average price of sprouts from the suppliers to the shops has come down from £3.88 a kilo a year ago to £3.59 a kilo last month, said Kantar in the trade journal The Grocer. This may not seem a big fall but at a time when many food and drink products are rising in price, it will be welcomed by shoppers more used to price rises than falls. And supermarkets are expected to use the falling price in their own special deals to entice Christmas shoppers. Year-on-year sales are up 23 per cent by volume and 18.5 per cent by value, said analysts Kantar, looking at the most recent trading period covering 12 weeks to mid November . Richard Mowbray of commercial suppliers TH Clements told The Grocer: 'We have seen an increase in promotional activity versus the same period last year and also some deflation which has helped to push volume.' Andrew Ovens of suppliers Produce World Group added: 'Unless this changes as we move into the peak season, sales should continue on this trajectory.' The good news comes as the humble sprout itself is changing with innovations including a sweeter version to tempt children, an M&S sprout/kale hybrid and a sprout flavoured Christmas cake from Ocado.","New sprouts are nuttier and sweeter than standard variety .

Despite protesting that he knew nothing about the disappearance of the gifts from Bonner's house, O'Brien repeatedly punched the 47-year-old grandfather in the face, causing him to hit his head against a wall. Christopher O'Brien (left) and John Bonner (right), who left an innocent man to die after he was beaten up during a lynch-mob-style hunt for a burglar . Later the victim who suffered from a pre-existing illness began to complain of headaches and the following morning was found collapsed in his home by his partner who phoned an ambulance. Mr Sheldon described as a 'proud family man with a big heart and a loyal friend to all that knew him,' was taken to hospital but he died five days later from his injuries. At Manchester Crown Court, O'Brien, of Gorton, admitted manslaughter and was jailed for nine and a half years. Bonner, of Openshaw, pleaded guilty to affray and was jailed for 16 months. The tragedy occurred in November last year after Bonner came home from a night out to find his house had been looted of Christmas presents. He was led to believe a local man known as 'Irish Tony' was involved in the raid and he recruited his uncle to help him with his man hunt. Their search took them to Mr Sheldon's home in Openshaw where Bonner confronted Mr Sheldon on the doorstep demanding that he tell him if the man responsible for the burglary was at the house. Innocent: Victim Norman Sheldon who was targeted by vigilantes thinking he was harbouring their suspect . But when Mr Sheldon told him he did not know where he was, a balaclava-clad O'Brien ran inside and began to punch the victim repeatedly about the face causing him to fall against the wall and bang his head. Both Bonner and O'Brien then fled. The following day on November 19, police were called to the house and found Mr Sheldon unconscious. He was taken to hospital for treatment to serious head injuries and but died on November 24. Police initially treated the incident as murder. But in mitigation O'Brien's lawyer Nicola Gatto said her client was 'horrified' at Mr Sheldon's death. He thought the victim would be merely 'battered and bruised'. Sentencing, Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'You and your nephew were taking the law into your own hands that day. The courts will not tolerate that kind of behaviour - it's almost akin to a lynch mob. 'His injuries were no doubt made worse because of his frail condition. Mr Sheldon merely opened the door to you - his reward was that he was beaten by you, as a result he died. In the immediate aftermath you were boasting.' Today, Mr Sheldon's daughter Gemma said in her statement on behalf of herself and brother Jamie: 'Since the guilty pleas my brother and I have both started to accept that our dad is not coming back. 'I am satisfied that they have accepted their guilt and admitted to their actions - but I still feel very angry and sick in the pit of my stomach that somebody could do that to another person.

Detectove Inspector Andy Cunliffe, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Bonner and O'Brien decided to take the law into their own hands and in doing so a doting father, grandfather, brother and uncle needlessly lost his life. 'The law cannot tolerate persons who take matters into their own hands and the sentences that they have been given clearly reflects this.

A mother-of-three sparked outrage when it was revealed she continued to claim benefits after winning £95,000 on Deal Or No Deal. Caroline Banana, 40, from Stoke-on-Trent, received the windfall after appearing on the TV game show in April 2011 and was eventually punished in April of this year when her case went to court. As previously reported in the Daily Mail, she was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to repay more than £6,000 after admitting six counts of fraud. Many felt the sentence was lenient given her crimes and that she should have gone to jail. But . a new BBC documentary has revealed that she wouldn't have faced justice . at all if it wasn't for the efforts of investigators at Stoke-on-Trent City Council. Paul . Bicknell, benefit fraud manager at the council said: 'It's quite . distressing when you think how many people are in difficult situations . and here's someone who has just walked away with a tax free lump sum of . £95,000 and yet still feels it's ok to keep claiming all the benefits . she can.' Despite her . being seen on Deal Or No Deal pocketing the fortune, this was . not enough to for the council to accuse her of fraud after she carried . on claiming benefits. Britain . On The Fiddle, which airs on BBC One on Wednesday evening, shows how . Banana was only able to be charged after evidence was built up against . her following months of research and surveillance. Steve Prince was the main investigator for the council in Banana's case. He had to stake out her house . and her children's school for weeks to track her movements. He also had to trawl her bank accounts and Facebook page to find evidence of her deceit. He explains on the documentary what drove him to become a fraud investigator and why he was determined to bring Banana to justice. He said: 'I was bought up on an estate with a family of nine, none of us would ever dream of claiming benefits fraudulently. When you hear of people doing it, it does get to you.' He added: 'She's . been claiming benefits from people like myself that contribute to that . system. When she won the money, it was the time to say thank you for your help, I don't . need that money anymore.' But instead, Banana didn't declare her winnings and carried on claiming income support, housing benefits, single person discount on council tax and free school meals for her children. Thanks to her winnings and benefits, she drove a 4x4, took a seven week holiday in Turkey and started a business buying and renting properties in the country. Cheat: The mother won £95,000 on Deal Or No Deal but continued to claim benefits - and would have gotten away with it if the council hadn't investigated . To catch her out, the council had to get written evidence from Endemol, the TV company who makes Deal Or No Deal, that they had paid Banana £95,000. When this was confirmed, they then searched Banana's bank records and found she had divided the fortune between three different accounts she had opened in her own name. She was also earning undeclared money by doing shifts as a receptionist. As well as claiming she needed benefits in order to live and feed her children despite her game show winnings and earnings, the investigators were intrigued to see her with her ex-husband on the show. She was meant to have separated from Michael Thabo in 2008 but he played the dutiful husband  during her Deal Or No Deal appearance. Caroline on the game show with presenter Noel Edmonds: She spent seven weeks on holiday in Turkey with her winnings while taxpayers paid her income tax and rent . Mr Prince were alarmed to see them . acting like a couple when Banana was claiming housing benefit as a . single occupier in Stoke and Thabo was doing the same in Stockport. On her Facebook page, he found further evidence the couple were still together. He found pictures of them on holiday and Thabo still had his relationship status listed as 'married to Caroline Banana.' Mr Prince also uncovered that Thabo had come from luxurious beginnings before coming to the UK with his family as political . refugees. His father had been president of Zimbabwe before Robert . Mugabe seized power and the family had lived well in a state house. The . council eventually had enough evidence to confront Banana and . interviewed her. She admitted she had funded her seven week holiday with . her winnings from Deal Or No Deal. Built up a case: Paul Bicknell, left, and Steve Prince from Stoke-On-Trent City Council were determined to bring Banana to justice and their efforts are revealed in a new documentary . When . asked what she thought taxpayers would think about her winning . thousands while still claiming benefits, she replied: 'They wouldn't be . happy.' She was charged and appeared at Staffordshire Magistrates Court in April where she was sentenced to the unpaid work and ordered to replay £6,000.

Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has regularly been criticized over his website's privacy settings, has had the tables turned on him in a documentary about online privacy. When the social network's founder was approached by a film crew outside his California home, he asked not to be filmed, but unbeknown to him the filmmaker continued to record their encounter using a camera hidden in his glasses. The encounter was part of Cullen Hoback's documentary Terms and Conditions May Apply, which examines internet privacy. Scroll down for trailer . Privacy settings: Mark Zuckerberg asked not to be filmed when the documentary crew questioned him outside his home . 'Do you still think privacy is dead? What are your real thoughts on privacy?' director Mr Hoback asked Mr Zuckerberg outside his home. In the clip Mr Zuckerberg, 29, asked: 'Are you guys recording?' Will you please not?' before relaxing after seeing that the main camera had been switched off, according to the Huffington Post. After believing that he was no longer being filmed, Mr Zuckerberg suggested that the film crew got in contact with his company's public relations department. Mr Hoback, whose recently released documentary has been well received in the wake of the NSA scandal and revelations that the government had collected information on millions of Americans, said he had wanted Mr Zuckerberg to experience privacy infringement. 'I just wanted him to say, ""Look, I . don't want you to record me"", and I wanted to say, ""Look, I don't want . you to record us"".' Mr Hoback said. Mr Zuckerberg has changed Facebook's terms and conditions on several occasions. Most recently, the network began rolling out its Graph Search, making it even easier for people to find information and photos of the site. Denied access: Leigh Van Bryan, left, was denied entry to the U.S. because of a tweet he sent . Timing: Cullen Hoback's documentary has been well received in the wake of the NSA scandal . The new service has been labelled a privacy nightmare by Slate, which warned that 'likes' from several years ago could now be easily viewed by others. Mr Zuckerberg has also been criticized in the past after he referred to web users as 'dumb f***s' for trusting him with their information, in an instant-message . conversation when he was 19, the Huffington Post reported. However, Facebook remains the largest social network in the world, with more than 1 billion users each month. In Terms and Conditions, Mr Hoback examined the agreements web users have been asked to sign up to by social network sites and other online services, and looked at who was sharing and collecting the information. The film includes interviews with people who found themselves in trouble with the law after posting comments on Twitter that were taken out of context by authorities. In one case, tourist Leigh Van Bryan was held by passport control at Los Angeles airport and then refused entry to the U.S. in January 2012 because of a tweet he sent three weeks early to a friend that said: 'Free this week for a gossip/prep before I go and destroy America?' Privacy act: Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook has faced criticism over its privacy settings . 'I think the craziest thing about this whole experience is that I didn't realize I was making a horror film,' Mr Hoback told the Daily Telegraph, adding that it would take the typical internet user about 180 hours to read all of the terms and conditions for their favorite websites. In the film, a MIT professor of social studies claimed that the world had woken up to privacy concerns about four years too late, according to the Chicago Tribune. Mr Hoback told the paper: 'I think the primary question needs to be not even do the systems work - but is this a mass infringement on civil liberties?' The film opened July 12 and is being shown in various U.S. cinemas.","Film crew wanted Facebook founder to 'experience privacy infringement'

Google has unveiled a new streaming video gadget which will give users easier access to Internet content on their televisions - taking aim straight at Apple's attempt to move into the living room. The new device, called Chromecast, is a small stick roughly the same size as a USB flash-storage drive that can be plugged directly into an HDMI port on flat-panel TVs. It syncs with users' smartphones, tablets and personal computers to bring Netflix, YouTube and other Internet content to what is usually the biggest screen in households. Google's plan to take over the living room: A demonstration showing Google's new Chromecast device syncing between a television and a laptop running Google Chrome to show a video from the Vimeo website . Launch party: Mario Queiroz, Google's vice-president of product management, holds the new Chromecast dongle as it is announced during a Google event at Dogpatch Studio in San Francisco, California . Google wants to have a presence on TVs because it could open up a lucrative new channel for it to sell more ads, which bring in most of its revenue. In a show of its determination to make inroads on TVs, Google yesterday began selling Chromecast for just $35 (£22.85). That price undercuts the most popular Internet-streaming devices made by Apple and Roku. An Apple TV box sells for $99 (£65), while the least expensive Roku box capable of showing high-definition video goes for $80 (£50). Roku, a company that formed within Internet video subscription service Netflix, also sells an Internet streaming stick similar to Chromecast for $100 (£65). Simplicity: In a move that has allowed Google to keep costs down, the hard work of processing video is done on a synced device, with Chromecast providing an easy interface to display the content on the big screen . Chromecast, which leans heavily in . Google's widely used Chrome Web Browser, is just the latest product from . the company intended to make inroads into the living room. Previous . offerings haven't worked out well. The company initially tried to embed an operating system called Google TV into sets made by TV manufacturers, but that flopped. Last . year, Google introduced an orb-like device called the Nexus Q in hopes . of delivering more Internet video to flat-panel TVs, only to quickly . pull the product from the market. With the Chromecast, in . a move that has allowed Google to keep costs down, the hard work of . processing video is done on the synced device, with the stick merely . providing an easy interface to display the content on the big . screen. The Apple and Roku . streaming boxes, by contrast, are standalone gadgets connected directly . to the Internet which rely on a standard remote control to select . content. Chromecast shown controlled by a Google Nexus tablet: By offloading the hard work to a separate device, . Google has been able to keep costs down to a very competitive $35 (£22), . including three months  of Netflix . More expensive: The Chromecast is competitively priced against the Roku box, left, which starts at around £50, and the Apple TV device, right, which usually also sells for around £50 (U.S. prices) Forrester Research analyst Sarah Rotman Epps said Chromecast could undermine Apple in the still-nascent market to plug streaming devices into TVs, just as the Nexus tablets have siphoned some sales away from Apple's iPad. 'Chromecast looks like a smart and disruptive device,' said Ms Rotman Epps. 'Maybe it took the other failures for Google to get it right.' It faces stiff competition, but its comparatively reasonable price could see it come to dominate a rapidly growing market. Earlier this year, Apple revealed that it has sold more than 13million of its streaming boxes. Roku said its sales of streaming boxes passed 5million units this year. As an enticement to get people to try Chromecast, Google is offering three months of free Netflix service with a purchase of the Internet-streaming stick. That translates to a $24 value, leaving the cost of the device at $11 for those who would have gotten Netflix anyway.","Chromecast connects straight to HDMI ports to stream content from users smartphones, tablets and personal computers .

Traditional GCSE alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications. The A* to G system will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine, with nine being the highest, say exam watchdogs. Other changes include an end to different papers for pupils based on ability, except in subjects where they are considered necessary. 'I got a nine!': Traditional GCSE alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications, which are being totally revamped . Exam regulator Ofqual will also confirm today that end-of-course exams are to become the ‘default method of assessment’, killing off modular tests in most subjects. They will generally be sat in the summer, ending the merry-go-round of pupils entered early or multiple times in the hope that they eventually score a good grade. The changes apply to English literature, English language and maths being taught from September 2015. Other subjects will follow the year after. Chief regulator Glenys Stacey admitted the move would be ‘challenging’ but added: ‘The changes will make sure they are better qualifications – better assessed and more resilient so that everyone can have greater confidence in the results.’ The reputation of GCSE has collapsed amid concern about grade inflation, easy modular assessments, dumbed down content and endless retakes. The nine numerical grades – one more than the current alphabetic system – will provide a clear distinction between middle and higher grades, Ofqual said, and reduce ‘bunching’ around the B, C and D grades. The extra grade is also intended to ‘signal that new GCSEs are new qualifications’. However, making nine the highest grade will fuel speculation that there is room to add more in future – in a similar way that a star was added to A grades. Mrs Stacey insisted this was unlikely but refused to rule it out. She added: ‘People will want to make comparisons between the new and old grading scales and to know which new grade is the same as an existing C grade, for example.’ It all rides on this: Exam regulator Ofqual will also confirm today that end-of-course exams are to become the 'default method of assessment' Governments of all political stripes have spent almost 100 years tinkering with the exam system. From 1918, 16-year-olds sat the School Certificate, in which candidates had to pass maths, English and three other subjects. It was abolished in 1951 when O-levels were introduced. Pass grades of A-E were developed  for the predominantly exam-based qualification, although some boards used 1-6. Fails were shown by a U grade or 7-9 respectively. From 1975, all boards adopted the letter-based system. CSEs were available from 1965 for less able pupils, with a Grade 1 the equivalent to a C at O-level. Students last sat the exams in 1987, and they were replaced the following year by GCSEs. The new qualifications made widespread use of coursework and controlled assessments and were graded A to G, with a U for fails. A* grades were first used in 1994 to show the highest level of achievement. But dumbing down and grade inflation under Labour led to many public schools ditching GCSEs in favour of alternatives such as IGCSEs, which have an option to do no coursework. Since the Coalition came to power, attempts have been made to restore  their reputation. Grade inflation was suppressed and other changes included giving more marks for correct spelling, grammar and punctuation. Plans are also under way to change the curriculum. Both the English and maths exams are . tiered at the moment, with foundation papers available for weaker . pupils. In future, all candidates will sit the same exams in English . literature and language, giving everyone the chance to achieve top . grades. Maths will remain . tiered, however, reflecting a huge difference in ability among . candidates. To avoid cherry-picking results, anyone who retakes a . subject will have to sit all the exams again. Only . having end of year assessments could also help boys, who are . outperformed by girls in almost every subject but are believed to . perform better under exam conditions. But Christine Blower, general . secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the changes would be . confusing to the public. Labour schools spokesman Kevin Brennan said it . was ‘odd’ that the Conservatives wanted more rigorous exams when they . allowed unqualified teachers in some schools. And Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, claimed the reforms had been ‘rushed through at breakneck speed, driven on by a political imperative, rather than the needs of pupils’. Pupils first sat GCSEs in 1988, replacing the old two-tier assessment structure of  O-levels and CSEs.","Changes will make clean break with current discredited qualifications .

Costco has left itself open to fresh ridicule by putting the faux memoir of a cult film character in its 'non-fiction' section - weeks after labelling the Bible fiction. Staff at a branch near to Los Angeles appeared to not realise that Ron Burgundy: Let Me Off At The Top was a work of comic fiction about Will Ferrell's cinema anchorman. It comes after the retail chain was forced into a humbling apology after a Southern Californian pastor tweeted a photo showing copies of the Bible labelled as fiction. Non-fiction: Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy in Anchorman. Costco has been left red faced after mislabelling the character's faux-memoir as 'non-fiction', weeks after outraging Christians by labelling the Bible fiction . That mistake had led some devout Christians to attempt to organise a boycott of Costco, which blamed the error on its distributor. The latest gaffe was spotted by LA Times columnist Robin Abcarian on a recent visit to her local Costco. But charitably she said she 'can't totally blame Costco for mislabelling' the book. 'The cover of this book sports a picture of a mega-mustachioed Will Ferrell, in character as San Diego’s fictional TV anchorman,' she wrote. 'If you aren’t a reader, don’t know anything about popular culture and perhaps haven’t been to the movies in a decade, it’s perfectly understandable that you might slap a “nonfiction” label on this faux memoir. 'Perhaps Costco, or its distributor, believes that Ron Burgundy is real.' Fiction: Pastor Caleb Kaltenbach (right) was surprised to find Bibles at his local Costco labeled as 'Fiction' Her sympathetic perspective was very different to the outrage from fundamentalist Christians over the mislabelled Bibles publicised by Simi Valley-based pastor Caleb Kaltenbach last month. 'Dear @Costco I'm sorry...But the #HolyBible is not fiction. I will not be buying your goods as a result. #BoycottCostco,' wrote Dan Trigona on the micro-blogging website. Domenica DeSantis added: 'very disappointed in costco stores. a bible should NEVER be in the fiction section. my faith is not ""fictional"" thank you. #smh.' The chain quickly apologised for the label, saying that a distributor had made a mistake on a small batch of the Bibles and that they would be immediately addressing the issue. 'We take responsibility and should have caught the mistake. We are correcting this with them for future distribution,' Costco said.

Surgeon: Dr Philippe Leynaud, 62, has been struck off - six years after his first misconduct hearing . A bungling French eye surgeon who blinded three of his patients has finally been struck off - six years after his first misconduct hearing. Dr Philippe Leynaud, 62, was employed to cut waiting lists at Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset by carrying out cataract operations at weekends. His employers compensated four of his patients after botched operations prompted legal claims. Three lost their remaining sight in the eye while the fourth was ‘severely visually impaired’. But the consultant ophthalmic surgeon was allowed to continue working in Britain after a General Medical Council panel stopped short of imposing a ban in 2007 and said that conditions were enough to protect the public. Three years later a review panel extended the conditions, which were due to expire next month, but the doctor has been struck off at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester. The panel decided the doctor, who has not worked in the UK since 2003, had not shown enough insight into his actions or any evidence that his skills had improved. Chair Gill Mullen said: ‘The panel considers Dr Leynaud to have demonstrated a persistent lack of insight into the seriousness of the consequences of both his deficient performance and lack of commitment to remediation. ‘The panel has concluded that these departures from good medical practice pose a serious risk to patients and to the public interest, and are therefore so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with continued registration.’ Eye surgeon: Leynaud was employed to cut waiting lists at Yeovil District Hospital (pictured) in Somerset . She added: ‘Accordingly, the panel has determined that, in order to protect patients, to maintain public confidence in the profession and to declare and uphold proper standards, erasure is a necessary and proportionate sanction in this case. ‘The panel recognises that this removes Dr Leynaud’s ability to practise medicine in the UK but considers that, in all the circumstances, this is an appropriate response to the risks posed by his lack of insight and apparent unwillingness to engage in remediation. ‘The panel has therefore determined to erase Dr Leynaud’s name from the medical register.’ During the 2007 hearing, Leynaud claimed the cases were ‘more complicated’ than the ones he dealt with in France. The surgeon was recruited through Deluca Medical Limited, a French company which sources doctors to provide services in Britain. Within months of taking up the post his bosses became worried about his rising rate of post-operative complications. An audit of 50 patients found 26 per cent had pre-operative problems compared with the national average of just 7 per cent. And 40 per cent had post-op complications - almost double the expected rate. It emerged that 20 of Leynaud’s 69 patients had experienced significant problems following surgery. In one test Leynaud correctly answered 49 out of 135 questions. The minimum for a pass is 90. Leynaud was not present or represented at his final hearing, but has previously stated in emails to the GMC that he had no intention of returning to Britain. Ms Mullen said: ‘There is no evidence before the panel to indicate that Dr Leynaud has remedied any of the deficiencies in his performance in any way in the three-year period since the last review was undertaken. 'Dr Leynaud’s professional practice remains deficient' Gill Mullen, Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel chair . ‘Further, whilst the doctor has given brief details of his work in France there is no independent verification of the standard of his practice. ‘In the absence of any independent evidence that Dr Leynaud’s practice no longer poses a risk to patients, the panel has concluded that Dr Leynaud’s professional practice remains deficient.’ She added: ‘Dr Leynaud’s lack of engagement and insight casts significant doubt upon his willingness to respond positively to the retraining that is required to address his deficiencies. ‘He has failed to appreciate and act upon the findings about his unacceptable performance, which might give rise to harm to patients and to the reputation of the profession. ‘Further, the doctor’s disregard for his obligations in respect of his professional regulator, regardless of the fact that it is, for him, in an overseas jurisdiction, could seriously damage the reputation of the medical profession and undermine public confidence in doctors.’ Leynaud will be struck off the medical register 28 days after he receives notification of the decision, subject to appeal.","Dr Philippe Leynaud was employed at Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset .

The triplets were produced when a single, fertilized egg split into three - a one-in-a-million chance especially considering the triplets were conceived naturally . Dr. William Gilbert, director of Sutter Women's Services, says the odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from 1-in-1-million to 1-in-100-million. He said the rarity makes it difficult to more accurately calculate the frequency of such births. Abby weighed 3 pounds, 2 ounces; Brin 3 pounds, 11 ounces; and Laurel 4 pounds. 'It is not unusual with identical triplets to have a difference in weight,' said Dr Gilbert. 'They usually don’t share equal amounts of the placenta so therefore one gets a little less nutrition than the other. When you have a difference in weight, the little one does better after they are born because the stress of being little matures your lungs faster.'

Just days after reports claimed Apple was halving production of its iPhone 5C because of 'dismal sales' in China, new figures show the model may equally be floundering in the U.S. too. Figures from a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners survey show that during last month, the iPhone 5C accounted for just 27 per cent of Apple's total iPhone sales. This is half the amount of 5S models sold, at 64 per cent, and only three times the amount of sales for the two-year-old iPhone 4S handset, at 9 per cent. Analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners shows Apple is selling twice as many higher-end 5S phones than its lower-priced 5C in the U.S. The 5S accounted for 64% of sales, pictured, while the 5C made up 27% and the iPhone 4S came third with 9% . Official figures from Apple claim the tech giant sold nine million new 5S and 5C handsets during the first three days on sale. These figures smashed the firm's own records - working out as 125,000 an hour, on average, or around 2083 a minute. Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012. However, only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two - and it wasn't made available in China immediately. Despite the success of the 5S, figures also show it couldn't match the amount of iPhone 5 sales during the same period last year. The iPhone 5 debuted at 68 per cent - four per cent more than the current high-end model. The news comes just days after Chinese . website C Technology reported sales of the cheaper iPhone 5C have been 'dismal'. It added Apple is believed to have halved production of the model as a result. Suppliers claim they have gone from making 300,000 handsets a day, on . average, to just 150,000 and there are also reports prices are dropping . across the region in a bid to attract buyers. The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time Apple had made the handsets available in China from launch. Previously, Apple launched handsets in key regions including the UK and the U.S and would roll out the handsets to other areas, including China, in the following months. C Technology claim that although the iPhone 5C was touted as a cheaper option, it costs a similar amount and has 'no particular highlights - making it unappealing to new buyers. The site adds that although prices of the iPhone 5S have remained high, the cost of the iPhone 5C has also dipped in certain areas from 4,488 yuan (£459) to 3,500 yuan (£358). Official Apple figures show the firm sold nine million iPhone 5S and 5C, pictured, handsets during the first three days they were on sale. However, Apple did not say what proportion of this amount was for each model. Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012 . In an investor note last week, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said: 'During our visit to Apple stores and resellers this week in China, we have found that there is healthy interest in the iPhone 5C. 'However, we believe this has not yet translated into exciting volume levels in China.'

A generation of children have remained living in the homes of their middle-aged parents, according to the latest official analysis of British households. It found the number of families who squeeze more than one generation of adults under the same roof is rapidly increasing. The rise in the number of stay-at-home children and ‘boomerang’ children, who return after university, has contributed to a new breed of ‘two-family’ home – the fastest-growing type of household. The new family life: A generation of children have remained living in the homes of their middle-aged parents, and their numbers are rapidly increasing, according to the latest official analysis of British households . The report from the Office for National Statistics found that the number of married couples living ‘without dependent children’ has risen by 200,000 since 2003. Although this includes childless couples, the ONS said the increase is due to the growth in homes  with adult children, who are too old to be classed as ‘dependent’. This means they are over 18, or 16 if no longer in full-time education. One in every 100 homes now has two families, the report found, largely because grown-up sons or daughters who stay with their parents are bringing partners in to live with them. The analysis also said an increasing number of single parents are finding their adult children reluctant to leave home. While more young people crowd in with their parents, the Families and Households report found a rise in middle-aged people living alone. Around 7.7million people now live by themselves and single-person households aged between 45 and 64 have risen by more than a quarter in the past decade. Many have never married or are divorced. At the same time the number of 20- and 30-somethings living alone has fallen as many more choose to live with their parents. Priced out: The fresh evidence of the spread of the stay-at-home generation comes amid concern that house prices have put homes beyond the pockets of all but the best-paid . The fresh evidence of the spread of the stay-at-home generation comes amid concern that house prices have put homes beyond the pockets of all but the best-paid, forcing many to remain in their childhood homes. Earlier estimates have said there may be as many as three million young people aged between 20 and their mid-30s who have always lived with their parents. Yesterday’s analysis based on the state-run Labour Force Survey,  which questions more than 150,000 households, said there were nearly eight million married or civil  partner couples living without dependent children – a rise of 200,000 in a decade. The ONS said the increase was driven by young adults who have ‘delayed leaving the parental home or returned to it’. It found a 39 per cent rise in homes classed as containing two or more couples. The ONS said these include households such as ‘a married couple with their son and his girlfriend’.","Rise in stay-at-home children has led to new breed of 'two-family home'

Now in her latest autobiography Love, Lipstick And Lies she opens up about the tender relationship she shares with her eldest son and the daily challenges her family faces in looking after him. Tender bond: Katie Price with her son Harvey seen here at the World of Golf in Sidcup, Kent share a strong bond . The 35-year-old says she finds it a shame that his dad footballer Dwight Yorke doesn't play a part in his life. He only spoke to Harvey on his tenth birthday because Katie's mum had phoned his manager to say he should. She . said: 'Dwight wouldn't even admit he was the father until a DNA test . proved he was. He was gobsmacked when Harvey said to him (on the phone) ""So when am I seeing you?"" 'It's . such a shame. All I can say is he's missing out on a very special . little boy. Dwight should try.

She has . apparently 'lost count of the number of televisions' her 11-year-old . son Harvey has smashed when he's had temper tantrums and has had to fit . Perspex screens to avoid it happening again.

But she is . happy to tell how her tender relationship with her disabled son has . blossomed and insists that her main goal is to give him the best . possible start in life. The reality star can anticipate when he's going to . have a tantrum and deal with it before it happens. But admits sometimes it happens too quickly to do so. She said: 'I wish all those people who show ignorance about the disabled condition could spend a day with Harvey and see the reality of looking after a child like him. Harvey was recently diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and Oppositional Defiance Disorder. Along with his autism all . three conditions make a huge impact on his behaviour. ADD means that he finds . it hard to concentrate and focus and the ODD makes him aggressive meaning he needs constant supervision. Routine is everything: Katie Price (pictured above) takes time out of the strict daily routine the entire family follow with children Princess Tiaamii, Junior and Harvey . at 'The Lion King' 3D film premiere, London in 2011 . New beginnings: Katie Price and her new husband Kieran Hayler arrive back in the UK after their wedding earlier this year and Katie with ex-husband Peter Andre who is no longer in Harvey's life (pictured here in 2009) Katie explains Harvey can dominate family life, which is hard on Junior and Princess, but appreciates most families with a disabled child will experience these struggles.

The bomb squad and a team of police dogs then searched Flight 5573 for dangers for several hours yesterday evening.

Steve Martos said: 'This is one of those types of incidents where, out of an abundance of caution, we would prefer to go through his tedious process to ensure there's no actionable, viable threat rather than let it continue and something actually occur. 'Any threat that we receive, we are going to take extreme caution and extremely seriously.' Safety: Passengers are led a safe distance from the plane which was forced into an emergency landing after a member of the flight crew discovered a suspect package on board . He said that a bomb squad and police dogs searched the plane and luggage 'to make absolutely sure there's no threat,' and nothing dangerous was found. Passengers were screened by bomb squad officers for any explosive substances and all were found to be clear. They were allowed to continue with their journey later yesterday evening.

But officials are remaining tight-lipped about the specifics of the threat or nature of the package. Officials at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport said the plane landed at 4:45 p.m and had been given the all-clear by 7.15pm. Sky Harbor spokeswoman Deborah Ostreicher told the Associated Press: 'No further information is available about the specific security issue that caused the flight to be diverted to Phoenix, but the passengers are all safe and police are investigating.' The plane that was searched was isolated on the northwest side of airport and Sky Harbor officials said the incident wasn't causing any flight delays.

Natasha McShane's family in Silverbridge, County Armagh, have decided not to tell the 27-year-old woman - who was left unable to walk or talk - about the trial in case it brings back too many memories of the horrific attack. Jury selection in the case begins on Tuesday. Her alleged attacker, 34-year-old Heribeto Viramontes, faces 25 felony counts, including armed robbery and attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Victim: Natasha McShane, 27, is unable to walk or talk after she was brutally beaten with a baseball bat in Chicago in 2010. Her family have decided to keep her in the dark about her alleged attacker's trial . 'We wouldn't say that to her, in case it . brings back memories,' her father Liam McShane told the Chicago Tribune. 'Maybe . someday if she can get better, she'll have to know. But I don't feel . that I have to tell her now.' Natasha was a student when she and her friend Stacy Jurich were attacked by a bat-wielding robber as they walked home after a night of dancing at 3.30am on April 23, 2010. Viramontes allegedly smacked both women across the head with a baseball bat before taking off with their purses and jumping in a car driven by his accomplice, Marcy Cruz, 28. Cruz, who pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder and received a sentence of 22 years earlier this year, told prosecutors Viramontes had spoken about committing a robbery that night.

Jurich . needed 15 staples in her head but survived the brutal attack with . lesser injuries than her friend, who is now unable to walk or speak and . must be cared for by her parents around the clock. Accused: Heriberto Viramontes, 34, allegedly struck both girls in the head with a baseball bat before stealing their purses. His accomplice Marcy Cruz, right, has already been sentenced to 22 years . Struggle: The victim's parents Sheila and Liam McShane, pictured in June 2010, now care for their daughter around the clock. They will be attending the trial with her two siblings but will not tell her . Her father said her endurance has improved and she now goes to physical therapy three times a week. He said she particularly loves the pool, with the help of a special lift that lowers her wheelchair. 'She loves the pool,' he told the Tribune. 'You know from her face, her eyes and her . smile.' They must still cut her food and she is unable to tell them when she needs the bathroom.

At this time of year, usually between the crisp and lush pages of a new autobiography, celebrities do battle to out-confess each other with ever more lurid personal disclosures. Why? For a start, the Christmas market is coming up fast and competition to get on the best-seller lists is intense. One of the most dependable ways to ensure that your life story stands out on the shelves is to lard it with a revelation or two that will both shock your fans while also neatly encouraging their sympathy. Queasy: Any sex attack is vile, but one has to wonder about Amanda Holden's motive in hinting at the identity of her attacker . My Binge Hell. I Was a Love Rat. My Secret Marriage Woe. You know the sort of thing. And strangely enough, these headline-grabbing divulgences, these marmalade-droppers du jour, always tend to follow a trend. They track unfathomable tectonic shifts deep below the crust of the celebrity world, which somehow finds them all suffering from the same thing at the same time. The recent fad for 'I was bullied' confessions follows on from the bipolar confessions of yesteryear. Those were a departure from the bulimia and assorted eating disorder confessions that were once all the rage; a progression from previously popular alcohol, drug or sex addiction confessions. And now the new black - certainly the new black market - is for shocking sex-attack revelations. Over recent weeks and months, we have learnt the following: that Amanda Holden was sexually attacked by a 'famous comedian' at a glitzy function when she was still married to Les Dennis; that a 20-year-old Madonna was raped at knifepoint on the roof of a Manhattan building. That Tulisa Constostavlos was drugged and date raped by someone she considered a friend when she was a teenager. That Danniella Westbrook was gang-raped during a three-day ordeal in South London. That Katie Price has suffered multiple rapes and sexual assaults, including an attack by at least one celebrity rapist. Similar revelations: Recently, we've learned that a 20-year-old Madonna was raped at knifepoint and that Tulisa Constostavlos was drugged and date raped when a teenager . There are others too numerous to mention - not to forget Ulrika Jonsson, whose 2002 autobiography Honest was one of the first to prominently and explosively feature such an attack. In her case, it was a sexual assault at the beginning of her career by a television presenter she did not identify. Famously, media speculation led to former Blue Peter presenter John Leslie being named as the alleged culprit - although Jonsson, to this day, has refused to confirm or deny it. Following this revelation, several other women went to the police with accusations relating to indecent assault by Leslie. During the subsequent court case, all charges against him were dropped - and he was never charged with any offences against Jonsson. Despite this, Leslie's name was blackened and his career in showbusiness effectively finished. Amanda Holden, in her new autobiography No Holding Back, seems to have strayed into the same insidious, murky territory. Yes, any sex attack is sickening and vile. Yes, any decent person will feel sympathy for her. But one still has to wonder what her motive is in describing her attacker as a 'famous comedian' and locating the assault at a much-photographed media event within a narrow timeframe in the summer of 2000. 'Now the new black - certainly the new black market - is for shocking sex-attack revelations.' Hinting at his celebrity status only invites, as surely it was intended to do, prurient speculation as to his identity - some of which will undoubtedly fall on the shoulders of innocent men. Meanwhile we can only assume the guilty party is free to carry on molesting other women unchecked. Then and now. A more responsible course of action for Miss Holden might have been to go to the police and name him - I'm assuming that did not happen - or entirely refrain from dropping vague but still poisonous clues as to whom he might be. That doesn't help anyone or anything - except of course her book sales. So forgive me for being cynical, understand that I do not minimise the distress and misery of female sex attack victims, appreciate that I view any sex attack against a woman as a matter of the utmost gravity. However, I do have misgivings about this gathering movement, this stormy front moving in from the west, for female celebrities to suddenly reveal sex attacks that happened to them many years ago; attacks that were never reported to the police or officials. Attacks that have been kept secret from friends, family and even husbands for a variety of deeply personal reasons. Attacks that are now being lobbed into the public domain, with all the subtlety of a fizzing grenade. To what purpose? Well, that is the big question. What is the point of revealing such shocking molestations years, even decades, after the event, if the victims have no intention of making a complaint or seeking justice for these crimes? Grey area: Katie Price, queen of the confessional autobiography, let slip the name of her rapist but never reported her attacker to the police . Perhaps the celebrities feel such confessions help other women, especially those who have suffered similar assaults? There is certainly some merit in that, although my worry is that they encourage the notion that the best course of action for a woman who falls victim to a sexual assault is - in the short-term, at least - to put up and shut up. Keep it to yourself until you have a safe platform, a book to sell, then use the worst experience of your life as a kind of currency to endear yourself to the public. How is that supposed to help any woman who has been attacked? If anything, it cheapens their suffering. Out in the real world, there are ordinary women who have been dragged off the streets and viciously raped, who have suffered terrible indignities and worse at the hands of men. Yet they have had the courage to go to the police, to endure the ordeal of a trial and to hopefully see the men who have wronged them put behind bars, where they cannot harm any more women. And since it was launched a year ago, Operation Yewtree has encouraged nearly 600 alleged victims, for better  or worse, to make complaints of sexual misconduct, against Jimmy Savile  and others. 'What is the point of revealing such . shocking molestations years, even decades, after the event, if the . victims have no intention of making a complaint or seeking justice for . these crimes?' I can't help but wonder what all those women - and men - who have come forward feel about the bleats made  by our celebrity authors behind the safe and glossy barricade of their  hardback books. It is one thing to walk into a police station and name a suspect. It is quite another to merely make a toot on the publicity trumpet, throw it out there, get it off your chest and hope for the best. That is not to say that reasons these women have for finally going public with their ordeals are entirely worthless. The motivations for doing so are often difficult and complicated. And they are different in every case. Amanda Holden kept her attack secret even from her then husband Les Dennis - why? Because she was afraid he would make a scene. The incident happened when she was trying to reconcile with Dennis following her brief affair with Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey. This had ended, with much public opprobrium, a few weeks earlier. Holden writes in No Holding Back: 'During our first tentative weeks at trying again, we went to an event together and on my way back from the loo I was cornered by a famous comedian, who tried to kiss me and put his hands in places they shouldn't have been. 'I was scared and tried to push him away, making light of it so he would leave without causing a fuss, but he wasn't put off. 'As I tried to fight him off, I caught sight of our reflection in a mirror. My body went limp, and I just stood there as he groped and nuzzled me, observing myself from afar.' No holding back: Discussing her attack might boost book sales, but Amanda's failure to report the incident suggests that violence against women is something to be endured . Now married to music producer Chris Hughes, the Britain's Got Talent judge said the attack left her feeling 'cheap and utterly worthless.' It would take a hard heart not to feel her pain. Certainly many women, particularly those who wrongly blame themselves for their ordeals, will understand Holden's complex undertow of emotions and self-recrimination. Four years ago Katie Price, the multi-volumed queen of the confessional autobiography, wrote in her magazine column about a celebrity who had raped her, leading to the usual speculations. She then let the alleged attacker's name slip off-camera during the filming of her ITV2 reality show What Katie Did Next. What Katie Didn't Do next, at any time, was to report her attacker. She even refused to make a statement to police following her revelations. Should she be blamed for that? It is a grey area. Many thousands of women have been sexually assaulted and never say a word about it. In many instances, they suspect they would not be believed. Perhaps they blame themselves for allowing the bad situation to arise and feel they should have done more to control it. In many cases, women simply cannot face the ordeal of being dragged through the courts - an entirely understandable reaction. Yet despite this, for celebrities and non-celebrities alike, the experience can burn into their souls for years. Perhaps there is comfort to be had in the knowledge for victims that other women, other famous women in particular, have suffered in the same way. However, the danger is that female stars divulging such attacks years after the event, sandwiched between cheery chapters on childbirth and meeting Simon Cowell, can actually do more harm that good. It might boost their book sales and enhance their noble suffering. But it does suggest that violence against women is something to be endured, to be shrugged off, to be kept a terrible secret and swept under the carpet - until it has a commercial value that can be cashed in.","In Amanda Holden's new book, we learn she was sexually attacked .

Killed: Keiron O¿Rourke, 40 of the U.K., were part of a jump that involved 200 other divers at Skydive Arizona when the accident occurred, police said . Two skydivers were killed Tuesday after they collided during a jump, collapsing their parachutes and sending them plummeting to the ground. The men — one from the United Kingdom and another from Germany — were among about 200 people trying to set world records for group jumps. Participants met on Wednesday and decided getting back in the air was the best way to pay tribute to their friends, many of whom know each other from other skydiving events around the world. 'Of course it makes me a little nervous, but this kind of thing happens. That's the price of skydiving,' said Evgenii Dolgopolov, of Moscow, Russia, who witnessed the accident. He planned to jump again Wednesday. 'This kind of thing happens sometimes, but it's very rare,' he added. Witnesses told investigators that both . skydivers had open canopies when they ran into each other 200 feet . above the ground. The two then fell to the desert floor with a loud . thump that could be heard from several hundred yards away. The accident . occurred at about 4:50 p.m., said Sgt. Brian Jerome, an Eloy police . spokesman. A third skydiver was injured in an unrelated accident. Tribute in the sky: Nearly 200 skydivers, from all over the world, perform a group jump, a day after two skydivers were killed after colliding in midair during a jump from Skydive Arizona, at Eloy Municipal Airport . Rehearsing: O¿Rourke had logged 849 jumps in his lifetime, with 100 in the last six months, while German jumper Schmehl logged 1,707 jumps, 80 in the last six months. Schmehl died at the scene while O¿Rourke died at a nearby hospital . There but for the grace of God go I: Two skydivers, who did not want to speak to the media, walk back to the airport after they joined nearly 200 skydivers, from all over the world, to perform a group jump . Eloy police identified the victims Wednesday as Keiron O'Rourke, 40, of the United Kingdom, who had logged 849 previous jumps; and Bernd Schmehl, 51, of Germany, who also was highly experienced, with 1,707 jumps. The skydivers are in Arizona for Square One World Sequential Series 2013, a gathering aimed at setting numerous world records for group skydiving with participants from around the world. Registrants paid $2,050 to sign up for the event, sponsored by skydiving equipment dealer Square One. It includes 28 jumps over about a week. Nearly home: Skydivers, from all over the world, float to the ground with their parachutes open after performing a group jump . Community loss: Richard Luczak, of Poland, said he 'lost friends yesterday' walks back to the airport after joining nearly 200 skydivers, from all over the world, to perform a group jump the day after two skydivers were killed . The registration website says organizers were looking to assemble a team of the most talented skydivers and would arrange the exact size of each formation jump based on the number of highly skilled skydivers who applied to participate. Skydive Arizona, between Phoenix and Tucson, has become one of the nation's top skydiving spots since it opened in the 1980s. The location is ideal because the weather almost always cooperates, providing clear, sunny skies most days of the year. And the vast, uninhabited desert provides plenty of jumping opportunities. Skydive Arizona bills itself as having the largest aircraft fleet in the world for skydivers with 12 planes, as well as the world's largest drop zone. Company officials said in a statement there were no problems related to the aircraft or equipment, and the weather was optimal at the time of the deaths, which occurred on the group's fifth jump of the day. They declined to comment further. Sharing the experience: After joining nearly 200 skydivers on a group jump, skydiver Martial Ferre, of France, talks about the jump that killed two skydivers after they collided in midair during a jump on Tuesday . Participants in this week's event said the setting sun around the time of Tuesday's jump was bright and might have caused the victims to lose sight of each other. They also noted it's important during group jumps to not get caught up in taking in the scenery. 'The first thing I do is look around,' said Martial Ferre, from France. 'I don't enjoy the view of this desert of Arizona. I just look for the others, and I look for a safe landing zone.' As he carried around his parachute gear after a group jump Wednesday with about 180 others, Ferre said getting back in the air was the right thing to do after the tragedy. 'We had to increase the morale of everybody,' said Ferre, who was close friends with the victims. 'The first thing that we did was to ask people, 'Do we want to continue jumping?' Everybody wanted to get back into action to bring this record in memory of these two guys.' According to the United States Parachute Association, there were 19 fatal skydiving accidents in the U.S. in 2012 out of roughly 3.1 million jumps as the industry's safety record continues to improve. In the 1970s, the sport averaged about 42 skydiving deaths per year.","The collision occurred more than 200 feet above the ground .

A young boy has been caught on camera shooting dead a family friend in a horrific accident at a Russian shooting range. The child was playing with a rifle, not knowing it was loaded, when it went off and killed the man as he wandered down the range. An instructor was supposed to be supervising the 12-year-old at the time, and could now face legal charges for failing to ensure that the gun was handled safely. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Killing: A boy is pictured sitting down and firing a rifle which he did not know was loaded . The tragedy took place at a shooting club in the suburbs of Moscow, according to LiveLeak. CCTV footage shows the child's mother and a male friend, who had just been firing a rifle, wander down the range to inspect the target they had been aiming at. The boy sat down at a table and started handling the gun, overseen by a female instructor. The instructor pulled out her camera phone and offered to photograph him while he pretended to fire the rifle. Danger: The 12-year-old's mother was standing with a friend at the other end of the rifle range in Moscow . The boy, apparently unaware that the gun was loaded, picked it up and pulled the trigger. A shot rang out, and then the man dropped to the ground, as can be seen in the video. When police were called to the scene, they determined that the victim had died instantly. Accident: The man instantly fell down dead after being shot in the head by the boy . The boy is not expected to face any official action, as he was only playing around and could not have known that the gun was in fact loaded. However, the instructor could face charges for allowing the 12-year-old to play with the rifle, according to LiveLeak. The incident is believed to have taken place on Sunday. It was initially reported by Life News, the website of Russian tabloid Tvoi Den.","Accident at a shooting club in Moscow was caught on surveillance camera .

Men, if you thought a handshake was a simple case of grip, shake and release, you are very mistaken. The humble handshake is in fact a weapon of seduction in disguise, with hanging on to her hand for as long as possible being the key element to finding love... apparently. According to website Attraction Methods, which specialises in showing men how to win the women of their dreams, a clingy handshake is just one of many ways to win a woman over. Scroll down for video . Magic the instructor and owner of seduction company Attraction Methods demonstrates how to hold a woman's hand . Holding on for as long as possible is the key to making it special, he enthuses as the model grins manically . The latest video tutorial explains that as well as continuing to hold onto a woman’s hand while you speak to her, how you let go is important. ‘Magic’, the instructor who runs Attraction Methods, suggests rather than just releasing the hand, a man should gently stroke along the palm as he slides his hand away. We're not sure how many women out there will agree. Attraction Methods claims to teach men how to ‘meet, attract, and date women using proven, easy-to-learn tactics.’ Women, according to another one of the website's short videos, simply need to be led ‘inch by inch’ to the place where ‘they don’t want to be but men want them to be.’ As well as cringe-making pulling tutorials the website sells full DVD kits whose contents should make single women shudder.

Attraction Methods is a global operation offering a dating coach service and a full on ‘pick up artist boot camp' in London. ‘Parts of London such as Kensington and Chelsea have 2 single females for every male but the men better have deep pockets or superb attraction skills because the women here are wealthy and attractive,’ the dating coach page informs men. ‘The rules of dating have also changed drastically with women getting higher education and better jobs. ‘Making women fall in love in London is not as easy as it used to be. ‘Sure there are lot of Eastern European women who are still feminine but there is a huge number of men competing for a small number of European women,’ it continues.

Having trawled the world's shopping outlets, Mark had it confirmed that the future Queen of England is particularly fond of sales at UK high-street store Reiss. During a visit to Bicester in February . while doing research for his new book, Bargain Fever: How to Shop in a .

Bargain-hunter: The Duchess of Cambridge can be found rifling through the 60 per cent off sale rack at Bicester designer outlet village in Oxfordshire, according to sales guru Mark Ellwood . 'I got chatting to a beautiful English rose behind the counter and asked why they were so many Chinese shoppers in the store - there are no Reiss stores in China - and she said: ""Oh, it’s Kate Middleton – she’s in here all the time."" 'She said, ""You look up and there’ll be Kate and her same two friends going through the 60 per cent off rack. You have no idea she's there and security must be outside, but she comes in all the time. And she's totally different to the Prince of Thailand, who I heard shut down a restaurant and brought his own staff when he visited Bicester.""' It’s not the first time that the Duchess of Cambridge has been linked with Bicester. Speaking to Sadiah Bte Shahal, the . wife of Singaporean senior parliamentary secretary for the ministry of . defence, Maliki Osman, on the first day of her and the Duke of .

At the time an assistant at the . store told Grazia: 'Kate bought the dress here. We were all surprised to see her and it was great to see her wearing it alongside the Queen and Duchess of Cornwall.' Mark said: 'The future Queen of England can't take anything free, she cannot endorse anything. 'I love this image of people going to Bicester and getting a sighting of the future Queen of England.' 'You look up and there’ll be Kate and her same two friends going through the 60 per cent off rack' And . it's not just the Duchess who loves a bargain, as Mark points out: 'Lady .

'Another friend of mine styled Jada Pinkett and she tried on a bracelet . and said ""this is beautiful"" – this is normally celebrity code for ""give it to me"". But she said: ""How much is it,"" he replied $50,000 and . she said ""could you work on the price and invoice us?"" – she paid for . everything.' Brit-born Mark was inspired to pen his book after noticing the steady stream of sales in stores. He . said: 'Ten years ago, retailers sold between 10 and 15 per cent of . their inventory at some sort of promotion - today they sell between 40 . and 45 per cent at promotion. Shopping guru: Paying full price is so passé, says Mark Ellwood . 'I was walking around and seeing lots of sales signs and when I shopped online I felt like an idiot if I hadn't found a coupon code, somehow I felt robbed! I wanted to know if there was something behind this and went to a researcher who gave me the numbers and I felt this was a fascinating story of how sales have doubled and why this has happened.' He joked: 'My mother's Scottish, she puts two five pound notes in her wallet and she thinks they're like giant pandas and if she looks away they might breed! I grew up very comfortably, but my mother takes great pride in her value driven-ness, she's very Scottish.' During his research for his book, Mark said he discovered: 'There is no reason to pay full price ever and there is no reason to accept full price – and if you do, you're a fool. You can always find a way to get a legal discount. Do you pay cash? Do you ask nicely? There is always an angle.' It was after moving to New York from London 15 years ago that Mark discovered his passion for a bargain at the Strand bookstore in Manhattan, where you can find 'dusty half-price books'.And it wasn't long after that that he discovered the shopping nirvana that is Century 21 in the city. He revealed: 'I go to Century 21 twice a year, the first two weeks of February and the first two week of August. That's when the showrooms clear out the backlog of that season's inventory. Twice a year it's a piñata of goodies… The rest of the year go for towels and socks! 'You go three times a week at 8.30am you go and look only for the names of the brands that you like - you don't browse - buy everything you like in any size that might fit and take it home. At the end of two weeks, go through everything you've bought, try it on and then take back whatever doesn't fit.' When it comes to online shopping, Mark has a tried and tested formula: 'It's cart abandonment. You have to treat shopping online like a date with someone new and cute, you mustn't put out on the first date. Instead, put the item in the cart, close the window, wait for it to go on sale and you'll create your own bargain.' Discount queens: Mark reveals that both Lady Gaga (left) and Martha Stewart (right) are fond of a bargain . In exploring the world of bargains, Mark . also unveiled the ploys that major 'high end middle market' chains use . to draw shoppers. Using J Crew as an example, he said: 'J Crew is one of my favorite brands, but they have decoy products in their stores, which exist solely to make everything else seem cheaper. 'J Crew launched the J Crew collection with a $900 blouse and everyone asked, ""who would buy that?"" But NO-ONE'S  going to buy it – it's not meant to sell, it's meant to make the $200 blouses that used to be $150 seem cheaper. 'J Crew puts expensive decoy products in stores, which exist solely to . make everything else seem cheaper' 'The J Crew collection is sprinkled throughout the stores, with the $350 dress next to the $200 dress to make it look cheaper. Shoppers are being manipulated and you have to be aware. 'We have this crazy irrational reaction to money - we don't think logically. If you get $5 off something, that goes into a magical pot that's no longer real money, you can spend it on anything... If it was still in your bank account you'd treat it like normal money, but this is weird bonus money.' He advised: 'Every sales assistant wants to make their four per cent commission and you have to start thinking ""they want to sell me this."" 'Start visiting your favourite stores, make friends, learn when the assistants work and buy a little cheap thing, full price. They need to know that if they look after you they will have a guaranteed sales stream. 'Then they'll invite you to the pre-sale, which is the secret sale that happens BEFORE the sale. By the time the sale signs go up now anything good is gone. So pre-sale you take your loyalists and you offer the sale to them. 'There is always a discount to be had.'

More than half of couples don’t manage to consummate their marriage on their wedding night, a new study has found - with alcohol, stress and exhaustion named as the top passion killers. Here, four writers confess what happened that night for them, revealing that for some, it seems, passion always finds a way... Too tired and tipsy: More than half of couples don't consummate their marriage on their wedding night . Jenni Murray, 63, lives in Cheshire with her second husband David. They have two sons. She says: . Too much to drink: Jenni's marriage didn't get off to a passionate start . It was 1971 and I was all of 21. I'd met Brian Murray (yes, it's his name I began working with and it stuck, even after the divorce) at university. He was handsome and funny - a dead ringer for my movie star of choice, Robert Redford, and we were very much in love. You'd think that nothing could stand in the way of an appropriately amorous wedding night. He never actually proposed, so I guess getting married was simply mutually agreed. It was social suicide openly to 'live in sin' in those days. Our mothers would probably have murdered us. So, off I went to church in the full white monty. My mother had gone into overdrive making plans for the wedding of her only child and the whole day was exhausting. It was a huge relief to arrive at a small country hotel in North Yorkshire for the only honeymoon we could afford - a long weekend before heading off for our final year at university. Not one to miss an opportunity for residents' past time drinking hours and the chance for a convivial social occasion, Brian led me, not to the marriage bed, but to the bar. Eventually, after much imbibing, we hit the sack. 'Well,' said he, 'I suppose we’d better consummate this marriage.' I explained the room seemed to be spinning. I felt a bit sick (I wasn't used to drinking.) The feeling overwhelmed me. The bathroom was down the corridor. I ran as fast as I could, but I missed. I staggered back to the room, pale and shamefaced. 'I'm sorry,' I sobbed and passed out. He spent what was left of our wedding night clearing up the bathroom. No wonder it didn't last - we were divorced seven years later. Anne Atkins lives in Bedford with her husband Shaun. They have five children. She says: . Virginal bride: Anne couldn't wait to have sex . Did we make love on our wedding night? You bet we did! I'd been counting off the minutes for over a year. We were Christians so we were both virgins, and had been waiting for the night with the keenest expectation. My husband Shaun is a clergyman in the Church of England, and some years ago a counsellor asked us why we got married. Apparently he was expecting some pious answer such as, 'To help each other in Christian work'. We both immediately and unanimously replied, 'Sex'. Why else would you get married? Wild horses couldn't have kept us apart on our wedding night, on St Swithun’s Day, July 15, 1983, just after we finished our Finals. Funnily enough however, my mother unwittingly scuppered any sneaking off in the afternoon. She shared our Christian values, and also had a great sense of fun and love of life, and said she fully expected Shaun to 'take me off somewhere' in the two-hour gap between the main afternoon reception, in King's College, Cambridge, and the dinner and dancing in the evening. I was so embarrassed at her even having these thoughts that I made very sure we didn't. Instead, we went and had tea with friends of my parents. I made sure my hair remained up and tidy, leaving my mother in no doubt whatsoever that it hadn't been rumpled and tussled. At midnight, however, we retired, sober and excited to our hotel room and enjoyed a night of madly-looked forward to - and extremely inexpert - lovemaking. It was worth the wait. Esther Rantzen, 73, has three children from her marriage to Desmond Wilcox, who died in 2000. She says: . Heavily pregnant: Esther wasn't in the mood on her wedding night . The morning of my wedding day, December 2, 1977, dawned clear, bright and frosty. I woke with my heart pounding, struck with such intense bridal nerves that I turned to my husband-to-be, and said 'Desmond, we're rushing this.' He didn't agree. We'd lived together for ten years, I was 37 years old and our first baby was due in a month, yet still the prospect of getting married petrified me. I shook with terror throughout the marriage ceremony at Kingston Register Office. And when we drove that evening to the cosy riverside hotel we had booked for our wedding night, I was only just beginning to recover and was hardly 'in the mood'. Dinner that night didn't help. The hotel chef, realising what a hugely important night it was, decided to cook a traditional Austrian wedding breakfast for us. It was eight courses of incredibly phallic food. There were sausages with everything and a strange pyramid-shaped mountain of ice-cream to finish. By the time we reached the bridal suite I was not feeling at all well. I collapsed on the four-poster bed, and Desmond swiftly followed. Having consumed my share of the champagne it wasn't long before he began to breathe very deeply. I knew the signs. Any minute now he would pass out completely. As I leaned over him tenderly, his eyes opened and he smiled and said 'Come here, Barrel Belly'. It may not have been kind, but it was accurate - I must have been the biggest bride the honeymoon suite had ever seen. I suppose it's no wonder that I laughed, hit my new husband and fell asleep next to him. The next morning I rang my sister and suggested she bring her whole family to our honeymoon hotel to finish the mountain of food. It's a measure of my husband's tolerance that he forgave me and it's a tribute to our relationship that we survived our passion-free wedding night. Brian Viner, 51, is married to Jane, also 51. They have three children: Eleanor, 20, Joe 18 and Jake 15. They live in Herefordshire. He says: . Ashamed: Brian partied while his new wife went to bed . Jane and I had been living together for two years before we got married, on a crisp January day in Derbyshire, in 1993. But did we consummate our new married status on our wedding night at a country house hotel near Bakewell? We did not. In fact, to my enduring shame, we didn't even retire to bed at the same time. Jane was three months pregnant, her growing bump accommodated by an empire line wedding-dress, and half-way through the barn dance she made her excuses. But I felt an urgent need for more do-si-do-ing, so I carried on whooping it up until my new sister-in-law, Jackie, politely but firmly told me that my place was upstairs with my bride, not downstairs twirling other women around the dance floor. That's not why we didn't do it, though. There was just far too much to talk about, from what friends and relatives had worn, to how one or two of them behaved, to an assessment of the food, the drink, the speeches, and the look on a few faces when I referred in my own speech to our forthcoming baby. Almost everyone knew, but not a couple of aged aunts, one of whom went alarmingly, translucently pale and blamed her slack jaw on ill-fitting dentures. The next morning, the slightly oleaginous hotel manager sidled up to me as we were loading our presents into the car, and in a broad Derbyshire accent said: 'A very good choice, young man, if I may say so.' Much to our amusement, he conspicuously failed to take her to one side and give me the same stamp of approval. It became our first family saying, and we have cited it, on and off, ever since.","Jenni Murray was too drunk .

A mother found dead in a burning car is thought to have started the blaze which claimed her life and that of her son. Detectives investigating the deaths believe the bodies found close to a yacht club in Southend-on-Sea yesterday are those of Catherine Mhlaba, 45, and 16-year-old Beki Ali. Officers are looking at the possibility that Mrs Mhlaba started the fire in her black Vauxhall Vectra, with the aim of ending her life and killing her son - who had global delay, a condition which meant he had the mental age of a six-year-old. Witnesses described seeing the car roll forwards as if it were being driven before it suddenly burst into flames. Blaze: A mother and child found dead in a burning car in Southend-on-Sea, Essex have been named as Catherine Mhlaba and Beki Ali . Horror: Witnesses saw the car suddenly explode near a yacht club in an upmarket area of town . Firefighters were called to the scene in the upmarket Thorpe Bay neighbourhood, and took 30 minutes to extinguish the blaze. When police arrived around 5.30pm, they found the bodies inside the vehicle. The street where the pair were found, which houses and yacht and tennis club, has been cordoned off while investigations into the incident continue. Mrs Mhlaba and her son - who have not been formally identified - originally came from Zimbabwe, and were living in Shoeburyness at the time of their death. According to members of the local Zimbabwean community, the woman's father helped found the Movement for Democratic Change, the main political party opposed to president Robert Mugabe. Investigation: Police are investigating the possibility that Mrs Mhlaba started the fire which claimed her life and that of her 16-year-old son . Audrey Charowa, 34, an MDC activist from Basildon, said Mrs Mhlaba's family are 'shattered' at the news. She said: 'It is very shocking and we are all devastated. 'As you would expect the family are pretty shattered and have been talking to the police all day. 'We will now be paying tribute as an MDC. Obviously the whole Zimbabwean community is in deep shock. It was totally unexpected.' Writing on a Zimbabwean news website, . Mrs Charowa described the woman as a 'heroine' and said that the . community was in mourning after her death. One eyewitness, Mandie Cotton, was approaching the car when it exploded as she was out on a run. Her . boyfriend Paul Smith said: 'The car was rolling at the time, in a . normal driving position, before it exploded and she didn't know whether . someone had got out of the car when a fire had started. 'She was only 25 or 50 yards away from the car when it exploded so she was pretty shaken. She said it was really frightening.' Appeal: Police have asked witnesses to contact them to help them find out what happened . An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this very difficult time. 'These tragic deaths are being investigated by detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate. 'Their . investigation is currently looking at the possibility that Catherine . Mhlaba was responsible for killing her son and taking her own life by . starting the fire inside the car. 'Detectives are appealing for anyone with information to contact them at Southend on 101. 'They . are particularly keen to hear from a dog walker who may have been in . the area at about 5.20pm or anyone who may have seen the car at any time . either before or during the fire. 'Police are aware some people may . have taken moving footage or images on mobile devices at the time and . would ask for these to be made available to detectives.' Formal identification is expected to take several weeks.

As many as a quarter of teenagers abuse their boyfriend or girlfriend, according to a study published today. Almost half of the young people interviewed also said that they had been abused in their relationships, leading experts to demand that the Government take action. The abuse ranges from emotional abuse, for example controlling where a girlfriend or boyfriend can go, to physical and even sexual assault. Abuse: The study, which surveyed 1,203 children aged 13-14, found that almost half had experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse (photo posed by model) The findings are the result of a survey of 1,203 schoolchildren carried out as part of a major project examining attitudes to domestic abuse in young people. The three-year From Boys to Men study, led by Professor David Gadd of the University of Manchester, also found that some children thought that it was acceptable to hit your partner in some circumstances. Around 17 per cent of boys asked said it was alright to hit your girlfriend if she hit you first, and 11.5 per cent of girls agreed. A notable minority said that it was alright to hit a boyfriend or girlfriend when he or she hit out first, or if they found out their partner had been unfaithful . Both boys and girls thought it was more acceptable for a girl to hit a boy than vice versa. The From Boys to Men project surveyed 1,203 schoolchildren aged 13-14, and found that: . The study also looks at how young people refer to domestic abuse - and found out that young people were much more likely to use gentler terms such as 'put downs' or 'fights' to refer to incidents of abuse. In-depth interviews with young men who abused their girlfriends were particularly likely to refers to their actions as 'fights', which they were not prepared to 'lose' for fear of seeming weak. Interviews with abusers found that many of them would say that domestic abuse was unacceptable in general, but find excuses when asked about their own actions. Professor Gadd said: 'For these . groups of young men, many of whom are already outside mainstream . schooling, there are limits to what curriculum based learning can do.  A . more comprehensive programme of intervention is needed. 'The . experience of living with fathers who have been cruel and sadistic, . makes it harder for them to recognise what they see as less calculating . forms of violence as abuse.

Britain's burgeoning economic recovery will see house prices roar back to life, adding more than a quarter to the value of the average home in the next five years, according to official forecasts yesterday. A confident Chancellor George Osborne declared Britain back on track thanks to the Government’s economic plan, with growth set to more than double this year in the biggest upgrade for 14 years. Labour insisted that many families were still being squeezed, with increases in the cost of living set to outstrip wages until 2014 or 2015. Other critics warned of the dangers of a recovery built on a housing price boom and increased household debt. Smile when you're winning: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in the Commons yesterday . But there was little doubt that yesterday was a triumphant moment for Mr Osborne, whose Autumn Statement left a red-faced Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls floundering and facing damaging sniping from his own side. House prices are expected to rise by a ‘stronger than expected’ 5.2 per cent on average next year, another 7.2 per cent in 2015, and will be 10 per cent higher by 2018 than previously predicted – delighting homeowners, but raising concerns about another housing bubble and the potential for interest rate rises as soon as 2015. The boom will add about £45,000 to the value of a typical home between now and 2018, but Mr Osborne pointed out prices would still be 3 per cent lower in real terms than they were before the credit crunch started in 2007. Yesterday, economic growth forecasts were more than doubled by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to 1.4 per cent for this year and 2.4 per cent in 2014. ‘Britain’s economic plan is working,’ Mr Osborne told the Commons, saying the UK was expanding faster than any other advanced economy. ‘It’s a serious plan for a grown-up country. But the job is not done. By doing the right thing we are heading in the right direction. Britain is moving again: let’s keep going.’ Hailing the ‘sacrifice and endeavour’ of the British people, he said Labour had been proved ‘comprehensively wrong’ for insisting there would be no return to growth until public spending taps were turned back on. In a deeply political statement, Mr Osborne said he would tighten the rules for tackling the budget deficit. Britain should run a ‘small cash surplus’ by 2018, he told MPs, revealing that a new ‘charter for budgetary responsibility’ would be put to a Commons vote just months before the next general election. It would mean that once the public finances return to the red, the cash will have to be used to help pay down debt. In only 11 of the 65 years since 1948 has the UK government recorded a surplus, now forecast for 2018. Mr Osborne insisted the Government’s welfare squeeze must continue, also challenging Labour to sign up to a new, permanent cap on most benefit spending before 2015. The Chancellor’s plans were calculated to box Labour in, leaving the opposition open to charges of fiscal irresponsibility if it refuses to back the Government’s proposals. The OBR said that by 2018, when it expects the budget to be in surplus, the Government’s ‘consumption of goods and services’ – essentially day-to-day spending on public services and bureaucracy – will have fallen to its smallest share of national income since 1948. Other key measures and forecasts in yesterday’s statement included: *A boost for business, with employers’ National Insurance scrapped for workers under 21 and business rates capped. * Unemployment to fall from 7.6 per cent this year to 7 per cent in 2015 and 5.6 per cent by 2018.* A permanent new welfare cap, to take effect from 2015, and a requirement for jobless youngsters to undertake training or work experience.* Next year’s planned 2p increase in petrol tax scrapped, and rail ticket rises capped at inflation.* Average household energy bills to fall by £50 as green levies are scaled back.* Future state pension age increases accelerated to save a further £400billion over the next 50 years.* Free school meals for children in reception, year one and two.* A new £200 tax break for married couples, which will be uprated in line with the personal tax allowance. Labour insisted that the rosy economic figures did not alter the fact that many people were experiencing a ‘cost of living crisis’. Chancellor George Osborne's dog Lola, a Bichon Frise, entering Number 10 . It looks like the new top dog at Downing Street is already taking her duties very seriously... Lola, George Osborne’s bichon frise, made her first public appearance yesterday – perhaps to give the Chancellor some moral support. The puppy, introduced on Twitter at the weekend, was carried into No 11 by an aide. It remains to be seen how the canine addition to Downing Street will get on with David Cameron's cat Larry who arrived in 2011 to help deal with No 10's rat problem. The OBR said earnings would not start to outstrip inflation until either next year or 2015, depending on which measure of inflation is used. It also suggested the recovery is still unbalanced, and there was a potential for growth to slow before the next election. Mr Balls, who struggled to make himself heard above Tory jeers, said: ‘For all his complacent boasts, for three damaging and wasted years, for most people there is no recovery at all.’ He insisted that despite the Chancellor’s ‘smoke and mirrors’, the Government was borrowing £198billion more than it planned in 2010. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable said there was ‘clearly still a danger of house prices getting out of control’, and cast doubts on parts of the Chancellor’s flagship Help to Buy scheme, which helps people with small deposits get mortgages on houses worth up to £600,000. ‘It’s very difficult for people on middle incomes to get into the housing market without the bank of mum and dad. And the danger is if you fuel demand, then prices are driven up even more,’ he said. Mr Balls insisted that despite the Chancellor¿s ¿smoke and mirrors¿, the Government was borrowing £198billion more than it planned in 2010 . ‘The key is to build more houses. We are beginning to see a big upsurge in construction . . . but we need an awful lot more.’ The dramatic recovery in the housing market also looks set to swell Treasury coffers, with stamp duty receipts set to almost double from £8.9billion this year to £16.8billion in 2018-19. The forecasts are likely to cause unease at the Bank of England where officials are worried about prices spiralling out of control. Governor Mark Carney last week warned the housing market could pose a ‘risk to financial stability’. Jan Crosby, of KPMG, said: ‘The increase in house prices is much larger than expected. It fuels fears of another boom and bust. The forecasts are startling and demonstrate the crucial need to create a sustainable housing market.’","Economic growth is set to more than double this year .

Tragic: Claire Lee, 34, was a fitness fanatic and played touch rugby for the Channel Island Guernsey . A British mother-of-two has died while ‘sandboarding’ down a 100m dune in Africa, it emerged yesterday. Fitness fanatic Claire Lee, 34, was trying the extreme adventure sport – known as ‘snowboarding on sand’ – for the first time. Her husband Barney and their two children are said to be devastated. Mrs Lee, who worked as a lawyer, was visiting an extreme fitness camp in the Okonjima safari reserve. But after sliding down a giant slope she collapsed and bystanders were unable to revive her. Local reports suggest that the keen cyclist and touch rugby player may have suffered internal injuries after tumbling over. But the Namibian sandboarding firm which organised the session claims her death was triggered by a pre-existing medical condition. Authorities in the southern African country are awaiting autopsy results to determine the cause of death. Mrs Lee was in Namibia with her personal trainer, Jon Le Tocq, whose firm Storm Force Fitness organises three day escapes to the retreat. Clients take part in an array of sports and fitness and motivational exercises there to ‘realign and rejuvenate’ their bodies. Mr Le Tocq confirmed that the fatal accident took place near the coastal city of Swakopmund, west of the capital Windhoek, last Wednesday. He said: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family of our friend. She was a member of our small group on holiday in the country At this time we are unable to comment further.’ The company which organised the sandboarding trip, Alter-Action Sandboarding, describes itself as the ‘first professional sandboarding operation on the Namibian coast’. Its website says: ‘With time and experience, Alter-Action developed the safest and most effective method of sliding on the dunes. The “perfect” sandboarding dune was chosen – a star dune with six different faces and a towering height of 100m.’ Founder Beth Sarro said Mrs Lee had been sandboarding for two hours before she collapsed. Miss Sarro said: ‘She was sandboarding with us and had just completed a run where she went down a sand dune lying down. Extreme Sport: The mother-of-two died while sandboarding in Namibia. Pictured are people trying the activity in South Africa . ‘She completed the run safely but said she felt funny, then she just collapsed. Someone she was travelling with tried to resuscitate Claire. ‘We were told after the incident that she suffered from a pre-existing heart condition but we had not been told about this. She appeared to be fine on the trip up until this point.’ Temperatures in Namibia can hit daily highs of 88F (31C) in December. The rest of the group were due back home at the weekend. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance to her family, who live on the Channel Island of Guernsey. Visitors to the Storm Force Fitness camp receive a 12-week training plan to prepare for activities including running, cycling, motivational coaching and core-strengthening. The firm’s website describes its courses as ‘truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to free yourself from the never ending “to do list” of life’. Mrs Lee’s family have declined to comment in detail but a female relative said they were still waiting to find out exactly how she died. Her husband Barney, a partner in Guernsey law firm Mourant Ozannes, is said to be too distraught to discuss his loss. The company’s managing director, Jessica Roland, said: ‘We are devastated by the news and our thoughts and prayers are with the family.’ Mrs Lee represented Guernsey in several touch rugby tournaments. Guernsey Touch chairwoman Katrina Bray said: ‘Her huge smile, amazing personality and sunny disposition will be remembered by so many who played beside her. Our thoughts and prayers are with Barney, their children, and their family.’","Claire Lee, 34, was trying the extreme adventure sport for the first time .

Mr Evans was leading the hounds through fields in the parish of St John, on the northern side of the island. His hunt claims to be one of the oldest in the British isles and was started in about 1884 by army officers who were stationed in the Channel Islands. Hounds are imported from Hampshire and Surrey for the twice-weekly event, which is popular with farmers on the island.","Mark Evans was hurled from his horse Bonnie but escaped unharmed .

A decorated Army major is suspected of selling a picture of Prince William in a bikini to a newspaper, a court heard yesterday. Major Alex McKay, awarded an MBE for his work on London’s Olympic security, was Prince William’s platoon commander at Sandhurst when the royal attended a James Bond-themed party there. The Old Bailey heard yesterday that former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks approved an illegal £4,000 payment for the picture of the Prince posing as a Bond girl in a green bikini. The 45-year-old was told the exclusive picture came from a reporter’s ‘best contact at Sandhurst’ who wanted the cash to pay for his wife to go on a course, it is alleged. The embarrassing photo was taken at a 007-themed party held in the cricket pavilion of the military academy, but was never published. Kate Middleton also attended the fancy-dress party and was said to have worn a wetsuit. The reporter sent an email saying the picture belonged to Prince William’s direct platoon commander where the Royal was training in 2006, the court heard. When Brooks was asked by email: ‘What do you think boss?’, she replied ten minutes later saying: ‘OK’. The court has been showed paperwork from The Sun showing a £4,000 payment was made on June 16, 2006, with the reference: ‘Prince William bikini exclusive’. But a story linked to this alleged payment did not appear until September 9, 2006, accompanied with a crude mock-up of the Prince’s face on a man’s bikini clad body. The story read: ‘Prince William caused a stir at a Sandhurst 007 bash by dressing as a Bond girl’ and also revealed his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton attended the party dressed in a wetsuit as James Bond and brandishing a toy gun. A war hero friend of the Prince, Major Alexis Roberts, who was killed in battle in Afghanistan in 2007 was initially suspected of leaking the embarrassing picture of the young Royal, the court heard. However, the focus shifted to a second Sandhurst platoon commander, Alex McKay, who is now suspected of taking the photo. The email exchange which was forwarded to Brooks was read out in full to the jury this morning. The reporter wrote: ‘My best contact at Sandhurst who has provided a string great stuff over a period of months, offered us a picture of William at a James Bond party dressed as a Bond girl. ‘He is wearing a bikini and an open Hawaian shirt. Salute: Prince William was training at Sandhurst when he attended the bash which was meant to test the cadet's communication skills . ‘He is an instructor at Sandhurst and the picture in question belongs to a fellow instructor who is very concerned by the idea of the snap ending up in The Sun. ‘He also happens to be William’s direct platoon commander.’ The email revealed the person offering . the photo wanted ‘£4,000 up front’ and wanted the story to run during . the Sandhurst summer holidays. The reporter said: ‘I have the guy with the picture over a barrel because I know his identity. ‘The chap is only happy for us to use the picture once, when Sandhurst is on a break, and wants the money upfront by Saturday. ‘The reason he needs the cash to pay for a course his wife is going on. ‘If he can’t get it from us, he will simply take out a loan.’ Prince William and girlfriend Kate both attended the 007-themed party at the military academy . Paddy Harverson, the spokesman for Prince William, told the jury he spoke to Brooks a month before the story appeared and asked her not to use the bikini picture. ‘It was Prince William in a bikini with a pink feather boa’, he recalled. ‘My feeling was the photo had been taken on a private occasion and it shouldn’t be published. ‘It was a private photo and shouldn’t be published without the Prince’s permission.’ Mr Harverson, who was employed as the communication secretary to Prince Charles, said Brooks had suggested the pictures would be printed the following day, in August 2006. He said when the story finally appeared, he noted: ‘It was interesting to see they didn’t publish the photo.’ Offer: Prince William's press officer asked Brooks not to use the photo because it was taken during a private occasion at the barracks, the court heard . Major Julia Parke-Robinson was a platoon commander at Sandhurst in the Blenheim company that included Prince William, then known as Cadet Wales. She was at the party in April 2006 with around 90 cadets, their partners, and staff. She told the court William brought his then-girlfriend Kate MIddleton to the party, which was used as a training exercise to assess cadets’ organisation skills. ‘I can remember Cadet Wales wearing a Bond girl style outfit, with a bikini top and grass skirt, as were a number of his friends’, she said. Ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson arriving at the Old Bailey today . ‘I have no recollection of what Kate Middleton was wearing at the time.’ Quizzed on the colour of William’s bikini, she said: ‘I recall it was green.’ Prince William was in the 12th platoon headed by Alex McKay, the court heard. Major Parke-Robinson said she received a briefing on dealings with the press when she moved to the company in January 2006 . She said cadets did not have access to the internet during their time at Sandhurst, and she was not sure how widespread social media use was. She said there was no official photographer at the party, but added: ‘Cadets take photographs throughout their training, so I believe photos would have been taken during the party. The court also heard that Brooks repeatedly approved via email what the reporter described as 'good value for money' payments ranging between £500 and £4,500 to his source. Although he did not refer to her by name in the emails, the court heard that money was paid to Ministry of Defence press officer Bettina Jordan-Barber. Jordan-Barber, who was employed by the MoD since 1997 and had a high level of security clearance, received a total of £100,000 for information she provided to The Sun, the jury was told. Brooks is on trial with Andy Coulson, 45, news editor Ian Edmondson, 44, and managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, for carrying out an alleged a six year phone hacking campaign at the News of the World. Royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, is also in the dock accused with Coulson of misconduct in public office. Brooks is then accused of masterminding a cover-up of phone hacking with husband Charles, 50, News International head of security Mark Hanna, 50, and PA Cheryl Carter, 49, when she knew she was about to be arrested. Rebekah Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Hart Hill, Charing, Kent, Edmondson, of Blenheim Road, Raynes Park, south London, and Kuttner, of Broomhill Walk, Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications. Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham Lane, Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office. Carter, of Mildmay Road, Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Glynswood Road, Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 19:48 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:48 EST, 5 December 2013 . Baroness Hale of Richmond, the most senior woman in the judiciary, said Strasbourg must rule on prisoner votes . European judges have the right to overrule Parliament when it comes to votes for prisoners, one of this country’s leading judges has declared. Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court and the most senior woman among the judiciary, said Strasbourg human rights judges must step in to protect prisoners because MPs will not do the job. And in a ringing defence of the Human Rights Act, she condemned critics who want to deport foreign criminals or illegal immigrants who claim to have family ties in Britain. Some people, she said, think we should ‘deprive British children of their right to live and grow up and be educated here if this will be the effect of deporting their only or primary carer.’ Lady Hale added: ‘Some critics are simply hostile to anything European.’ The defence of the Strasbourg court and human rights law opened up a rift between Lady Hale and other senior judges who have launched fierce attacks on the European Court of Human Rights over the past few days. This week recently-retired Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said that ‘Strasbourg is not superior to our Supreme Court’ and warned of a ‘democratic deficit’ which has grown because European human rights judges meddle in matters that should be for Parliament. In an even more strongly-worded intervention earlier this month another Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, compared the behaviour of the Strasbourg court on prisoner voting to the activities of communist East Germany. ‘To give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old German Democratic Republic was democratic,’ he said. Lady Hale’s speech - given as a lecture at the end of November but published only yesterday - set her at odds with her colleagues and confirmed that there is now serious division among the leaders of the judiciary over human rights law. The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate. Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions. Lady Hale said: ‘I have no personal view on which prisoners should be given the right to vote. But I do think that the issue is a good example of why we need human rights legislation. ‘Parliament is rightly proud that it represents and is accountable to the people. Lady Hale said MPs cannot be trusted to protect the interests of prisoners . ‘But members elected under the present franchise do not represent, and are not accountable to, the people who are currently disenfranchised. ‘The purpose of any human rights protection is to protect the rights of those whom the majority are unwilling to protect: democracy values everyone equally even if the majority do not.’ Lady Hale added that the media were hostile to the Human Rights Act, passed by Labour in 1998 to make Strasbourg rules part of British law, because ‘it was seen as a threat to press freedom from the outset.’ She added that ‘there was a perception that it has prevented us from sending some dangerous foreigners back to their home countries and generally allowed people with no right to be in this country to stay here once they have established a private or family life here. ‘Not every member of the public is persuaded that we should not export people if there is a real risk that they will be tortured in the country to which we send them,’ Lady Hale said. She said ‘it may be no coincidence’ that Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling ‘have been most vocal in their opposition’ to the Human Rights Act. Scrapping the Human Rights Act, Lady Hale said, would ‘raise all sorts of interesting questions about the effect of the decisions which have been made during the period while the Act was in force.’ She said that that new rights had been established and ‘there is indeed a point to the Human Rights Act.’ Lady Hale, 68 and twice married, has been an Appeal judge since 1999 and, in 2009, the first woman on the Supreme Court. She has built a reputation as the most radical and feminist of the senior judiciary. As head of the Law Commission that recommends reforms to the government, she shaped the Children’s Act, the 1980 law blamed by some for stripping parents of power over their children, and the Family Law Act, a no-fault divorce reform law pushed through by John Major that was later dropped when it proved unworkable. In a Supreme Court judgement in 2011, she changed the definition of domestic violence so that it now includes shouting at a partner or denying them money as well as actual physical assault.","Lady Hale has called for Strasbourg's human rights judges to protect prisoners, claiming MPs cannot be trusted to do the job .

Almost 600 children under 16 take up smoking every day in the UK, experts have warned. An estimated 463 start smoking every day in England, with 50 in Scotland, 30 in Wales and 19 in Northern Ireland. Each day, 67 children, more than two classrooms full, start smoking in London, and of 74,000 young people under 16 in Birmingham, nine take up smoking every day. Experts used survey data from more than 6,500 youngsters to estimate there were 207,000 new child smokers between 2010 and 2011. Scroll down for video . Almost 600 under-16s take up smoking every day in the UK, experts have warned (stock picture) The data was drawn from surveys of secondary school pupils in England in years 7 to 11 (mostly children aged 11 to 15) carried out for the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Published in the journal Thorax, the figures for new smokers were particularly high in London. 'Each day, 67 children, more than two classrooms full, start smoking in London,' said the experts, who included specialists from Cancer Research UK and Imperial College London. The experts said: 'Smoking is among the largest causes of preventable deaths worldwide. 'The present data should help to raise awareness of childhood smoking and to focus attention on the need to address this important child protection issue.' People who start smoking before the age of 15 have a higher risk of lung cancer than those who start later, they said. Each day, 67 children, more than two classrooms full, start smoking in London (stock picture) The team also pointed to 'compelling evidence that young people are susceptible to branding and advertising and are influenced by the depiction of smoking in films'. They said: 'Legislation is needed to counter the efforts of the tobacco industry, but this requires political will by legislators at both national and local levels.' Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Although the thought of nearly 20 classrooms full of children taking up smoking every day should be shocking, the sad thing is that it comes as no surprise. 'It is even sadder to think that, at current rates, half of these children are likely to eventually die as a result of their habit if they continue smoking.' She added: 'Tobacco manufacturers are still using expensively-designed packaging to recruit new young smokers. 'With this research showing that nearly 600 children start smoking every day, proposed legislation to prevent this through the introduction of standardised packaging for all tobacco products can't come too soon.' Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK's head of tobacco policy, said: 'This research is a timely reminder of the scale of the tobacco problem. 'The 570 under-16s who start smoking every day are far too many lives that will be blighted by an addiction that will kill half of them if they go on to become long-term smokers. 'We must do all we can to reduce smoking rates, especially because the vast majority of smokers start before they turn 19. 'Last week's commitment from the Government to further explore standardised packaging for tobacco products is a step in the right direction that will give children one less reason to start smoking.'","Estimated 463 children start smoking every day in England .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 19:51 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:41 EST, 5 December 2013 . Tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationals are having their British visas rubber-stamped in just ten minutes, an official report reveals today. Despite the country being rated as ‘high-risk’ from fraudulent applications, visitor visas were being waved through without proper checks, inspectors found. John Vine, the chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, found refusal rates had plummeted to just 4 per cent. The findings emerged in a highly critical report into the visa processing centre in Warsaw, Poland. It handles about 56,000 applications a year, of which more than 36,000 are visitor visa applications from the Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians, who have recently been protesting against their Government's decision to suspend Ukraine's European integration (pictured), are having their visas rubber-stamped in just 10 minutes . Anyone given a visitor visa can enter Britain for a set period of time, but there are scant checks on whether they leave the country at the end. Ukraine is not part of the EU so its nationals have no rights to come to Britain and cannot work unless given specific permission. The report will raise concerns that thousands are getting in, staying and working in the black economy. The report found inexperienced and temporary staff were under pressure to clear 45 applications a day – the equivalent of one every ten minutes. As a result, document checks designed to prove if migrants were genuine visitors – or trying to enter the country permanently – were not carried out. Managers were breaking rules suggesting they should review one in five cases, and in a three-month period, only 3 per cent were given additional scrutiny. Ukraine is not part of the EU so its nationals have no rights to come to Britain and cannot work unless given specific permission. The report will raise concerns that thousands are getting in, staying and working in the black economy . Mr Vine criticised the ‘poor quality’ of decision making in the Visa Section. He said it was of ‘serious concern’ that so little attention was paid to quality assurance of decisions made by entry clearance officers who process visa applications. And he cited the ‘real risk that visa decisions were being taken without the necessary checks being conducted’. Security assessments suggested Ukraine applications were ‘high risk’ because they were often backed by forged or counterfeit documents. But applications from Ukraine were much less likely to be refused than those from low-risk countries. The report said: ‘We were surprised to find that the refusal rate for Kiev was significantly lower than for other posts in the region. ‘We would have expected a post which the risk profile indicated was a high risk and which reportedly received a high number of applications that were not genuine, to have a refusal rate exceeding that of spoke locations deemed to present a lower risk.’ Inspectors found the refusal rate fell from 14 per cent in October 2012 to just 4 per cent in June this year. It cited as reasons the hiring of temporary and inexperienced staff and the increase in processing targets ‘meaning that officers may not have had enough time to conduct further research on applications or conduct verification checks in all required cases’. The centre also processes visa requests from non-EU nationals living in other parts of Eastern and Central Europe, such as Romania and Austria. Mr Vine added: ‘It is vitally important, if the visa application process is to be fair and transparent, that the Home Office corrects these serious failings in its decision making.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Protecting the border is our  top priority.  The UK is not a member of the European free movement zone and so visa holders have their visas and documentation checked again at the border. ‘We have reviewed the cases highlighted by the Chief Inspector, and we are satisfied that no individual was issued with a visa when they should not have been.’ * At least 385,000 Romanian and Bulgarian migrants will arrive in Britain over the next five years, a report claimed last night. The Democracy Institute think-tank said the real total would ‘significantly surpass’ current estimates of how many will come when working restrictions end on January 1. Its report suggests an average of 77,000 Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK annually, made up of 44,000 Bulgarians and 33,000 Romanians. The report’s author Patrick Basham wrote: ‘This paper’s unexpected finding is that the most alarming of the forecasts is actually insufficiently alarmist.’ The report says Britain is attractive to educated and skilled migrants who want to earn more, but also to a ‘not insignificant’ group of unskilled and uneducated migrants who ‘avail themselves of the smorgasbord of government-provided benefits’. It criticises the UK for creating a ‘self-inflicted economic migrant own goal’ as a result of its over- generous welfare spending. Hitting back: Mariana Campeanu says British workers would rather live off benefits than take low-paid jobs . Britain should be grateful to Romanians and Bulgarians for taking jobs shunned by local workers, according to a Romanian government minister. Mariana Campeanu, the country’s labour minister, said many British workers would rather live off benefits than take jobs picking fruit or working in hotels. Her comments came as London Mayor Boris Johnson became the most senior politician to back the call for restrictions on workers from both countries to be extended beyond January 1. David Cameron has announced restrictions on new arrivals from the EU claiming benefits. But in an interview with The Times, Mrs Campeanu said it was generous welfare payments to Britons which left open thousands of low-paid jobs for migrants. She said: ‘British people do not access the vacancies on the labour market for which Romanian citizens, for example, are going to apply. ‘If there are any vacancies, somebody will fill them, whether they are from Romania, Italy, Spain or wherever.’ ‘Taking into account the fact that Romanian citizens in the UK contribute greatly to the GDP and also that many of these people are young and well qualified, the UK should be grateful that these people have come to live there.’ About 22,000 Romanians and Bulgarians work in the UK in the summer picking fruit and vegetables – and tens of thousands more are self-employed or have visas to take jobs in health and social care. Last night Home Secretary Theresa May made clear her determination to change EU free movement rules – and suggested ministers could put a ‘cap’ on overall migrant numbers. Ahead of a meeting of EU ministers, Mrs May said: ‘I will make clear that I believe we need to change the way free movement rules work. Looking ahead, we must seize the opportunity presented by the Prime Minister’s plan to reform the EU and address the problems caused by free movement.’ Mr Johnson, speaking on LBC radio, said he would like the extension of the block on benefit claims to ‘go for six or 12 months’ because of competition for jobs that left ‘many young Londoners who feel they are not getting a fair suck of the sauce bottle’. He urged Mr Cameron to push for such changes in the EU.","Refusal rates are just four per cent, according to a report into visa centre .

"By . Lucy Crossley . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:47 EST, 5 December 2013 . A coroner has called for all nursery staff to undergo paediatric first aid training following the death of a nine-month-old baby. The plea came as an inquest concluded little Millie Thompson's death was due to 'misadventure', after she choked on mashed up shepherd’s pie on only her third full day at nursery. Her grieving parents have blamed a 'catalogue of errors' for the death of their daughter, who had started coughing during her lunchtime feed from a supervisor at Ramillies Hall in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. However, an expert witness said Millie had suffered a rare condition as a result of choking, which meant she could not have been saved, and that nursery staff could not have recognised the problem. Tragedy: Little Millie Thompson died after choking on shepherd's pie during her third full day at nursery, prompting a coroner to suggest all nursery staff should undergo first aid training . The inquest was told that the supervisor at the privately-run nursery - whose basic first aid certificate had expired - shouted for help and passed her on to a colleague who did have paediatric first aid training. Millie was pulled from her high chair and given five slaps on her back - instead of a repeated sequence of chest thrusts and further back slaps. Her condition fluctuated and then deteriorated as an ambulance arrived 10 minutes after staff dialled 999 on October 23 last year. The emergency call was wrongly graded as 'serious but not life . threatening' situation - which usually results in a response time of 20 . minutes - when it should have been graded as an 'immediately . life-threatening case.' Ruling: The inquest jury concluded little Millie Thompson's death was misadventure, after she choked while she was being fed on her third full day at a nursery . Grieving: Millie's parents Joanne and Dan Thompson grieving parents have blamed a 'catalogue of error's for their daughter's death . And an emergency call handler who had no . clinical training and who sent the ambulance to the nursery ended the . call by saying: ""Jeez, stop giving me information"". The hearing was told the call handler Aaliyah Ormerod made her . comment after she put down the phone - unaware she was still being . recorded. During the call she had used scripted questions and felt . 'bombarded with details'. She did not give evidence in person after . the court received a doctor's note saying she was 'medically unfit'. No . disciplinary action will be taken against her. There were no signs of life as Millie was taken to Stepping Hill Hospital and she was pronounced dead soon after arrival. It emerged during the hearing at Oldham Magistrates’ Court that Millie suffered a rare complication as a result of the choking in which air was able to get into her partially blocked airway but not out. The trapped air placed pressure on her heart which led to a fatal cardiac arrest. Loved: Millie as a newborn with her father Dan, left, and right with both her parents, who said they had expected nursery staff to be trained in first aid . An expert witness in paediatrics told the inquest that the condition was uncommon. The only effective treatment would have been a medical procedure where a needle is inserted to the chest to release the air pressure. Paramedics are trained to carry out such a procedure but it would have been difficult to make the correct diagnosis in such a young child. The inquest heard that nursery staff could also not be criticised for not recognising its nature. In returning its verdict of misadventure, the jury said Millie had inhaled a . particle of food into her left lung causing in a rare and difficult to . detect condition - pneumothorax. The panel said they did not believe she . could have been saved. Ramillies Hall did fulfil its legal requirements in ensuring at least one staff member with a paediatric first aid training certificate was on the premises at any given time. It emerged that all nursery employees had to undergo paediatric first aid training in the wake of Millie’s death. Scene: Along with paramedics, police were also called to Ramillies Hall School, in Cheadle Hulme, where Millie choked in October last year . Following the verdict, South Manchester Coroner John Pollard said he would write to the Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove to ask that all nursery staff have such training. He said sending the letter 'as a matter of national importance'. He also vowed to write to the Chief Inspector of the North West Ambulance Service calling for better training for call handlers. Following the inquest Millie's parents Joanne Thompson, . 28, a quantity surveyor and Dan, 40, a a building inspector, hit out at . the nursery. In a statement the couple said: 'From the moment Millie . started choking, she was totally reliant on the nursery staff until the . ambulance arrived. The appropriate first aider should have dealt with . the incident and not left Millie's side. 'If she had continued as she . had been trained to do we believe Millie would have had a better chance . of survival. A number of nursery staff noticed that Millie was in a . serious condition. 'As parents when we drop off our children with . anyone who looks after them who have relevant qualifications especially . in paediatric first aid, that when a critical incident happens we would . expect them to use their first aid training to help our child in . distress. In memory: The couple have started a charity in her name, Millie's Trust, to offer free First Aid training for anyone who looks after young children . 'We believe a catalogue of errors of judgement and failing . to follow training led to a situation where once the paramedics attended . it was too late to save our beloved daughter.' Mr and Mrs Thompson have started a charity in her name, Millie's Trust, to offer free First Aid training for anyone who looks after young children. In a statement Diana Patterson, Principal, Ramillies Hall School said: 'While today's outcome is comforting in that it confirms our understanding that we did everything we could to save Millie, it doesn't alter the fact that she's no longer with us and we'll continue to miss her and think of her family every day. 'This has been a devastating time for everyone involved and we would like to thank our parents, past and present, as well as the local community for all of their words of support and comfort which have helped sustain our dedicated nursery team, who've been heartbroken by Millie's loss. 'At the time of the incident, Ramillies Hall School already exceeded the number of trained paediatric first aiders required by the Department for Education.' Ged Blezard, Director of Emergency Services for the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust would like to express its sincere condolences to Millie's family for their very sad loss. We accept the jury's conclusion and would like to thank the Coroner for his handling of this sensitive case - we are now considering his helpful recommendations.'","Millie Thompson choked during her lunchtime feed at privately-run nursery .

Suspect: James Leslie, pictured, was arrested by police in connection with the shooting after a seven-hour search . A woman police officer shot at point-blank range by a gunman was on only her second shift in a new job. The 33-year-old officer was shot through a door without warning after responding to reports of a disturbance at the house in the early hours of yesterday morniing. She had only recently become a response officer following her request to be given a more exciting role. The officer, who was wearing body armour, is in hospital suffering from serious injuries to her face, neck and hand but police say her injuries are not life-threatening. A male colleague dragged her from the scene and raised the alarm as the gunman fled on a mountain bike. She and her colleague were dispatched to the address in Headingley, Leeds, on the 'routine' call - to do with anti-social behaviour -  when the shooting happened at 4am. Though the injured woman is an 'experienced officer' who has been in the force for some years, she had recently switched from neighbourhood policing. James Leslie, 37, was arrested by heavily-armed officers in connection with the shooting after a seven-hour manhunt. He was arrested outside Shire Oak Primary School in Wood Lane, Headingley, where a sawn-off shotgun was recovered. Kieran Williams, 17, said he had a row with the suspect yesterday and a women police officer . called round to take information from his housemates during the night . after a bottle was thrown through their window. He said he later heard multiple shots. The . teenager said the suspect came to his house, which backs on to the scene of . the shooting, complaining that someone was shining a torch through his . window. 'He was shouting his mouth off and all that. That . argument died down but he was carrying on for about five or six hours. He was going on and on and on.' Crime scene: Armed police guard a sawn-off shotgun in Leeds at the scene where James Leslie was arrested following the shooting of a WPC in the early hours of yesterday . Evidence: The gun allegedly used by James Leslie was dumped on the floor outside a primary school when he was arrested . Row: Kieran Williams, near the scene at Cardigan Road, said he had been in a row with Lesley on Tuesday night .

'We will be supporting the officers and their families through this traumatic time.'

"PUBLISHED: . 10:21 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:05 EST, 4 December 2013 . Benjamin Price went from earning more than £500,000 a year to claiming £71 a week in benefits . A city banker who complained that his £518,000 pay packet was not enough was made redundant months later and now lives off £71 a week in benefits, a tribunal heard yesterday. Morgan Stanley trader Benjamin Price, 39, said he had effectively ‘signed my own death warrant’ by making a complaint about his pay. His annual earnings had dropped from £533,000 to £518,000, with the bank  blaming the cut on the global financial crisis. Mr Price objected and four months later he was made redundant, leaving him to survive on unemployment benefit, East London Employment Tribunal was told. Now he is claiming £1million in unfair dismissal and breach of contract. He is also claiming to be a ‘whistleblower’ about the culture at the American banking giant, where making complaints is ‘seen as detrimental to your career’. Mr Price, of Wimbledon, South London, accuses the bank of reneging on a deal to improve his pay after he turned down a job offer from a rival. He said he had been headhunted by Citibank in 2010 and offered a deal worth $1.1million (£670,000) a year. But he agreed to stay at Morgan Stanley after his bosses promised to match the offer, he claimed. However, not only did his bosses fail to make good on the deal, they cut his wages too, he claimed. He was made redundant in  January 2012 after 14 years at the bank, having worked his way up from analyst to senior trader in the company’s derivatives division. He said the culture at Morgan Stanley was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses. Mr Price told the panel yesterday: ‘Despite my good performance, I was a squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up. Mr Price, 39, had worked at Morgan Stanley for 14 years when he was made redundant in January 2012 . ‘This effectively was me signing my own . death warrant at Morgan Stanley. That was the deal,  $1.1million, they . offered when I turned down Citibank, and I would not just keep quiet . about it. I was made assurances by my senior manager at Morgan Stanley, . Craig Verdon, that they would match this offer. ‘I asked for a written contract from . Mr Verdon that he would match the $1.1million offered by Citibank, but . he told me due to the UK 50 per cent bonus tax at the time, he would not . provide one. ‘When I was . paid $850,000 (£518,000) the following year – not the deal agreed – I . was told there was not enough money to pay what was agreed.’ But . Citibank never put its offer in writing either, and was not ‘hammering . on his door’ to hire him, the tribunal heard. Thomas . Linden QC, representing Morgan Stanley, said Mr Price had never . received a written contract agreeing the new job or terms of the offer. During . a heated exchange, Mr Linden claimed: ‘The truth is you didn’t have an . offer to match. It is quite common for bankers at bonus time to say “it . isn’t enough”. I don’t think I’ve ever met a banker who thinks he is . overpaid.’ The trader replied: ‘I have written my witness statement and . sworn an oath and you keep asserting I am lying. Mr Price told the tribunal he signed his own 'death warrant' with the company by complaining about pay . ‘I don’t think anyone can sit and say being paid $800,000 is being underpaid, but it just was not what was agreed.’ On . the culture at the banking giant, Mr Price claimed: ‘The practice at . Morgan Stanley is to attempt to pay you a minimum it thinks it needs to . in order to keep you happy and not look to move  to a competitor. 'Speaking up at Morgan Stanley is welcomed so long as you are agreeing . with senior management, and making complaints is seen as detrimental to . your career, as it is wholly at their discretion how much compensation . you will be getting and promotion is impossible without backing. ‘I . am aware that going up against Morgan Stanley will harm my chances of . finding employment elsewhere in the industry in the future.’ The hearing continues.

Jill Mourning: The part-time model was a victim of sex trafficking and has opened up about her experience to provide relief for other victims . A part-time model who was the victim of sex trafficking in the southern states of America has opened up about her traumatic experience to educate and provide relief for other victims. Jill Mourning, then age 19, was used to traveling with her manager across the country on modeling jobs. However after a few months, he began to bring men into her varying hotel rooms, who would then rape her, and sell videos of the rape online. Scared into submission, Miss Mourning told the Charlotte Observer that she initially kept quiet about her ordeal because, 'It was like, holy . crap, everything I’ve worked so hard for could be taken away from me, . because people will think that I did something to deserve this. And I . was not about to let that happen.' In 2007, Miss Mourning became a model through ModelMayhem.com, an online forum where aspiring . models connect with others in the industry. After . she posted portfolio pictures of herself on the site, a woman . contacted her about a manager who was interested in representing her. 'And I of course said yes,' Miss Mourning, now 25, said. 'What 19-year-old wouldn’t?' She said she met her new manager in . Charlotte, North Carolina over a period of several months, where he systematically . built up her trust; booking modeling jobs for her, as well as taking the time . to listen, and give advice, when she was having problems with her parents. The student, who was voted East Lincoln High School’s Most . Excellent Teenager during her senior year, explained: 'It all felt very legitimate.' However in the spring of 2007, while she was sleeping in an Arizona hotel, Miss Mourning woke to her manager and two other . men entering her room with a tripod and video camera. Dazed, she thought she had . overslept her call-time for the cigar company photoshoot, she said. But . her manager proceeded to pin down her arms, while another man fastened her . ankles. 'I realized something bad was about to happen,' she recalled, explaining that the three men took turns raping her, and videotaped the act - to sell on the . Internet and blackmail her with, she said. 'And the next day, I was to shoot like . nothing had happened. My . manager actually said to me, ""This is business as usual. This is just . business; don’t take it personally.""' This scenario played out repeatedly in Charlotte and several other cities across the country, from May 2007 until October of the same year. Miss Mourning said she felt trapped; believing that her manager was . too powerful and knew too much about her to get herself out of the situation safely. 'I decided I wasn’t going to tell . anybody; I was going to compartmentalize,' she added, saying that she was terrified she would be judged if people found out. Anti-trafficking activists and . authorities explained that traffickers will use fear, manipulation and blackmail . to take advantage of their victims, who are often made exceedingly vulnerable by their age, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. 'People don't know . this problem exists, [or] they think it’s . only in poor, third-world countries in Africa' The trafficking of Miss Mourning finally stopped when her . manager was arrested for an unrelated financial crime and was sentenced . to ten years in prison. She kept her ordeal a secret until 2011 when she decided to tell her grandmother, Suzanne Zucker, who had . raised Miss Mourning for most of her childhood. Ms Zucker, who lives outside of . Columbus, Ohio, said had never suspected anything was wrong during her granddaughter's time as a model. After a failed suicide . attempt and extensive counseling, Miss Mourning says she is not ready to file . charges against the man who forced her into sex trafficking - despite the authorities possessing evidence of the act, which they found online. An FBI agent has spoken to her about prosecution, but she is unable to relive those terrible months of her life, she said. 'To go back now, when I am in such a . good place – reliving all of the evidence, watching the videos – to go . back to that would be really, really tough,' she explained. Instead, she has found healing in raising awareness. Miss Mourning is part of a community of local activists, law enforcers and civic groups dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing relief for Charlotte victims. In July last year, she founded All We Want is LOVE - Liberation of Victims Everywhere, a nonprofit that aims to educate youth about human trafficking. She has spoken in schools and churches, . put together student-run human trafficking awareness groups . for colleges and high schools, and organized fundraisers for All We Want . is LOVE. Miss Mourning said: 'I want to use my . experience to make people aware. I realized how many people didn’t know . this problem exists, and the people who do know it exists think it’s . only in poor, third-world countries in Africa. 'You need to have kids understand trafficking so they don’t become victimized,' she said. January marks National Human Trafficking and Slavery Prevention Month, and on Friday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina hosted a conference on human trafficking - part of a new effort to combat what authorities call a growing problem in North Carolina and across the country. A special human trafficking task force was formed last year and is currently investigating ten . to 12 trafficking cases across North Carolina. Charlotte has one of the highest rates of trafficking in the U.S., according to . anti-trafficking groups, which say that the city’s growing immigrant . community, teamed with its major sports events, franchises, and easy highway access are all factors in attracting human traffickers. Authorities have labelled trafficking a 'hidden . crime;' one that is increasingly hard to uncover or prosecute. Lia Bantavani, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said that while sex trafficking often takes place in massage . parlors and strip clubs, most often it is through online escort services, which she called 'cheap and anonymous' to advertise. 'There are fewer ways for the so-called pimps to get caught,' she said. For the third year in a row, President Obama has declared January 2013 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, urging 'all residents to actively participate in the efforts to both raise awareness of and end all forms of human trafficking in our communities.'","Jill Mourning, 25,  has now founded All We Want is LOVE - Liberation of Victims Everywhere, a nonprofit to educate youth about human trafficking ."

The number of breeding pairs in the UK is thought to have dropped this year to a record low of below 14,000, marking a 84 per cent drop since 1995.

A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said: ‘The turtle dove is the fastest declining bird in this country  and within ten years we could lose this icon of the British countryside completely.’ Known for its gentle purring call, the turtle dove has a narrow diet consisting mostly of seeds from weedy plants which are gradually being killed off in Britain by modern herbicides used in intensive farming.

Millions of women and self-employed people will have a one-off chance to boost their State pensions by buying extra credits . Millions of women and self-employed people will have a one-off chance to boost their State pensions, the Chancellor revealed yesterday. Anyone who hits State pension age before 2016, or who has already retired, will be able to buy extra credits to push their payout above the basic level of £110.15 a week. For a limited time they will have the chance to pay a new class of National Insurance contribution. They will be able to boost their pension by £25 a week, increasing the maximum pension for someone on a basic payout to £135.15 a week. The cost of the top-up will be announced next week. The surprise move is to help the estimated 12 million pensioners who will not qualify for the new higher flat-rate State pension of around £155 a week which is being brought in on April 6, 2016. The biggest winners will be women and the self-employed, who typically have poorer pensions. It is thought to be the first time people already claiming a pension have been able to add to it. Tom McPhail, head of pensions at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘A lot will depend on how much these top-ups cost – but you would think the Government would want to make it seem a good deal. This will go a long way to solving the annoyance of people who will be retiring under the old State pension.’There are two parts to the current State pension. A basic element – based on the number of years someone makes National Insurance contributions – and a part that higher earners build up, known as a state second pension (S2P), once called Serps. This can top-up the pension to £270.15 a week. Historically women have earned less than men and taken time off to have children. As a result, they have lower State pensions, while the self-employed don’t qualify for the top-ups at all. Currently, the average weekly State pension of a man is £148; and £131 for a woman. About 2.8 million women get less than £80 a week. About 4.2 million self-employed only qualify for £110.15 a week. From April 2016, with the new flat-rate State pension, the State second pension will be abolished. Everyone with 30 years of National Insurance pay-ins who retires from then on will get about £155 a week. Those who have already earned higher top-ups will keep them. But those who will have retired before April 2016 won’t see any boost in their pensions. Those affected say it is unfair that someone who retires the day before the new system starts could get a pension of £110.15, while someone with an identical job history who hits pension age the following morning could get £155 a week. To level the playing field, the Chancellor is offering these special top-ups from October 2015, giving those with low pensions who retire before April 2016 the chance to increase their payouts by buying extra National Insurance credits. Dr Ros Altmann, a campaigner for savers, said: ‘This is not a free lunch. But it is a real chance for people to build up a much better pension provided it doesn’t cost too much.’","They will be able to pay a new class of National Insurance .

A lorry driver admitted killing a four-year-old girl when his 44-tonne lorry ploughed into the back of a family car in a motorway accident. Robert Booth, 64, was driving his HGV at its maximum speed of 55mph seconds before he smashed into stationary traffic on the M6 motorway near Coleshill, Warwickshire. His lorry collided with a Vauxhall Zafira, sending it careering across the road into a concrete barrier on the hard shoulder, leaving Priyanka Bhogal, of Coventry, West Midlands, with fatal head injuries. Tragedy: Robert Booth (right), 64, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, was driving his HGV at 55mph on the M6 motorway near Coleshill, Warwickshire, seconds before a crash that killed Priyanka Bhogal (left), four . Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours. Booth, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, initially denied causing death by dangerous driving, claiming he suffered from sleep apnea syndrome, which meant he was asleep at the time of the crash. But he later changed his plea to guilty when he appeared at Warwick Crown Court. The brightly-lit signs also instructed drivers to move from the inside lane to the middle lane in order to avoid the accident - which Booth also allegedly ignored. Prosecutor Nigel Wilkins said he paid ‘no attention’ to the signs or the brake lights ahead of him. He said: ‘It was night time and at the time Mr Booth was driving a heavy goods vehicle, it was an articulated lorry. Also on that stretch of motorway were Mr and Mrs Bhogal. ‘They were travelling in a Vauxhall Zafira, a people type carrier, and in that vehicle were their children including Priyanka. She was sitting in the rearmost near side seat. Scene: Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours (file picture) ‘The defendant drove into the rear of that vehicle and as a result of him colliding with that vehicle it was pushed into a barrier at the side of the road. ‘And tragically the four-year-old child Priyanka, despite being taken to hospital with injuries, died later that same morning of effectively a serious head injury which was caused by that collision. 'Mr Booth did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead. We know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say Mr Booth caused' Nigel Wilkins, prosecuting . ‘Along that stretch of road on that day there had been another incident, I believe it was some sort of minor accident but it had caused a build up in the M6 itself. ‘Because of that incident the relevant gantries were being displayed to both control the speed of traffic and to warn traffic of the problem ahead. ‘There was a 40mph speed limit being shown to traffic and the gantries were showing that a lane ahead was closed and for traffic to move from lane one to lane two when safe to do so. ‘Mr Booth did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead. We know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say Mr Booth caused.’ Trial: Warwick Crown Court (pictured) heard Booth ignored several signs on overhead motorway gantries warning of a minor collision further ahead and ordering them to drive at a maximum of 40mph . The court heard the Bhogal family had been driving home to Coventry after a family member's 40th birthday party the day before in Walsall, West Midlands. In a statement, Priyanka’s mother Baljit Bhogal, who was driving, said: ‘We left the party at about 11.30pm. I know Priyanka was wearing her seatbelt. Priyanka was sitting in her booster seat. ‘I looked up in my inside mirror and then . I heard a screeching from behind. I saw a lorry coming up very quickly . behind me in lane two. 'I could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open. She appeared to have no soul left in her' Joginder Bhogal, father of Priyanka . ‘I knew I needed to get away from it so I steered to the left to get away from the lorry.  Within seconds of seeing this lorry it hit our car from behind pushing our car off the road into the barrier. ‘I went to Priyanka first, I held her head for a bit and said Priyanka. She did not say anything, she just fell forward. I continued holding Priyanka's head through the back of the smashed window. ‘Two women came up to me and took me away from the scene. I was taken to hospital and the doctors told me Priyanka had died.’ Priyanka's father, Joginder Bhogal, added: ‘I could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open. She appeared to have no soul left in her.’ Tachograph records from Booth's lorry were analysed and showed police he was travelling at his maximum speed of 55mph. Booth was bailed and ordered to return to court on February 25 for sentencing .

Navy spokesman PVS Satish said: 'There are some people who are trapped . on board, we are in the process of trying to rescue them. 'We will not give up until we get to them.' He said the explosion inside the INS Sindhurakshak was probably an accident, and said that when the vessel exploded, other sailors nearby jumped into the sea in panic, some of them suffering injuries. One man standing outside the dockyard said he heard a sound like a rocket or jet engine, then a blast, while another witness said the sky turned red. Photos distributed by social media users showed a large fireball over the navy dock where the diesel-electric submarine was berthed, and TV reports said the vessel was nearly submerged after the fire.

Andrew Kearns, 38, an oil trader who was sacked because he was said not to be in a fit state after a heavy night out has launched a claim of wrongful dismissal . An oil trader sacked for missing work after heavy drinking sessions yesterday insisted: ‘You can do what you like as long as you make money.’ Andrew Kearns, who earned £140,000 a year plus six-figure bonuses, was fired after being late or absent at least 64 times in two years, the High Court heard. He is suing his former bosses at commodities firm Glencore for wrongful dismissal, claiming that socialising with clients late into the night was part of his job. The 38-year-old admitted he enjoyed knocking back up to ‘eight pints of beer then wine on top’, the hearing was told. The final straw came when he was allegedly so hungover after drinking until 4.30am on a business trip to Singapore that he missed three meetings and did not respond to phone calls from his concerned managers. Mr Kearns claimed his absences were acceptable given his role in the company and adamantly denied turning up to the office with ‘red eyes and trembling’. ‘The culture in this organisation is that you can do what you like as long as you make money,’ he told the court. ‘I accept that there is sustained lateness and I am saying that it was accepted because I made money. ‘Drinking was an integral part of entertaining and building relationships with people.‘The picture that you want to paint of me is that I’m a wanton alcoholic who doesn’t care about anything other than drink. ‘I’m not an alcoholic, I don’t have binge-drinking tendencies and I am quite lucid in a court of law focussing on the issue at hand.’ Jonathan Cohen, for Glencore, said: . ‘They fired you because you didn’t turn up for work, for meetings...you . were late, you were drunk.’ Mr . Kearns responded: ‘All acceptable as long as we make money. This was . not a desk, nine-to-five role. The point is, nobody raised any issue. ‘If you make money you do well – If you don’t, you get fired.’ Counter argument: But Mt Kearns claims he was in fact working hard for the company and that late night socialising with clients were part of the requirements . He also claimed that many of his late arrivals at work were due to train delays. And he denied claims that he also regularly failed to turn up at his . former employer, commodity trader Trafigura, because he was drunk. Mr . Cohen said Mr Kearns had metaphorically ‘slapped Glencore in the face’ after bosses arranged for him to see medical specialists because they . were concerned about his excessive drinking. Mr . Kearns admitted drinking into the early hours while on the trip to . Singapore in October 2010, but claimed he had no meetings that day that . required his attendance. He said: ‘The reason I was fired was that they needed a scapegoat for the year’s losses. ‘I . had been trying to save the year, because the year had been abysmal. I . was working extremely hard during this period. It’s a results-driven . business and I got results so it [lateness] wasn’t an issue.’ His counsel Ahmed Miah earlier told the hearing: ‘We say the dismissal is a mockery and the whole dismissal process was a sham. ‘There was no true or just reason to accuse him of not turning up to meetings when his attendance was not obligatory.’ He told Judge Richard Seymour QC that the married father of three’s reputation was ‘on the line’.Mr . Kearns, from Gillingham, Kent, received a £202,000 signing-on bonus in . 2009. Last week he had his claim for a share bonus of around £750,000 . struck out.

Mothers feel ‘shoved aside’ in the workplace, Nick Clegg has said, as a survey found three quarters thought their careers had stalled since having children. The Deputy Prime Minister warned the whole economy missed out when mothers returning from maternity leave were side-lined. The Liberal Democrats have pushed for the Coalition to adopt a shared parental leave policy, allowing fathers to take some of the later months of leave from the mother to care for children. Feel less employable: Research has revealed that three quarters of mothers found that their careers stalled after having children . But a Mumsnet survey found that 60 per cent of mothers felt less employable since having a child.Three quarters said it was harder to progress in their career. During pregnancy, nearly half (47 per cent) said they were made to feel guilty while one in four (26 per cent) felt their job was under threat. More than one in three (37 per cent) felt ignored when it came to career progression. Mr Clegg said: ‘It is sadly still far too common for women to feel shoved aside at work because they’ve decided to have children. Aside from the obvious unfairness, it’s also bad for our economy, which means everybody ends up losing out.’ He added: ‘Modern families come in every . thinkable shape and size. In many cases mothers want to work and . fathers want to spend more time at home. We need to dramatically update . our working practices to accommodate these realities, helping families . juggle their lives as they see fit. 'Shoved aside': Nick Clegg warned that the whole economy missed out when mothers returning from maternity leave were side-lined . 'That is why from April 2015, the Coalition Government is introducing shared parental leave to ensure career options remain open to women after pregnancy.’ Businesses have warned however that the plans could spark chaos, particularly as the Lib Dems wanted each parent to be able to dip in and out of work throughout the parental leave entitlement. Mr Clegg praised the ‘many employers’ who understood the importance to retain the best staff through a better balance of work and home. Businesses that were regarded as family-friendly included Barclays, McDonald’s, TalkTalk, BT, Pizza Express, Matalan and the National Trust among others. Justine Roberts, Mumsnet CEO, said: ‘While we have legislation designed to protect women against discrimination in the workplace it’s clear that in many cases companies are simply not following the rules. She added: ‘Our survey reveals how important the culture created at work is. As members of our family friendly programme attest supporting women on their return to work improves retention rates and ultimately adds value to a company. ‘But with over half of mums saying they felt less employable and three-quarters saying it was harder to progress in their career since having children, it’s clear there’s still lots of work to be done to ensure family friendly practices are commonplace.’ One survey respondent told Mumsnet: ‘I was told that no-one wanted to see a pregnant woman waddling around the restaurant.’ Another user of the Mumsnet forum said on informing her employer she was pregnant: ‘I was told [by my boss he] was very disappointed in me.’ Best practice: Businesses considered 'family-friendly' who understood the balance between work and home included McDonald's, Barclays and TalkTalk . On returning to work, a quarter of mothers felt their bosses were not supportive. Nearly half (46 per cent) said they were made to feel guilty for leaving work on time to collect their children. Eight out of ten wanted there to be a cultural change to reduce discrimination around maternity leave with over half (56 per cent) saying more legislation was needed. One mother told the survey that she was ‘deliberately pushed towards less financially rewarding role as it was assumed I would not be interested in a more challenging and lucrative role any more.’ Another said: ‘Two weeks after returning to work I was deployed for one month over 100 miles from home. No choice but to stop breast feeding.’ Another said her job was given to someone else when she was on maternity leave and she did not find out until she had a return to work interview. The single most popular policy mothers wanted employers to adopt was flexible working with 28 per cent favouring this. Next most popular was emergency childcare provision, job shares and back to work programmes. The survey was carried out between 1 and 7 November and involved 1029 Mumsnet users.","Nick Clegg warned that the economy missed out when mothers were sidelined after returning from maternity leave .

Salmonella, insects, excrement and hair found in imported spices, from countries such as India and Vietnam, have caused outbreaks around the world, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. Some 12 per cent of imported spices contained what the FDA deemed as ‘filth’ - insects, excrement and hair – between 2007 and 2010, the new report said. The imported spices were also twice as likely to contain salmonella as any other inspected foods with almost 7 per cent of the goods containing the pathogen during the three-year period. Buyer beware: Salmonella, insects, excrement and hair has been found in imported spices from countries such as Vietnam and India, the US Food and Drug Administration claimed in a new report . Over three years, 749 spice shipments were refused entry into the US because of salmonella contamination while another 238 were sent back because they contained hair, excrement, insects or other contaminants. The FDA, which monitors food and drug safety for US consumers, decided to investigate imported spices after several spice-related illness outbreaks occurred around the world. Black and red pepper in salami from China, Vietnam and India caused hundreds of illnesses and some 14 known outbreaks effected more than 2,000 people, many children, since 1973 according to the FDA. The outbreaks caused 1,946 reported illnesses, 128 hospitalisations and two deaths. During the production process, harvest . and immediate storage were considered the stages when spices were most . at risk of contamination. All by hand: The FDA said many of the imported spices came from very small farms where animals are used to plough crops, produce is harvested by hand and spices dried in the open air . Some contaminated spices were allowed through customs because they were later cooked or treated, killing the salmonella. The FDA said that by the time the spices were eaten most of the pathogen was likely to be gone. The report also noted that the amount of . spices that an individual consumer would normally eat was so small that . most had less chance of getting sick from contaminated spices than from . contaminated fruit or vegetables. A FDA statement said: 'People’s tendency to eat small amounts of spices with meals generally lowers the probability of illness from contaminated spices relative to similarly contaminated foods consumed in larger amounts. 'It is also possible that illnesses caused by contaminated spices are under reported, particularly because of challenges related to attribution for minor ingredients in multi-ingredient foods.' According to Fox News, Michael Taylor, the deputy commissioner for foods at the FDA, said the agency was ‘not recommending that consumers stay away from spices’. He did, however, advise that when cooking, spices should be added before cooking to reduce the risk of getting sick. The FDA report said that farms and agricultural centres of varying size are used to produce spices around the world. Many are produced on very small farms where animals are used to plough crops. They are often harvested by hand and spices are dried in the open air.","Some 12 per cent of imported spices contained 'filth' while 7 per cent contained salmonella .

Foreign diplomats refusing to pay the Congestion Charge have racked up a staggering £74million in unpaid fines, it has been revealed. Over the past ten years, a third of embassies in London have ignored the controversial charge - claiming it is a local tax they are exempt from. Now, Transport for London (TfL) has revealed diplomats owe a whopping £74,047,592 - with the Americans being the biggest culprits. Shocking: Foreign diplomats refusing to pay the Congestion Charge have racked up £74million in unpaid fines . Since 2003, the US embassy has amassed £7.8million in fines - more than ten per cent of the overall total. They are joined by the Embassy of Japan, which owes £5.4million, and the Embassy of the Russian Federation, which has accumulated more than £5million. Other notable culprits are the High Commission for the Federal Republic of Nigeria (£4.3million) and the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany (£3.8million). It currently costs £10 to drive inside the Congestion Zone between 7am and 6pm on weekdays. Motorists who refuse to pay the charge with 28 days are left with a costly £130 fine. 1. American Embassy (£7,861,610) 2. Embassy of Japan (£5,405,550) 3. Embassy of the Russian Federation (£5,055,460) 4. High Commision for the Federal Republic of Nigeria (£4,351,960) 5. High Commision for the Federal Republic of Germany (£3,885,000) 6. Office of the High Commissioner for India (£3,163,370) 7. Embassy of the Republic of Poland (£2,603,270) 8. Office of the High Commissioner for Ghana (£2,379,620) 9. Embassy of The Republic of The Sudan (£2,200,735) 10. Kenya High Commission (£1,775,600) Despite repeated threats of legal action from TfL bosses, around one third of embassies continue to drive freely inside the zone. The US embassy today said it had no intention of paying the Congestion Charge - claiming it is exempt from the charge under the 1960 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Under the convention, all diplomats are exempt from paying local taxes - despite TfL saying it is 'a charge for a service and not a tax'. A US Embassy spokesman said: 'The US Embassy in London conscientiously abides by all UK laws, including paying fines for all traffic violations, such as parking and speeding violations. 'Our position on the direct tax established by Transport for London in 2003, more commonly known as the congestion charge, is based on the 1960 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which prohibits the imposition of this sort of tax on diplomatic missions. 'Our position is wholly in accordance with that agreement to which the United States and the United Kingdom are both signatories, and it is a position shared by many other diplomatic missions in London.' The Congestion Charge, which brings in around £110million a year, has generated more than £1.2billion in revenue since 2003. Around £960million of this has been spent on improving the bus network, £102million on roads and bridges and £70million on road safety. Figures released by TfL today show the total cost of fines has rocketed by £4million in the past five months alone - an increase of £31,000 per weekday. Culprits: The US embassy, left, has amassed £7.8million in unpaid fines since 2003, while the Embassy of the Russian Federation, right, owes more than £5million . Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL's General Manager for Congestion Charging, said: 'We and the UK Government are clear that the Congestion Charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. 'This means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it. Around two thirds of embassies in London do pay the charge, but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels. 'We will continue to pursue all unpaid Congestion Charge fees and related penalty charge notices and are pushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.'","Foreign embassies owe more than £74million in unpaid congestion charges .

A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years. Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit. The solicitor, who was nicknamed ‘Bash’ and hailed by criminals as a ‘top brief’, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial. Feeding information: Basharat Ditta, left, tipped off crime lord Neil Scarborough, right, about a major investigation into his drug trafficking activities . Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, . dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, . Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues. Inquiries . revealed Ditta was a 'regular user' of the Class A drug after tests . found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit . cards. Over an eight month . period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain . information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well . as one of his associates. All . four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a . major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across . Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. They . and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and . cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a . series of raids. Secret: Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed . Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, . who worked at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing . disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course . of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing. The . lawyer’s downfall came after police investigating Scarborough . discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February . 2011. Two detectives trailed . the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta’s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 . per cent under the lawyer’s bins in a black golf glove. Soon . after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta . who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football . stadium, Ewood Park. The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were . nine communications between them. 'Top brief' for criminals: The court heard Ditta was a 'regular user' of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards . Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to 'legal privilege.' During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him. In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business. But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them. Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: 'If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor. Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients. Office: Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, Lancashire, where top defence lawyer Basaharat Ditta worked . 'The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs. 'Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer. But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship. 'He thwarted the police’s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities. Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it. 'He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.' Exposed: Ditta, pictured outside Liverpool Crown Court, was arrested in 2011 after a police surveillance operation into drug trafficking . Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: 'If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.' But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: 'Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals. 'His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations. 'Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public. 'Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession. 'Lancashire’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice . 'Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law. We will find you and put you before the courts.' Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences. On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work. On a website forum one client said of Ditta: 'He’s a top brief. If you get arrested and go to the desk to give your details, they ask you if you want a brief and if so which one. 'More often than not when you say yes, I want Bash they just put their head in their hands and sigh cause they know it’s a big waste of time. You aint getting charged!'","Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough .

A businessman embroiled in a High Court cash fight with his estranged wife 'transferred assets and shares after his marriage got into difficulties', a judge was told today. Lawyers for Michelle Young suggested to Mr Justice Moor that assets belonging to her husband Scot Young had been transferred to a 'lieutenant' via other people. They indicated that transfers had come to light after a financial investigator examined Mr Young’s finances. Battle: Michelle Young, 49, told a High Court judge that her estranged businessman husband Scot once spent £1 million a year on dining out as she launched a High Court divorce settlement battle . Mrs Young, 49, estimates that Mr Young, 51, is worth 'a few billion at least' and says 'there was a vast fortune hidden'. Mr . Young has yet to give evidence. But he disputes Mrs Young’s claims and . has said he is 'penniless and bankrupt', a victim of 'financial . meltdown' and 'hopelessly insolvent'. Financial . investigator Burke Files today gave evidence about Mr Young’s finances . and was questioned by Rex Howling QC, for Mrs Young. Mr . Howling said there appeared to be occasions where assets or shares had . been transferred by Mr Young then later appeared in the name of his 'lieutenant'. Mr Files agreed. 'The . various schedules suggest that Mr Young could have been telling his . advisors that he was worth as much as £500 million in 2005/06,' Mr . Howling has told the judge. 'Mr Young has resolutely failed to provide evidence of where his money has gone.' He added: 'Mrs Young asserts that Mr . Young has transferred his beneficial interest in the majority of his . assets to a number of closely-allied third parties.' High seas: Mrs Young said her husband Young paid '£2 million to £4 million' for a boat - 'a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat' - and had talked about buying a 'very expensive helicopter' to fly between a home near Oxford and London . Michelle Young has said she would ‘settle for £300million’ of her husband’s money, plus legal bills. Michelle . Young and Scot Young – once a successful property tycoon – embarked on . the final chapter of a seven-year court divorce battle this week. Mr . Young insists he has no wealth or . assets to fund the vast divorce settlement his wife demands. Earlier . this year he served three months of a six-month prison term for . contempt of court after he failed to reveal information about his . finances. Mrs Young, mother to his two children, continues to insist . he is hiding the truth, and told the High Court he had ‘a vast . fortune hidden’. She has refused to complete their divorce until the . settlement is agreed, stopping him marrying his fiancée Noelle Reno, a . 29-year-old model. Plans: Once divorced Mr Young plans to wed his fiancee, 29-year-old model and actress, Noelle Reno . Mrs Young told Mr Justice Moor of the extravagant life she had enjoyed with her husband before they separated in 2006. ‘We . had vast estates. We had staff,’ she said. ‘We had a very luxury . lifestyle.’ Mrs Young, a former model, said she had jewellery which . cost a million pounds and which she auctioned at Sotheby’s for between . £160,000 and £180,000. She added: ‘We had a chandelier in our drawing room. The other chandelier sits in the White House. They were valuable assets. ‘I . paid £10,000 for a beautiful piece of furniture around 15 or 18 years . ago. It was a beautiful side piece. I bought that at Sotheby’s.’ Mrs . Young said they had moved house a number of times and the profit on one . house was ‘£10million’. She said Mr Young paid ‘£2million to £4million’ for a yacht – ‘a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat’ – and had . talked about buying a ‘very expensive helicopter’ to fly between their . homes in Oxfordshire and London. The couple lived in Belgravia, . central London, for three or four years and in Miami where they owned . three Porsche cars, she said. Mrs Young told the judge: ‘My husband . has never produced a shred of real evidence about where one asset has . gone to.’ She accused him of being ‘incredibly’ secretive about finance . and accused him of hiding his ‘vast fortune’ offshore. ‘He was . constantly on the phone to his high-profile friends and advisers talking . about  multi-million-pound deals he was involved with,’ she said. ‘If . I heard it... he would quickly run off... or jump out of the Phantom or . Ferrari so I couldn’t hear.’ She added: ‘He was  secretive. I wasn’t . made aware very much regarding the business side.’ Mrs Young, who in . the past has described herself as a  ‘pioneer’ for divorcing women, . said she wanted a £25million house and wanted to live in Belgravia. She . was previously awarded £30,000 a month to pay for rent and school fees . for their two daughters, Scarlett, 20 and Sasha, 18. In court hearings earlier this year she claimed she was owed more than £1million in unpaid maintenance. Mr Young denied his ex-wife’s allegations yesterday and at one point asked the judge if her ‘ranting’ was allowed. He . was made bankrupt over a £1.8million debt in 2010 and claims to be . living off the generosity of friends including entrepreneur Sir Philip . Green and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. The estranged . couple began their relationship in 1989 and married in 1995, before . separating in 2006. After a hearing due to last four weeks Mr Justice . Moor will make a final decision about how much Mr Young is worth. The trial is being staged in private but Mr Justice Moor has given permission for it to be reported. The trial continues.

Jailed: Lorry driver Ethan Roberts admitted causing the deaths of a married couple after he crashed into them while texting his girlfriend . A lorry driver has been jailed after his HGV toppled onto a car killing a married couple while he texted a girlfriend. Ethan Roberts, 44, deleted the message before police arrived at the crash scene in an attempt to avoid getting caught, a court heard. Hair salon boss Mark McHale, 46, and his wife Tamsie, 43, a primary school deputy head, were crushed to death on the motorway as they drove to Manchester Airport for a holiday to Cuba. Roberts, of Immingham, Lincolnshire, was texting as he drove on a 50mph roadwork section of the M62 near Leeds, West Yorks. He had received 58 messages from girlfriend Helen Chapman in three days before the crash - all while he was driving, Leeds Crown Court heard. Roberts was jailed for five yeas and three months after admitting causing two deaths by dangerous driving. Sentencing, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'Those who drive HGVs owe a particular responsibility to other road users because of the nature of the vehicle they drive and because the results of dangerous driving can be catastrophic. 'Evidence clearly shows you had a regular habit of reading and composing and sending text messages while driving. 'If ever a case demonstrated the . obvious danger of that this is it and the danger in doing that was . obvious and it created a grossly avoidable distraction. Victims: Mark and Tamsie McHale were crushed to death in the motorway crashed as they drove to the airport for a holiday to Cuba . Tragic: Roberts' 19-tonne HGV toppled into the car and crushed Mr and Mrs McHale on the M62 . 'You . received a text message very shortly before the collision and you were . either reading it or composing a reply when you lost control of your . lorry.' Happy: Mr McHale owned a hair salon in Bishop Auckland, County Durham . Prosecutor Richard . Clews told Leeds Crown Court that Roberts’ 19 tonne articulated lorry . began to veer into the inside lane as he was distracted by his mobile . phone messages, on July 25, last year. It . pushed Mr McHale’s Audi into the third lane, facing the wrong way, and . the lorry jack-knifed, its fully loaded trailer unit toppled onto the . car, crushing and killing McHale and his wife Tamsie. Mr Mchale owned Hair Haus, in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, and his wife was deputy head at Gilesgate Primary School, Durham. Judge Marson said the hard-working couple were 'on their way no doubt to a well-earned holiday'. Roberts tried to blame Mr McHale for the crash and examination of his phone showed no messages at the time concerned - but checks revealed a text had been deleted. Further records showed that Roberts had received 58 text messages from Helen Chapman over the last three days - all while tachograph records showed he was driving. The last one had arrived about one minute 16 seconds before the collision. He had sent 48 messages to her in return. 'It is clear he was in the habit of both reading and composing text messages while driving and had done so frequently on the day of the collision,' said Mr Clews. Cover-up: The court heard Roberts had deleted the text message following the M62 crash in a bid to hide his guilt . 'In all probability, the defendant was either reading the message from Helen Chapman or had read it and was in the process of making a reply. There is no other reason for deleting it.' The court heard Roberts was driving from Grimsby to Burnley, Lancashire, when the accident happened shortly before 6am. After the collision he was found by witnesses bleeding in the cab of his vehicle and on the phone to his boss. Roberts admitted two charges of causing the deaths of Mr and Mrs McHale by dangerous driving. He was jailed for five years and three months and disqualified from driving for five years. The judge said he accepted Roberts had not set out that day to kill or injure anybody and that his remorse was genuine. But it was a seriously aggravating feature that he was in the habit of texting while driving, he said. Mitigating Peter Horgan told the court he had been driving HGVs for 13 years, doing an average 30,000 miles a year without a problem. 'He accepts on occasions he did make and send text messages.'","Ethan Roberts, 44, veered his HGV into the inside lane of M62 near Leeds .

A teenager from Shrewsbury who has been caring for both her parents for a decade has been nominated for a Women Of The Year Award. Sarah Thomas, 19, cares for her mother Carole, 56, and father Ray, 59, who suffer from multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia respectively and has been looking out for them since she was a toddler. As well as looking after her parents Sarah campaigns tirelessly to gain better recognition and support for other young carers, and to support the MS Society. Sarah Thomas cares for her mother and father, who suffer from multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia respectively . Most children enjoy a carefree childhood, free from adult responsibilities. But for as long as she can remember, Sarah has had to play the grown-up. 'People were amazed to see me put my own shoes on before I could speak, but it was what I'd always known,' she says. 'I didn't realise I was doing more than other children.' When Sarah was 6, her mother had a serious relapse and her father was hospitalised with blood poisoning. 'For the first time, I was able to understand the seriousness of our situation,' she says. As her mother's health worsened, she took on increasing responsibilities: preparing meals, doing housework and helping her to the bathroom, causing chronic back pain. 'Young carers are often accused of being extremely serious, and even bullied,' says Sarah. 'But we're just caught up in bigger problems.' Sarah is a representative for the Young Carers' Forum set up by the Red Cross . Determined to make a difference, when she was eight Sarah became a representative for the Young Carers' Forum set up by the Red Cross, which provided carers the chance to be playful and make up for their lost childhood. Then, aged nine, Sarah was taught how to give her mum injections. 'It was daunting, but I tried to take it in my stride,' she says. Five years later, another devastating blow hit the family when Sarah's dad was diagnosed with a degenerative bone disease and fibromyalgia. 'He used to be a builder, so it was hard for us to watch him deteriorate,' she says. 'Everyday tasks can be difficult for him on a bad day, whether that's lifting and carrying or putting on his coat. I help him wherever I can.' With first-hand insight into carers' issues, in 2010, she headed to Downing Street with the Red Cross to question David Cameron on what support the government planned to offer. One of the issues she raised was her restricted opportunities to study at university - a problem she overcame by studying an Open University degree. 'At a normal uni I'd worry about the fees - they'd go to waste if something happened at home and I had to leave.' When Sarah was invited to carry the Olympic torch in 2012 she used the opportunity to raise money for her local branch of the MS Society, and has volunteered with the charity for over ten years. Today, she continues to campaign alongside caring for her parents, setting up an awareness group for those crossing over from child to adult carers at her college, and training to provide emotional support on the Carers UK phone line. 'I'll never stop campaigning and building awareness for carers of all ages,' she says. 'I want to break down stigmas attached to us and help get the support we need.' Sarah, 11, pictured with her mother at a cricket match for the MS society in 2005 . Sarah hasn't let her unusual childhood stop her living her life, and in 2010 met her fiancé, Sam Eaton, 21, through a mutual friend. 'I've always been happy to sacrifice partying to help out at home, but I used to worry it would stop me meeting someone,' says Sarah. 'Sam has made my life complete.' Jenna Mahoney of the MS Society says: 'Sarah's been caring for her mum since she could walk. She's volunteered for her local branch of the MS Society since she was a teenager and played an active role in raising awareness of MS and the work of young carers.

She was leaving work at around 9pm when the pair pounced before she had time to drive off. She said: ‘They were saying, “we have got a knife. Give us your keys and your bag”. On the approach: Mrs Crockett said she was wary of the two figures approaching her on the Leeds street . Attack: The pair run at the solicitor, who is 5ft 6ins tall, in an attempt to get her handbag . Keep back: The solicitor tries to defend herself against the white, hooded attackers . One of the robbers grabs hold of her bag, which has her BMW keys in it, but she refuses to let go . ‘There was no way I was going to let it happen and become a victim. I had to stand up for myself, no matter what the consequences. ‘I was dragged down the street, and it seemed they were going to stop at nothing to get hold of my keys and my car.’ Help came when a car being driven by a woman drove up the road, prompting the attackers to flee - with her car key. ‘They managed to get my key out of my bag, despite me clinging on to the strap,’ she added. ‘I have had my law practice here since 1993 and I have always had BMWs so I don’t know why they have targeted me now. ‘It’s a nice car which I have only had since June, but I have always felt safe until now. ‘The police have suggested I get the bus to work from now on, but I won’t let them beat me.’ The robbers, who have yet to be identified, go out of view as a car approaches the scene . But one manages to get back and steal her car keys just when she thinks she's safe . Robbers gone: Police have suggested Mrs Crockett should take the bus to work now, but she has refused . The robbers were both white. One was said to have blond hair and one was wearing an Adidas hooded top with a logo on the front and black or grey trainers with white soles. He was about 5ft 9ins tall. The other was taller and wearing a dark grey hooded top with tassels on the hood and dark footwear with a white sole.

Anger: Chief Secretary to the Treasure Danny Alexander said there was no 'sense' behind the figures . Scotland receives more than £1,600 extra per head than the English, exposing the massive benefits they enjoy by being part of the Union. New national statistics published yesterday showed the glaring disparities of public spending ahead of next year’s independence referendum. England is short-changed to the tune of three per cent a year per person, while Scotland gets 16 per cent more spent on it than the UK average. Northern Ireland gets a massive 24 per cent extra spent on it proportionately and Wales 10 per cent compared to the UK average. Every Scots gets £10,152 spent on them, compared to £8,529 for the English, £9,709 for the Welsh and £10,876 for those living in Northern Ireland. The UK average spend per head is £8,788 - £1,364 more than the Scots. Those in living in the South East of England lose out the most. They get just £7,638 per head of public spending. Londoners, in contrast, have a healthy £9,435 splurged on them which the Treasury put down to the higher infrastructure and wage costs. A breakdown of the different policy areas show that Scots enjoy £307 per head spent on housing, while the English get just £138. Scots also get more than twice as much spent on them than the English on economic development: £992 per head compared to £469. Spending on health is £1,912 per person in England compared to £2,115 in Scotland, where prescriptions are free. Education is another area where Scots get more resources - as well as not paying university tuition fees. Some £1,441 is spent per head on education in Scotland compared to £1,360 in England. Scots, who enjoy free personal care, have £1,857 spent on them for social care and pensions, compared to £1,652 for the English. The figures were seized on by UK ministers who argued that they showed the advantage Scotland gets from being part of the Union. Chief . Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: ‘These figures . demonstrate that the people of Scotland continue to see a real financial . benefit of over £1,300 per person compared to the UK average. The UK . remains the most successful economic, and political, union in history . and Scotland is one of its greatest success stories. It makes no sense . to put this at risk through separation.’ The generous funding package stems from the controversial Barnett formula, which was based on population, rather than need. However . council bosses in England and Wales this week called for the ‘unfair . competitive advantage’ handed to Scotland to be scrapped. Scaremongering: The SNP said Scots per head paid more tax - if North Sea Oil revenue is counted . The Local Government Association said the UK Government should dump the 34 year-old Barnett Formula. But the SNP accused the UK of scaremongering and not taking into account that Scots per head paid more tax - if North Sea Oil revenue is counted. Annabelle Ewing, the SNP MSP said: ‘The best of both worlds is an independent Scotland in charge of own abundant resources, and a relationship of equality with the rest of the UK. ‘A No vote would be the worst of all worlds because it would be a green light for the Treasury to slash Scotland’s budget and the services we all depend on. ‘ . She added that politicians south of the border were ‘itching to impose even harsher spending cuts in Scotland’. A spokesman for pro-UK campaign Better Together said: ‘These figures underline the fact that we have the best of both worlds here in Scotland. ‘We have a Scottish parliament making decisions about our health, our education and our police, and we have the strength and security of being part of the United Kingdom. Devolution works. Independence would end it and would be a huge leap into the unknown.’ The Scottish Government will next week release its white paper on what an independent Scotland would be like, should Scots vote to break away from the UK in next September’s referendum. Future: The Scottish Government will next week release its white paper on what an independent Scotland would be like . But Scotland’s Advocate General, Lord Wallace of Tankerness will say in a speech today FRI that the ‘real challenge to the Scottish Government [is] to what extend will the white paper own up to the uncertainties which would inevitably flow from a ‘Yes’ vote in a referendum’. Scotland’s membership of NATO and the European Union would have to be renegotiated and Scotland may even be deprived of using the pound as its main currency. Switching to a ‘needs-based’ formula would give England more than £4 billion extra a year to spend, the LGA said. That would amount to around £94 more per head for the English, £103 more for the Welsh, while Scots would be stripped of £846 and Northern Ireland would lose £516 per person. The First Minister of Wales this week also signalled he would veto the so-called sterling zone if Scotland voted for independence. In an article for the Scottish Daily Mail, Carwyn Jones wrote: ‘It is highly unlikely that currency union without strong fiscal controls could work, there would be too much uncertainty, it would slow down decision making and the risk to Wales and Northern Ireland would be far greater - so it would only be right for the views of the rest of the UK to be heard. ‘Given the experience of the Eurozone in recent years, and the uncertainty which surrounded the various bail-outs, then I am not convinced that a shared currency would work from the Welsh perspective.’","National statistics showed the glaring disparities of public spending .

According to the lawsuit, Madden gave . written notice by the school in August 2012 that her daughter had . congenital herpes simplex and indicated how to treat it. The suit says the school never contacted the mother about the issue until Nov. 12, 2012, when the mother was called and told that it was urgent that she leave work and pick up her child from school because ‘she was contagious.’ The girl was treated at a doctor's office and given permission to return to school, after it was determined she was not contagious. Madden says she was later shocked to learn the school nurse had been removing her daughter's clothing, without her permission, to check for lesions.

The lawsuit claims that the school . failed to follow their own guidelines, failed to provide the school . nurse with adequate training and negligently searched the girl and . negligently kept her from attending school. As a result, she is now suing the school system, for ‘great emotional distress and suffering, humiliation and embarrassment, and for all medical expenses past and future.’ Madden also claims that she lost her job as a consequence of having to take several off work to handle the matter. A response from the Hamilton County Board of Education alleges that Madden's daughter was ‘unable to self-toilet and was therefore dependent upon school officials to change her diaper,’ reports WRCB. The response continues to state  that ‘…this child had a diminished expectation of privacy such that any routine examination that school officials may have conducted during the course of routine diaper changing would not have violated any clearly established rights of the child…’","Brandy Madden of Chattanooga, Tennessee, claims a school nurse removed her daughter's clothing without first seeking her permission .

Myles Thomas, who said he has been getting over a cold, was walking to the University of Minnesota campus to grab some pizza on Monday night and spat on the ground - just as a patrol car passed. He was stunned when he saw the car make a U-turn and approach him and his friends. 'The police officers... informed me that spitting on the sidewalk or any public property was subject for a citation,' Thomas, 21, wrote on his Facebook page following the incident. 'Shocked, I questioned them about it, as this was something I had never . even heard of.' Shocked: Myles Thomas, 21, has been fined $115 after police saw him spitting on the sidewalk in Minneapolis . He apologized for spitting but, claiming that he had been 'a little under the weather', he spat into the snow again - and the officers weren't happy about it. 'He and his partner got out of . the car and approached me and told me to come to them and put my hands . on the car,' he wrote. 'Shortly after they searched me and put me in the back of the . squad car, where they eventually wrote me out a ticket and released me.' While Thomas said he accepted the . law, he said he did not feel citing him for spitting was a valuable use . of police time - especially as there has recently been a spate of . attacks on campus. 'I do not understand how students can be harmed and these recent cases . go unsolved but I am cited for simply spitting on the sidewalk,' he wrote on his Facebook page. His Facebook post was shared thousands of times - but the misdemeanor and the fee still stand. Cited: He learned that it is illegal in the city - and many others across the U.S. - to spit on sidewalks . Scene: He said he respects the law but he thinks the police, who stopped him outside the University of Minnesota campus, pictured, should have spent their time stopping more serious crimes elsewhere . Speaking to KARE11 about the incident, he said that he respected the law - but insisted he had just not known it was an offence. 'It is a little wacky,' he said. 'I mean, what can you do though? It is the law. You're . supposed to obey the laws of the land.' According to a city ordinance, it is illegal to spit on sidewalks, buses and public areas, KARE reported. The habit is illegal in cities across much of the U.S. Another ordinance in Minneapolis states that spitting on the . floor or furnishing of a boat, canoe, building or walkway, is also illegal and comes with a fee of $115. Thomas conceded that next time, he will 'just bring a bag or something' to spit in.

Shocking footage has emerged of an elephant being violently beaten in India following an undercover investigation. The malnourished 14-year-old elephant called Sunder is chained by two legs, writhing in pain and struggling to stand as its handlers, known as a mahouts, strike it repeatedly with the pole. Sunder visibly recoils in fear from the weapon-wielding young men who continue to threaten the animal with violence after it has finally managed to stand. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An undercover investigation has uncovered footage of an elephant being violently beaten in India . Sunder was chained and abused for six years at the Jyotiba Temple in Kolhapur. The animal was dragged from a forest in the south-west of the country and presented as a 'gift'. Following orders by the Maharashtra Forest Department and Project Elephant the temple was told to send Sunder to a sanctuary. But he is being kept in an old dark poultry shed in Warananagar instead. The investigation was carried out by campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). It says the Nagpur-based principal chief conservator of forests and current head of forest force, SWH Naqvi, has failed to implement the state and central government orders. Peta say Indian politicians are claiming Sunder is fine and healthy. The Kolhapur division of the Forest Department also says 'every month a veterinary doctor visits the place to check the elephant,' according to PETA. Cruel: The young men are seen hitting the elephant so hard it falls to the ground unable to stand up . Plea: The malnourished 14-year-old elephant called Sunder is chained by its two legs while it is violently beaten . Fear: Sunder visibly recoils in fear from the weapon-wielding young men who continue to threaten the animal . Evidence: A distressed Sunder collapses to the ground after taking a beating from its handlers . These claims are in spite of scarring on Sunder's legs from abuse, he has a low weight and he is being forced to stand on concrete all day with no opportunity for exercise. This new video shows the animal is also being beaten. Dr Mel Richardson, elephant expert who examined the footage, said: 'He is fearful of the mahout.' 'From what I can see his legs and feet are in bad shape. Suffering: Sunder tethered in the temple shed, where he was taken after being dragged from a forest in the South-West of the country . 'He is in a dangerous situation and needs relief – no chains, natural substrate, and space to exercise.' 'Vinay Kore and the Kolhapur division of the Forest Department seem to be trying to fool the public, but an elephant needs space to roam and the companionship of other elephants – not more years of being chained on concrete, cowering in fear of a violent mahout', says PETA UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi. 'It's long past time to follow through on their promises: Sunder needs to be sent to a sanctuary today.' Former Beatle Paul McCartney and Hollywood actress Pamela Anderson have previously written to authorities calling for Sunder's release. Brutal: Sunder's feet are chained with spiked manacles so he cannot take a single step in any direction . McCartney wrote: ‘I have seen photographs of young Sunder, the elephant kept alone in a shed at Jyotiba Temple and put in chains with spikes. ‘I appeal to you to do what is right here and get Sunder post-haste to rehabilitation in the forest. ‘Years of his life have been ruined by keeping him and abusing him in this way and enough is enough. ‘I most respectfully call on you to use your authority to get Sunder out, placed in your protective custody and eventually integrated into a herd in the forest.’ PETA India has filed a petition with the High Court of Bombay asking the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD) to implement its previous order – as well as the recommendation from Project Elephant under the Ministry of Environment and Forests – and retire Sunder to a sanctuary. Following pressure from PETA India, more than 26,000 people who have signed the online petition. The petition filed at the High Court of Bombay is listed for its first hearing on December 10 this year.

The Ford Mustang, America's classic sports car, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a sleek new design and plans to go global. The iconic car, which has featured in countless films, including the 007 and Fast and Furious franchises, has been given its first makeover since 2005. The new-look 2015 Mustang was revealed on Thursday at events in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Sydney, Barcelona and Ford's hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. Scroll down for video . New direction: Ford has released a remodeled Mustang to celebrate the car's 50th anniversary . Icon: The Mustang has featured in several films, including Charlie's Angels and James Bond movies . 'Mustang cuts to the heart and soul of . our company and really represents our company at its best,' chief operating officer Mark Fields told dealers and employees in Dearborn. The new model is due to go on sale in the U.S. next autumn and will be available in Europe and Asia in 2015. Ford sells more pickups in a week than it does Mustangs in a month, but the company says the Mustang has the highest name recognition and highest favorable opinion of any of its cars. And car companies count on beautiful sports cars to cast a glow over the rest of their lineup. The Mustang's first full redesign since 2005 presented Ford with a tough task: update and freshen an icon without alienating its passionate fans. 'When you work on an icon of the company, it's a mixture of tremendous pride and honor and a little bit of angst because there's a lot of responsibility,' Mr Fields said. More than 9 million Mustangs have been sold since 1964, and the car has more than 300 fan clubs around the world, including one in Iceland and one solely for owners of yellow Mustangs. The first Mustang was revealed at the World Fair in New York, which Mr Fields attended as a three-year-old. Classic: More than 9 million Mustangs have been sold since 1964 . Sleek: The latest model has a more dramatic finish but retains its classic features . Driving seat: Ford's chief executive Alan Mulally tests the new model . Farrah Fawcett drove a white one in Charlie's Angels, Steve McQueen raced a dark green one through the streets of San Francisco in 1968's Bullitt, and it also appeared in Diamonds Are Forever and Gold Finger. The new car takes plenty of cues from the old. The long hood and sloping fastback are still there, as is the trapezoid-shaped grille with the Mustang logo from the original. But the new car sits lower and wider, and the roof tapers dramatically in the front and back. The signature rounded headlights are smaller and set back under a  chiseled brow, while the traditional three-bar taillights are three-dimensional and tucked beneath the rear deck lid. This new generation of Mustang has been engineered to meet international safety and emissions standards. A right-hand-drive version will be sold in the UK and Australia, and Ford will market the car more heavily overseas. Ford design chief J Mays said that while international needs were taken into account, the design wasn't influenced by European or Asian sensibilities. 'The reason they love it is because of its American-ness,' he said. Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst with IHS Automative, expected modest overseas. IHS forecasted European Mustang sales would triple from current levels to about 2,500 in 2015, while sales in China were likely to remain low because two-door coupes aren't popular there. Redesign: The latest model presented a challenge to designers who wanted to retain the Mustang's character while updating its capability . Road trip: Ford hopes the Mustang will sell well on the international market . Coupes make up less than 1 per cent of sales annually across the globe, Ms Brinley said. But they're still an important car for automakers. 'It's an aspirational body style. It signals a sporty drive and a sexier product,' she said. Ford hopes Mustang can become the top selling pony car in the U.S. The Chevrolet Camaro, which followed the Mustang to market in 1966 and was last redesigned in 2009, has outsold its rival for the past three years and is on track to do it again this year, according to Kelley Blue Book. Aaron Bragman, the Detroit bureau chief for the website cars.com, liked the new Mustang but questioned whether it could beat the Chevy Camaro, which has a less retro-inspired design. 'Anyone looking for something a bit more modern is going to choose the Camaro,' he said. Mustang buyers will have three engines to choose from: updated versions of the 3.7l V6, which gets a projected 300 horsepower, and 5.0l V8, with 420 horsepower, as well as a 2.3l EcoBoost four-cylinder that gets a projected 305 horsepower. Ford will also offer updated six-speed manual and automatic transmissions. Final numbers for horsepower and fuel economy will be released later. Inviting: The interior has brushed aluminum fittings and better quality materials than previous models . Inside, new options include blind-spot detection and toggle switches that adjust the steering, stability control and other settings depending on the road conditions. The interior also has nicer materials, with brushed aluminum replacing painted plastics. Ford isn't saying how much the new Mustang will cost. The current one starts at about $23,000. A convertible version will also be offered. Dealers at the Dearborn event said they were pleased with the new car. 'They captured what's distinctly Mustang but it's new and fresh,' Brian Godfrey, general manager of Pat Milliken Ford in Redford, Michigan, said. When Gail Wise drove away from a Chicago Ford dealership in the spring of 1964, she didn't realize hers was the first Mustang ever sold. Ms Wise paid $3,347 for the car, and was happy to have a convertible. It wasn't until she was on the road, with other drivers honking and flagging her down, that she realized what she had. 'I felt like a movie star,' she said. On the road: Gail Wise, the first person to own a Ford Mustang, poses with the car she bought in 1964 and still owns today . Fifty years and 9 million Mustang sales later, Ms Wise was on hand to celebrate the 2015 version of the iconic pony car. With her was the original Mustang convertible, which still sits in her garage. Ms Wise was 22 and freshly out of Chicago Teachers College when she decided to buy a car to commute to her new job as a third grade teacher. She went to Johnson Ford and asked for a convertible, since her family already owned two other Ford convertibles. 'I thought I deserved a convertible,' she said with a laugh. The manager didn't have any on the floor, but took her into a back room and pulled a tarp off the new Mustang. It was April 15 - two days before the car was officially supposed to go on sale - but he offered it to her anyway. 'It was sporty. It was perfect. It went zoom zoom,' she said. She got $400 for a 1958 Chevrolet she traded in. Ms Wise taught for three years before getting married and moving to South Carolina with her husband, Tom, who was in the Navy. But they kept the car, which has been fully restored. The car now sits in their Park Ridge garage in Illinois next to a 2013 Ford Escape. It made the four-hour trip to Dearborn on a trailer, but the Wises still take it on shorter journeys, including a trip last year that included a few laps on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 'It's incredible that it's still such a popular car,' she said.","Ford goes after international audience with Europe and Asia releases .

Mary Berry and her husband Paul Hunnings (pictured when she became a CBE) say they give each other IOUs at Christmas instead of gifts .

"By . Fred Redwood . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 23 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:07 EST, 23 November 2013 . Although he will be 80 in March, conductor Sir Roger Norrington shows no signs of slowing down. His engagements diary is booked three years in advance and he travels worldwide to conduct 50 concerts a year. As well as all this, there is his annual stint at the Proms, where  he has taken to the podium for the past 30 years. Now he also has to organise the sale of his house – a late Victorian gem near Newbury in Berkshire, on the market at £2,995,000, which he has only recently finished renovating. Yet he makes light of his busy schedule. Impressive estate: Sir Roger Norrington and his wife bought Nalder Hill House, which has seven bedrooms, as well as four one-bedroom flats and three cottages, 17 years ago . ‘Buying this property was a family venture,’ he says. ‘Now there are fewer of us, the place is too big – it’s like a snail’s shell stuck to my back.’ Sir Roger and his choreographer wife Kay, 61, bought Nalder Hill House 17 years ago. It was big enough to enable them to install Kay’s mother and stepfather in one of three cottages in the grounds and make a steady income from letting the four one-bedroom flats attached to the house. However, what attracted them to the property most was its potential as a restoration project. Nalder Hill was then a rather sad and gloomy hotel, but Sir Roger saw the chance to transpose his musical beliefs into interior design. ‘Follow the exact instructions of Beethoven in 1810 and the music somehow sounds modern,’ says Sir Roger, whose musical trademark is performing classical works exactly  as they would have sounded when written. ‘Similarly with a house – just show up what was originally there and it lives again.’ The couple had previously restored a 17th Century cottage in nearby  Inkpen. However, Nalder Hill, with its Fawlty-esque odour of failure, had been more thoughtlessly fouled up. Big project: Sir Roger has spent a majority of the time living at Nalder Hill renovating the Victorian gem . Standing in the magnificent drawing room, with its views over the Kennet valley, Kay points out the minuscule attention to detail they have brought to the restoration. Every plastic light switch has been taken out and replaced with Victorian brass fittings; Victorian bell pushes are now in place; the fireplaces, one in every room, have been restored; faded wallpaper has been replaced with silk fabric inserts between panelling; cornicing has been freshly coloured with gold leaf. That is quite apart from the major structural repairs – the rewiring, new roofing, replumbing and new copper gutters. It all took 15 years, and when I enquire about the price of the works, Sir Roger replies simply: ‘Don’t ask!’ The drawing room opens into the dining room and along the corridor there is Sir Roger’s study, with its baby grand piano, floor-to-ceiling bookcases and imposing desk. It’s only when you see upstairs – where, apart from the four flats, there are seven bedrooms with dressing rooms and bathrooms – that you truly appreciate the size of this house. Did Sir Roger regret, I wonder, taking time out a few years ago to appear on Maestro, a television series involving eight celebrities, including Jane Asher, Katie Derham, Peter Snow and David Soul, competing against one another to find the best conductor? Veteran in the game: Sir Roger Norrington has been conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Last Night of the Proms for three decades . ‘No – I loved it,’ he says. ‘A lot of people learned a lot from it about classical music. The winner, Sue Perkins, was extremely good.’He is remarkably unstuffy, and any talk about conducting is infused with self-deprecation. ‘The great conductors – and I don’t consider myself one – have supernatural powers,’ he says. ‘I just use my eyes and gestures and shout, “Play in tune, you b******s!” ’ It’s little wonder that Sir Roger is regarded with such affection by orchestras. His warmest memories of Nalder Hill are  of the times when the entire Stuttgart Orchestra – 100 musicians – visited for lunch parties in his five acres of grounds. ‘Orchestras don’t usually socialise with their conductor, which is silly,’ he says. ‘They have come three times and each time was marvellous. We have a hog roast and a jazz band plays.’ Much of the countryside surrounding the house is shown in a gigantic mural in the hallway, covering three walls. One direction looks towards Oxford and the spires of the university city are exaggerated so as to stand out. The artist the Norringtons commissioned to create the mural even included a tiny depiction of Sir Roger in a boat on the River Cherwell. The death of Kay’s mother and her stepfather’s move into a care home  led to the sale. But who will buy it? ‘Maybe some international businessman or rich rock star,’ says Kay. ‘It’s handy for London and the airports and big enough for an entourage, staff and an extended family.’ knightfrank.co.uk, 020 3641 5162 .","Proms conductor Sir Roger Norrington is selling his £2,995,000 home .
