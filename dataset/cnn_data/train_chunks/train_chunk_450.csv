"Nigeria has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Islamist terror group Boko Haram that includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls, Nigerian officials said Friday. The deal came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan. ""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" Tukur said. Officials provided few details about the release. Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, did not specify when the girls would be freed. He said not all would be let go at once, but a ""significant number"" would be released soon. ""A batch of them will be released shortly, and this will be followed by further actions from Boko Haram,"" he said. ""It is a process. ... It is not a question of hours and days."" The Nigerian government consented to some demands by Boko Haram, but Okupe declined to provide details. The government, he said, ""is looking beyond the girls. We want to end the insurgency in this country."" ""On the war front,"" he added, ""we can say there is peace now."" The agreement was first reported by Agence France-Presse. What is Boko Haram? The terrorist group abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing. Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur. ""The group has shown willingness to abide by the agreement which â€Žit demonstrated with the release of the Chinese and Cameroonian hostages few days ago,"" Tukur said. In cross-border attacks by Boko Haram this week, eight Cameroonian soldiers and 107 group members were killed in heavy fighting that lasted two days in northern Cameroon, the country's defense ministry said Friday, according to state broadcaster CRTV. The militants led an incursion near Limani, close to the border with Nigeria, on Wednesday, equipped with heavy weapons, including at least one tank, CRTV said, citing information from the defense ministry. The fighting lasted two hours and resumed on Thursday, when Cameroonian soldiers forced the militants back across the border into Nigeria. Seven Cameroonian soldiers were injured. A Boko Haram tank and other vehicles were destroyed and weapons and ammunition were seized by Cameroonian forces, according to CRTV. A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is  unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap. Where are the missing girls? The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram was founded 12 years ago by Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic cleric who called for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. Police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the Internet.","""On the war front, we can say there is peace now,"" government spokesman says .

"A man who checked in to the Navy's Substance Abuse and Recovery Program for alcoholism treatment was also treated for a Google Glass addiction, according to a new study. San Diego doctors say the 31-year-old man ""exhibited significant frustration and irritability related to not being able to use his Google Glass."" He has a history of substance abuse, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, they say. The man was using his Google Glass for up to 18 hours a day in the two months leading up to his admission in September 2013, according to the study. He wore it to work and reported feeling more confident in social situations while wearing it. He removed it only to sleep and bathe, according to the study authors. The controversial eyewear allows users to access online information, shoot photos or video and send messages.  It is controlled by voice or by using the tiny touchpad on its side. Potential dangers of wearing the device, including decreased awareness and headaches, have been documented. Google Glass users frequently reach for the device, tapping near their temples to control its features; this patient repeatedly did the same, even when the device was not there. ""He reported that if he had been prevented from wearing the device while at work, he would become extremely irritable and argumentative,"" the doctors write. This is the first known case of Internet addiction disorder involving Google Glass, according to the study authors. It is not a recognized disorder in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the go-to resource book for mental health professionals. ""Individuals with IAD manifest severe emotional, social, and mental dysfunction in multiple areas of daily activities due to their problematic use of technology and the internet,"" according to the study abstract. While in the treatment program, the man experienced withdrawal symptoms that he reportedly said were much worse than the withdrawal he went through from alcohol. After 35 days at the center, the patient reported a reduction in irritability and was no longer repeatedly moving his hand to his temple. However, doctors say he continued to ""intermittently experience dreams as if looking through the device.""","Google Glass user treated for Internet addiction disorder .

"(CNN) -- Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla is urging citizens to exercise restraint as her government seeks a diplomatic course to resolve a boundary dispute with neighboring Nicaragua. The neighboring Central American countries are in a dispute over a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast, along the San Juan River, known as Calero Island. Costa Rica claims that Nicaraguan troops are camped out on the Costa Rican side of the border and it has asked the Organization of American States to intercede. ""Dear Costa Ricans: never before have we had to be united when the aggression and provocation test us,"" Chinchilla said in a televised address Wednesday night. ""Let us be calm and firm, amid the outrage that these events provoke within us."" Costa Rica claims that its flag in the disputed area was taken down and replaced by a Nicaraguan flag. Also, said Chinchilla, the Nicaraguans are destroying a forest in a protected area and a  Nicaraguan dredging project in the river is dumping sediment on the Costa Rican side as well. But, the president said, Costa Rica will respond ""with prudence and sensibility."" ""This is our strength,"" she said. ""The strength of reason and not the strength of arms.  We can't allow ourselves to get carried away by the profound indignation that this undeserved aggression causes us. Our tools are dialogue and international law, with those we are acting."" Costa Rica abolished its military after a 44-day civil war in 1948 that stemmed from a disputed presidential election and left more than 2,000 dead. It maintains only domestic police and security forces. On Wednesday, the country called for an emergency meeting of the the permanent council of the Organization of American States in an attempt to resolve the spat. The body called a recess to discuss the matter further, and had not reconvened by Wednesday night. ""For the Costa Rican government, these actions constitute an unacceptable violation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty, and are absolutely indefensible by Nicaragua,"" Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rene Castro wrote in a letter to his Nicaraguan counterpart. During his presentation, Castro showed slides with maps of the disputed area, arguing that Nicaragua's own maps show that the area in question is in Costa Rican territory. He also showed photos showing the area where sediment was allegedly being deposited, and where the Costa Rican flag had been taken down. Nicaragua said that an earlier judgment by the United Nations upheld its rights over the river area, although it gave Costa Rica freedom to navigate it. Nicaragua said that all of its activities are within its borders. ""We categorically reject the allegations made by Costa Rica,"" the country's ambassador to the OAS, Denis Moncada, said. ""Nicaragua has not violated the sovereignty of Costa Rica. Nor is the dredging, in Nicaraguan territory, affecting Costa Rican land. With these statements, Costa Rica has broken the diplomatic equilibrium that traditionally exists between the two nations."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: President: Our strength is the strength of reason, not arms .

"In 2016, we need to elect a president who has the experience to hit the ground running on day one.  We need someone who has walked the walk, not just talked the talk. We need someone who is extremely competent, extremely intelligent and extremely dedicated to the men, women and children of this country. We need someone who personally knows world leaders and understands the threats and challenges facing America. We need someone who understands what middle-class families have been going through and how to give every family a fair shot to get ahead in life. Our next president needs to be someone who knows without debate that equal pay for equal work and the full participation of women in our country is not only the right thing for them and their families, it's critical for the economic future of America. We need President Hillary Clinton. That's why I am honored to formally announce my renewed and unreserved support for Clinton as she considers a 2016 presidential bid. I'm ready for Clinton because she is the best person to take on the challenges that face our country, and she has more than enough qualifications, achievements and experience to do the job. While Clinton and I came to the Senate at the same time after the 2000 elections, I have known her for more than 30 years. I first met Clinton when I was serving in the Michigan State House of Representatives and she was serving as first lady of Arkansas and working as an attorney. We were both speaking on a panel at a national conference on children's issues in Detroit. I had just passed one of the first child abuse prevention trust funds in the country and Clinton was serving on the board of directors of the Children's Defense Fund. That event was certainly an apt place to meet Clinton. For so many years before that and for the decades since, fighting on behalf of children and families has been a cornerstone of Clinton's career. GOP tries to define Clinton for young voters . I was in the room when then-first lady Clinton courageously spoke in China at the Fourth World Conference on Women and reminded the world that ""women's rights are human rights."" I will never forget the power of that speech. Shortly thereafter, I was motivated to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. Clinton continued to speak up on behalf of women and girls around the world as secretary of state.  And since passing the baton at the State Department to Secretary John Kerry, she has once again made the fight for quality, universal early childhood education one of her signatures issues. The issues that will dominate the 2016 election are issues that Clinton has been a leader on for years. She has been a champion for middle-class families and for those working hard to get into the middle class. She voted time and again to raise the minimum wage so people working full time would not find themselves still in poverty.  She wrote the Student Borrower Bill of Rights and fought for lowering student loan rates by ending giveaways to the big banks. And of course she has fought tirelessly to give all Americans, especially children, the security of quality, affordable health care. As president, Hillary Clinton will fight for our values day in and day out. I also know Clinton is practical and pragmatic. She understands how to get things done. I saw it in her that day in Detroit so many years ago, watched her help accomplish great things like the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, worked with her here in the Senate to increase the minimum wage, and continued to be inspired by the grit, determination and old-fashioned hard work she put in across six continents and 956,733 miles as secretary of state. As secretary of state, Clinton stood up for America and stood strong against our enemies. As president, she will stand up for all Americans and stand strong against those who want to rig our political system for their own gain. When America chooses its next president, we need someone who understands that people across this country are working hard and just want a fair shot to get ahead in life. I know that Clinton understands this because that's the America she has been fighting for all her life. That is why I am ready for Hillary Clinton -- and why America is, too.

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN)Boko Haram insurgents have kidnapped 80 people in northern Cameroon, officials said, an attack that comes as troops from neighboring Chad entered Cameroon to join the fight against the terrorist group. The attacks happened in the villages of Mabass and Makxy in the Mayo-Tsanaga Division of the Far North Region of Cameroon on Sunday morning, Saiid Abdulkarim, a journalist for the state broadcaster, told CNN. Three of those kidnapped were found dead, Abdulkarim said. The Cameroonian government did not immediately comment. Meanwhile, thousands of Chadian troops arrived in Cameroon to join that country's soldiers in the fight against Boko Haram. The governor of Cameroon's Far North Region, Mijiyawa Bakary, told CNN that the first contingent of Chadian troops arrived in a convoy of more than 400 vehicles, and a second wave of soldiers were expected to arrive soon. The Chadian soldiers ""are coming in with dozens of tanks, armored vehicles and other military equipment,"" Cameroon defense ministry spokesman Col. Didier Badjeck said. The Chadian parliament unanimously voted Friday to send troops to Cameroon and Nigeria to join in the fight against Boko Haram. The move comes after Cameroon's President, Paul Biya, made a strong call for international cooperation in the fight against Boko Haram. Biya told diplomats recently that Boko Haram was ""a global threat"" that calls ""for a global response."" ""Such should be the response of the international community, including the African Union and our regional organizations,"" he said. Chadian officials concluded that Boko Haram also poses a danger to Chad. Chadian President Idriss Deby said attacks on Cameroon by the terrorist group could destroy Chad's economy. ""We can't remain indifferent to what is happening to our neighbors,"" Deby said. ""Cameroon is the entry and exit point for Chad economically."" Much of what is imported to Chad comes through the Cameroonian seaport of Douala, and Chad's crude oil is transported through a pipeline that runs from southern Chad to a floating facility 11 kilometers (almost 7 miles) off the Cameroon coast. The presence of Chadian troops on the front could be key to reversing the gains so far made by the terrorist group. Trained in desert combat, Chadian forces played a critical role in fighting jihadists in northern Mali, where they became major allies to French troops in the fight against terrorists there. In fact, they were instrumental in the killing of some high-profile jihadists. The involvement of Chadian troops marks a major shift in Cameroon-Chad anti-terrorism cooperation. In the past year, it focused mostly on securing individual borders. While Chad is the first country to put boots on the ground in Cameroon, the international community and regional bodies are also expressing concern. On Friday, the Russian ambassador to Cameroon, Nicolay Ratsiborinski, said his country will supply Cameroon with modern and sophisticated military weapons. He said the equipment will include heavy artillery, armored cars and missiles. Michael Stephen Hoza, U.S. ambassador to Cameroon, also said his country would help train Cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight. Boko Haram has been staging cross-border raids on Cameroon, the latest being the attempt by the insurgents to take over a Cameroon military base in Kolofata. Cameroonian troops killed 143 of them, and lost one soldier. On January 3, Boko Haram fighters briefly took over control of a military base in Achigashia, forcing Cameroonian soldiers to retreat and then for the first time use airstrikes against the insurgents. Attacks on military installations mark a big shift in Boko Haram operations in Cameroon. Initially,they would cross the border and either attack to steal food or kidnap nationals and expatriates in exchange for ransoms. Cameroon has already deployed about 7,000 troops across the Far North, where Boko Haram has scaled up attacks over the past six months.","Boko Haram from Nigeria kidnaps 80 people after attacks on villages in Cameroon .

"There's no arguing that Apple set the standard for modern mobile devices with the iPhone and the iPad. It didn't take long after those two products launched for competitors to rush out their own copycat devices. Even then, it took another few years before Android was good enough to go toe to toe with iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. But it's no longer about being just as good as Apple. You have to be better. Competitors have built upon the foundation Apple laid in mobile and are now leapfrogging it with bunch of useful features you can't find on iPhones and iPads. The evidence is everywhere, but it's most apparent in products made by Apple's biggest mobile rival, Samsung. By now, Samsung's Galaxy devices have become synonymous with Android, to the point that the manufacturer has more brand recognition than any other phone or tablet running Google's operating system. A lot of that has to do with Samsung's massive marketing budget, but you can't ignore the fact that the company has innovated a lot by creating popular new product categories that Apple is wary to try. The best example of this is the Galaxy Note, a smartphone-tablet hybrid with a giant screen. When that device first hit the United States about a year ago, critics (including me) slammed the device for being too large. It couldn't fit comfortably in your pocket. It was really thick. And it came with a stylus, that relic of the Palm Pilot era, making the Note feel like a step backward. None of that mattered. Samsung sold at least 10 million Galaxy Notes. The company came out with an updated version with an even larger screen called the Galaxy Note II a few months later and sold another 5 million (at last count), a very big achievement for a single Android device. But more importantly, Samsung created a new category of smartphone that people didn't even know they wanted, much like Apple did when it released the first iPhone. Samsung isn't afraid to tout its cool factor either. Since the first commercial debuted in late 2011, you've probably seen those ""Next Big Thing"" ads that make fun of starry-eyed Apple fans waiting in line for the next iPhone. Whether it's boasting about the bigger screens or sharing content by tapping phones together, Samsung seems content to blast Apple for its stuffiness while showing in a practical context what its devices can do. On the software side of things, Samsung is taking advantage of its mobile devices' processing power to layer premium features on top of Android, such as the ability to run two apps at once in a split screen or separate window. Samsung's best tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1, can do all that plus take advantage of a stylus so you can draw and take notes on the screen. There is a downside to the split-screen thing, however. Developers have to tweak their apps to work in split-screen mode on the Note 10.1. There are only about 20 apps right now that can do it. But what's most important is how nimble Samsung has become at improving its mobile devices through software updates. The Note 10.1 launched last fall, but it received a software update with a new version of Android and a slew of other features like the voice assistant Google Now, which is a lot more impressive than Apple's original Siri. Samsung's director of product planning, Shoneel Kolhatkar, said the company takes user and reviewer feedback into account when preparing to deliver new software updates. Instead of making users wait a year for new features, Kolhatkar said Samsung can use that feedback to deliver ""incremental innovation that keeps the product alive."" ""We want to keep the product relevant to consumers,"" Kolhatkar said. ""It's about how to fit our devices into people's lives versus changing their behavior."" Samsung isn't alone, of course. Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system is built for touchscreen devices like tablets, too, and it offers a lot of advantages over iOS. All Windows 8 apps can run in a split screen so you can run two at once, plus the main menu is capable of displaying real-time updates for stuff like news and weather. Microsoft even has its own line of Surface tablets that blur the line between PC and laptop thanks to a clever snap-on keyboard cover. Based on all this evidence, Apple feels behind. Take a look at its newest fourth-generation iPad. It has a killer processor and other great hardware features, but the operating system doesn't take advantage of any of that. The home screen is still just a grid of static icons that launch apps. Apple also isn't nearly as versatile at adding new software features to its devices. Apple usually makes users wait a year or more for a new version of iOS, and even then some older devices can't access all the latest and greatest features. Apple CEO Tim Cook likes to say tablets -- not laptops -- are the future of computing, yet it feels like Apple's software goes out of its way to limit what you can do on the machine. Meanwhile there are others, especially Samsung, that appear to be innovating at a pace faster than Apple can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Kovach.","Mobile-gadget rivals are leapfrogging Apple with useful features not on iPhones, iPads .

"A young rising star.  A keynote speech on the Democratic Party's biggest stage. Is it 2004 again? San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave the most significant speech of his political career on Tuesday night when he became the first Latino to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. ""My grandmother didn't live to see us begin our lives in public service. But she probably would've thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in San Antonio, one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his way -- the good people of San Antonio willing -- to the United States Congress,"" Castro said in his speech, referring to his twin brother, Joaquin. ""My family's story isn't special. What's special is the America that makes our story possible. ""Ours is a nation like no other -- a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation ... no matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward."" Comparisons to the 2004 Barack Obama are inevitable. The then-Illinois state Sen. Obama gave the same address in Boston, launching him onto the fast track for the presidential nomination four years later. Castro, 37, shrugs off the similarities and talk that he could eventually become the first Hispanic president. DNC speech to focus on Mexican American family experience . ""Oh, I would be lying if I said that's not flattering. Of course it's flattering to anybody,"" he said last week from San Antonio. ""But the biggest mistake I can make in this situation is to believe the press, to believe the hype."" That humble response can be attributed to his modest upbringing. Castro's grandmother immigrated to Texas from Mexico as an orphan at the age of six. She taught herself to read and write in Spanish, eventually finding work in San Antonio as a maid and a cook. Castro's mother, Rosie Castro, learned a tough lesson at a young age while in school in San Antonio, where her teachers discouraged speaking Spanish. ""They would charge us a quarter if you were caught speaking Spanish, and incidentally that's how much lunch cost,"" Rosie Castro said. ""We were put down so often that the message was clear -- Spanish was a bad language that shouldn't be spoken."" As a result, Julian Castro and his brother, Joaquin, grew up in a home where Spanish was rarely spoken. Neither speaks the language fluently. ""I understand Spanish better than I speak it,"" Julian Castro admits. It was Rosie Castro who inspired Julian's political future. While in college she became president of the Young Democrats at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio. Out of college, she joined the Chicano movement, working with the ""La Raza Unida Party"" to fight for reforms beneficial to the Mexican-American community. In 1971, Rosie ran for San Antonio City Council and lost the race.  Along the way, though, she took her sons to various community and political events where they witnessed battles for voting rights and an end to discrimination on city services. ""I dragged them to every meeting, rally and voting booth,"" Rosie Castro said. ""They helped me on different campaigns and handed out literature. I wanted them to realize it is your duty to be involved."" Now, less than two weeks shy of his 38th birthday, Julian Castro, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard's Law School, is the youngest mayor of a Top 50 American city. At age 26, he was the youngest councilman ever elected in San Antonio. Joaquin Castro, who introduced his twin Tuesday night, is a politician in his own right -- currently running for the House of Representatives in a contest Democratic leaders expect him to win. ""Since they were young, I imagined they would do great things,"" Rosie Castro said of her sons. A source familiar with Julian Castro's speech set the bar high for the San Antonio mayor, saying it was akin to Obama's career-making 2004 address. Castro himself says he'll focus on his own story of achieving the American dream. Who is the next Obama? He drew a link for those working to write their own success story, addressing what he said in an interview was the ""clear choice that voters have in this election, and why the policies that President Obama has put forth make more sense to creating opportunity, bringing the middle class back, and assuring prosperity in the future."" ""We need to make a choice. It's a choice ... between a country where the middle class pays more, so that millionaires can pay less ... or a country where everybody pays their fair share. It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell grants ... or a nation that invests more in education. It's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas ... or a leader who brings jobs back home,"" Castro said. ""This is the choice before us. And to me, to my generation, and for all the generations that will come after us, our choice is clear. Our choice is a man who's always chosen us. A man who already is our president -- Barack Obama."" The choice of Castro for the convention's keynote address is strategic in an election where the Latino vote will be key. Obama handily won the demographic's vote in 2008 over Republican John McCain and it will be pivotal for him to do the same in November. The Romney campaign also knows the importance of Hispanic voters. Last week's GOP convention in Tampa had no shortage of prominent Latino speakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American who was among those in consideration for Romney's vice presidential pick. Obama's advantage over Romney among the politically imperative demographic remains steady from previous months, with the president taking 61% to Romney's 29% of registered Latino voters' support in August, according to a Gallup survey. Romney's campaign has publicly identified a ""magic number"" for the Latino vote if the former Massachusetts governor has a chance of winning the election: 38%. McCain garnered 31% of the Latino vote in 2008. But Latino interest in the 2012 election appears to be lagging. Compared with the 2008 election cycle, Hispanic interest levels in 2012 are 10 points behind where they were in the previous election, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal-Telemundo poll conducted in July. Amid the lagging support, the White House announced in June a bold new policy that halts deportations of some young immigrants who came to America illegally as children. The policy is a ""temporary"" measure that allows eligible immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation deferral for a two-year period. Castro acknowledges with a smile the strategy behind his prominent speaking role: ""Obviously I'm young and I'm also Hispanic, two important groups in this election. And I'm confident that I can do a good job in articulating why President Obama ought to be the candidate that Americans select for the next four years."" Since being elected in 2009, Castro has built a reputation as ""a youthful and dynamic leader here in town,"" says Walter Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas-San Antonio. ""In a lot of ways, this speech is an initial test on the national stage,"" Wilson says, predicting that if Castro is successful at the convention, it gives the party a new confidence that he indeed is a rising Democratic star. ""It's definitely a symbolically significant speech for the mayor. It sets the tone for where the Democratic Party thinks its future is headed,"" Wilson said. San Antonio Republicans are skeptical of Castro's broader appeal, with one San Antonio official calling him a ""typical young, energetic liberal Democrat."" He ""believes in big government, tax and spend, and those type of things,"" said Steve Heinrich, treasurer of the Republican Party of Bexar County. George Rodriguez, president of the Tea Party of San Antonio, echoed those comments. ""He's a tax-and-spend liberal. He does not represent all Hispanics, we're not all the same,"" Rodriguez said. Before his speech, the young mayor Tuesday appeared to be more nervous about using a teleprompter for only the second time rather than for the high expectations surrounding his address. ""In the end, the American dream is not a sprint, or even a marathon, but a relay,"" Castro said. ""Our families don't always cross the finish line in the span of one generation. But each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labor. My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson -- the South Carolina Republican who heckled President Obama during his speech to a joint session of Congress -- has raised at least $1 million in contributions, a campaign aide confirmed. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, shouts ""You lie!"" during President Obama's speech Wednesday night. News of that cash haul comes after Wilson directly asked in a Web video for campaign cash to fend off attacks from political opponents and said he's standing by his opposition to Democratic efforts at health care reform. Wilson has come under fire for shouting ""you lie"" to Obama during the Wednesday night address to Congress on health care reform. The lawmaker soon apologized for his behavior, viewed by Republicans and Democrats as an ill-mannered breach of political decorum. The remark energized Wilson's opponents and supporters, who have been opening their wallets and sending donations to Wilson and Rob Miller, his Democratic opponent in next year's congressional race. Miller -- who has reported raking in more than $1 million as a result of the outburst -- ran against Wilson last year, losing by 8 percentage points. It was Wilson's smallest margin of victory in his five elections to Congress. In an e-mail to supporters Friday night, Miller said he had raised the money in small contributions in less than 48 hours -- a total that dwarfs the $67,000 he has taken in during the entire first half of the year. Wilson shouted ""you lie"" after Obama laid out what the congressman said were ""bogus claims"" about health care reform ""spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost."" ""The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens,"" Obama said in his speech. ""Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren't so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.  Watch CNN's John King and Joe Johns talk about little words and big money Â» . ""There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false. The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally,"" Obama said. It was at that point Wilson made his now-infamous exclamation, sparking boos and Obama's retort: ""It's not true."" In a YouTube video released on Thursday, Wilson said, ""On these issues, I will not be muzzled, I will speak up and speak loudly against this risky plan."" He added: ""Supporters of the government takeover of health care, and the liberals who want to give health care to illegals, are using my opposition as an excuse to distract from the critical questions being raised about this poorly conceived plan.""

"The former head of a private preparatory school in Miami, Florida is out an $80,000 discrimination settlement after his daughter boasted about it on Facebook. Patrick Snay, 69 -- the former head of Gulliver Preparatory School -- filed an age discrimination complaint when his 2010-11 contract wasn't renewed. In November 2011, the school and Snay came to an agreement in which Snay would be paid $10,000 in back pay, and an $80,000 settlement. Gulliver Schools also agreed to cut Snay's attorneys a check for $60,000. But before the ink could dry on the deal, Snay's daughter took to Facebook, boasting, ""Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver. Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT."" Snay's daughter blasted the message to her 1,200 Facebook followers, which included many current and former Gulliver students. Word of the post spread like wildfire back to school officials. Within a few days, Gulliver Schools sent a letter to Snay's attorneys stating that Snay had broken a confidentiality agreement and that he would not be receiving the $80,000 settlement. The agreement stated that neither Snay nor his wife could speak about the settlement to anyone except for his attorneys and other professional advisers. Snay filed a motion to enforce the settlement and won in a Circuit Court ruling. The school appealed. A hearing was held to determine if his daughter's knowledge of the settlement and her Facebook post had violated the confidentiality agreement. ""What happened is that after settlement, my wife and I went in the parking lot, and we had to make some decisions on what we were going to tell my daughter. Because it's very important to understand that she was an intricate part of what was happening. ""She was retaliated against at Gulliver. So she knew we were going to some sort of mediation. She was very concerned about it. Because of what happened at Gulliver, she had quite a few psychological scars which forced me to put her into therapy. ""So there was a period of time that there was an unresolved enclosure for my wife and me. It was very important with her. We understood the confidentiality. So we knew what the restrictions were, yet we needed to tell her something,"" Snay explained in court documents. Last week, the Third District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida agreed that Snay had, in fact, violated confidentiality and reversed the Circuit Court ruling. It wrote: ""Snay violated the agreement by doing exactly what he had promised not to do. His daughter then did precisely what the confidentiality agreement was designed to prevent, advertising to the Gulliver community that Snay had been successful in his age discrimination and retaliation case against the school. ""Based on the clear and unambiguous language of the parties' agreement and Snay's testimony confirming his breach of its terms, we reverse the order entered below granting the Snays' motion to enforce the agreement.""

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican says it has ordered a controversial bishop who denies the Holocaust to ""distance himself"" from his views ""in an absolutely unequivocal and public manner."" In the interview,  Bishop Williamson denied the Nazis had used gas chambers at concentration camps. The Vatican has been under fire since Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson almost two weeks ago, days after Swedish Public Television broadcast an interview in which Williamson said the Nazis had not systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II. Israel Wednesday blasted the rehabilitation of Williamson. ""The reinstatement of a Holocaust denier by the Holy See offends every Jew, in Israel and around the world, and humiliates the memory of all Holocaust victims and survivors,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. It said the Church's distancing itself from Williamson's position was ""the first step in the right direction"" and said it expected ""more explicit and unequivocal decisions and statements on this issue."" Israel's statement appears to have been made before the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, said Williamson would not be allowed to perform priestly functions if he did not recant. Williamson's position on the Holocaust is ""absolutely unacceptable and firmly rejected by the Pope,"" Bertone said. He added that Williamson's views on the Holocaust ""were unknown to the Holy Father at the time of the excommunication's remission."" Williamson was rehabilitated on January 21 along with three other members of the ultra-conservative Society of Saint Pius X. The move was announced three days later. Bertone's order comes only two days after he declared the matter ""closed."" ""The Society of Saint Pius X has distanced itself from its bishop and apologized to the pope for this embarrassing incident. The pope spoke clearly on Wednesday (January 28). I think the question can be considered closed,"" Bertone, said, according the Catholic daily Avvenire Tuesday. But on Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded that the pope firmly reject denial of the Holocaust. Earlier on Wednesday, a German district attorney said he had launched a criminal investigation into Williamson's remarks. ""I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler,"" Williamson said in the Swedish interview, which also appeared on various Web sites after broadcast. ""I believe there were no gas chambers."" Regensburg District Attorney Guenther Ruckdaeschel said authorities were investigating whether the remarks can be considered ""inciting racial hatred."" Denying the Holocaust is a crime in Germany, punishable by up to five years in prison. American Jewish leaders have also expressed outrage that Williamson, who was excommunicated in 1988, was welcomed back to the church days after the interview. Williamson and three other bishops who belong to the Society of Saint Pius X were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988. The society was founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve, who rebelled against the Vatican's modernizing reforms in the 1960s, and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said when the controversy erupted that the Vatican's decision to accept Williamson was part of its desire to normalize relations with the ultra-conservative group, and had nothing to do with the bishop's personal views. Ruckdaeschel decided to launch his investigation in Regensburg because the Williamson interview was conducted at a seminar of the Society of Saint Pius X, of which Williamson is a member, in the nearby town of Zaitzkofen. Ruckdaeschel told CNN that a legal representative for Williamson contacted him and said the bishop denied the allegations. Williamson apologized last week for the ""distress"" his remarks caused the pope, but did not retract them. According to the legal representative's account, Williamson had told the Swedish reporters he did not want the interview aired outside Sweden -- and therefore, the remarks would not fall under German criminal law. According to the German criminal code, comments glorifying or denying crimes committed by the Nazis, or National Socialists, are a crime only if they are made publicly. Ruckdaeschel says he will attempt to question the two Swedish reporters who conducted the interview. He said it was unlikely Williamson would have to appear in court because he is currently in Argentina, but the bishop may be required to submit a written statement in the case. The pope -- who was born in Germany and was a child during the Nazi period -- rejected Holocaust denial in public statements on January 28. After his 14th birthday in 1941, Benedict -- then called Joseph Ratzinger -- was forced along with the rest of his class in Bavaria, southern Germany, to join the Hitler Youth. However his biographer John Allen Jr., said Ratzinger's family was strongly anti-Nazi. CNN's Hada Messia and Alessio Vinci in Rome and Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin contributed to this report.","Vatican orders bishop who denies Holocaust to ""distance himself"" from views .

"London, England (CNN) -- Olympic triple-jump champion Christian Taylor knows all about putting his best foot forward. But in order to continue competing in the sport he loves, he's had to go back to square one. Retrain his muscle memory and try a new way. For an athlete who's used to constantly repeating his routine, day after day, year after year, it was a big deal. ""All my life I've jumped from my left foot -- that was my takeoff -- and even winning the 2012 Olympics, that was the foot I jumped from, so the idea of switching feet was pretty crazy,"" the American tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""You have to almost use a different side of the brain. My left leg was muscle memory, I could do that day in, day out, and now to do that off my right, it took a little while to get over it."" So why take such a big risk? Taylor had no choice -- triple-jumping had taken its toll on his knee joints and he was facing the prospect of having to quit in his prime; at 22, he was the youngest man to win the discipline's Olympic title in 100 years. ""People around me would say, 'You've won so many things, can you not continue through the pain?' but it was to the point that it was either that I try and blow out my knee or I just give it up,"" says the 2011 world champion. ""I love this too much -- my passion for it exceeded the doubt -- and once I just committed to it, I was like this is it. I'm going to make it happen. ""My parents always brought me up with the saying, 'Where there's a will there's a way,' so I was willing to do what it took and now I'm making the way."" During the hard times that followed, he was able to draw on the religious beliefs instilled in him by his grandmother. ""My faith keeps me to who I am, because a lot of times there are a lot of distractions, a lot of pressures that come with the lifestyle,"" Taylor explains. ""But keeping that faith and just remembering who I am is very important to me. I have my daily devotions."" His persistence has paid off. While he finished outside the medals at last year's world championships, finishing fourth, he has completed a hat-trick of titles in the lucrative Diamond League series. A season's best leap of 17.51 meters at the Zurich meeting in August earned the 24-year-old the $40,000 jackpot as the leading men's triple-jumper over seven events. Taylor has not only overcome physical challenges, but geographical ones too. After he won at London 2012, and then sealed that year's Diamond League crown, his coach Rana Reider decided he wanted to move to Britain to take up a new role with its national team. ""That was very difficult because all my family was in the U.S. My sister just got a scholarship and she moved to Jacksonville and I was training in Daytona, Florida (the state where he went to university) so we were only an hour away and that was very, very special to me that I could see her at any time,"" Taylor says. ""But now that was all taken away from me very quickly. It was a big decision, but at the same time it was also an easy decision, because if you want to be the best sometimes you have to make sacrifices. ""So I said, 'We make a special team and we've been successful,' and so I just had to follow him over here -- and another surprise was we weren't even in London! ""We were in Loughborough (where UK Athletics' high-performance center is based) and it was literally in the middle of nowhere. It was farmland and people spoke a little different there, so it was quite an adjustment."" Indeed, the market town in the East Midlands of England was a long way from Fayetteville, Georgia, where his parents -- immigrants from the West Indian island of Barbados -- moved after Taylor's birth in Long Island, New York. ""My childhood was the typical American story -- I played football, basketball, a lot of soccer growing up. My parents were taking me to karate, so I really tried it all,"" he recalls. ""They challenged me to try track and field because that's when you start to get to the time of getting scholarships, and they said I was too talented for them to have to pay for my college."" The teenage Taylor tried 100-meter sprints, and even cross-country, but via long-jumping he discovered his true path. ""The triple jump is a hop, skip and jump -- so it's two hops on one leg and then one hop on the opposite leg, which takes a lot of coordination,"" he says. ""The fact I know that everyone can't do the triple jump makes it special for me. The hardest thing about it is the patience. ""It's such a fast-moving event, but in your head you have to slow every step down and really extend each phase to the farthest point."" Taylor says the crowd plays a big part in spurring him to leap further. ""I like to get the fans involved. Get that encouragement and kind of feed off that energy. From then, you just take off and it's 90-95% full speed,"" he says. ""You have to be fast. You can't come down and jog to jump far. The faster you run, the further you jump."" In keeping with his multisport background, Taylor is also versatile in track and field -- this season he competed in the long jump as well, setting the fifth-best leap in the Diamond League of 8.09 meters and finishing third overall. He has also been running 400 meters -- which he hopes may be a stepping stone to a place in the U.S. relay team for the 2016 Rio Olympics, where he also plans to defend his triple-jump title. It all comes down to pushing himself as far as he can go -- and next on the list is the world record of 18.29m (60 feet), set by Britain's Jonathan Edwards in 1995. ""I'm at 17.96m so it's not too far but at the same time, it's actually very far,"" Taylor says. ""It's pushing myself beyond limits I don't think I can even comprehend at this time -- it's going to take an out-of-body experience, so I'm pretty excited about that. ""I would like to do it at a world championships but if it happens also in Rio, I won't say not to that,"" he adds, breaking into a trademark smile. Ultimately, Taylor is hoping to steal some of the limelight enjoyed by Usain Bolt, the biggest name in athletics and arguably the most charismatic man in world sport. ""When Usain walks onto the track, the lights turn on, the people are to their feet and it's an energy like no other -- and that's something I strive for myself,"" he says. ""I want to bring not eyes just to myself but to the triple-jump because I think right now it's such a hard event, and I think getting that to the limelight would be pretty special.""","Triple-jump star Christian Taylor overcomes career-threatening injury .

"A soldier has committed a deadly mass shooting at Texas' Fort Hood again. And again, a female police officer was involved in bringing the violent rampage to an end. The military policewoman has not been identified, but by all accounts, she risked her life to ensure the bedlam wrought by Spc. Ivan Lopez came to a close in the second building he entered. By then, Lopez, whom the Army chief of staff has described as a ""very experienced soldier,"" had taken three lives and wounded 16 people -- all of them Army personnel. Without the officer's courageous actions, Wednesday's casualty count might have been higher. ""It was clearly heroic what she did in that moment in time,"" said Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commander. ""She did her job, and she did exactly what we'd expect of a United States Army military police."" According to Milley, the melee began about 4 p.m. Lopez first walked into a unit building and opened fire. The 34-year-old Iraq veteran then left, got into a vehicle and continued firing the .45-caliber Smith & Wesson semiautomatic that he had purchased off-base, Milley said. Lopez exited the vehicle and walked into a second building, opening fire again, Milley said. It was there he ""was engaged by local law enforcement here at Fort Hood."" The MP arrived in the parking lot about four minutes after the first 911 call, and she began to look for the suspect with other law enforcement officers. A short time later, she saw the suspect. ""He was approaching her at about 20 feet. He put his hands up, then reached under his jacket, pulled out the (semiautomatic) and she pulled out her weapon,"" the lieutenant general said. ""She engaged, and then he put the weapon to his head and he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" Milley said. The shooting spree was over in about 15 or 20 minutes. The investigation into what spurred Lopez's violent revolt promises to take much longer. U.S. Rep. John Carter joined Milley in praising the military policewoman in a CNN interview Thursday, saying she ""responded exactly as the military would expect."" He further said that her quick reaction was a result of training that military police took after the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, in which Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 31 others on the base. ""That's the active shooter program they've all been through,"" Carter said. ""We can see that this is the training that was the result of the Hasan shooting. I lived through the Hasan shooting, and it was kind of eerie last night."" In 2009, Sgt. Kimberly Munley, a civilian police officer, was washing her car and topping off the gas tank when she got the report that shots had been fired at Fort Hood. She and Senior Sgt. Mark Todd responded to the scene and were directed to the Soldier Readiness Processing Center. The 5-foot-2, 125-pound mother of two and her partner exchanged gunfire with Hasan, who shot Munley three times, sending a bullet into each of her thighs and another into her knuckles. Munley and Todd were credited with ending Hasan's rampage and hailed as heroes. Munley can no longer work in law enforcement because of her injuries and has spoken out on behalf of the victims, whom she claims the government has ""betrayed"" by denying them certain treatment and benefits in the aftermath of the shooting. Though not much is yet known about the policewoman involved in ending Wednesday's shooting spree, Fort Hood is home to the 89th Military Police Brigade, a ""combat-ready, deployable force"" that can support worldwide operations, according to the brigade's web page. Phillip Carter, a former MP captain on the post, said he believes she was a junior enlisted soldier who was patrolling by herself. He credited her for facing the threat. ""Most police officers probably would have stepped back and waited for backup, but she stepped forward,"" he said. Carter told CNN her training would have been 18 weeks and included a ""Shoot/No Shoot,"" class on a shooting course. ""You have to make a decision on the range as to whether to engage or not,"" he said. ""They're designed to create that split-second impulse because that's all you would have in this kind of a situation.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The United States is ""absolutely not"" giving Israel a green light to attack Iran, U.S. President Barack Obama told CNN Tuesday. President Obama meets Tuesday with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin near Moscow. ""We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East,"" Obama said, referring to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Obama has been in Moscow for a summit aimed at trying to reset the U.S.-Russian relationship. On Sunday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden appeared to leave the door open for Israel to attack Iran if it saw fit. ""Israel can determine for itself -- it's a sovereign nation -- what's in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else,"" Biden said on ABC's ""This Week."" Obama said Tuesday that Biden had simply been stating a fact, not sending a signal. ""I think Vice President Biden stated a categorical fact, which is we can't dictate to other countries what their security interests are. What is also true is that it is the policy of the United States to resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear capabilities in a peaceful way through diplomatic channels,"" he said.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry interview President Obama Â» . The top U.S. military leader, Adm. Mike Mullen, said later on Tuesday that he understands Israel's position. ""The Israelis see Iran achieving a nuclear capability as an existential threat, and that fact is tied to the rhetoric of the leadership of Iran, which ... has said that they would seek to eliminate Israel,"" said Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His counterparts in the Gulf also understand the Israeli stance, whether or not they agree, Mullen said. ""That gets back to the criticality ... of solving this before Iran gets a nuclear capability, or that anyone... would take action to strike them. And I think that window is a very narrow window,"" he said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said he hoped diplomacy would resolve the issue. ""I am hopeful that that dialogue is productive. I worry about it a great deal if it's not,"" Mullen said. The State Department took a similar line on Monday. ""Our goal here is to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. When I say 'our' it is just not the United States -- it is the international community,"" spokesman Ian Kelly said. ""Israel is a sovereign country. We are not going to dictate its actions. We also are committed to Israel's security and we share Israel's deep concerns about Iran's nuclear program."" Asked if this could be interpreted as the United States flashing a green light for Israel to attack Iran's nuclear sites, Kelly said, ""I certainly would not want to give a green light to any kind of military action."" The Israeli government considers Iran's nuclear program to be the dominant threat facing the country.

"A U.S. patient who had an infection of the mysterious MERS virus has recovered, the Florida Department of Health announced Monday. The patient, a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia, has been discharged, the department said. He was admitted to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando on May 9. ""All health care workers and household contacts who had contact with the patient were tested for MERS-CoV and all of those results have come back negative,"" the health department said in a statement. ""There is no broad risk of MERS-CoV infection for the general public, and no threat to those traveling to the Orlando area."" MERS-CoV stands for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The Florida patient is not a U.S. citizen, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. He is one of three people in the United States who have been confirmed to have had MERS, which can be fatal. The first U.S. diagnosis was in an Indiana man who had traveled to Saudi Arabia and is also a health care provider. The Florida and Indiana cases are not linked, Schuchat said. The Indiana patient had ""extended face-to-face contact"" and shook hands with a man from Illinois during a 40-minute business meeting, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. This is believed to represent the first transmission of MERS within the United States, officials said. The Illinois man said he was suffering only mild cold-like symptoms and did not seek or require medical care, Dr. David Swerdlow told reporters. A blood test indicated that he had been previously infected with MERS. ""We think that this patient was likely infected with MERS. But technically he doesn't count as an official case of MERS,"" he said. MERS: 5 things to know . What is MERS? To date, there have been more than 570 confirmed cases of MERS, including 171 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of countries with confirmed cases has expanded to 18, with a case in the Netherlands, according to the WHO. The global health authority has seen a sharp uptick since the middle of March, especially in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. MERS is a coronavirus, the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. It was first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. No one knows exactly how the virus originated, but evidence implicating camels is emerging. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS. Doctors say they believe the Indiana patient's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances of getting better. The ""risk to the general public remains very low,"" Schuchat said. In some countries, the virus has spread from person to person, but only when they were in close contact, such as when a person was caring for an ill person. ""This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person in community settings,"" she said. Out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the Florida and Indiana patients with confirmed MERS, Schuchat said. No cases of MERS have been diagnosed as a result of transmission on a plane, the CDC's Dr. Marty Cetron said. The Florida patient . The 44-year-old Florida patient traveled on May 1 from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to London, then from London to Boston, Boston to Atlanta, and finally Atlanta to Orlando. The man began feeling unwell on the flight from Jeddah, with symptoms including ""fever, chills and a slight cough,"" Schuchat said.

"(CNN) -- Seema Tomar has worked hard for her shot at fame. From humble beginnings in rural India, the 31-year-old has stared down the barrel of poverty and prejudice to become one of the world's leading trap shooters. Tomar made history in 2010 when she became the first Indian woman to win a World Cup medal (a silver) and has collected dozens of trap shooting (a type of clay-pigeon shooting) prizes over the years. Two golds at the Asian Shotgun Championships held in the United Arab Emirates last month were the latest landmarks in Tomar's glittering shooting career which began in the decidedly less sparkly surroundings of Johri, a provincial village 50 km (30 miles) north of New Delhi. With around 5,500 inhabitants and a local economy based around agriculture, villagers have been more used to wielding scythes than shotguns and air pistols, but Tomar's fortunes and others were transformed when a shooting range was set up in the late 1990s. ""From the beginning I was always interested in sports but there were no facilities in the village,"" Tomar told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""But then a local doctor who used to work in New Delhi came and built a small shooting range."" The Johri Rifle Club is a modest affair with a 10-meter range and a handful of shooting bays. There's also limited electricity, so practice can only take place during the day. But these meager facilities have changed lives, says Tomar. ""When people got to know that a shooting range has opened in the village, families realized that rather than the kids roaming free in the village they could get involved in this activity. It had a huge effect,"" she says. Along with producing a string of champion shooters, the range has also given villagers access to careers outside farming with many finding work with the Indian army and local police forces. Sporting chance . For Tomar though the prospects of joining their number initially looked bleak -- she was approaching adulthood and expected to get married and become a housewife. ""I spoke to my mother and father, asking them if I could do shooting. Looking at the culture and society of the village they said it is not possible. It hurt me a lot and I felt really bad,"" Tomar said. ""I realized that until the time someone from my family, most likely an elder, would go into shooting, my family would not let me enter the sport."" So when her mother had a go, attitudes towards the teenage Tomar's participation changed. ""My mother was 60 years old when she started shooting and participated in air pistol and air rifle ... She won medals at state level, then she played pre-nationals and nationals and won medals there too."" Like her mother, Prakashi, Tomar stared out using an air pistol but soon switched to a bigger weapon. ""I (competed) in air rifle for two years, and my score was good: 390/400. But I thought I needed some other event,"" she said. ""When I saw the shotgun event for the first time I liked it. It was a very explosive event. My results was quite good in it and I won a lot of medals."" Tomar enrolled in the Indian Army in 2004 and has been on India's shooting team since 2005 winning 32 gold medals at national level and five golds and one silver on the international stage. Her speciality, trap shooting, involves hitting a series of moving targets from a distance of around 75 meters using a 12-bore shotgun. When Tomar clinched her historic silver medal at the World Cup in 2010 she scored a personal best 70 out of 75 -- a mark she bettered by two points at the recent Asian Shotgun Championships during the women's team event. On song . The physical aspects of her sport are tiring -- there is a lot of recoil in the gun, she says -- but to shoot well requires a clear mind as much as a steady hand. ""The most important is mental relaxation,"" she says. ""The best thing is music. I love listening to music. Before every match I listen to a good song, and keep murmuring it. That is the best way to let go of all my mental stress. ""Whenever I miss the target or I get under pressure, then I say 'no, let's sing a song.' That song keeps playing in my head. The benefit of the song playing in my head is that, I leave the pressure and the match becomes better because of it,"" she laughs. With her mother still enjoying her shooting well into her 70s, Tomar could be around at the top of her sport for decades to come. But for now the crosshairs are on some important targets just around the corner, like qualifying for the Rio Olympics in 2016. With a maximum of 30 places available for each competing country and two people per event, Tomar will need to be at the top of her game next season when the quota places are earned at World Cup events and world and continental championships. Medals and titles are clearly important to Tomar, but so are the triumphs of equality she has helped foster through her success, promoting a message to girls in her village and across India that they too can be the masters of their own destiny. ""I remember my older times when I would come to this shooting range nervous and shy. I used to think, will I be able to do anything, will people ever get to know me? All those things of the past I remember. ""Now I feel really good, and people know that and if girls are coming here for shooting they have achieved something. I love the feeling that many girls have come out of their house.""

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Explosions took place Tuesday outside two embassies in Greece, and police carried out controlled explosions of three more suspicious parcels addressed to embassies, officials said. The incidents come a day after one person was wounded when a parcel bomb addressed to Greece's Mexican Embassy exploded. The object at the Swiss Embassy on Tuesday was a small bomb that was thrown into the building's courtyard, police said. A separate explosion happened outside the Russian Embassy, police said. It wasn't immediately known what type of device caused that explosion. No one was injured in either incident. Meanwhile, authorities said they detonated a package at the Bulgarian Embassy and a suspicious package addressed to the Chilean Embassy, after a courier carrying the latter parcel thought it might contain an explosive device. The third parcel was addressed to the German Embassy, but it was detonated near a courier office because embassy officials thought it might be a parcel bomb and sent it back, police said. Monday, a parcel bomb addressed to the Mexican Embassy exploded at the same private courier company and wounded a woman there. Two suspects were arrested Monday after police cordoned off the surrounding area, the ministry said. Both were wearing wigs and one of them was wearing a bulletproof vest. Both also were carrying Glock 9mm pistols and were in possession of two other explosive parcels, including one addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the ministry and police said.

"(CNN) -- She was dubbed ""The Assassin"" after winning gold at the London 2012 Olympics, but Kaori Matsumoto prefers to be known as ""Beast."" Her coach, however, says she is more like Peter Pan -- and the judo star herself claims she once saw a fairy like Tinker Bell. A self-confessed lover of junk food, Matsumoto is far from your average athlete -- and she is breaking new ground in a most traditional sport that was founded in her native Japan in the late 1800s. ""No-one like her has won the Olympics before,"" Harumi Nakahashi, Matsumoto's coach at the Four Leaf Japan Judo Club, told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""So I think she has made a new history in the world of judo. And for kids who practice judo, they don't have to be pushed into certain stereotypes anymore now that they have Matsumoto who has broken those barriers."" Matsumoto, who turned 26 last month, earned her nickname not just for the ferocity of her fighting style, but also because of its unfettered natural instincts. ""There are tons of players in Japan who are better at judo than me, but the one thing that I can beat them at is my spirit,"" she says. ""I tend to go with just my spirit only, so my technique lags behind. My judo is sloppy compared to others'. ""I just go with the feel. I'm often called 'beast' because I stay natural, and wild, I think. I just follow what the instinct tells me. It's just like how people put up an umbrella when rain starts. I just naturally react to the flow of that situation."" Japan has traditionally dominated judo since its first appearance at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, though it was not until 1992 that women were able to compete for medals. ""A judoka like her is unique in a female,"" Nakahashi says of Matsumoto, who at London 2012 became the first Japanese woman to win gold in the 57-kilogram class. ""She has a girlish side to her, but she is more like Peter Pan, with a heart of a young boy. She has something really pure about her."" Matsumoto is from Kanazawa, the coastal capital of Ishikawa Prefecture which is also bordered by the Japanese Alps. ""I used to live where there were lots of bugs and forests and nature,"" she recalls. Having started judo at the age of six, by junior high school she was traveling the world as a national representative. ""My mother said, 'You're lucky you can go to so many different worlds.' So I promised her, 'I will take you there.' ""In the beginning it was that I just didn't like losing, but when I thought I want to take my parents to other countries for the matches, when the goals that were only mine started involving other people, I became stronger."" Nakahashi says Matsumoto's family ""support her in a way that's invisible to the eye -- they support her soul."" And that attitude has helped her respect not only her teammates, but her rivals too. ""Japanese judo is very high level, so it is hard to become the representative. And once I do become the representative, that means I am representing all my rivals, so I carry everyone's emotions to my Games,"" she says. Matsumoto was not only Japan's first female victor in her weight category, she was also the only one of the judo team to win a title at London 2012 as well as her country's first of seven gold medalists at that Olympics. ""It was fun, but all other emotions were mixed because many of my teammates lost,"" she says. ""It was something more than frustration. The two players who had lost their matches before me still came by to cheer me up. I was touched by how amazing they were, and then the feeling of respect to them was stronger than frustration (towards the losses). ""I fought my match holding the respect to them, thinking I would never forget their existence."" For Matsumoto, judo is a microcosm of what it means to be Japanese -- from the bow at the start of a fight, to the acknowledgement at the end. ""Judo's philosophy -- to start with a propriety and end with a propriety -- is Japanese spirit itself, so I think judo is something that expresses the true Japanese-ness,"" she says. While there are many ways of scoring points in the sport, the ultimate goal is to achieve ""Ippon"" -- a decisive move which ends a contest. ""If you win perfectly by Ippon, your opponent can be convinced that it was a perfect throw and she had lost. It is accepting your defeat. I think that's beautiful, because that's accepting yourself and your weakness."" Matsumoto admits one of her weaknesses is her diet, which she is trying to change in order to stop a long series of injuries to most parts of her body (""My arm, my nose, my fingers, and my elbow ... also my medial ligament, both my ankles."") ""Recently I've been eating a lot of organic food and stuff like that. Organic vegetables are a little expensive, but what you eat comes back around to you,"" she says. ""I have a really unbalanced diet, and I like sodas, coke, ice cream, snacks and chocolates and everything like that, but I'm trying to stay away as much as possible. I'm trying to control myself."" Injuries are part of life as a judoka, and Matsumoto says they provide important lessons. ""I broke my finger during the world championships, but the message then was that I was doing a judo that just pressed forward without even looking at my opponent,"" explains the fighter, who went from fifth in the world in 2009 to champion the following year. ""My fighting spirit was bare and raw and it lacked a cool mind, so I understood that the bare fighting spirit was not good enough. I learned through my injury that I have to have a cool mind along with my hot spirit."" However, Matsumoto's mind is clearly a curious thing -- as evidenced by her admission that she believes she once saw a fairy. ""In Japan we have tea made out of barley, and we have it in this big bucket during training which everyone can drink out of. And one time from that bucket, a tiny person this size -- like Tinker Bell without the wings -- came out and flew away. ""But that was only that time and I haven't seen any since. It just simply strayed in and then left so that it won't be found by humans."" While Matsumoto is aiming to defend her title at Rio 2016, an appearance at her home Olympics in Tokyo four years later may be a less likely dream -- but not for younger generations of judo hopefuls. ""There are many children who don't have a dream in Japan. I didn't have a dream when I was in elementary school, so I painfully understand the anxiety to that,"" she says. ""But by watching sports together through the Olympic Games, we can share our dreams with the children. And the more children share those dreams, the more they will be able to have their own."" While Matsumoto didn't have any particular goal -- judo was so entrenched in her life from early on that she couldn't imagine doing anything else -- there was one recurring thought in her mind. ""I used to wonder what it would be like if every single person in the world smiles at once."" Smile, and the whole world smiles with you -- even if you're a ""beast.""","Kaori Matsumoto is the first Japanese woman judoka to win Olympic gold in 57 kg division .

"(CNN) -- The comparison would probably irk Michael Jackson purists, but it's easy to see why some of Kilian Martin's fans liken his fancy footwork to the late ""King of Pop."" The Spanish skateboarder's stylish 360-degree toe spins, seen through the artful lens of filmmaker and friend Brett Novak, have a mesmerizing quality -- much like the rest of his repertoire. Martin's artistic flourishes may not be as grandiose as some you'll witness in a skate park; you won't find the 27-year-old chasing air in halfpipes, for example. His tricks are more delicate, his approach more artistic. ""To me skateboarding is an art form,"" Martin tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I'm able to put my thoughts into it, picture stuff and then draw it ... using the world as my canvas and the skateboard as a brush."" Those canvases, as millions have witnessed on YouTube, range from abandoned train station ticket halls and derelict water parks to art galleries and deserted cityscapes in the U.S., Asia and Europe -- the place where Martin's skateboarding odyssey started. Born and raised in Madrid, skating didn't figure much in his early childhood. Like most kids he played soccer but also competed as a gymnast and enjoyed surfing on family vacations in the Canary Islands. The athleticism learned at the gym has clearly informed his skating style, but it was a love of the waves that ultimately influenced his future. ""When I was in Madrid I couldn't surf, so I thought that skateboarding could help my surfing,"" he explains. ""That's basically why I started skating. Then I got hooked ... and I stopped going to gymnastics when I was 16 years old. I love skateboarding because of the creative side of it. There's so much variety, so much you can do."" Streets ahead . Martin has made his name in a branch of skating called street freestyle made famous by U.S. pro legend Rodney Mullen. Often referred to as the godfather of the genre, Mullen invented numerous moves in the 1980s which are now commonplace today, including the flatground ollie and a host of flip tricks. ""Freestyle skateboarding is pretty much how skateboarding started,"" says Martin. ""In freestyle skating there aren't really any rules and you can skate however you want. What I do is mix that freestyle skating with the streets (doing) spins, handstands and rail tricks on obstacles."" Initially, he plied his trade as a competition skater but after winning the 2010 World Cup freestyle in Paderborn, Germany he switched to making films. None are particularly long -- most last around five minutes -- but all are jam-packed with tricks that Martin makes look easy. But the reality is often rather different. ""Sometimes I'll be trying tricks hundreds of times and I'll be completely exhausted and not really wanting to do it anymore but I push myself,"" he reveals. There is also the task of knitting separate tricks together into a flowing sequence -- which is not easy in freestyle, a discipline sometimes derided for being a jerky, stop-start affair. ""Sometimes I'll have my eyes closed and picture myself (doing a trick). As I am filming it my mind and (visualizing) how it looks, I start to think of tricks I've done before and how I can keep the flow and how I can make a variation,"" Martin explains. Evolving tricks is just as important as creating new ones, he says, pointing to his embellishment of the ""daffy"" -- an old and relatively simple maneuver where a skater straddles two boards, riding one behind the other. ""I've been able through the years to take that trick from flat ground to obstacles and come up with some ideas (integrating) the ollie, heelflip and going backwards. It's something that I'm proud of,"" he says. Magnum Opus . Martin's talent has led to some unique opportunities, like skating to George Bizet's ""Carmen,"" in a commercial for a brand of whisky. He teamed up with a choreographer Miguel Elias for the two-day shoot at the Avenida Theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the end of last year. ""When I was skating Elias was giving me ideas. It was something very new to me. I listen when people give me suggestions for new tricks but a lot of the time it doesn't make sense because they're not skaters,"" Martin says. ""But a lot of what he was saying was making sense ... he came up for an idea for a wall trick. I was like 'wow,' this guy has so much style. Afterwards, I had a whole new respect for him."" More recently, Martin has hooked up with his buddy Novak again to shoot the next installment of his freestyle adventures. Life could not be better for the Spaniard, who is now based in California -- the cradle of the sport. ""What really makes me happy is making skate videos,"" he says. ""My goal is to develop my skating, basically take it to another level. It's not really about changing skateboarding, but changing my own skateboarding. ""It's something that I want to do for the rest of my life, as long as I have legs ... well even if I don't, 'cause I'll do a handstand!"" Read more: The 'Frog King' who spawned a golden legacy .

"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- A group of anonymous software developers said they will soon start selling a program that will allow iPhone owners to use the hugely popular device on cell phone systems around the world and not just with AT&T. Apple's iPhone is yet to go on sale outside the U.S. Apple's iPhone, released in the United States two months ago, was engineered to operate for the first two years only on the AT&T system through an exclusive arrangement between Apple and AT&T. It has not yet been sold outside of the U.S. Los Angeles software consultant Brett Schulte, who is not affiliated with the developers, demonstrated the software for CNN Friday evening. An iPhone that had the new software appeared to work on the T-Mobile system just seconds after Schulte replaced the AT&T SIM card with a T-Mobile SIM card. ""It's completely software hacked,"" Schulte said. ""There's no case opening required. It's not required to do any kind of disassembly."" It took Schulte about two minutes to unlock the iPhone. The developers would not give CNN their last names, saying ""We don't want to be hounded."" The said they would start selling the software, which they haven't yet priced, as soon as their online payment and customer service systems are ready. They're also waiting for more information from their lawyers. Apple spokeswoman Jennifer Bowcock told CNN her company has no comment. AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said he couldn't speculate on the legality of unlocking the phone, but he added, ""When you sign up, you're signing a two-year contract. You're obligated to pay the bill."" ""When people buy the iPhone it's clear from our materials it's designed to operate exclusively on AT&T,"" Siegel said. Schulte, however, said it is possible to buy an iPhone without being contractually obligated to AT&T. The developers recently created a Web site -- iPhoneSIMfree.com -- but there is very little information on it and no direct way for anyone to purchase the software. Internet records showed they bought the domain name less than two weeks ago. Two members of the group, who identified themselves only as ""John"" and ""Liu,"" told CNN in a phone interview that a core group of six people on three continents worked to unlock the iPhone as a hobby. They said they are fans of Apple products who thought the iPhone should be made accessible to people who cannot use AT&T. ""I'm not in America and I can't use it,"" said Liu, who would not reveal the country in which he lives. ""It's not fair."" Asked if he thought modifying the iPhone was legal, he said ""That's a very good question. I truly believe it is."" John and Liu said they have not been contacted by either Apple or AT&T, but said that could change the moment their software goes on sale. Earlier this month, a teenager figured out a way to unlock the iPhone, but his method required disassembly of the unit.

"(CNN) -- It has been a watershed moment for Australian cricket. The sport-crazy country's national team has been humiliated during the Ashes series against an England side they would once routinely embarrass. Australia's crushing innings and 157-run defeat in Melbourne marks the end of a golden period where the team had dominated the game for the best part of a decade. The result means that England, the holders, take an unassailable 2-1 lead into the fifth and final Test next week and will retain the Ashes even if Australia salvage some pride with a victory in Sydney to square the series. Will Australia's one-day cricket reign end in 2011? Yet every cloud has a silver lining. On one hand, the hosts will have to make do without captain Ricky Ponting, still regarded as one of the finest batsmen of the modern game, who has been ruled out due to a troublesome fractured finger. But his absence could mark a wholly different watershed: his replacement, 24-year-old Usman Khawaja, is set to become the first Muslim to play for the Australian national cricket team. ""It's been a childhood dream for me,"" Khawaja, who was born in Pakistan before moving to Australia as a young boy, told the Cricinfo website.   ""Ever since I can remember I wanted to play for Australia."" Khawaja has been waiting in the wings throughout the series, and has been in sparkling form in Australia's domestic Sheffield Shield, boasting the highest average in the competition, close to 75. The same can't be said for Ponting. A horrendous run of form with the bat, combined with his team's largely abject displays throughout the series, has seen the 36-year-old receive a mauling from the Australian media. England retain cricket's Ashes with innings victory in Melbourne . But the promotion of Khawaja to the first team has come at a time when Australian cricket needs a good news story, and at a time when the country's attitudes to immigration and multiculturalism have been put under the spotlight by recent tragedy. As many as 50 Iraqi and Iranian Kurdish immigrants died when their boat sunk off the coast of Christmas Island last month, an Australian territory that holds thousands of failed asylum seekers in detention camps to prevent them entering the mainland. An Amnesty International report on the conditions at the island condemned ""the sheer number of individuals who had clearly been suffering both physically and psychologically from the conditions of prolonged detention. Many had been detained for over a year, and incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts were visibly on the rise."" And while a survey by Australian TV network SBS in the aftermath of the tragedy found that 62% of those questioned agreed that Australia should be a multicultural society a minority, only 48%, ""believe migrants should be able to maintain their culture without prejudice or disadvantage."" But for some, the emergence of Khawaja can have a far wider impact than leveling what has been a disastrous Ashes series for Australia. ''Obviously it will have a positive impact; It's good for the [Muslim] community,"" Tariq Khawaja, Usman's father, told the Sydney Morning Herald. ''It shows that it's a fair system and whoever puts in effort can achieve anything in this country. Not only Muslims, any religion. ""As a youngster, if you have passion and if you have dreams, you can make it work.''","Ricky Ponting injured for the fifth and final Ashes test against England .
Usman Khawaja will replace him .
Khwaja will become the first Muslim to play cricket for Australia .
England lead the series 2-1, and have retained their titled ."

"On the surface, Facebook's $2 billion purchase of Oculus VR, which develops virtual-reality technology, doesn't make a lot of sense. Facebook is a social network. Oculus makes gear that enhances video gaming. How is this awkward marriage going to work? Maybe it won't: Facebook moms and Millennial gamers are an uneasy mix. Then again, this may be a savvy bet by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the long-term future of how we communicate. Either way, there's a lot of confusion surrounding this deal. So let us break down what Oculus VR does and why Facebook wanted it so badly. What is Oculus VR? Based in Irvine, California, Oculus (rhymes with ""octopus,"" sort of) is a young company founded by Palmer Luckey, who designed its core product -- the Oculus Rift headset -- as a 20-year-old engineer at the University of Southern California. In the hopes of raising $250,000 to make a few hundred headsets for diehard enthusiasts, Luckey launched a Kickstarter project in 2012. He hit that goal in four hours and within a month had raised nearly $2.5 million. Early prototypes of the Oculus Rift soon drew raves at tech conferences. Gaming legend John Carmack, the lead programmer of pioneering games like ""Doom"" and ""Quake,"" came aboard last year as Oculus' chief technology officer. And both CNN and Time honored the Rift in 2013 as one of the top inventions of the year. Developer versions of the headsets began rolling out to Kickstarter backers and others last spring. A consumer version is expected sometime later this year. How does the Oculus Rift work? The headset, which looks like something a skier or scuba diver might wear, fits snugly over the wearer's face and is paired with headphones. A high-definition 3-D display immerses you in an interactive world -- a medieval village, a tropical jungle, a jet's cockpit -- which you navigate with the help of a game controller. The goggles come packed with an extra-wide field of view, accelerometer, gyroscope and compass to track the position of your head and sync the visuals to the direction where you are looking. This technology has allowed Oculus to improve on the sometimes jerky visuals of other virtual-reality systems. Those who have demoed the headset say it feels so real they have flinched involuntarily at perceived dangers. Reviewers have been wildly enthusiastic, inspiring such breathless headlines as ""Mere Words Can't Do Justice To How Awesome The New Oculus Rift Gaming Headset Is"" and ""I Wore the New Oculus Rift and I Never Want to Look at Real Life Again."" Why did Facebook buy the company? This is the big question. Given the potential demand for the Oculus Rift when it hits the market, Facebook may view Oculus purely as a new stream of revenue. Some observers suggest the purchase is an attempt to inject some futuristic cool into an aging social-media company that's falling out of favor with young users. By buying Oculus, Facebook also is betting that the next tech wave could be ruled by wearable devices -- a similar path being trod by Google, with its Glass eyewear, and Samsung, with its Galaxy Gear smartwatch. ""After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences,"" said Zuckerberg in a post announcing the purchase. ""Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home. ""This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures."" The Oculus Rift, however, remains an immersive but isolating experience -- it's not clear how Facebook would integrate social functions into a Rift game, or whether users would even want that. How might Facebook use Oculus? Oculus believes that over the next 10 years, virtual reality will become ubiquitous and affordable. Future technology could potentially allow two Oculus wearers to interact with each other in a virtual world -- like Skype on steroids. ""You start to realize how big this could be if you can see someone else, and you can actually look at them and your brain believes they're right in front of you, not through a screen,"" Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe told reporters in a conference call, as reported by Fortune. So, yes, the Oculus Rift might be a real-world step toward the ""Star Trek"" Holodeck, a chamber which can simulate any environment. Instead of messaging your old college pals through Facebook, why not meet them for a virtual hike through the Grand Canyon? ""You get the goosebumps,"" Iribe continued. ""You see how big this could be, and how social it is, and the impact it could have on other industries."" Still, however, some observers remain skeptical. ""The real question is: Does Mark Zuckerberg actually believe that Facebook's aging user base is going to be enthusiastic about the notion of a virtual social experience?"" wrote Eric Mack for Forbes. ""While I'm sure that Facebook would love to integrate virtual reality gaming and chats with doctors on the other side of the world into its platform,"" Mack added, ""could part of the calculus also be to hedge against the day that the era of the social network as we know it becomes totally played out?""

"(CNN) -- Rachel Atherton is haring down a narrow muddy path on a hillside riding every hump and bump with the skill you would expect from a double world champion. She may be surrounded by beautiful, rolling countryside on all sides in north Wales, but the trail she is tackling today in Llangollen is known as a bit of a beast in mountain biking circles. The course is frighteningly steep in places, frequently rocky and steeped in mud, but the 27-year-old negotiates every perilous twist and turn with ease. ""When you are racing and you get it right, it feels amazing,"" Atherton told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It almost feels like a meditation or a dance because you feel at one with your bike, putting it exactly where it needs to be and the rocks and bumps are working in your favor and it feels perfect."" Atherton has been risking life and limb bombing down mountain sides for more than a decade competing in the discipline of downhill mountain biking. ""The average mountain bike race lasts five to six minutes, which doesn't sound long, but when you are hurtling down a mountain at 40-50 mph (65-80 kph) and you've got obstacles -- rocks, roots, big jumps, trees to dodge ... it's pretty hard work!"" she explains. ""You physically need to be strong and very fit but also you need to be able to mentally overcome challenges -- if you're scared or a bit nervous -- and be able to put yourself in to the zone where you are willing to take the risks. You need to believe in yourself."" A family affair . Atherton took up BMX racing at the age of eight before switching to mountain bikes three years later. She admits to hating it at first, preferring to play netball and hockey at school, but encouraged by her two brothers she quickly became hooked on the sport. In 2004, aged 16, Atherton clinched the UK senior downhill title and four years later won her first World Championship. She has since gone on to amass 21 individual World Cup downhill wins and been crowned overall World Cup champion three times. ""Having two older brothers was amazing. I've no doubt that I wouldn't be where I am today without having my brothers as role models,"" she says of reigning downhill world champion Gee (29) and 32-year-old Dan, who has tasted success in four-cross (4X) races -- think ski-cross on two wheels. ""(It's) made me quite competitive. Every time we go out riding, even if it's just a fun ride we always end up trying to be the first to the bottom of the hill ... so it's a really good environment to be an athlete. You are always striving to be the best,"" she says. The friendly sibling rivalry has bred numerous individual wins, sometimes at the same World Cup events. Atherton and Gee have ""done the double"" a couple of times winning both men's and women's downhill races, but nothing will top one glorious day when all three of them stood on top of the podium. ""The highlight of my racing career so far has got to be the 2008 World Cup in Andorra when Dan won his four-cross, Gee won the men's downhill and I won the women's downhill. For all three of us siblings to win the World Cup in the same day was a tearful day!"" Shouldering the pain . As might be expected in such a dangerous sport, tears have been shed following more painful experiences. Atherton has perhaps suffered more than most riders during her career, breaking ribs, wrists, fingers and a collarbone, as well as dislocating her shoulder seven times. The worst unhinging came not up a mountain, but on a road when she was hit by a pick-up truck in California during a winter training camp in January 2009. ""There was a lot of nerve damage and I had about three or four operations over the following year to try and get me back on track. I had to have a nerve graft which was pretty big surgery really."" Inevitably, the setback led to a certain amount of soul-searching about whether she wanted to carry on racing, but she eventually returned replenished both physically and mentally. ""Being injured or having time off definitely gives you something that you didn't have before. It gives you a real hunger and a real determination to prove to yourself that you can get back up and be as strong as you once were,"" she says. It's an attitude that hasn't done her any harm so far with Atherton enjoying her most successful period in the sport in recent seasons, completing the World Championship and World Cup double in 2013. Atherton narrowly missed out on a fourth World Cup crown this year -- she finished second to compatriot Manon Carpenter -- but she's setting her sights predictably high for 2015 targeting another World Cup and World Championship double. Another championship-winning year would also help in her continuing quest to encourage a new generation of girl racers. ""Girls need to have the balance of being tough and getting dirty on the sports fields and then having a good time being a girl,"" she said. ""I think what I've always tried to do in my role as being a top athlete is to show girls the confidence that sport can give you. It gives you such a good feeling and makes you feel strong inside. I think every girl should have that opportunity.""","Rachel Atherton is a double world champion in downhill mountain biking .

"(CNN)Forty-three people who came into contact with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan are now officially cleared after not demonstrating any symptoms during a 21-day monitoring period, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Monday. One more will be cleared later Monday, and four others will complete their 21-day monitoring period soon, he said. ""Thankfully, they are all asymptomatic, and it looks like none of them will get Ebola,"" said Jenkins, who is overseeing response efforts in Dallas. Texas officials' conflicting numbers . The news conflicted with information Jenkins provided to CNN on Sunday indicating that all 48 people would be cleared at midnight. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings also provided numbers that conflicted with Jenkins' information from Sunday. Jenkins told CNN that in addition to the 48 people whose quarantine was ending Monday, there were 75 health workers being monitored. Rawlings said 120 people were still being monitored. It was unclear how he came up with that total. Among those in the clear is Duncan's fiancÃ©e, Louise Troh. Monday marks the 21st day since her last contact with Duncan, who was the first person to die of the disease in the United States. ""We are so happy this is coming to an end, and we are so grateful that none of us has shown any sign of illness,"" Troh said in a statement Sunday. ""We have lost so much, but we have our lives and we have our faith in God, which always gives us hope."" Texas nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, who helped care for Duncan, remain hospitalized as they battle the virus. Pham is in stable condition at a National Institutes of Health facility in Bethesda, Maryland, according to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Vinson is at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Her family has not given permission to make her condition public. While there are signs of hope in the United States and at least one more country in West Africa -- Nigeria was declared Ebola-free Monday, following an announcement that Senegal is now rid of the virus -- Ebola is still spreading rapidly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, health officials report. More than 4,500 people have died from the virus in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization, which said the region is still suffering from ""widespread and intense transmission"" because patients don't have access to adequate health care. There's a social crisis, too. Orphans of victims are often abandoned, their relatives terrified of taking them in. Here's the latest about the virus from around the world: . Ebola czar begins work this week . Ron Klain, the former chief of staff to two vice U.S. presidents who has been tapped as the Obama administration's ""Ebola czar,"" will begin his new duties Wednesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Klain is highly regarded at the White House as a good manager with excellent relationships both in the administration and on Capitol Hill. His supervision of the allocation of funds in the stimulus -- at the time an incredible and complicated government undertaking -- is respected in Washington. He does not have any extensive background in health care -- something many Republicans seized on -- but the job is regarded as a managerial challenge. ""He's strong. He's very tough,"" said CNN political analyst David Gergen. ""It's important in this job to be a coordinator; you have to knock heads together. He's tough enough to do that."" A former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and also to former Vice President Al Gore, Klain is president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group. He has clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court and headed up Gore's effort during the 2000 Florida recount. Nigeria: Ebola is gone . Nigeria was thrust in the Ebola spotlight in July after an infected air traveler introduced the virus to Lagos. The case spurred fears that the disease would spread across the city of 21 million and throughout Africa's most populous country. In the end, Nigeria confirmed 19 Ebola cases, including seven deaths. The World Health Organization said an aggressive government response and effective contact tracing helped keep the virus in check. ""This is a spectacular success story that shows that Ebola can be contained,"" WHO said Monday. ""Such a story can help the many other developing countries that are deeply worried by the prospect of an imported Ebola case,"" it said. ""Many wealthy countries, with outstanding health systems, may have something to learn as well."" Nigerian health officials reached 100% of known contacts in Lagos and 99.8% at the second outbreak site in Port Harcourt, WHO said. And unlike in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the combined epicenter of the outbreak -- all identified contacts in Nigeria were physically monitored every day for 21 days, the agency said. The few who tried to escape the monitoring system were tracked down and returned to finish their required monitoring period. For WHO to declare an Ebola outbreak over, a country must pass 42 days with active surveillance in place, supported by good diagnostic capacity, and with no new cases detected, the agency said. The 42-day period is also twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola. Doctors Without Borders: Worker has recovered . A worker with the international organization Doctors Without Borders announced Monday that a staffer in Norway who contracted Ebola in West Africa and was treated in Europe is now free of the virus. He has been discharged from care, according to Doctors Without Borders' London office. The organization is not releasing any more information, including the staffer's name or plans, citing patient confidentiality. Spain: Nurse's aide free of Ebola . Teresa Romero Ramos, who had contracted Ebola after caring for a patient with the deadly disease, is now free of the virus, Spain's Special Ebola Committee said Sunday. A third test came back negative after two earlier tests showed the levels of Ebola in her system were almost nil. Romero has recovered enough to produce antibodies, virus expert Luis Enjuanes told CNN. But she'll stay in the hospital for days, possibly a few weeks, to recover, Enjuanes said. U.N. worker dies . An employee with the United Nations' entity for gender equality, U.N. Women, died over the weekend from Ebola, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. The staffer worked for the organization in Sierra Leone, and the worker's spouse is receiving treatment for the virus, according to Dujarric. CNN's Al Goodman, Joshua Berlinger, Eliott C. McLaughlin and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","U.N. staffer who worked in Sierra Leone has died of Ebola; spouse being treated .

"Editor's note: Since the FBI arrested a Brooklyn businessman in late July on federal charges of organ trafficking, CNN has been conducting a worldwide investigation into the sale of kidneys, using willing donors and willing recipients from China to Israel to the United States. This installment examines two very different stories of Israelis involved in the trade. Yechezekel Nagauker in a Chinese hospital where he got a kidney transplant after paying $100,000. TEL AVIV, Israel (CNN) -- In a dank Tel Aviv hospital room, you can see at a glance just how desperate some Israelis are for a new kidney. In one bed, Ricki Shai's mother lies practically unresponsive. Her diabetes is slowly killing her. It has forced the amputation of both of her legs. Sitting in a bed beside her is Shai's father, Yechezekel Nagauker, also a diabetic. But he decided, his daughter says, not to wait for a kidney donor. ""My father didn't want to be like my mother,"" Shai said. In April, Nagauker cut a deal with a kidney broker, who promised him a new life and a new kidney for $100,000. It was available only in China, the donor said. ""The broker went to him and suggested that he become a new man. 'Come with me. Two days, $100,000, and two days you will be a new man,' "" Shai said. Today, Shai calls the broker ""the killer."" Nagauker's body is rejecting the new kidney. The family's story is one of several that have come to light in recent weeks as part of a worldwide CNN investigation into what appears to be a widespread black market in human organs, a network now being probed by authorities in Israel and the United States. Nagauker went to China, where his daughter said he was taken to a rural hospital and given the kidney of an 18-year-old Chinese girl. Shai captured images on her cell phone of her father in what she described as a filthy hospital. The surgery went poorly, and the girl who donated the kidney died shortly after surgery, Shai said. ""They gave her $5,000, and she died,"" she said. The broker has yet to face any sanctions. Until just last year, the entire transaction was not only legal in Israel; some state-sponsored health insurance plans paid for transplants. Before March 2008, Israeli law allowed citizens to go abroad for live organ transplants from non-related donors. Israeli investigators are looking intensively at illegal organ trafficking under the new law, the country's Health Ministry said. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, who studies the organ trade, says Israel has become ground zero for both legal and illegal transactions. For years, she said, the very first treatment for anyone with kidney disease in Israel has been to find a new kidney rather than linger on official lists waiting for one. ""There's a belief, of course, that not only is transplant better than dialysis, but you want a living donor, because it's better than a kidney that was on ice or that was under a truck,"" said Scheper-Hughes, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley and founder of the newsletter Organs Watch. ""Michael,"" a broker who insists that he operates legally but still wanted to keep his name and face a secret, said Israelis do not like to weaken their own. His mother, he said, needed a kidney and happily agreed to buy one in China rather than receiving a transplant from her own son.  Watch ""Michael"" on how he brokers kidney transplants Â» . The broker said he has arranged nearly 220 transplants. It has been relatively uncomplicated, he said. Israel's 2008 law banning the strict brokering of kidneys for cash has made things trickier, Michael says. But if a patient arrives at his door with a donor claiming to be a relative, he can easily send them overseas with no questions asked. But are they really relatives? ""I don't know,"" the broker said. ""I don't care. I don't deal with that."" For her part, Shai says her family is ""breaking."" But she has no doubt that the organ broker her family used is still in business. ""We are paying the price,"" she said.","Israeli man paid $100,000 to broker to get new kidney .

"Boston (CNN)Prosecutors said Azmat Tazhayakov knew exactly what he was doing after the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing when he helped his friend ditch a laptop and backpack that belonged to schoolmate Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The assertions were made during opening statements of the first marathon bombing-related trial. ""They did it to protect their close friend,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Siegmann. Tazhayakov is charged with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice in connection with alleged actions taken after the bombing. His roommate, Dias Kadyrbayev, faces the same charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. Both have pleaded not guilty. Another friend, Robel Phillipos, pleaded not guilty to making false statements. None is accused in the bomb plot itself. Lawyers for Tazhayakov, a University of Massachusetts Dartmouth student from Kyrgyzstan, said he did everything he could to help the investigation when he spoke with the FBI. Based on that information, authorities found Tsarnaev's backpack in a landfill and his laptop in the students' apartment. The government says accused bomber Tsarnaev texted Tazhayakov after the bombing and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what they wanted. He ended the text with a smiley face. His lawyer told jurors, the smiley face is code for marijuana. Tazhayakov asked whether Tsarnaev saw the news of the bombing, according to prosecutors. Tsarnaev responded, ""Don't go thinking it's me, you cooked bastard,"" which reportedly is a phrase used to describe those who smoke marijuana.  A friend who took the stand as one of the first prosecution witnesses told jurors Tsarnaev sold weed on campus. Prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev, ""i think they got his brother"" hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. That's because the students allegedly recognized the Tsarnaev brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public's helping finding the two men. Defense lawyers for Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev have said the young men weren't sure it was the Tsarnaev brothers.  Kadyrbayev will have a separate trial at a later date. In January 2013, three months before the bombing, the government saia Tazhayakov stayed over with his pal for two nights and met Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the bombing. The FBI suspects Tamerlan helped plot and carry out the terror attack with his little brother. One month before the bombing, the government says the younger Tsarnaev met with his friends at a restaurant and told them he knew how to make a bomb and could make one with gunpowder. He also allegedly discussed martyrdom. ""It was good to die ... as a martyr, as you would die with a smile on your face and go straight to heaven,"" Tsarnaev told them, according to Siegmann. Tazhayakov's lawyer Nicholas Wooldridge said his client doesn't believe in martyrdom and the Tsarnaevs did not act as martyrs because they initially survived the attacks. The defense maintains Tazhayakov, then 19, didn't understand his legal right to remain silent when the FBI questioned him because of difficulty understanding English and that he was coerced during questioning. His lawyers have asked a judge to throw out his statement, but the judge has not yet ruled on that motion. His lawyers also blame co-defendant Kadrybayev for throwing the backpack in a dumpster, repeatedly telling jurors Tazhayakov never touched the backpack and didn't know it had been ditched. ""We've been asking God that the truth will come out, and we hope the jury will hear that,"" Tazhayakov's father said outside court, through a Russian translator. When CNN asked whether his son could have done something differently, his father replied ""Absolutely. Before you make a friend, make sure you make the right decision.""","Prosecutors allege Azmat Tazhayakov helped dispose of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's items .

"(CNN)Take a moment and think of an African author. Have you got the name in mind? Keep it there for a minute. In years gone by, chances are cultural icons like Nigerian literary giant Chinua Achebe or South African Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer might have popped straight into your head. But lately new names from across the continent are becoming part of popular literary consciousness. ""Purple Hibiscus,"" ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" and more recently ""Americanah"" have brought international acclaim for Nigerian author du jour, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. She joins a growing list of popular African authors -- including NoViolet Bulawayo, Binyavanga Wainaina, Taiye Selasi, Lauren Beukes, Alain Mabanckou -- who have been steadily picking up steam --and fans -- across the globe over the last several years. 'Democratization of culture' But where has this new wave of African writers come from? For Minna Salami, an award-winning blogger specializing in African culture and the diaspora, they were always there -- the rest of the world just didn't know how to find them. ""The world is far more interconnected thanks to technology and social media,"" Salami told CNN. ""It's an exciting time ... People are checking out alternative literature and Africa -- in its position as a kind of underdog -- provides that perfect place to go and seek alternative voices that help people make sense of the world. ""It's kind of democratization of culture so people cannot ignore voices coming from other parts of the world,"" added Salami, also known by her digital moniker MsAfropolitan. ""And when something is good, it obviously catches people's attention. Before it would not have reached any mainstream; now it is, thanks to bloggers and local content production."" Read this: 'Humans of Khartoum' photo series . True, indigenous content producers and independent publishers have slowly developed in recent years all across the continent. In Cape Town and beyond, enthusiastic readers can pick up a copy of The  Chronic, a pan-African gazzette by Chimurenga that's successfully putting a spotlight on an eclectic mix of writers, photographers and illustrators from the continent. Concurrently in Kenya, there is the Kwani Trust, a Nairobi-based organization that works to promote up-and-coming local writers through its publication, Kwani?. More and more, stories are resonating with readers because they reveal the day-to-day issues faced by locals, according to the journal's managing editor, Billy Kahora. ""Just think about stories off the page, or off the book, when you think about how stories organically take place,"" he explained. ""These are stories with a kind of narrative that people tell each other in public spaces, like churches, bars, on the street. All these stories are really locally grounded and are actually kind of written in the immediate concerns of what's happening about."" Celebrating African writers . But it's not just literary collectives that are driving interest towards contemporary authors. Many in the publishing industry cite the numerous international awards, which now frequently acknowledge and celebrate African writers -- for helping develop the surge in popularity for authors. One such annual event is the long-running Caine Prize which aims to ""promote the best in new African literature, to identify and champion the most talented writers on the continent,"" according to the award's director, Lizzy Attree. ""New writers are emerging all the time,"" she said. [Writers'] collectives like Jalada are starting up and publishing online; publishers are branching into new areas -- romance, sci-fi, crime fiction and literary fiction is thriving."" New voices, new genres . Take for instance Kenyan writer Okwiri Oduor, the recipient of this year's Caine Prize. Speaking at London's British Library last month at the ""Africa Writes"" book festival attended by all five shortlisted contenders, Oduor was among those calling for a more assorted literature output. ""I don't know what 'African Literature' means,"" she said, ""but I think there are many ways of thinking about it. I would hope for it to diversify -- I'd like to read more science fiction, multiculturalism."" Zimbabwean writer Tendai Huchu, a contender for this year's prize, agreed. ""I would hope for more diverse literature -- by this I'm saying a lot more stuff in different genres,"" he explains. ""There's the pulpy, entertaining stuff that goes to the masses but at the moment, we have a situation in which you do a story and someone says: 'What does this tell you about Africa?' which is problematic."" For Zambian writer Efemia Chela, also shortlisted nominee, just talking about African literature is ""a bit of an absurd idea."" She explained: ""You could say European literature is like talking from Russia all the way to the Hebrides -- no one really does that and it's a bit tricky with African literature. It's 54 countries and so you know, there's so much scope and range of voices."" Meanwhile, Kahora, also shortlisted for this year's Caine Prize, said that this desire for different styles and genres was already on its way -- and growing. ""A lot of people now are very interested in afro-futurism,"" he said. ""A lot of sci-fi, a lot of fantasy, a lot of erotica, and then a lot of cross genre -- a kind of cross pollination of genre,"" added Kahora. ""You will also see [more] forms -- you will see some straying to visual storytelling online that attempts to do what a book does."" Attree said that this new generation of writers is helping to change perceptions about the continent. ""Africans are now telling their own stories, and this side of Africa is opening the eyes of international readers who are seeing the continent in different lights as a consequence,"" she said. ""Not just as a place of war, disaster, genocide and famine, but one of hope, beauty, romance, tragedy, poverty, laughter, struggle, and upliftment.""

"(CNN) -- When an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010 a quarter of a million people lost their lives, homes were flattened and communities torn apart. The capital Port-au-Prince became a sea of devastation in which shelter was hard to find. Those affected flocked to find safe ground. Amid the chaos, the Sylvio Cator stadium became a makeshift refuge for those hordes rendered homeless by the disaster. Thousands poured through the gates at the national home of soccer, seeking sanctuary on turf that usually only plays the role of host for 90 minutes at a time. A year on from the disaster some 7,000 people still live in and around the stadium, a grim reality replicated on nearly every green space in the rubble-strewn city. But slowly, soccer -- like the community it represents -- is starting to reassert itself. The scene is still far from normal as helicopters laden with medical supplies use the pitch -- once the preserve of players only -- to land and take off from. For the man charged with trying to rebuild the country's decimated football community, it provides yet another challenge to etch onto an exhausting list. Haiti's Football Federation (HFF) president, Yves Jean-Bart, recalls how the earthquake that brought the country to its knees spared nothing for the beautiful game. ""Our national headquarters collapsed in just a few seconds,"" he told CNN. ""Of the 50 people present at the time of the earthquake one dozen were injured and 32 found dead. ""We also lost inventories of national equipment; the federation's archives were not recovered. Our trophies, the awards we have received throughout the history of the federation, pictures of witnesses of our glorious years were not found in the rubble. It was a complete disaster. ""On top of it all, right after the earthquake all fields were occupied by millions of refugees of the earthquake who had lost everything. Currently we no longer have any soccer field that we can use in Port-au-Prince and surrounding towns for a decent game."" This represents a big problem for the country, whose passion for football is described by soccer's governing body FIFA as ""amongst the most intense on the planet."" Yet despite the infinite challenges, the HFF have worked tirelessly to get soccer back on its feet and were still able to launch their domestic league and cup tournaments, if a little later than advertised. Just two months after the tragedy, and despite losing their coach Jean-Yves Labaze to the earthquake, Haiti's under-17 women's team competed in a qualifying tournament for the World Cup. This courage of purpose saw the team given FIFA's Fair Play award at a recent ceremony, where the team captain, Hayana Jean Francois, summed up the country's feeling towards soccer when she told the audience: ""If there was no football, we would be nothing."" It is this enthusiasm that has been the catalyst for recovery according to many, allied with offers of assistance from the likes of Guyana, the United States, England, Qatar, Spain and Canada. English Premier League star and France international Florent Malouda felt moved to visit the country to support the Yele Haiti charity, founded by his friend, hip hop star Wyclef Jean. The Chelsea midfielder was stunned by what he saw. ""We went to Port-au-Prince and it was chaos,"" he said. ""People were trying to rebuild their lives but there was no water, no electricity. Some of the first tent camps on the road from the airport had already been destroyed by the wind. ""I wondered how they could live in such difficult conditions. But when you spoke to people you could feel that, no matter what happens, they were still positive and they still believed in life. It was really inspiring."" For Malouda, Haiti's love for soccer remains despite the crisis: ""I'd say football must be their second religion. They know everything about football. They just love it. That's the power of football. It's all about joy and passion, and it lets them forget their problems."" FIFA have been at the forefront of the international aid effort, donating $3.25 million, and its president, Sepp Blatter, told CNN: ""One year after the earthquake, we have not forgotten about Haiti and we are still committed to supporting them. ""We know that football remains a contributor to the positive spirit of many youngsters in Haiti, and that it can bring some hope for them in these difficult times."" The tragedy galvanized the international football community and help flooded in from companies such as Digicel, Adidas, Walt Disney and German television station SAT-EIN. Plans to bring the crumbling Sylvio Cator stadium back up to scratch are in motion and construction of a new headquarters for the HFF has already begun. Once completed it will be a particularly poignant reminder of Dr Jean-Bart's colleagues who were entombed in the previous HFF hub. ""We held a memorial service for our colleagues who did not make it in April on the site of our collapsed headquarters, an extremely moving ceremony,"" he explained. ""On our new website as well as our new headquarters we will have a special place dedicated to their memory, but we know it will never be enough to demonstrate our gratitude for all that they have done for soccer."" The HFF hasn't replaced any of those who were lost, and now operates with a threadbare staff, but thanks to help from around the world Dr Jean-Bart says the future is dominated by hope. ""Overall, we would say that it is thanks to all the 208 associations of FIFA, who showed us their support and affection that we never felt alone throughout this long journey. ""Since 2003 we've been going from one catastrophe to the next. Personally, I never imagined that there was so much solidarity in our family, such a passion to get back on track, everyday I see that the courage and the willpower is getting stronger and stronger. ""What we are most satisfied with is being able to keep doing of all our activities just like before the quake. We are extremely proud of being able to get back up and handling every situation going on in our country. ""Haiti never really had much except for talent and the passion for soccer.""","Haitian soccer is slowly rebuilding after the devastating earthquake of January 2010 .

"On February 1, deadly riots at a football match in Port Said plunged Egypt into mourning and despair. The national league was canceled and the future of one of African soccer's traditional powerhouses seemed bleak. However, a tiny bit of that gloom lifted just weeks later when Ahmed Hassan made history by making his 179th international appearance -- a new world record that gave a glimmer of hope in a time of turmoil. But, as he prepares to continue the Pharaohs' rebuilding phase, Hassan says that Egypt -- a country where sport and politics are inextricably linked -- faces a long road to recovery before it can resolve its problems and move out of a ""dark tunnel."" ""The whole country is suffering from a lack of ethics, as well as a general lack of security, and this is causing problems in all facets of life,"" the 36-year-old told the official website of world football's governing body FIFA. ""There is no doubt that football will bounce back but the whole country has to make it out of this dark tunnel. Stability will only return when all members of the community, whether they be players, fans, referees, journalists or security staff, recognize their role, stick to it and respect the role of others."" American is coach, protester in Egypt . Hassan's landmark appearance came on February 27 in a friendly against Kenya in Qatar. The Egypt team has not been able to play at home since the riots, which killed 74 people after a game between top-tier clubs Al-Masry and Al-Ahly. More lives were lost as fighting spread across the country. Hassan, who has returned to the national squad for Thursday's friendly against Nigeria in Dubai, was deeply moved by the tragedy. An outspoken figure against football hooliganism, Hassan took to the streets the following day in protest against the clashes. ""It's depressing to see the sport that everybody loves become a source of such sadness but, ultimately, what happened was a result of fanaticism,"" he said. ""I have to say that the media also played a large role by stirring up the fans' aggression instead of attempting to calm things down."" Hassan captained Egypt to Africa Cup of Nations titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010 -- his fourth overall. But the Pharaohs' form has plummeted in recent years, failing to qualify for the 2012 edition of the tournament. Hassan said the Arab uprising last year, which saw Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak overthrown in a wave of protest, was a factor in the team's fall in fortunes. ""We're all part of this country and anything that goes on affects us, so naturally our concentration levels drop and we cannot remain focused when such turmoil is happening at home. On top of that there's the fact that we couldn't play for a very long time with the league being suspended for almost four months,"" he said. Hassan said Egypt had taken for granted its ability to qualify. ""After being on top for all those years, we simply underestimated our opponents, but we have learned our lesson well and we have learned it the hard way."" Hassan carved a successful football career in Europe for 10 years, before returning in 2008 to play for Al-Ahly and, now, that club's fiercest rival Zamalek. Both teams, like Al-Masry, are supported by militant fan groups known as ""ultras."" ""It is a great thing if they stick to supporting their teams within the reasonable and ethical limits, but once it crosses the line and turns aggressive or becomes a vehicle for something completely beyond football then it becomes unacceptable and can lead to disasters,"" Hassan said. ""All over the world, ultras support their clubs using organized cheering which can be very entertaining, and this is what we as players like to see in the stands, but if they cause violence in the stadiums then no, we cannot tolerate that.""","Most-capped player in history,  Ahmed Hassan, says Egypt is suffering from a lack of ethics .

""Each time I win and stand on the podium, I feel that I truly have won myself,"" Duong told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""When they put the gold medal on me, I feel so emotional, as if it is a dream."" Growing up in Hanoi, Duong wasn't particularly interested in the sport and has an overweight relative to thank for sparking her career into life. ""When I was small, I didn't know anything about Wushu,"" she said. ""I only knew that martial arts could make you healthy. One of my cousins who was very fat practiced Wushu to lose weight and I asked to come with him."" Her cousin's interest may have waned pretty quickly -- ""he quit after a week -- he is still fat!"" she jokes -- but Duong has persevered and now tucks into a rigorous daily diet of exercise, training in both the morning and afternoon six days a week, sometimes longer. ""Before important tournaments, we even practice on Sunday mornings -- the programs consist of physical and technique training."" The modern sport of Wushu started life in ancient China as a form of self defense, explains Daniel Kainan Pan, a former member of the Great Britain Wushu team. ""Traditional Wushu can be said to be the ancestor of all martial arts like Aikido, Karate, Judo -- they all came from ancient Chinese martial arts,"" Kainan Pan says. ""What really sets Wushu apart (from other martial arts) is that it's more of a complete system, in the sense that in the fighting aspect there are grabs and throws but also punches and kicks -- you can use anything you want. ""From a performance aspect, it's almost comparable to gymnastics -- everyone does 720 (-degree) rotations and lands in the splits."" There are also weapons to wield in Duong's non-combat discipline -- female competitors perform their individual routines with either a double-edged straight sword (Jian) or a spear (Qiang) while the men use a slightly different type of sword, a Dao, and a wooden staff called a Gun. ""Everything about Wushu is equally very difficult,"" Duong says. ""It requires you to be persistent in training to combine the movements of your head, your arms, your legs and your whole body. It's very important that all the movements are coordinated carefully."" As she roams around the floor space at the gym in downtown Hanoi and casually performs eye-watering stretches on the stall bars, it's clear that this dedication has paid off -- her supple, flowing movements have a balletic quality to them. This combination of strength and grace is one of Wushu's most appealing aspects, says Kainan Pan, but also one of the hardest to master. ""The sport may be derived from traditional martial arts, but the movements are more beautiful and more emphasized,"" he says. ""You really need to be able to stretch and do the front splits -- flexibility is really difficult. The second thing is athletic ability -- there are lots of jumps and a high degree of rotation."" Kainan Pan grew up idolizing Chinese Wushu legend turned actor Jet Li, but for Duong it is her compatriot Nguyen Thuy Hien who has spurred her on. The 35-year-old, who now coaches the sport, made history in 1993 when she won a world championship gold medal at the age of 14 before repeating the feat four years later. ""She was the first person to win a world championship gold medal for the Vietnamese Wushu team,"" Duong says. Duong will have a chance to emulate Nguyen at the World Championships in Jakarta, Indonesia next October. Victory will be another acrobatic step towards her goal of mastering both the physical and the mental challenges of the ancient martial art. ""In my opinion, in order to become a great athlete, one must have qualities of persistence, creativity and the ability to think, understand and sense what you are doing,"" she said.","Vietnamese martial artist became a world champion in 2013 .

"New York (CNN) -- Outside a Manhattan mosque where the imam preaches against terrorism, the brothers of the ""Revolution Muslim"" are spreading a different message. Protected by the Constitution of the country they detest, radical Muslim converts like Yousef al-Khattab and Younes Abdullah Mohammed preach that the killing of U.S. troops overseas is justified. In their thinking, so were the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States -- and so are attacks on almost any American. ""Americans will always be a target -- and a legitimate target -- until America changes its nature in the international arena,"" Mohammed said in an interview to air on tonight's ""AC 360."" Al-Khattab and Mohammed consider al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden their model. ""I love him like I can't begin to tell you, because he doesn't seem to have done anything wrong from the sharia,"" al-Khattab said, referring to Islamic law. ""If you're asking me if I love him as a Muslim, I love him more than I love myself."" They hand out fliers outside the gleaming 96th Street mosque, where up to 4,000 people visit every day. Inside the sleek, modernistic house of worship, Imam Shamsi Ali preaches against the violence that now sweeps many Muslim countries. ""What we try to do is reminding our people about the real Islam,"" Ali said. ""We tell them what the real Islam is all about. Islam is about peace. Islam is about moderation. Islam is about friendship. Islam is opposed to any kind of hatred against anybody."" Law enforcement sources have told CNN the men walk right up to the line of protection under the First Amendment, but their message is not going unnoticed. Al-Khattab handed CNN Correspondent Drew Griffin a business card from an FBI agent who he says is keeping tabs on him. The agent would not comment without clearance from his superiors, except to say, ""Obviously, if they gave you my card, you know we are watching them."" The mosque has called police on Al-Khattab and Mohammed several times, and passers-by occasionally engage them in heated debates. Ali told CNN that ordinary Muslims are ""disgusted with their behavior."" But they insist they don't fight themselves, and don't incite others to do so. Al-Khattab calls President Obama ""a murderer, a tyrant, a scumbag,"" and says he wouldn't ""shed a tear"" if Obama were killed. But he added, ""Would I incite his murder? That's not what I teach."" Mohammed calls himself an American ""by default"" who identifies with Muslims. Al-Khattab, a Jew who lived in Israel before converting to Islam, says he ""would like to see a mushroom cloud"" over the Jewish state -- ""but before that, I'd like to see the people guided, and I'd like them to go back to their original countries where they're from."" But federal agents are not only watching them, they're watching some of those who are listening. Neil Bryant Vinas, a young New Yorker who has pleaded guilty to plotting to attack trains on the Long Island Rail Road, met with al-Khattab. Al-Khattab said Vinas and ""some brothers"" traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey, and had dinner with him. Al-Khattab said they considered him something of a hero because he left Israel and converted to Islam. Al-Khattab also claims friendships with Tarek Mehanna, now under indictment in Boston, Massachusetts, on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, and Daniel Maldonado, who pleaded guilty before a federal judge in Texas to receiving military training from Islamic militants in Somalia. Mohammed says he and his fellow radicals are ""commanded to terrorize the disbelievers ... making them fearful so that they will think twice before they go rape your mother or kill your brother or go onto your land and try to steal your resources."" ""We are defending innocent women that are bombed every day, innocent children that are bombed every day,"" he said. But asked whether those who take their fliers should take up arms against Americans, he said, ""We certainly have never said that.""

"As violence continues unabated in Iraq, the United States has agreed to sell $700 million in military aid, including 5,000 Hellfire missiles. The Iraqi government made the request for the missiles, which are primarily fired from helicopters, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The United States has already been providing Iraq with Hellfires. Since January, 780 were delivered, according to Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. The United States expects to ship another 366 in August. Kirby said the additional 5,000 missiles would likely be shipped in batches, but he had no details on a delivery schedule. Congress, which has the authority to block it, was notified of the potential new sale on Monday. The State Department has approved the proposal. Iraq's government has been waging war with militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The terrorist group has taken over several cities. It is seeking to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses parts of Iraq and Syria and has begun imposing Sharia law in the towns it controls. Police officials in Baghdad told CNN two car bombs exploded in two Shiite neighborhoods on Wednesday. At least seven people were killed and 25 were wounded when one bomb exploded near a gas station in Sadr district in eastern Baghdad. About 30 minutes later, another explosion near a busy outdoor market in al Ameen neighborhood in southern Baghdad killed five people and wounded 35 others.","Hellfires are usually fired from the air to ground, water .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday blamed Hamas for abducting three teenagers who went missing in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. ""This morning I can say what I was unable to say yesterday before the extensive wave of arrests of Hamas members in Judea and Samaria,"" he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. ""Those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of Hamas -- the same Hamas that Abu Mazen made a unity government with.  This has severe repercussions."" Abu Mazen is another name for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu said he asked  Abbas ""to do everything to help bring them back in peace.""  He's also given security forces orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to Gaza or any other place. One of three boys is a dual Israeli-American citizen, according to CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel, which attributed the information to a source at Netanyahu's office.  Israeli and U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the report. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Sunday for the immediate release of the boys. ""We are still seeking details on the parties responsible for this despicable terrorist act, although many indications point to Hamas' involvement,"" Kerry said in a written statement that offered support to the Israeli government. ""As we gather this information, we reiterate our position that Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past."" Netanyahu: Israeli forces can use 'all measures' to free teens . 'We'll hug them soon' Gilad Shaar, 16; Naftali Frenkel, 16; and Eyal Yifrach, 19, have been missing since late Thursday or Friday, and were last seen around Gush Etzion, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The three ""were just on their way home,"" Naftali's mother, Racheli Frankel, told reporters. ""We trust"" that they ""will be with us here, and we'll hug them soon ... and God willing, we'll all be able to celebrate their return safely,"" she said. She thanked the security forces for their efforts and the U.S. Embassy for its support. ""We feel waves and waves of prayers and support and positive energy in this direction."" Israeli soldiers have detained about 80 Palestinian suspects in the search for the three teens, the IDF said Sunday. Netanyahu on Saturday gave security forces the OK to use ""all measures"" at their disposal to find the teenagers. The Palestinian Ministry of Information said in a written statement that the arrests come under ""flimsy pretexts"" as a ""continuation of the aggression"" on Palestinians. ""The ministry also asserts that the Israeli military campaign has been on going for decades, during which (Israel) kidnapped the entire Palestinian people,"" it said. Hamas responds . A Hamas spokesman in Gaza told CNN that Netanyahu's comments attributing blame were ""stupid and baseless."" ""The arrest campaign made by the Israeli occupation in the West Bank is targeted to break the backbone of Hamas and bring it down,  but the Israelis will not succeed in achieving their goal,"" Sami Abu Zuhri said. But Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said the kidnappings are a reminder of Hamas' tactics.  ""When the Fatah-Hamas government was formed last month, the international community quickly recognized and welcomed it,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""Suddenly, Hamas' cruel acts of terrorism were forgotten, their never-ending attempts to harm innocent civilians, along with the Hamas Charter, which calls for the total destruction of the state of Israel.""  Now, he wrote, ""the international community has been given a second chance to correct its moral, diplomatic and strategic mistakes. Wall to wall condemnations of the kidnapping are called for, as well as placing responsibility on the Palestinian government, including the threat of taking physical, economic and diplomatic steps against it."" But, he wrote, the international community is ""keeping silent, and by doing so, not only are the Palestinians receiving a false, lenient message, but Israel also understands again that she has no one to count on but herself, something that will not encourage further compromises on her part in the near future."" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said, ""We are determined in bringing the boys home in a (hasty) manner, in safety and in good health. Palestinian terrorists will not feel safe, will not be able to hide and will feel the heavy arm of the Israeli military capabilities."" '#BringBackOurBoys' The abduction of the three teens inspired social media users to use the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys, a reference to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign for more than 200 Nigerian school girls who were kidnapped by militants. The thread quickly became contentious, with pro-Palestinian users alleging many Palestinian children have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers and imprisoned. A ""Bring Back Our Boys"" Facebook page calling for an end to ""the terrorism against Israel"" had more than 50,000 likes Sunday.","U.S. calls abduction a ""despicable terrorist act""

"(CNN)As teenagers, the women of the Ethiopian Mursi tribe pierce their lower lips and put a clay plate in it. They are one of the last tribes in the world who still practice this tradition and the new generation, influenced by the outside world, might decide to abandon it. That's why British photographer Jimmy Nelson decided to travel the world for three years, visiting 35 tribes in all five continents, to document their lives and customs before they disappear. He drank vodka with the Mongolian Tsaatan tribe in freezing conditions and admired the beautiful Himba tribesmen in the Namib Desert. The result of his journey can be found in his new book of photographs, ""Before They Pass Away."" ""The whole idea is to make (the tribes) iconic. To give them the attention that we give ourselves in the developed world,"" the 45-year-old photographer says. From a very early age, Nelson was confronted by cultural diversity. He grew up in different African countries before moving to England at the age of seven to attend a catholic Jesuit boarding school. Going back to Africa to meet with nine tribes in four different countries was a special experience for him. Read this: modernizing the Maasai to avoid extinction . ""Africa is evolving the quickest in my opinion. It has lost the majority of its ethnicity and authenticity,"" he says. ""I grew up in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gabon and in Cameroon. I've been living for 45 years, and what I saw in my childhood is not there anymore."" Being humble . Nelson and his crew, consisting of an assistant and a cameraman, covered Africa in five trips. They visited five tribes in Ethiopia, and one each in Kenya, Tanzania and Namibia. Nelson says the most challenging part of his African journeys was approaching the tribes in southern Ethiopia. ""There are many small tribes in a small area and everybody is protecting their own turf. So they can be quite intimidating,"" he says. When first approaching the tribes, Nelson left the camera equipment behind. He says even though all the tribes had been documented before, he was conscious to explain to them what he wanted to do. Only the Kenyan tribe, Samburu, knew he was coming. Maasai Cricket Warriors: 'Bowling is just like throwing a spear' Although he was always traveling with a local guide, Nelson had to rely on body language and gestures to communicate with the different tribesmen and gain their trust. But he says it was all about appealing to their vanity. ""Initially it's idolization. You put them on a pedestal and then you touch their muscles and show that through lots of gestures, lots of hero-worship,"" Nelson explains of his initial meetings with the Ethiopian tribes, who would often greet him carrying Kalashnikov rifles. ""You arrive and they are all wild and intimidating, it's all about being macho."" One thing that stood out to Nelson when meeting the different African tribes was their awareness of their appearances. He says he noticed a lot of male vanity in the African tribes. For example, many people think the men in the Namibian Himba tribe are actually women. ""This is a classic example of the whole idea behind the book that appearances can be deceptive,"" he says. ""Very few of us will ever look as beautiful as these people."" The Himba: Namibia's iconic red women . Signs of modernization . When Nelson and his crew traveled across the Omo Valley four years ago, to find the southern Ethiopian tribes, it took them three weeks to reach them. Today, he says, the roads have been improved and it only takes a few days. He thinks this is one of the reasons some of the tribes are slowly abandoning their traditional lifestyle. ""At the moment (the African tribes) are evolving quickly because of the digital age. Many of them have a mobile telephone, so they are aware of an outside world,"" he says. The book ""Before They Pass Away"" is just the first third of his project. The next step is to go back to all 35 tribes and show them their photos, explaining to them why he made them. The idea is to then visit another 35 tribes in more politically unstable areas, where he would need the authorities' help to get access. But most of all Nelson hopes the portraits will encourage a deeper dialogue between the tribes and the developed world. ""By illustrating these people in a grand aesthetic, romantic, idealistic and iconic way, I'm trying to attract the public's attention to a subject matter that they wouldn't normally be interested in,"" the photographer explains. Before Nelson embarked on his three-year-long journey, he was just expecting to make a visual document to celebrate the tribes for what they looked like. But now he thinks there are greater lessons to be learned. ""In my eyes the tribespeople are emotionally and socially very rich but materially very poor, and we (in the West) are the opposite,"" he says. ""How aware of how special they are is debatable, hence why I want to start this discussion. Before they pass away.""","Jimmy Nelson photographed 35 tribes all over the world for book ""'Before They Pass Away""

"In the latest sign of his resolve to fight widespread official corruption, Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a leadership meeting Monday to expel four senior members from the ruling Communist Party, including a retired top general of the two million-strong People's Liberation Army. Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission that runs the world's largest standing army, was found to have accepted bribes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Xu was also a member of the country's elite decision-making body, the Politburo, before retiring in late 2012. The official probe into Xu, 71, started in March and Party investigators have found evidence of him and his family members receiving money and gifts from others, according to Xinhua. Xu's case would be handed over to prosecutors for a court martial, making him the most senior military leader to face corruption charges in recent memory. In a statement released after Monday's Politburo meeting, President Xi and other Chinese leaders reiterated their ""zero tolerance"" for corruption in the government and military -- long a lightning rod for mass discontent across the country -- but they also acknowledged the anti-graft task would be ""ongoing, complex and formidable."" The three other former senior officials ousted from the Communist Party for corruption were Jiang Jiemin, a former minister in charge of state assets; Li Dongsheng, a former vice minister of public security; and Wang Yongchun, a former deputy head of state-owned oil behemoth China National Petroleum Corporation. 'Tigers and flies' The announcement on Xu came on the heels of the downfall of Su Rong, a former vice chairman of China's top political advisory body. Su, once a ""state leader"" in the official hierarchy, was formally removed from his post last Wednesday over serious corruption allegations. State media has characterized Xu as a big ""military tiger"" caught in the massive anti-graft campaign launched by President Xi, who is also the commander-in-chief. After becoming the head of the Communist Party in late 2012, Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""tigers and flies"" alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position. Xinhua recently touted the catching of 30 ""tigers"" since Xi took power less than two years ago. Zhou Yongkang . Some China watchers have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials to Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be under investigation for some time. Jiang, Li and Wang in Monday's announcement have long been considered Zhou protÃ©gÃ©s. State media has reported official probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan Province -- three places Zhou once ruled. If announced, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. In 2013, some 182,000 officials were disciplined while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission. State media has cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- though called politically motivated by Bo supporters -- as one prime example of President Xi's determination to clean up the Party. 'Corruption endemic' Longtime China observers, however, point to the limits of President Xi's war on corruption. ""Corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going do it,"" said Frank Ching, a Hong Kong-based commentator and columnist on Chinese politics. ""Something has to be done about the system."" ""There have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets. There has been no indication that they are going to do that. In fact, a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison,"" he added. ""I think people will be much more convinced of the seriousness of this anti-corruption campaign if there were a move to enact such a law.""","Gen.

"U.S. fighter jets intercepted Russian bombers off Alaska and California this month, the latest incidents in a string of recent aerial encounters over the Pacific. On June 4, according to U.S. defense officials, four long-range Russian Tu-95 Bear-H bombers, accompanied by an aerial refueling tanker, flew into the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone, an area extending 200 miles from the North American coast, off Alaska, where they were intercepted by U.S. F-22 fighter jets. Two of the Russian bombers peeled off and headed west, while the other two flew south and were identified by U.S. F-15 fighters within 50 miles of the California coast. Capt. Jeff Davis, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command, said it was the first time U.S. jets had intercepted Russian military aircraft off California since July 4, 2012. Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said it is believed the Russian planes were on a training mission. Davis said the Russian planes were entirely within their rights during the flight. ""They followed all the protocols, and it was a very professional encounter on both sides,"" he said. ""There was nothing that they were doing that was contrary to international law."" The Russian planes never entered U.S. territory proper, which by international law extends 13.8 miles (22.2 kilometers) from the U.S. coast. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, any aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zone, which extends 200 miles from the coasts of the United States and Canada, must file a flight plan indicating their intentions, must maintain radio contact with air controllers and must have an operational radar transponder. Davis said Russian flights into the air defense zone are intercepted about 10 times a year. But earlier this year, a top U.S. Air Force general said Russia was stepping up its military activities in the Asia-Pacific region as tensions increased over the Ukraine and Russia's move into Crimea. Gen. Herbert ""Hawk"" Carlisle, in a presentation to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, talked up the increased Russian activity. ""They've come with their long-range aviation off the coast of California; they circumnavigated Guam,"" Carlisle said, showing a picture of a U.S. F-15 fighter ""intercepting"" a Russian bomber off the Pacific island. Guam is home to Andersen Air Force Base, which has been used by the U.S. military for flights of B-2 and B-52 bombers across the Pacific. Flights around Japan and the Korean Peninsula have also ""increased drastically,"" as has naval activity in that area, Carlisle said. The confrontations aren't just near U.S. airspace. In April, a U.S. Air Force surveillance plane was buzzed by a Russian jet fighter while flying over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, U.S. military officials said. Describing the fly-by as ""straight out of a movie,"" one U.S. official said a Russian Su-27 fighter jet flew within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC-135U jet. The Russian aircraft turned and ""showed its belly"" to the U.S. crew so they could see it was armed with missiles, a U.S official said. Also in April, U.S. defense officials say, a Russian fighter jet made a dozen low-altitude passes over the USS Donald Cook, a U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer that was operating in the Black Sea. On April 28, a Russian Defense Ministry statement said Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu and U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had discussed both incidents during a phone call that day. In response, the statement said, Shoygu ""offered to instruct the commanders in chief of the armed forces of both countries to discuss possible additional measures to address the interests of both countries to prevent future misperceptions of actions."" On the other side of the world, F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands intercepted two Russian bombers in April. The Russian planes, which had come about a half-mile into Dutch airspace, were escorted out and then monitored by British planes as they flew north of Scotland. In a high-profile training mission of its own, the U.S. Air Force this week sent two of its top-of-the-line B-2 stealth bombers to an air base in Britain to conduct training operations. Three B-52 bombers were also sent from the U.S. on a two-week deployment to England, also for training purposes, according to an Air Force news release. U.S. sends B-2 stealth bombers to Europe .

"(CNN) -- A young woman stands against a crisp black backdrop. The photographer walks forward and gently turns her away from the camera. Today the focus is not on her face but on the delicate architectural feat that sits atop her head. It seems to almost defy gravity, with light radiating from the hair tower as it spirals upwards in a conical shape. Hairstyles have long been popular fashion statements for Nigerian women. But over the years, the intricate braiding and eye-catching sculptures have often reflected the country's changing sociopolitical times as well. And for the last six decades, one man made it his life's work to capture the complex refashioning of his homeland. In February, the renowned artist J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere died at his home in Lagos aged 84. He left behind a remarkable body of work, much of which is largely unknown outside Nigeria. But now, many of Ojeikere's countrymen are putting in a renewed effort to celebrate the life of the beloved artist -- through documentary films, exhibitions and an impressive monograph of work, Nigeria is presenting J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere to the world one last time. ""He started taking images of a nation that was in the throes of development [and] independence in 1960,"" explains Bisi Silva, the founder and director of the Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos. ""We discovered oil, money... modern buildings were going up. So he documented that process, that transition into a modernizing nation."" A final wish for a departed friend . Over the last five years, Silva has been working tirelessly to complete an extensive monograph on Ojeikere. This has not been yet another project for the art curator -- Ojeikere was a close friend, and the duo had been collaborating on the monograph up until his untimely passing in February. ""I had a very close relationship with 'Pa Ojeikere,' as we call him here,"" says Silva, who turned to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise funds for publishing the book. ""I used to speak to him at least once a week."" Silva recalls Ojeikere's passion and enthusiasm for the project and, holding it close to her heart, she says she's determined to finish what they had started together. ""He was really dynamic, really passionate about photography and there was so much to learn in his archive. Over the last five years, we became friends. He was like a father to me. ""It was just such a big shock that he passed away. That he wouldn't see the book he was extremely excited about."" Documenting independence . Born in a small rural village in West Nigeria in 1930, Ojeikere would become one of Nigeria's most celebrated artists. For over 60 years, the master photographer fastidiously immersed himself in capturing his homeland, documenting every facet of daily life. His many photographs would come together to create a striking anthropological study of Nigeria. The 1950s saw a young Ojeikere searching for a vocation. Rejected by the army, it was an uncle who inadvertently put him on a lifelong journey by suggesting photography. Starting small, the untrained amateur would photograph women in his village as they donned their Sunday best and headed to church. Later on, Ojeikere got a job as a darkroom assistant at the Nigerian Ministry of Information. When he wasn't working, he was often found at the local university, snapping moments between students, staff and events on campus -- once again capturing daily life on film. The country was moving toward a time of social change and political upheaval and Ojeikere explored this through his lens. ""You're getting a sort of history of Nigeria at a very important, transitional period, just on the cusp of independence,"" says Silva. ""And just after independence [in 1960], when there is a feeling of euphoria, feeling of liberation, the sense of 'now we can conquer the world, we can develop the nation; we are free, we are independent.' ""And this all comes out in the way in which individuals and people presented themselves. It's like: 'Look at me. I'm fashionable, I'm modern, I'm confident, I'm educated. I'm a professional.' All these images amount to a visual image of Nigeria in the 50s, 60s and 70s."" Not just hair . Ojeikere's next job was working for the national television station, a career move that enabled him to rub shoulders with other creative minds. This is when he started to take photographs with more artistic intent, explains Silva. ""He started coming into contact other artists, filmmakers, writers and that's why as he developed, the artistic intent as opposed to the anthropological intent began to develop. When we finally get to 'Hairstyles,' they are actually done in a very specific manner. It wasn't someone on the street. It was in a studio with a specific lighting, with a specific position."" The ""Hairstyles"" series, for which he is so critically acclaimed, features over 1,000 photographs of Nigerian styles since 1954. But for Silva, his work documenting traditional Nigerian headgear and the country's architecture, as well as his studio portrait work, must be examined alongside ""Hairstyles"" to fully comprehend Ojeikere's legacy. The images communicate a transition from the normal photographs depicting Africa, says Silva. ""The images we are used to seeing of Africa -- they gave a one dimensional perspective of a race, of a nation, of a people. It's been a herculean work to bring this publication together."" Final tributes . Silva's monograph is just one tribute to Ojeikere. Nigerian filmmaker Tam Fiofori recently released ""J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere: Master Photographer,"" a documentary capturing the final year of the artist's life. Elsewhere, an exhibition of ""Hairstyles"" is currently shown across the UK. Curated by Gillian Fox, it is the first time audiences in the country are having the chance to view Nigeria from this perspective. ""As a Nigerian, he wanted to document that moment in Nigeria when it was a time of colonial rule changing over to democracy,"" says Fox. ""He was keen in the wake of modernization to capture something that was quite intrinsic to his culture, his nation and he saw the rate of change that was happening and he thought hairstyles were fascinating and an art form in their own right,"" she continues. ""They were something that should be preserved because the thing about a hairstyle is that they are really ephemeral."" She adds: ""I think it was a love letter to his country. He used photography which is a very modern medium to document these moments of social change.""

"After 37 years, Exodus International, an organization whose mission was to ""help"" gay Christians become straight, is shutting down. But not before issuing an apology. ""We're not negating the ways God used Exodus to positively affect thousands of people, but a new generation of Christians is looking for change -- and they want to be heard,"" Tony Moore, an Exodus board member, said Wednesday. The announcement comes less than a day after Exodus issued a wide-ranging apology to the gay community for ""years of undue judgment by the organization and the Christian Church as a whole,"" a statement from the group says. ""Exodus is an institution in the conservative Christian world, but we've ceased to be a living, breathing organism,"" said Alan Chambers, the president of Exodus. ""For quite some time, we've been imprisoned in a worldview that's neither honoring toward our fellow human beings, nor biblical."" Chambers, who has a wife and children and previously identified as gay, has acknowledged that he has ""ongoing same-sex attractions."" Granderson: Oops, I left my sexual orientation at home . ""It is strange to be someone who has both been hurt by the Church's treatment of the LGBTQ community, and also to be someone who must apologize for being part of the very system of ignorance that perpetuated that hurt,"" Chambers said. ""Today it is as if I've just woken up to a greater sense of how painful it is to be a sinner in the hands of an angry church."" LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning. California law banning gay 'conversion therapy' put on hold . New focus on a therapy . Exodus, which has promoted ""freedom from homosexuality through the power of Jesus Christ,"" has de-emphasized conversion therapy in recent years as more of the counselors in its network have abandoned the practice. The American Psychological Association defines conversion therapy as aimed at changing sexual orientation, but adopted a resolution in 2009 condemning the practice. In it, the organization said ""mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments."" But the same resolution also encouraged therapists to consider the religious beliefs of clients who say such beliefs are important to their views of homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1975. But yet with the apology, some things have not changed, according to Chambers. ""I cannot apologize for my deeply held biblical beliefs about the boundaries I see in scripture surrounding sex, but I will exercise my beliefs with great care and respect for those who do not share them,"" he said.  ""I cannot apologize for my beliefs about marriage. But I do not have any desire to fight you on your beliefs or the rights that you seek."" Conversion therapist: Lawsuit won't stop us . A new ministry . With the closing of Exodus International, the board of directors voted to begin a new and separate ministry called Reduce Fear. ""This is a new season of ministry, to a new generation,"" Chambers said. ""Our goals are to reduce fear, and come alongside churches to become safe, welcoming and mutually transforming communities."" It's meant to align with Jesus' New Testament message found in John 13:34 -- ""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another."" ""From a Judeo-Christian perspective, gay, straight or otherwise, we're all prodigal sons and daughters,"" Chambers said.  ""Exodus International is the prodigal's older brother, trying to impose its will on God's promises, and make judgments on who's worthy of His Kingdom. ""God is calling us to be the Father -- to welcome everyone, to love unhindered."" Gay men sue counselors who promised to make them straight .","Exodus International promoted ""freedom from homosexuality"" through ""power of Jesus Christ""

"(CNN)Jordan has executed two imprisoned jihadists in retaliation for the murder of its pilot, Lt Moaz al-Kassasbeh, by ISIS. The executions follow Jordan's initial agreement to release one of the jihadists, Sajida al-Rishawi -- a demand made by the group through a video statement by one of its Japanese hostages -- in return for the pilot. The release of a gruesome video by ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, on February 4, showing al-Kassasbeh being burnt alive triggered the Jordanian decision to carry out the executions few hours later. In doing so, Jordan has dragged itself deeper into the Syrian conflict and exposed further weaknesses in the strategy followed by the U.S.-led international coalition set up to fight ISIS. Neither of the jihadists executed by Jordan are connected with ISIS in its current incarnation, but with al Qaeda. For example, one of them is Ziad Karbuli, an Iraqi national linked with the late al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and who had been detained in Jordan on death row since 2006. Through their execution, therefore, Jordan has inadvertently strengthened the link between ISIS and al Qaeda. This is significant because the two groups have been engaged in a battle over resources and legitimacy since the start of the Syrian conflict. ISIS has been trying to present itself as the ""true"" al Qaeda, causing the latter to increase its military activities worldwide as well as within Syria to affirm its influence. Despite initial condemnation of the brutality of ISIS, al Qaeda's Syrian offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra has recently begun engaging in similar activities itself, such as beheadings and other forms of public violence. One reason behind this is that al-Nusra has felt upstaged by the Islamic State and has escalated its violent acts in order to assert its presence in the face of its rival. But another reason is that the actions of the international coalition set up to fight ISIS have pushed the two groups together. The coalition airstrikes in Syria have targeted both ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, thereby presenting the groups with a common enemy. The Syrian regime's attacks on ISIS following the organization's advance in Iraq in June 2014 also shifted the position of ISIS away from the regime, aligning the organization with Jabhat al-Nusra, which still regards fighting the Assad regime as its primary objective. In the Qalamoun area bordering Syria and Lebanon, ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra have begun cooperating against the Syrian regime and Hezbollah. The coalition's mediocre support for the moderate Syrian opposition in southern areas of Syria not only contributed to the Free Syrian Army's vulnerability to attack by al-Nusra brigades but also pushed some members of the two entities to maintain a working relationship based on material necessity and backed by sharing the mutual goal of fighting the Assad regime. Today, several towns along Syria's south-western border witness al-Nusra presence. In the north, a number of towns have shifted their alliance from al-Nusra to ISIS due to a number of reasons, from fear to coercion to seeking material gains. Now that ISIS and al-Nusra have been pushed towards one another even more as a result of the Jordanian executions, a similar shift of allegiance is likely in southern Syrian towns as well. If that were to happen, Jordan, which has borders with southern Syria, would find itself with ISIS on its doorstep overnight. This bears bad news for the coalition. The south is where the Free Syrian Army retains more control than anywhere else in Syria, and where the coalition is planning on empowering the moderate opposition through training and weapons provision. Being confronted with ISIS in the area derails this plan. The presence of ISIS in the south would also push Jordan to escalate the level of its engagement in the Syrian conflict. It will be forced to change from a supporter of its patrons, the United States and Saudi Arabia, in their fights against ISIS and into a participant in frontline warfare with the organization. This will in turn trigger further entrenchment by not just those two countries but also other members of the coalition in the war as they scramble to aid their Jordanian ally in its fight against ISIS. Such a development would heighten the reactive nature of the coalition's strategy towards ISIS. Jordan's executions have already demonstrated that countries within the coalition do not have a uniform strategy for dealing with hostage crises and act singularly and in haste. All this is playing into the hands of ISIS, which has been calculating its moves carefully -- the Jordanian pilot had been executed weeks before, Jordanian authorities believe, during which time it had been fooling the Jordanian government by demanding the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, in a build-up towards the final planned humiliation that came with the release of evidence of al-Kassasbeh's murder. Jordan's revenge, then, marks a major shift in the war against the Islamic State. It is a shift that is likely to change the nature of the actors in the Syrian conflict as ISIS and al-Nusra move closer to one another. It is also a shift that will trigger wider regional repercussions, and drag members of the anti-ISIS coalition into an open-ended confrontation on a wider scale than before. In the midst of all this, the moderate Syrian opposition risks becoming extinct. The international coalition therefore simply cannot afford to continue to act in the Syrian conflict without having in place a harmonized, long-term, and proactive strategy that takes into account the urgent need to end the conflict through a political-military plan rather than a reactive one based on irrational retaliation and limited military activity.","Jordan's execution of two jihadists will strengthen link between ISIS and al Qaeda, says Lina Khatib .

"(CNN)A powerful 7.4-magnitude quake shook the Pacific coast of Central America on Tuesday, causing some damage and killing at least one person in El Salvador. The quake was deep (70.5 kilometers or 43 miles) but close to El Salvador's shoreline -- about 64 kilometers from the municipality of Intipuca. El Salvador's Ministry of Weather and Natural Resources initially issued a tsunami warning for the coastal regions, saying the quake was felt throughout the country. It later downgraded it to a tsunami alert. What to know about earthquakes . The mayor of San Miguel tweeted some photos that showed light structural damage to the local hospital.

"(CNN)In Japan's Sagano Bamboo Forest, on the outskirts of Kyoto, towering green stalks of the famously versatile plant sway in the wind, creaking eerily they collide and twist, leaves rustling. The sun filters through the densely packed grove, projecting thin slashes of light onto the dozens of camera-clutching tourists shuffling down the wide trail that cuts through the middle of the forest as they awkwardly angle their shots, attempting to crop human forms out of their frames. Long gone are the days when you'd get this place to yourself. If you've ever clicked on a rundown of ""places to see before you die"" or a compilation of the most beautiful forests in the world, chances are you've seen a photo of Sagano. Located in the gorgeous Arashiyama district of western Kyoto, the Sagano Bamboo Forest's popularity has expanded in recent years, coinciding with the growing number of Buzzfeed-esque articles that include it on superlative-heavy travel lists. Though it's the beauty of the bamboo that brings in the masses, those distinct rustling sounds have become an attraction in their own right. A few years ago the Ministry of Environment included the Sagano Bamboo Forest on its list of ""100 Soundscapes of Japan"" -- a selection of everyday noises intended to encourage locals to stop and enjoy nature's music. For the best experience, head out early in the morning or late evening and avoid weekends completely, when Japanese day-trippers descend on the area -- especially in the fall and spring. (There's no admission fee and it's open 24/7.) A 'major' temple and a film star's former home . Right outside the Bamboo Forest entrance is the northern gate of Tenryu-ji Temple (open daily, 8:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m., admission 500 yen, about $5),  a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Kyoto-gozan -- five major temples of Kyoto. This is no coincidence. In Japan, Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples are often situated near bamboo groves, which are viewed as a clever means of warding off evil, while the bamboo is seen as a symbol of strength. Built in the 14th century by a shogun in honor of the passing of Japan's emperor, Tenryu-ji has one of the country's most incredible Zen gardens and is today the headquarters of the Rinzai School of Zen Buddhism. At the other end of the Bamboo Forest trail sits Okochi-Sanso Villa (open daily, 9 a.m.-4 p.m., admission 1,000 yen), the former home of late silent film star Denjiro Okochi. A massive complex of gardens with plants and trees that are famed for catering to all four seasons, there's also a temple, study, tea hut and museum highlighting the life of Denjiro. Exploring Arashiyama . The bamboo forest and its bookend attractions of Tenryu-ji and Okochi-Sanso Villa may be the stars of the area for international tourism crowds, but the entire Arashiyama district is worth exploring. With its low-lying tree-covered mountains that tumble into the Hozu River, historic temples and charming streets, Arashiyama has been designated a National Historic Site and Place of Scenic Beauty by Japan. It's been attracting moneyed locals since the 8th century, when vacationing aristocratic families visited to check out the changing seasons' colors and go boating on the Hozu River. Today, one of the top ways to enjoy the natural beauty of the area is by hopping on the Sagano Scenic Railway -- also known as the Sagano Romantic Train. A retro-style steam train that runs seven kilometers along the Hozu River, it departs once every hour from the Sagano Torokko Station -- a short walk from the JR Arashiyama Sagano Station -- daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Wednesdays. (The train shuts down from December 30-February 28.) The entire ride takes less than 30 minutes. Afterwards, many opt to hop on the bus that connects the train station to the river, where Hozu River Boat Rides depart for the two-hour, 16-kilometer trip  from Kameoka back to Arashiyama. Boats run daily from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., with reduced hours from December 1-March 1. Private charters are available. On land, bike rentals are among the best ways to explore Arashiyama's web of temples, shrines, restaurants and gift shops. The area's main icon, however, is the Togetsukyo Bridge (Moon Crossing Bridge), which flows over the Hozu River. Built during Japan's Heian Period (794-1185), when Kyoto was Japan's capital, it was reconstructed in the 1930s. Here, Japanese tourists can be seen posing for photos while dressed in colorful kimonos -- a nod to Kyoto's status as the cultural capital of Japan. After all that touring, a pit stop at one of the many soft-serve ice cream stands is a fine way to end the day -- the vanilla/green tea twists are particularly addictive. Arashiyama sidetracks . The Arashiyama crowds can get annoying, but the fantastic Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple is oddly overlooked by most tourists as it's a bit more remote than most of the district's attractions. About a 30-minute walk from the Sagano Bamboo Forest, it features over 1,000 little stone rakan (statues of enlightened ones) made from 1981 to 1991 during the reconstruction of the temple. Some laugh joyfully. Most pose serenely, covered in a green layer of moss. The odd one holds a tennis racket. On weekdays, the lovely uphill walk from the Sagano Bamboo Forest to Otagi Nenbutsu-ji is also surprisingly tourist-free yet full of unique gift shops -- including one owned by an artist who creates his works out of silk worm cocoons -- a massive traditional torii gate, tea rooms and private residences. If the kids are crying out for something a bit more lively, up on Mount Arashiyama sits the Iwatayama Monkey Park, home to some 100 Japanese macaques. What's cool about this place is that it's the humans who are in the cage, and the monkeys -- which you can feed -- on the outside. Getting in/where to stay . From Kyoto Station, take Kyoto City Bus #28 or Kyoto Bus #71, #72, #73, or take the JR Sagano Line to Saga Arashiyama station. From downtown Kyoto, take City Bus #28 or #11. For trains, take the Keifuku Arashiyama Line to Arashiyama Station. For private tours of Arashiyama, Virtuoso-affiliated Windows to Japan offers an excellent western Kyoto itinerary that includes the highlights of the area. For those who want more than a day trip, the top hotel in Arashiyama is luxury ryokan Hoshinoya Kyoto, which can only be reached by ferry. Rates from 20,400 yen per person/night.

"As investigators search for clues to what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the answer to one question may prove key: Why did the transponder in the Boeing 777-200ER stop transmitting information? The fact that it happened at all is astonishing to John Nance, a broadcast aviation analyst and veteran pilot. ""It is hard to conceive of a situation in which a triple seven would lose all ability to have its transponder on and the crew would not find some way to communicate,"" he told CNN. A senior Malaysian air force official said Tuesday that the plane traveled hundreds of miles in the opposite direction from its original destination, and had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared from radar screens. Suggestions that the plane veered off course and that its transponder was not working raise questions about a hijacking, but a catastrophic power failure or other problem might also explain the anomalies, analysts said. Here are some of the options: . Turned off intentionally . Kit Darby, a longtime pilot, said Tuesday it was not clear whether the transponder was turned off intentionally. A power failure would have turned off the main transponder and its backup, and the plane could have flown for more than an hour with such a power failure, the president of Aviation Information Resources told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. But Nance expressed doubt that that could have been the case. The electrical system aboard the plane is so robust and the transponder draws so little power that it would be one of the last pieces of equipment to go dark, even after a catastrophic event like an engine explosion or a breach of the cabin and rapid decompression, he said. ""I'm in a head-scratching mode,"" Nance said. ""The most likely probability is that a human hand turned that off. Then you get into the logic tree of who and why and there aren't that many channels in that tree."" He added, ""This is beginning to look very, very much like a hijacking."" A former Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector agreed. David Soucie, author of ""Why Planes Crash,"" cited the redundant electrical, charging, battery and communications systems on Boeing 777s. Much had to go wrong for the aircraft to lose its transponder and then to veer off course, he said, adding that it stands to reason ""that someone forced those pilots to take control of the aircraft and take it off course."" Turning off a transponder requires a deliberative process, said Peter Goelz, former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. ""If someone did that in the cockpit, they were doing it to disguise the route of the plane,"" he told CNN. ""There might still be mechanical explanations on what was going on, but those mechanical explanations are narrowing quickly."" Questions and answers . 'Patchy' radar . Alastair Rosenschein suggested that a pressurization problem may have been to blame. If the plane lost pressure and the pilots failed to don their masks within a few seconds, ""they would become unconscious,"" the aviation consultant and former British Airways Boeing 747 pilot told CNN. ""The aircraft would continue on the last heading."" If that happened, the plane may have crashed in the middle of the Indian Ocean, nowhere near where the search is going on, he noted. How does he explain the loss of the transponder signal? ""It is possible that, even with the transponder putting out a signal, the radar controllers didn't notice it, pay attention to it or receive it,"" he speculated. That would be rare, he acknowledged, but so too is the disappearance of a jetliner. And radar is ""pretty patchy"" around there, he said. The transponder broke . The mechanics of the device may have been at fault, said Kirk Fryar, president of Sarasota Avionics, which sells the devices. ""They're not supposed to break, but they do break,"" he told CNN. ""Sometimes the transponder itself could be off frequency, not sending the right pulse."" The boxes are located in the cockpit, within reach of the pilot, copilot or both, he said. Each is equipped with an on, standby or off mode. And there is often more than one. ""Boeing would have at least two transponders,"" he said. ""What happens is sometimes you're flying along and, say, your transponder breaks and reports the wrong code or wrong altitude, air traffic control will go, 'You need to turn it off because we're getting erroneous readings,'"" he said. And, if one were to break, the pilot or copilot would have to flip a switch to replace it, something that a pilot stressed during an emergency might not do. An antenna malfunction may also have been to blame, but that would be unlikely on a Boeing, which undergoes routine maintenance checks, Fryar said. See more of our coverage on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 . Flying below the radar . Flying below the line of sight of the air traffic controller is another way for a transponder to stop identifying a plane. ""The higher you are, the better sensitivity you're going to have to air traffic control,"" he said. That would be improbable during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, the itinerary that the Boeing jet was on when it fell off radar early Saturday. He too cited the possibility that it was turned off intentionally. Why might that have happened? To escape detection. Fryar recounted when he and his flying instructor flew into airspace over Denver without having communicated with air traffic control. ""He goes, 'Oh, my God, we're going to get in trouble,' flew 500 feet off the ground, turned off the transponder. They can't find you, basically."" Thirty miles later, he switched it back on and the two completed their flight without incident. CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Tom Fuentes said Tuesday he was not persuaded by any of the theories: ""There's still as many possibilities out there, maybe more, now that we know about the transponders being off and the length of time that plane flew in the air without them. It still leaves mechanical, terrorism (and) other issues as much in the air as they were before."" History . Transponders have been around since World War II and commonly used in general aviation since the late 1960s, said Fryar. It supplemented military radar, which was unreliable -- unable to distinguish a flock of birds from a plane, he said. A transponder for use in general aviation would typically cost from $2,000 to $7,000; versus $20,000-$30,000 for a commercial airliner. There's nothing fancy about the technology. An air traffic controller sends out a radar sweep that contains a microwave pulse requesting information; the transponder decodes the request and sends back that information -- identity of the aircraft, its location, altitude and speed. Primer: . Q. What information does a transponder send, and who does it send it to? A transponder is a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar. When the transponder receives a signal from a more sophisticated ground ""secondary"" radar, it returns a squawk code with the aircraft's position, its altitude and its call sign. It is constantly being radar pinged, helping air traffic controllers on the ground determine the airplane's speed and direction, too. Q. What does ""squawk"" mean? It's a four-digit identifying code that the pilot enters into a transponder for each flight. It helps air traffic control recognize each plane. Q. Why are transponders necessary? Primary radar is more basic, effective only at seeing the radar reflection of objects. It paints targets, displaying them with a blip on a screen. The bigger the object, the bigger the reflection. Transponders enhance the reflected signal and provide the additional information for air traffic control. Q. Is there a way to use it to indicate a problem on board the aircraft? There are codes for different emergencies. For a hijacking, it's 7500. For communications failure, 7600. Emergencies are 7700. Q. How do you turn off a transponder? There is a switch that you would move from ""ON"" or ""SBY"" (standby) or ""ALT"" (altitude). You could also pull the circuit breaker for the transponder in the cockpit. Q. Why would you turn off a transponder during a normal flight? There could be several reasons. One reason could be when airplanes get close to each other (perhaps they are approaching an airport). Air traffic controllers may then request pilots to turn the transponders off or to standby. Also, if the transponder is sending faulty information, the pilot might want to turn it off. Planes are still visible on primary radar until they get below the radar's coverage ability.","""This is beginning to look very, very much like a hijacking,"" says John Nance .

Transponders: ""They're not supposed to break, but they do break"""
"It's not often you get insight into a destination from a heavy metal band, but in Debrecen, Hungary's second city, locals are used to having to make a noise to get heard. ""We've got to go to the Roncsbar,"" Debrecen enthusiast Nora Erdei tells me after a day touring the city's rich historical sites (Roncsbar, Csapo utca 27, Debrecen; +36 52 688 050). Just off the historic center, Roncsbar is a pub and live music venue masquerading as a junk shop filled with pre-loved sofas and a ceiling hung with hundreds of retired cymbals shimmering like fish scales. It has the atmosphere of a student party in an old building that's waiting to be renovated -- or very possibly demolished. Roncs is owned by Hungary's best known heavy metal band, Tankcsapda. Sometimes referred to as the ""Hungarian Metallica,"" the band has taken an international music genre and -- through lyrics, album covers, and an annual New Year party-concert -- made it all about their home city. It's perhaps fitting that Tankcsapda should be seen as ambassadors for Debrecen -- the city sometimes needs a few power chords and pounding bass lines to get noticed. ""Foreigners think that Hungary is Budapest and there's nothing else,"" is a familiar refrain on Debrecen's streets. Hungary's backup capital . Debrecen has, at times, been more important than the current seat of power, with locals claiming it takes over in times of trouble. That doesn't quite add up. Debrecen has survived 13th-century Mongol invasions, the Black Death, 150 years of struggle against the Ottomans, numerous conflicts and the turmoil of communism and still only briefly been the country's capital twice. It took the helm once after a short-lived revolution in 1849 and for a second time at the end of World War II. Today, Debrecen may not be well known to tourists, but that only adds to the charm of this relaxed university city. It's a small place; the historical center is sized for strolling and regular cafe stops. The bizarrely elegant, stuffed-crocodile-decorated Croco Cafe in the art nouveau Hotel Aranybika (Piac utca 11-15, Debrecen; +36 20 363 6121) is a good place to pre-load with coffee before tackling the vertiginous stairs of the west tower of the Great Reformed Church (Piac utca, Debrecen; +36 52 412 694). From the tower there's a grand overview of Debrecen and and the surrounding area -- a vast sea of grassland stretching across the Carpathian Basin. These are the rich grazing lands that the horse-powered Magyar tribes from the east settled in the ninth century and which their descendants, the Hungarians, have raised livestock on ever since. Architectural mash-up . There's also a view of Debrecen's mix of architectural styles, the legacy of frequent devastating fires that back in the 19th century led the city's students to form one of Europe's first-ever fire brigades. Also visible from the rooftops are traditional weather cocks with Islamic star and crescent moon symbols that once advertised to Ottoman invaders that the city preferred trading to fighting. Trade meant that craftsmen prospered and Debrecen became famous for -- among other things -- hats, clay pipes (in the early 19th century 10 million were reportedly made a year, with thousands bought for Britain's navy) and fine foods. Back on the ground, perhaps fueled by cake or famed ice cream made with real fruit on the terrace of the Gara Cukraszda cafe (Kalvin ter 6, Debrecen; +36 52 530 460), it's possible to explore more of the city's student life, past and present. In the 500-year-old Reformed College of Debrecen (Kalvin ter 16, Debrecen; +36 52 516 856), the current crop of undergraduates can be contrasted with exhibits celebrating the lives of their 17th- and 18th-century forbears. Here visitors can view a reconstruction of one of the city's early printing presses and explore the soaring library, with more than half a million books set amid serene green colonnades and soaring galleries. Glass and concrete . Nearby, MODEM (Baltazar Dezso ter 1, Debrecen; +36 52 525 010) is an ultra-modern gallery with stark and curved glass and concrete walls. A winter showing here of challenging works by cutting-edge Chinese artists has just given way to a summer-long exhibition of paintings depicting Hungarian grasslands and herder traditions. A tram ride connects Debrecen to Nagyerdo Park, a huge forest that's home to Aquaticum (Nagyerdei Park 1,  Debrecen; +36 52 514 174), a thermal spa and pleasure-baths complex that in August takes advantage of its nine-meter-high spiral and its open kamikaze slides to host the Hungarian National Water-Chute Championship. Debrecen hosts its yearly flower parade and carnival this year August 15-20 -- the event dates to a cycling meet in 1900 when floral decorations got more attention than the riders. It was revived in 1969, minus the pedalers, and now uses 3 million blooms to dress themed floats parading along three miles of decorated streets. 'Double sausage' Throughout the year, Debrecen hosts festivals dedicated to folk and choral music, poetry, gymnastics, jazz and ""stuffed dishes."" At the 17th-century Old Post House Hotel (Szechenyi utca 6, Debrecen; +36 52 325 325), the accommodation is reassuringly 21st century, but there's timeless evening entertainment with traditional czardas dance-house music played by a trio in the cellar bar. For breakfast the hotel offers the dauntingly named, and just as dauntingly sized, ""Debrecen double sausage."" With hundreds of years as a livestock market serving a farming hinterland Debrecen has always been about food, and not all of it sausage shaped. The highly ranked Ikon Restaurant (Piac utca 23, Debrecen; +36 30 55 57766) is another example of the city's ability to combine the local and the cosmopolitan. After working in leading UK restaurants, chef Peter Pataky returned to Debrecen to build on his family's traditional recipes. For his ""20 Mile Menu"" he uses ingredients sourced from within the stated distance -- terrain that encompasses the pasture lands of Hortobagy and the livestock that Debrecen's wealth was built on.

The three opinions include one from October 2011 by U.S. District Judge John Bates, who scolded government lawyers that the NSA had, for the third time in less than three years, belatedly acknowledged it was collecting more data than it was legally allowed to. ""NSA acquires valuable information through its upstream collection, but not without substantial intrusions on Fourth Amendment protected interests,"" Bates wrote. The focus of the opinion was the government's admission that for three years, under its authority to monitor foreign communications, it had been collecting information beyond what it gets from Internet service providers, and included data that was entirely domestic. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court estimated the mistaken collection of domestic data, including e-mails and other Internet activity of Americans, totaled 58,000 communications a year. Report: NSA can see 75% of U.S. web messages . The NSA said the collection was a mistake that went beyond its authority under Section 702 of the Patriot Act. ""This was a situation where there was technological problem that could not be avoided, rather than any overreach"" by the NSA, according to a senior intelligence official who spoke with reporters about the matter. The other FISA Court opinions from November 2011 and September 2012 covered NSA steps to fix errors it made in over-collecting data and to purge data it shouldn't have collected. Those rulings indicated that the matter had been resolved. The overall issue, the intelligence official said, was immediately raised with the court. ""The FISA court probed deeply and thoroughly into the issue. The government took strong appropriate steps to remedy the problem, and the court determined it had remedied and that the collection could continue,"" according to the official who did not speak for attribution. ""This is not an egregious overreaching by a greedy agency seeking to spy on Americans,"" the official added. NSA admits 'mistakes' amid criticism after audit show is broke privacy rules . The administration also released documents provided to Congress to persuade lawmakers to reauthorize its surveillance authorities. The agency has come under pressure from lawmakers of both parties over the sweeping nature of its secret data collection, most recently surveillance that captures  telephone metadata related to communications to and from the United States. That program and the one addressed in the document release on Wednesday were brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the United States and is now in Russia under temporary asylum. He faces espionage charges. Their exposure also has generated concern from privacy groups and libertarians. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, who has proposed legislation aimed at reforming certain provisions of the Patriot Act related to the FISA Court, welcomed the newest development. ""Today's release of documents by the Director of National Intelligence begins to appropriately draw back the curtain on the secret law of government surveillance, and they also underscore the need for increased oversight and stronger protections for Americans' privacy,"" he said in a statement. Leahy is planning a hearing in coming weeks on the document release. In 2008, the NSA began collecting what it called ""upstream"" communications, essentially information that travels across the Internet, separate from the what it receives from Internet service providers that filter data to respond to agency requests. The NSA is supposed to be targeting foreign communications, such as e-mail addresses it believes relate to foreign intelligence, that have to do with potential terrorism investigations. The NSA said it made mistakes because of the way data was collected. It couldn't separate information that was entirely domestic. Government lawyers won approval from the court after making changes and later deleted years of data because some of it couldn't be separated from domestic communications.

"Bob Hoskins, the pugnacious British actor known for playing gangsters, tough guys and working-class gentlemen in such films as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""Mermaids,"" has died, publicist Clair Dobbs said Wednesday. Hoskins was 71. His passing comes nearly two years after he retired from acting following a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Hoskins was perhaps best known for 1988's live-action and animation hybrid ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" In the comedy, he played detective Eddie Valiant, who hates ""toons"" -- cartoon figures who live in a separate showbiz world bordering Valiant's 1940s Los Angeles -- and takes up the task of proving the innocence of the cartoon title character, accused of murder. The film was the second-highest grossing movie of 1988, after ""Rain Man."" He followed the turn with performances in a variety of films, including 1991's ""Hook"" in which he played Smee, the pirate assistant of Captain Hook; 1995's ""Nixon"" as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover; and 2001's ""Last Orders"" as the gambler friend of protagonist Michael Caine, whose pals gather to spread his ashes after his death. Hoskins was nominated for an Oscar for 1986's ""Mona Lisa"" as a cabdriver who establishes a relationship with a high-priced call girl. Caine was also in the film. Hoskins won both a BAFTA and Golden Globe for his performance. Robert Hoskins was born on October 26, 1942, in Bury St. Edmunds, England, the only child of a bookkeeper and a cook. He dropped out of school at 15 and took jobs as a truck driver and window cleaner, among others, before falling into acting by accident: A friend was auditioning for a part and Hoskins, who was waiting nearby, was asked to try out. A natural, he got the role. ""I fit into this business like a sore foot into a soft shoe,"" he told the UK paper The Telegraph in 2009. In Britain, he gained fame for his performance as a Depression-era song-plugger in Dennis Potter's miniseries ""Pennies From Heaven,"" later turned into a 1980 movie starring Steve Martin. Though he had a handful of recognizable roles in films after ""Pennies"" -- including 1980's ""The Long Good Friday,"" 1982's ""Pink Floyd the Wall"" and 1985's ""Brazil"" (in which he played a gleefully malevolent repairman), it wasn't until ""Roger Rabbit"" that he broke through to mainstream American audiences. That film drove him a bit nuts, he told The Telegraph. ""I think I went a bit mad while working on that. Lost my mind. The voice of the rabbit was there just behind the camera all the time,"" he recalled. ""The trouble was, I had learnt how to hallucinate. My daughter had an invisible friend called Jeffrey and I played with her and this invisible friend until one day I actually saw the friend."" It was his daughter, however, who set him straight. ""My daughter, when I came back from filming in San Francisco, she said 'Dad, slow down, slow down. You're going barmy, mate.' And I was."" Always a steady and straightforward worker -- no ""Method acting"" for Hoskins -- he appeared in at least one production every year from 1972 until his retirement in 2012. ""There's two things I love about this business. One's acting and the other one's getting paid for it,"" he told the UK paper The Guardian in 2007. ""The rest of it is a mystery to me."" In one of his last roles, he played the elf Muir in 2012's ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" In the 2011 TV miniseries and Peter Pan prequel ""Neverland,"" he played Smee -- a character he had portrayed in ""Hook."" But true to his working-class roots -- The Telegraph described his natural voice as ""cockney as jellied eels"" -- he hated to put on airs. ""I met a little old fella in Regent's Park when I was walking a character around. He said, 'You are who you are, ain't you?' and I said, 'Yeah, I am who I am.' And he said, 'That's good. I grow roses,' "" Hoskins recalled. ""And we sat talking about roses all afternoon. It was wonderful."" Hoskins is survived by his wife, Linda Banwell, and four children.

"(CNN)Concierge requests are typically predictable: tickets to a show, flowers, artisanal chocolates. But some guests demand a truly outlandish hotel experience. The ability to fulfill those peculiar requests separates the professional concierge from just the schmoes who work at the desk. Life-size statue replicas in chocolate . Michael Romei, chief concierge of the Towers of the Waldorf Astoria New York, has seen various paranormal concierge requests during his tenure of 20-plus years. He most vividly remembers the Australian couple crazy about candy. They wanted near life-size statues of themselves for their wedding -- made out of chocolate. ""The pastry chef at the Waldorf had only their photographs to work with,"" Romei says. It took several months and ""several emails back and forth"" to get the statues' dimensions just right. Camels . At the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort in Tucson, Arizona, lead concierge Victoria Cote was on the first month of her job when a guest asked where he could purchase two camels. Refusing to get her rookie feathers ruffled, she located a dealer 35 minutes from the hotel. The guest went to view the camels but decided against purchasing them, citing ""a missing hump."" Kobe beef for the dog . At the St. Ermin's Hotel in Westminster, London, a guest requested a daily supply of Kobe beef fillet for his dog. The concierge team bought and couriered the steaks from a nearby restaurant daily. Two 150-gram Kobe beef steaks retail for roughly $50 in England. Unicorn . At the Hotel Indigo in Asheville, North Carolina, a guest asked for a unicorn to be waiting in his room upon arrival. Concierge Katie Brown purchased a unicorn plush toy and drafted a cheeky but amiable note as a special surprise: . ""Beloved Guest, . ""We saw your request for a unicorn. Unfortunately this is the wrong season. Due to their migratory habits, unicorns currently inhabit the second star to the right of twilight. ""They are expected to return to Asheville sometime this June. ""In the meantime (as Asheville is known among many circles as the Unicorn Capital of the South), we hope that you can accept this very accurate artist rendition of our native fauna. ""If this is unacceptable, we do profusely apologize. As you are not the first guest to express interest in our local wildlife, we have planned a meeting with the head unicorn, Lord Mangus Biffy of the Rainbows on perhaps adjusting his peoples/horses/mythical creatures move to somewhere outside the universe to better align with our guest wishes. ""Our sincerest apologies, . ""The Society of Proper and Right Unicorn Caretaking."" 'Hangover' party . When a Fortune 500 company contacted Vegas Luxury Group VIP to help them throw a ""Hangover""-inspired party, the concierge service got them a great rate on the same suite used in the movie. Added to the mix were savvy bartenders, a DJ and various related characters: a 250-pound guy in a baby suit, two people in tiger costumes, a Mike Tyson lookalike, people in togas and others dressed as characters from the ""Wolf Pack."" Scattering dog ashes in the sea . An elderly woman contacted the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu to ask if she could scatter her dog's ashes in the sea. Concierge Bert Momotomi spoke to the woman and discovered her beloved pooch, Aloha Pumehaha, who had been born in Honolulu, had recently passed away. Local canoe and charter boat clubs proved too pricey. Then, Atlantis Submarines agreed to take the lady out to sea during their last shuttle to the sub and at no cost. Momotomi escorted the woman and helped her scatter the dog's ashes in the ocean. ""I had obtained a lei from our lei-making instructor and we prayed together as we tossed the lei into the ocean,"" Momotomi says. ""It was extremely gratifying to help this woman who had tears rolling down her face with her dream of bringing Aloha Pumehana home."" Mariachi band proposal on Golden Gate Bridge . At the Kenwood Inn and Spa in Sonoma, California, a gentleman wanted to partially recreate his first date with his girlfriend -- listening to a mariachi band at a Mexican restaurant -- so he could pop the question, on bended knee, in the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge. With security at an all-time high -- it was shortly after 9/11 -- chief concierge Eric Edenfield had to sneak seven guys onto the bridge walking in opposite directions, have them put on their sombreros in the middle of the bridge, pull out their instruments and play a tune while the man kneeled. ""It caused quite a stir on the bridge that day,"" says Edenfield. ""She did say yes, thankfully, but it was one of the hardest requests I've ever been asked to fulfill."" Custom fingerprint art . At the Four Seasons Resort The Biltmore in Santa Barbara, California, senior concierge Katie Allan was faced with an irate guest whose wedding centerpiece -- a custom fingerprint artwork -- hadn't arrived in the mail. The wedding was hours away. ""In a few hours, the concierge found an artist and had a courier pick up the appropriate canvas and paints,"" says Allan. ""The artist created artwork similar to the original -- the team had to blow dry the canvas to ensure the paint dried in time."" Originally published March 2014, updated March 9, 2015.

"(CNN) -- FoxNews.com alerted the Secret Service on Monday about the apparent hacking of its Twitter feed for political news, after the feed was used to falsely report that President Obama was killed. Jeff Misenti, Fox News Digital's vice president and general manager, said in a statement that the website has also requested ""a detailed investigation from Twitter about how this occurred, and measures to prevent future unauthorized access into FoxNews.com accounts."" Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie said Monday that his agency ""will be investigating the matter and will conduct the appropriate follow up."" The false tweets were taken down from the site after being up for hours. One of the tweets from @FoxNewsPolitics said Obama was ""shot twice at a Ross' restaurant in Iowa while campaigning. RIP Obama, best regards to the Obama family."" ""We wish @joebiden the best of luck as our new President of the United States. In such a time of madness, there's light at the end of tunnel,"" the last in the series of tweets said later. An article on FoxNews.com confirmed the hack. ""Hackers sent out several malicious and false tweets claiming that President Obama had been assassinated,"" it said. ""Those reports are incorrect, of course, and the president is spending the July 4 holiday with his family. ""The hacking is being investigated, and FoxNews.com regrets any distress the false tweets may have created."" But six tweets related to the fake news remained on the Fox News Politics twitter feed hours after the apology was posted. Later, Fox News announced the tweets were removed. One of the false messages said, ""It's a sad 4th of July ... The shooter will be found."" That message encouraged Twitter users to repost the message on their own Twitter accounts, which would spread the fake news. Several users did just that. The tweets generated headlines around the world, as well as criticism and mockery on Twitter, with firebrand liberal TV host Keith Olbermann frantically tweeting to many individual Twitter users that Obama is fine. He asked Twitter users not to re-post the messages. The first of the false tweets about Obama was posted about 2 a.m. ET. The Twitter messages asserting that Obama had been attacked came after a message that said, ""Just regained full access to our Twitter and email. Happy 4th."" A student journalist interviewed someone claiming to be a representative of the hackers shortly before the Obama tweets were posted. Adam Peck of Stony Brook University's Think magazine reported that the hackers, calling themselves the Script Kiddies, were an offshoot of the hacker group Anonymous. ""Without groups like Anonymous, what is there to prevent corruption?"" he quoted the representative as saying. Peck interviewed the representative via instant message, contacting an account he said they used to send out the tweets and later deleted. He said they had posted several innocuous fake messages before sending the Obama tweets, then deleted them. He said he could not confirm that the person he interviewed was really one of the hackers but ""firmly"" believed it, based on the link between fake posts on Twitter and the instant message account. The instant message address he gave to CNN for the hackers was offline Monday morning. The @FoxNewsPolitics Twitter account had 34,566 followers Monday morning but by afternoon had more than 37,000. Twitter spokeswoman Jodi Olsen said the company did not comment on individual accounts, declining to answer questions about whether @FoxNewsPolitics had been hacked or why the account of the alleged hackers was suspended. Hours later, the San Francisco-based technology company issued a statement saying Fox News has identified that it was first compromised in another way, which in turn allowed for the alleged perpetrators to access the network's Twitter account. ""While Twitter does monitor accounts for brute-force login attempts and similar methods of attack, we're unable to anticipate compromises that take place due to offsite behavior,"" Twitter spokesman Matt Graves said in its statement. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: Twitter says the Fox News' hack was due to ""offsite behavior"" it wouldn't monitor .

"(CNN) -- Barring a steep drop in crude prices, U.S. motorists can expect to see gas prices exceeding $3 per gallon, if they are not seeing such prices already, according to a new survey of filling stations. The latest Lundberg Survey of cities in the continental United States was conducted Friday. It showed the national average price for a gallon of self-serve unleaded gasoline at $2.91, an increase of 3.9 cents from the last survey two weeks earlier, survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said. ""It is once again crude oil at work,"" Lundberg said. A resurgence in crude prices resulted in the price per barrel increasing nearly $8 per barrel. At $89 per barrel, crude is at a 25-month high. The rise in prices predicted by Lundberg is based on the necessity for gas retailers to reflect an increase in the wholesale price of gas at the pump. Profit margins on a gallon of gas for a retailer fell by about half in the last two weeks, Lundberg said. The retail margin for retail is less than six cents per gallon. Retailers will have to raise prices at the pump to make up for it. ""We may easily pay three dollars per gallon or more by Christmas,"" Lundberg said. Gas prices in this survey were nearly 28 cents higher than in December a year ago. The Lundberg Survey sampled prices at about 2,500 gas stations. The highest average price in the continental United States was in Long Island, New York, at $3.21 per gallon. The lowest price was in Denver, Colorado, at $2.61. Average per-gallon prices in other cities: . Albuquerque, New Mexico: $2.75 . Atlanta, Georgia: $2.84 . Baltimore, Maryland: $2.90 . Chicago, Illinois: $3.09 . Miami, Florida: $2.96 . Minneapolis, Minnesota: $3.03 . Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: $3.02 . Portland, Oregon: $2.99 . San Francisco, California: $3.19 .","Gas prices increase by nearly four cents .

"(CNN) -- The Maldives will introduce strict guidelines on conducting wedding ceremonies for tourists after a foreign couple was mocked and abused by staff members at a local resort, the president's office said Friday. The couple thought they were taking part in a marriage renewal ceremony conducted in the local Dhivehi language. But the officiant used the occasion to insult them and call them names. The Maldives -- an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south-southeast of India -- is a secular nation of 370,000 Muslims. But it is a favorite of well-heeled Westerners lured by its white sandy beaches. The incident came to light when a YouTube video of the ceremony surfaced recently. The nationalities of the couple are not known, but they speak in English in the video. The woman -- wearing a white dress - and the man bow their heads in prayer in what they think is a wedding renewal. But the person conducting the ceremony calls them ""swines"" and ""infidels"" and says children of such a union will be ""illegitimate,"" according to a translation provided by the local Minivan news website. At the end of the ceremony, the couple exchange rings and head to the beach to plant a coconut tree in the sand. At several points in the video, the officiant is heard cautioning the videographer to make sure he did not record the profanities. In his weekly radio address Friday, the nation's president, Mohamed Nasheed, said he was disgusted by the incident and described the behavior of the staff as ""absolutely disgraceful."" All tourist hotels without exception will be required to follow the new guidelines which will be issued shortly, he said. ""No stone will be left unturned to ensure that an incident like this never happens again,"" the government said in a statement Thursday. Ahmed Shiyam, the sub-inspector of police in the capital Male, said officers have taken two people in custody -- the one who performed the ceremony and another who assisted him. The resort, he said, was cooperating with the investigation. He refused to share details about the couple. CNN's Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.","Couple thinks they are taking part in a wedding renewal ceremony .

"(CNN) -- A Jewish hockey player sued the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday, claiming that coaches of one of its affiliate teams subjected him to harassment and anti-Semitic remarks. Jason Bailey, 23, is seeking unspecified damages in the action filed in Orange County (California) Superior Court against the Ducks, the Bakersfield Condors and coaches Martin Raymond and Mark Pederson. ""Sorry, we can't comment,"" said Alex Gilchrist, director of media and communications for the Ducks. According to the complaint, Bailey endured ""a barrage of anti-Semitic, offensive and degrading verbal attacks regarding his Jewish faith"" from Raymond, head coach of the Condors. Raymond, according to the lawsuit, would say, ""they (referring to Jews) 'only care about money and who's who.' "" It also claims that Raymond said ""he never wanted his son to be raised Jewish or to wear a yarmulke."" Assistant head coach Pederson made anti-Semitic remarks about Bailey, the suit alleges, including, ""well, I don't know if we can trust him with the money; he's Jewish."" Bailey, who was drafted in 2005 by the Ducks but has not played in the NHL, was rarely given ice time and was not provided with resources ""that were fully available to the hockey players who were not Jewish,"" he argues. According to the lawsuit, Bailey in 2009 complained to the Bakersfield coaches about the ""anti-Semitic hostile work environment"" and spoke to Anaheim Ducks assistant general manager David McNab, who told him the organization ""found his complaints unbelievable."" Bailey was sent to the Iowa Chops, where he got no playing time, the athlete contends. The Ducks tried to send him to the Central Hockey League, but when he claimed the move would be a breach of his contract, the team backed down and suspended Raymond and Pederson briefly and told them to write apology letters, the lawsuit states. Bailey claims the letters were insincere. In one, Pederson allegedly wrote, ""I guess I never stopped to think about the impact my statement would have on you or how it would make you feel. It was not intended to insult or hurt in you in any way, but it did, and for that I am truly sorry."" A letter from Raymond states, ""As a French-Canadian, I too have come face-to-face with bigotry and understand how such remarks can negatively affect lives."" He wrote that he no longer would continue the behavior, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit contends that Bailey was the victim of religious discrimination, harassment based on religion, intentional infliction of emotional distress and retaliation. It claims he lost income, benefits and suffered humiliation. Bailey, who was traded, now plays right wing for the Binghamton Senators, a farm team for the Ottawa Senators. ""The Ottawa Senators Hockey Club does not comment on legal matters regarding members of its organization and those under contract,"" said Phil Legault, vice president for communications.

"(CNN)Japan's Shimanami Kaido might be an expressway, but it was designed with the cyclist in mind. A spectacular 60-kilometer road-and-bridge network connecting Japan's main island of Honshu with Shikoku (the nation's fourth largest island), it spans six smaller islands in the process and features bike and pedestrian lanes for its entire length. The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture. Whichever way you travel, the views of the Seto Inland Sea National Park are sublime. Cycling gives you the freedom to stop for a photo halfway across a bridge or detour to investigate lighthouses, shrines and natural wonders most automobile travelers zip past. With 14 cycle rental terminals along the way, you can go at your own pace, spend a night at a campsite or inn or just hand your bike in at the nearest rental terminal and hop on a bus. Some terminals even have electric bicycles for hire. Experienced cyclists will be able to complete the entire route  -- there are a few challenging spots -- in a few hours. Here's a look at some of the highlights. Starting point: Onomichi . As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station. Manager Katsunori Takahashi is huge cycling enthusiast, and it shows. You can park your bike in your room, and there's even a cycle-through restaurant. Taiwanese bike manufacturer Giant has a store in U2 catering to cyclists: bikes, accessories, repairs. U2's Shima Shop sells local produce such as lemon comfiture and dried debera (five-spot flounder), an Onomichi delicacy. As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama. The walk down the Path of Literature is pleasant -- it winds past past boulders engraved with works by famous writers who've stayed in Onomichi over the centuries. You'll see the splendid Senkoji Temple, which dates from 806 AD, one of the oldest temples in Japan. A stamina boost comes in the form of Onomichi's legendary ramen. Tsutafuji is one of the most popular ramen shops in town. It's a mom and pop waterfront bar near the JR station that's been open more than 50 years. There are just 10 stools inside, so you may have wait a while. Once inside, you'll get a bowlful of noodles topped with pork in a pork-bone-and-fish broth. 'Orchard of Japan' After a day in Onomichi, it's time to roll. As soon as you've crossed Onomichi Strait and reached Mukaishima Island, you'll find yourself in a serene realm of citrus groves, set in the folds of forest-clad mountains. Citrus is big business here. The town of Setoda is Japan's number one producer of lemons, while Ehime Prefecture is known as the Orchard of Japan. There are tangerines, oranges and hybrid fruits unique to these islands, such as anseikan (a cannonball-sized grapefruit). Citrus-related products abound: cakes, jams, honey, sauces, juices. World's longest suspension bridge . As you breeze across the routes magnificent bridges (seven of them), a labyrinth of misty islands unfolds below. There are inhabited islands, desert islands and islands that are no more than a rock with a lone pine tree clinging to it. A procession of trawlers, tugs and speedboats glides in and out the channels. As for those bridges, their exquisite state of the art forms make them an attraction in their own right. Tatara is one of the world's longest cable-stayed bridges -- its elegant 220-meter-high steel towers represent the folded wings of a crane. At 4,045 meters long, Kurushima Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the world. Temples, fusion food, stunning sea . Deep in the heart of rural Japan, there's a rich amount of art and culture to enjoy. Kosanji Temple on Ikuchijima Island is a must-visit. Built in 1936 by Buddhist priest Koso Kosanji in memory of his mother, this wonderland of temples, pagodas and natural beauty took more than 30 years to complete. Each building is modeled on famous temple buildings in Kyoto, Nikko and elsewhere, so visiting is like taking a stroll through Japanese history. For the perfect ending to a trip (should you choose to loop back the way you came) you can't go wrong with the Bella Vista Hotel in the hills outside Onomichi. The rooms are huge and offer views over the supreme serenity of the island-dotted sea. There's exquisite fusion in the hotel's Italian restaurant (blowfish and tagliarini). The hotel spa is open to the elements on one side, allowing fresh ocean breezes to cool your skin as you boil to a jelly while watching Jupiter rise over the Seto Sea. Travel info . Shinkansen bullet trains depart Tokyo regularly for Shin-Onomichi station -- the trip takes about 4.5 hours. Domestic flights between Tokyo and Hiroshima take about an hour and 20 minutes. Bicycles can be rented for 500 yen a day (children 300 yen). Tolls totaling 500 yen (about $5) are required for all bridge crossings. By car, the tolls are about 4,000 yen one way. A free shuttle bus to the Bella Vista Hotel runs from Onomichi JR station. The Tourist Office in the station can arrange it for you.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A powerful quake struck Japan on Thursday, killing two and triggering a tsunami warning for one prefecture and advisories in others, officials said. The warning and advisories were lifted about 90 minutes later, the Japan Meteorological Agency said, but it left millions of Japanese rattled. The quake was closer to the Japanese coast than last month's 9.0-magnitude quake. There were reports of two casualties in the earthquake zone, and 132 people were injured, officials said. Seventeen of the 132 were thought to have serious injuries, the National Police Agency said. A handful of roads were damaged as well as a few homes. The Yamagata Prefectural office said a 63-year-old woman died after a power outage caused by the quake stopped her oxygen, which relied on electricity. A second person died in the Miyagi Prefecture, the office there said, though it did not say who or how. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was a magnitude 7.4. The U.S. Geological Survey said it was 7.1. The USGS also said Thursday's quake could be considered an aftershock, making it the biggest one since the March 11 quake. Workers evacuated the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after the quake, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. The company said it has communication with the plant, and the power is still on there. There were no immediate reports of damage, it said. The workers returned later and were assessing any impact, CNN's Kyung Lah reported Friday. TEPCO later said its work was not impacted by the quake. About four million homes remained without power, police said, and water and train services were disrupted in some places. The quake's epicenter was off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture in northeastern Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The USGS said the quake was centered 41 miles (66 kilometers) from Sendai -- one of the areas worst hit by last month's 9.0-magnitude quake -- and 73 miles (118 kilometers) from Fukushima, where a crisis has been under way at the nuclear plant since last month's tsunami. Public broadcaster NHK had reported a tsunami warning for Miyagi, saying people in that area should evacuate away from the shore to a safe place. NHK also reported tsunami advisories for the Pacific coast of Aomori Prefecture, and for the Iwate, Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said based on all available data, ""a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected and there is not a tsunami threat to Hawaii."" The quake was centered 207 miles (333 kilometers) from Tokyo, the USGS said. It was 30.4 miles (49 kilometers) deep, the agency reported. The Japanese Meteorological Agency estimated the depth as 60 kilometers. The earthquake took place shortly after 11:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. ET).","NEW: The Yamagata and Miyagi Prefectural offices confirm one death each .

"(CNN) -- More than 500 people have died in Belgium since the start of April, a higher-than-usual number which may be tied to a string of summer days with high temperatures, health authorities said Tuesday. Between April 1 and July 4, a total of 520 people died across the country, said Bianca Cox, a scientific collaborator at the Scientific Institute of Public Health, which provides research on public health issues. It is not clear yet why they died, but researchers speculate it could be linked to the heat and lower concentrations of ozone levels, Cox said. ""There are no other real factors at the moment,"" she told CNN. ""But of course, we can't be sure that all 520 deaths are due to heat. There will be some that are due to other causes."" The deaths were mainly among those 80 and older, she said, and many already had underlying conditions such as heart and respiratory problems. The elderly and those with health problems can be particularly susceptible to hot weather. There were 300 deaths in the last week of June and the first week of July alone, a week in which Belgium had unusually high temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher for seven days in a row, Cox said. For three days that week, the country also had ""critical"" levels of ozone, she said. For six days so far in July, temperatures at Brussels International Airport have topped 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), with a maximum of 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit), CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said.  He added that the average high for this time of year is only 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit). Ward said neither April nor May was terribly warm as a whole, with the highest temperature during either month about 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit).","520 people have died in Belgium between April and July .

"(CNN)""So tell me,"" an old school friend asked, ""if the demand for chocolate is so high, why are cocoa farmers so poor?"" We were sitting in the local pub, just days after I returned from a trip to the Ivory Coast, filming a CNN documentary about child labor and poverty in the chocolate industry. Two years after CNN's Freedom Project exposed Chocolate's Child Slaves, it was time to return to the cocoa plantations to unwrap the chocolate supply chain, to investigate what progress has been made to stop child labor and to explore how farmers can get more money for their beans. My friend didn't know what he was letting himself in for. The answer to his question is neither simple nor short -- and ""cocoa-nomics"" has become something of an obsession of mine. The chocolate industry is worth an estimated $110 billion a year, and yet its key commodity is grown by some of the poorest people on the planet, in plantations that can hide the worst forms of child labour. Accurate figures are impossible to come by, but up to 800,000 children are thought to work in the cocoa sector across the Ivory Coast; children who are both a symptom of and a self-perpetuating factor in a much wider problem -- poverty. In 1980 the international cocoa price was $3,750 a tonne -- equivalent to $10,000 a tonne in 2013. Nowadays it is considered high at roughly $2,800 a tonne. Over the same period, the value of cocoa within a chocolate bar has halved from 12% to just 6%, so although a farmer's cocoa is essential to a chocolate bar, its value is a small part of the ultimate cost of production. Most (70%) of a modern day chocolate bar's value goes to the manufacturer because the majority of the costs are in marketing, research and development. In 2012, as part of sweeping reforms to the cocoa sector the Ivorian government enforced a minimum price for cocoa at the farm gate; at 60% of the international market price, it's about $1.5/kg. No farmer will tell you it is enough, but it does mean they can budget ahead, and are less at the mercy of passing middlemen or traders. Nick Weatherill, director of the International Cocoa Initiative, says the Ivory Coast's reform of the cocoa sector was guaranteeing a steadier price, ""at least in its first steps."" ""It may not be as high as the farmers would like, to jump out of poverty,"" he says. ""But at least it's steady and they know what's coming"". A guaranteed minimum price was the first gust of a prevailing wind which is now sweeping over the cocoa plantations: For more than a decade the ""big chocolate,"" companies like NestlÃ©, Hershey, Kraft and Mars have suffered from a barrage of bad publicity -- seemingly unwilling or unable to flex their corporate muscle to stop child labor. Across the industry it was seen as everybody's problem but nobody's responsibility. ""So what has changed?"" asked my friend, who by now was tucking into a hearty pub lunch. Infographic: Cocoa-nomics explained . I'm afraid the answer lies in self-interest as much as corporate responsibility: Growing cocoa is becoming unsustainable. There's a crisis brewing. The average age of a cocoa farmer is about 51 (not much lower than the average life expectancy); and across the Ivory Coast plantations are old, diseased and in need of regeneration. But regeneration requires investment, and the younger generation would rather migrate to the capital city, Abidjan, or switch to more lucrative crops like rubber or palm oil. In West Africa, the cocoa supply is failing to meet increasing demand. And with 1.3 billion Chinese starting to acquire a taste for chocolate, demand looks set to rise exponentially -- particularly in emerging markets -- in the coming years. So in the Ivory Coast, which produces more than a third of the world's cocoa, there is now an urgent business case for doing the right thing, and helping to improve the lives of cocoa-growers. That means investing in those at the bottom of the value chain: Educated, business-minded farmers are the only way to secure a sustainable cocoa supply in the future. My trip to the Ivory Coast coincided with a visit from JosÃ© Lopez, NestlÃ©'s top cocoa executive -- a real-life Willy Wonka who oversees 468 chocolate factories in 86 countries. NestlÃ©'s ""Cocoa Plan"" has pledged $120 million worldwide over ten years; at a new research and development centre in the capital Abidjan, they are the breeding the next generation of super saplings -- disease resistant, high-yield cocoa trees. They plan to give away 12 million new plants to Ivorian farmers by 2016. In rural communities they are working to promote awareness of child labour and building schools. Is it enough? It's easy to criticise: Their sustainable cocoa plan covers just 15% of their global supply chain and yet they made a profit of $11.55 billion in 2012. Fortunately they are not acting alone. Where NestlÃ© has its ""Cocoa Plan,"" American food giant Cargill has its ""Cocoa Promise."" We visited one of 1,200 field schools set up by the company to teach 60,000 farmers good agricultural practice -- and that means no child labor. There is a growing perception that the Ivorian government, NGOs and chocolate corporations, are starting to work together -- all in the name of sustainability. Democratic farming cooperatives are gaining momentum, empowering farmers at a village level. If their farmers' beans are grown sustainably, a cooperative can be certified by organisations like the Fairtrade Foundation, the Rainforest Alliance and UTZ. Certified beans command a higher market price and a premium on top that feeds directly back into the community. And this is where ""cocoa-nomics"" meets the consumer -- where we can make the choice to buy chocolate bars made from sustainably and ethically-sourced cocoa. The international market price of cocoa is set by a multitude of market forces, and the truth is cocoa farmers are at the wrong end of the supply chain, limited by the value they can extract from raw beans. A total recalibration of the industry is not going to happen and powerful chocolate companies like NestlÃ© are businesses, with shareholders to please, not charities. The sceptics would argue that it pays to keep the poor poor. Except we love chocolate -- and so its makers need more quality cocoa beans:  Where there is an insatiable demand, there is surely hope for cocoa farmers. And so among the grinding poverty, signs of positive change -- albeit on a small scale -- are clearly visible: School children in khaki uniforms, the next generation of farmers who, in turn, will insist their children are educated. To lift a whole society out of poverty and eradicate child labour will take time. It's the sort of holistic community approach that money alone can't buy. But that's not to say more money from the likes of NestlÃ© and other ""big cocoa"" manufacturers is not badly needed. Back at the pub, my friend has dutifully maintained his listening face; he ponders the chocolate pudding on the menu but decides that apple crumble is probably a better option, today at least.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. State Department has issued a travel alert for U.S. citizens in Europe, based on information that suggests that al Qaeda and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks. Americans are warned to be aware of their surroundings and protect themselves when traveling. One senior U.S. official said earlier that in addition to the travel alert from the State Department, ""U.S. military installations are taking prudent precautions. This is a serious situation."" A separate U.S. official said the alert is being prompted by the volume of intelligence on possible terror threats, rather than new intelligence. It emerged last week that U.S. intelligence officials were looking at information about a possible ""Mumbai-style"" attack in cities across Europe. A United Kingdom security source said Saturday that it was not believed the expected U.S. alert was a result of new intelligence received in the last few days. But the source added that the intelligence related to the possible Mumbai-style attack was being looked at very seriously on both sides of the Atlantic. The security source said there are no plans to raise the terror threat level in the United Kingdom from severe to critical. A severe threat level means an attack is considered highly likely; critical means an attack is expected imminently. A possible backlash from the French burqa ban is considered a factor in the expected warning, the security source said. The French Senate recently approved a law banning veils that cover the face, including the burqa, worn by some Muslim women. Mumbai, the financial hub of India, was the site of a three-day terror attack two years ago that left more than 160 people dead. Ten men launched the carefully planned assault, targeting prominent sites such as the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel, the Oberoi-Trident hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN Saturday that an advisory will likely be sent to law enforcement agencies around the United States after the travel alert is issued, ""just to keep them in the loop."" But the official added that current intelligence is about Europe rather than a threat in the United States. CNN's Elise Labott, Jeanne Meserve, Andrew Carey, Barbara Starr, Pam Benson and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: State Department alert warns Americans in Europe to be aware of surroundings .

Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon . ""President Chavez spoke to the challenges and aspirations of the most vulnerable Venezuelans. He provided decisive impetus for new regional integration movements, based on an eminently Latin American vision, while showing solidarity toward other nations in the hemisphere. His contribution to the current peace talks in Colombia between the Government of President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has been of vital importance. ""The secretary-general renews the commitment of the United Nations to work alongside the Government and the people of Venezuela in support of its development and prosperity."" U.S. President Barack Obama . ""At this challenging time of President Hugo Chavez's passing, the United States reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government. As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the United States remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law and respect for human rights."" Chinese Foreign Ministry . ""President Chavez has been an outstanding leader of Venezuela and a good friend of the Chinese people. He has made great contributions to consolidate the relations of our two countries. President Hu Jintao and Chief Secretary Xi Jinping have sent messages to Vice President Maduro to express our deep condolences.

The two countries will keep working together to deepen this strategic partnership we've been enjoying, which we believe benefits both countries and their people."" Russian President Vladimir Putin . ""Vladimir Putin praised the personal efforts of the Venezuelan leader, through which a solid foundation for the Russian-Venezuelan partnership was laid and strong political ties have developed, large-scale humanitarian and development projects were launched, and expressed his confidence to continue on this path, strengthening and developing the relationship between Russia and Venezuela,"" the Kremlin said. Former Venezuelan presidential candidate Henrique Capriles . ""In this difficult moment, we should demonstrate our profound love and respect to Venezuela! Unity of the Venezuelan family!"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Ahmadinejad ""expressed his heartfelt condolences to the Venezuelan government and nation on the sad demise of the late President Hugo Chavez,"" the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

Venezuelan poverty rates were cut in half, and millions received identification documents for the first time, allowing them to participate more effectively in their country's economic and political life. ""At the same time, we recognize the divisions created in the drive towards change in Venezuela and the need for national healing.

"New York (CNN) -- An attorney for Steven Slater, the JetBlue flight attendant who made headlines in August when he deployed a plane's emergency chute and walked off the job, indicated in court Tuesday that discussions about a possible plea agreement with prosecutors were under way. ""We look forward to resolving this matter amicably with the district attorney,"" said Daniel Horwitz, Slater's attorney. ""Mr. Slater wants to get on with his life, and that's why he resigned from his job voluntarily."" District Attorney Richard Brown said his office is considering ""an alternative sentencing program, at the defendant's request, representing the fact that he recognizes the seriousness of this event."" ""His actions could have led to  serious injury, or get someone killed -- and passengers would have been  alarmed,"" Assistant District Attorney Ben Mantell told the judge.  However, he added, ""We are interested in counsel's request"" to discuss a plea bargain. Brown also criticized what he called the trivial manner in which the media depicted the event. ""This was a serious incident... the estimated cost of replacing the chute is  $25,000, and the disruption to air travel was  considerable."" Brown said his office would  consider requiring Slater to enter anger management and alcohol/drug abuse  counseling programs as part of a plea agreement.  ""Nothing is off the table,""  Brown asserted, including possible jail time. Slater, who wore a blue suit and stood at attention at the defense table, will return to court October 19. He faces felony charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief along with the offense of criminal trespass. If convicted, he could face a maximum of seven years in prison. Slater has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The flight attendant became a hero to some after the August incident when, authorities said, he grabbed some beer and triggered an inflatable emergency chute to leave a plane at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, reportedly after arguing with a passenger. As of Tuesday morning, the still-popular Slater had amassed more than 210,000 ""fans"" on a public Facebook page. The drama on Slater's last flight may have started well before takeoff. ""A number of passengers were competing for overhead carry-on luggage areas,"" said attorney Howard Turman, a Legal Aid lawyer initially representing Slater, last month. ""With great difficulty, they were shoving the bags around, attempting to get it in. Steven came over to assist and either the bag or the overhead [bin door] hit him in the head and at that point he suffered an injury."" Turman has also said a woman ""started cursing and -- based on the information -- slammed the overhead luggage bin on his head."" After various exchanges with the woman and a crew member, some passengers said, Slater used the plane's public address system for a farewell message that included profanity, and grabbed some beer from the beverage cart before deploying the emergency slide and leaving. Turman has sharply denied a JetBlue passenger's assertion that the flight attendant instigated the confrontation. JetBlue removed Slater from duty following the incident and launched an internal investigation. Though many had already thought Slater's fate with JetBlue had been sealed, over the weekend the airline officially announced that Slater no longer worked for the airline. Airline spokeswoman Jenny Dervin told CNN on Saturday that the separation occurred last week, but declined to elaborate on how Slater and the company parted ways. Horwitz said his client resigned his position. CNN's Hussein Saddique, Allan Chernoff and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW:  DA says Slater may have to attend counseling in deal .

"London, England (CNN) -- In a third trial, three men have been convicted in a 2006 plot to blow up commercial airliners over the Atlantic Ocean, the head of Britain's counterterrorism prosecution told CNN on Thursday. Ibrahim Savant, Arafat Waheed Khan and Waheed Zaman were convicted of conspiracy to murder as suicide bombers. They and other conspirators planned to detonate liquid explosives stowed aboard the planes in soft drink bottles, prosecutors said. The men ""were actively working alongside other men on a plot to cause death and injury on a massive scale,"" said Sue Hemming, head of the Counter Terrorism Division at the Crown Prosecution Service, in a statement released to CNN. ""They were cleared in the previous trial of being aware of the ultimate targets of the plot,"" Hemming's statement said, ""but we say that they were committed to the principle and practice of violent jihad to the point of targeting innocent people in an attempt to further their cause. ""The verdicts demonstrate that the Crown Prosecution Service was right to pursue a third trial."" In the first trial in December 2008, the jury was hung on a key charge. In the September 2009 retrial, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, Tanvir Hussain and Assad Sarwar were convicted, but the jury could not decide whether to convict Savant, Khan and Zaman of conspiracy to murder persons unknown. The foiled plot created global chaos as airports were closed and passengers stranded. New restrictions were instituted worldwide and a ban on liquids remains in effect in most airports around the world. Twelve people have now been prosecuted in connection with the liquid bomb plot.","British court convicted three of conspiracy to murder as suicide bombers .

"A mother who had never set her eyes on her baby, a poor villager who hadn't worked for years, an old man who had never seen his pension money -- these are just some of the thousands of blind Namibians whose lives have genuinely been transformed by the treatment of a woman who they call their ""miracle doctor."" Dr. Helena Ndume, the head of the eye department at Namibia's largest hospital, Windhoek Central, has dedicated her life to help to restore sight in a country where tens of thousands of people are suffering needlessly from a condition that is curable. Cataracts, a clouding of the lens in the eye,  is one of the main culprits of blindness in Namibia, a country of barely two million. For Ndume, this is simply unacceptable. ""You can't call yourself a progressive country or nation if you still have people going blind from cataracts today,"" says Ndume, who also runs eye camps across the southwest African country where she treats those who do not have the means to pay for a simple surgical procedure. A tireless worker, Ndume reckons that she and her team have so far restored the sight of more than 20,000 people. ""There's no money in this world that can pay the joy of someone who was so blind for so many years and then suddenly they regain their vision,"" Ndume says. ""You're changing the life of so many people, you make it easier for them and it is also productive for the country -- you help people who are taking care of their grandchildren, contributing to the economy of the country, this is very, very good,"" she adds. Growing up in South African-occupied South West Africa -- as Namibia was then known -- Ndume's desire as a teenager was to become a fashion designer. But she soon found that she had to give up her dream. At the age of 15, Ndume was one of the many Namibians who went through Angola to Zambia to join the liberation movement that ultimately led to Namibia's independence. There, she was housed in camps of the South West Africa People's Organization where she was told that becoming a fashion designer was not an acceptable career path. ""In an independent Namibia we need medical doctors, not fashion designers,"" Ndume remembers being told at the time by Nahas Angula, who is currently Namibia's prime minister. So instead of following her fashion dream, Ndume was sent to Germany to become a doctor and in 1989 she returned to a liberated Namibia, keen to practice occupational health. She was urged, however, to specialize in ophthalmology and help to tackle Namibia's bigger problem of  blindness. In the beginning, Ndume remembers, people were a bit suspicious about having a doctor operating on their eyes. But after the first successful medical procedures, everybody started asking for help. ""There was that few operations, people who came really blind with visual acuity who could only see light perception -- they went back seeing again and that's how the message spread like wildfire,"" says Ndume. ""For them this was really a miracle and they will even tell me that this is like Jesus when he was making the blind see again and that's I think why they call me the miracle doctor,"" she adds. Ndume's amazing energy and dedication has also inspired others to join her mission to rid Namibia of preventable blindness. As a result, a mix of international groups like Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) and Seeing Without Borders and individual doctors travel to Namibia every year, dedicating their time and expertise to help poor people to restore their sight. ""Dr. Ndume is a remarkable woman,"" says Mike Colvart of SEE. ""She is inexhaustible, she is an incredible physician, very capable but also able to motivate people and she's been able to get the governor of Namibia to support her and her colleagues. ""She does provide an amazing service, she works all the time here, 12 hour days, day after days, seven days a week, she never stops,"" he adds. And while Ndume had to give up her teenage dream of forging a career in fashion, she says she has no regrets -- she has been able to serve her people and make a profound difference in thousands of lives. ""If you give, you get back, and the getting back is to see people going home very satisfied with bright faces -- coming in looking down and depressed and then they go back home seeing again, that is so rewarding and it keeps you, it makes you come back all the time,"" she says.","Helena Ndume is a doctor who helps tackle Namibia's problem of blindness .

"Planes believed to be Israeli struck inside Syria on Sunday, the Syrian government and an opposition group said, but the two entities differed over whether the targets belonged to the Syrian military. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency characterized the strikes as ""a flagrant attack on Syria, targeting two safe areas in (the) Damascus countryside in Dimas and near Damascus International Airport."" There were no casualties, SANA reported. But a London-based opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said ""warplanes believed to be Israeli"" struck a ""military area"" in Dimas, a Damascus suburb. The airport target was an import-and-export warehouse, and it was not clear whether the warehouse contained weapons, SOHR said. ""There were at least 10 explosions heard in the area, and it is not known at this moment if there are any injuries as a result of these two raids,"" the SOHR statement said. The Syrian army released a statement saying the strikes caused ""material damage to some facilities"" and reiterating the SANA claim that the targets were civilian. ""This attack proves Israel's direct involvement in supporting terrorists in Syria against which the Armed Forces achieved significant victories in Deir Ezzor, Aleppo, and other areas,"" the statement said. ""The General Command asserted that such acts of aggression will not dissuade it from continuing its war on terrorism in all its forms across the entirety of Syria."" U.S. options in Syria shrivel as Islamists and Assad regime make gains . Israel did not immediately respond to the claim but has declined in the past to comment on what it calls ""foreign reports."" The government of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is engaged in a long-running civil war which has seen some conflict spill over into neighboring countries. In March, after a bomb injured four Israeli paratroopers in the Golan Heights, Israeli forces responded with artillery fire aimed at Syrian military targets across the frontier, the IDF said. Israel then followed up with airstrikes. ""We will not tolerate any violation of our sovereignty and attacks against our soldiers and civilians, and we will act unwaveringly and with strength against all those that are acting against us, at every time and every place,"" Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said. ""We see the Assad regime as responsible for what is going on in its territory, and if it continues to cooperate with terror organizations that are trying to attack Israel, we will continue to extract a heavy price from him, in a way which will make him regret his actions."" In October 2013, Israeli warplanes struck a military base near the Syrian port city of Latakia, an Obama administration official told CNN. The target, according to the official, was missiles and related equipment the Israelis feared might be transferred to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. The official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information.

"Voters in the Democratic Republic of Congo lined up at polling stations Monday as the giant country holds its second postwar election despite opposition calls for delay over logistical challenges. The presidential and parliamentary polls are critical in the central African nation struggling to rebuild years after a conflict left millions dead and displaced entire regions. Incumbent Joseph Kabila, who took over after his father died in 2001 and was elected  in Congo's first democratic election five years later,  is one of 11 presidential contenders. More than 18,000 candidates are vying for 500 parliamentary seats, according to election officials. ""Kabila's regime has lasted too long. It's the same system, they are doing the same thing. Looting this country,"" said Paul Efambe, who lives in the capital of Kinshasa. Congo election could be a test of country's democracy . ""This is our version of the  Arab Uprising ... we want him (the incumbent) out. This country is rich in resources, but we have turned into world spectators. This frustration has lasted too long."" Efambe, a 42-year-old consultant, said he is supporting the leading opposition candidate, Etienne Tshisekedi. ""People felt cheated by the system,"" he said. ""Kabila has not lived up to the expectations. We are ready to take to the streets if our candidate does not win."" Kabila loyalists, in turn, accused the opposition of inciting violence and said there are fears of protests if he does not secure a victory. ""As soon as I cast my vote, I'm going home and locking my doors,"" said Willy Bonso, who also lives in the capital. ""I don't know what will happen after the election, I am afraid."" Supporters of both frontrunners have clashed repeatedly as the nation prepared for election day. Its last election in 2006 was overseen by the United Nations and considered a transition from decades of dictatorship, making this year's vote the first true test of democracy,  analysts say. ""Expectations are high. Tensions are very high,"" said Herman Nzeza, the Congo representative of FreeFair DRC, a nonpartisan group  that raises awareness of the election. ""The opposition wants to win, it's now or never. Tshisekedi is already considering himself president, we don't know how all sides will react if their candidates don't win."" Clashes have erupted in days leading up to the vote, with at least two deaths reported when supporters of the two frontrunners hurled rocks at one another Saturday , Human Rights Watch said. Days before the poll, dozens of helicopters airlifted balloting materials over the central African nation as the last-minute activities sparked concerns of vote irregularities. The massive nation has poor infrastructure and long stretches or dirt roads that make it impossible to deliver ballot material to some regions, especially during the rainy season. In addition to the logistical nightmare,  fraud allegations started before the vote and the opposition alleges that the leader of the electoral commission was picked by the incumbent, according to Albert Moleka,  a spokesman for Tshisekedi. Congo is not ready to conduct elections yet,  Moleka said. ""No country is perfect, but we should be able to conduct  organized elections. We should respect the rights of the Congolese to have good elections, and our country does not have the facilities -- even roads --  to do that,"" he said. For months, Tshisekedi's party  demanded a change in the date because the government does not have adequate resources to meet the election needs. ""We wrote to the election commission in April and told them the calendar was unrealistic. We could not see how they could manage to achieve that. This election will not be fair,""  Moleka said. Analysts fear post-election violence could further destabilize the nation, which is battling unrest years after the 1998-2003 conflict that left 5 million dead as a result of  fighting, diseases and starvation. Stability in Congo -- which borders nine countries --  is vital to Africa's Great Lakes region. The years of war affected at least six neighboring nations, some of which are still battling rebel movements spawned during the conflict. Despite Congo's vast resources including cobalt, gold, copper and tantalum, the fledgling democracy  is mired in poverty and conflict especially in its eastern region, prompting complex economic and political relations with its neighbors and the world. A major international concern is the eastern region, a hot spot for the so-called ""conflict minerals,"" which led the United States to intervene after human rights groups said the resources are used to fund wars in the nation and neighboring countries. Last year, U.S. lawmakers passed legislation that requires American electronics companies to  submit annual reports outlining what they are doing to ensure  minerals bought from Congo are ""conflict-free."" It targets manufacturers using minerals from the east,  where government forces have been battling rebels for years. ""Funding for armed groups often comes from the sale of minerals -- often to American companies -- from mines the groups control,"" Rep. Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington state, said last year.  ""This legislation will help save thousands of lives and help protect countless women in the Democratic Republic of Congo by cutting off a key source of funding for armed groups."" Congo has witnessed one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War II.  While the war ended eight years ago, women are paying a high price for the conflict in the east. Violence and rapes are widely reported in the region, including a holiday season mass rape last year  that left the international community reeling in disbelief. While  Congo is among the nations with the largest United Nations peacekeepers, the forces have been ineffective in stopping rapes in the sprawling, remote region. Despite its shortcomings, the World Bank says Congo has made some steps. In a January report called ""Resilience of an African Giant,"" the international body showcased some progress, including a decline in maternal deaths and a spike in the number of children going to primary schools. However, despite the modest progress, less than a quarter of the population has access to clean water and only one in 10  people get electricity, according to the report. Kabila faces a tough battle from foes hoping to persuade voters  that change is overdue. Tshisekedi has said a majority of the nation's about 70 million population lives in poverty despite ample resources, and has vowed to make reforms and sweeping changes if elected. ""It's time for change, time for security and justice, time for jobs and proper healthcare, time to educate our youth,"" he said. Kabila's former aide, Vital Kamerhe, who was instrumental in his 2006 win, is also among the contenders in the election.  Kamerhe, a former speaker in the National Assembly, broke with the president's party a few years later. More than 30 million people are registered to vote, according to election officials. Results are scheduled to be announced on December 6.","The polls are critical in the nation struggling to rebuild after a long war .

"(CNN) -- President Obama and his family arrived Friday for a weekend getaway in Maine, but along with a little rest and relaxation comes criticism that the president is taking it easy with the Gulf of Mexico oil crisis in a critical phase. The Obamas plan to spend the weekend on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. The trip marks the president's third weekend vacation since the oil disaster began in April. The Republican National Committee launched a website blasting what it considers Obama's ""leisure activities or missteps"" during the oil disaster, like playing golf, attending concerts and vacationing in Asheville, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; and now Maine. Obama has also faced criticism for scheduling a trip up north, instead of vacationing in the Gulf, as he advised other Americans to do. ""Presidents are certainly entitled to vacation, just like everybody else, but there is a fine line as to when presidents should do it, what they should and where they should do it,"" said Brad Blakeman, a former member of President George W. Bush's senior staff and the deputy assistant for appointments and scheduling. ""Presidents have to be cognizant of the fact that everything they do is going to be scrutinized,"" said Blakeman, who also is a professor for Georgetown University's Semester in Washington program. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons said the Republican criticism is ""galling,"" considering Bush's frequent trips to Camp David and his home in Crawford, Texas. ""Barack Obama is working as hard as any president that we've had in recent history and certainly harder than the most immediate previous president,"" he said. CBS's Mark Knoller, who keeps track of presidents' comings and goings, calculated that Bush spent all or part of 977 days at Camp David or in Texas during his two terms. Blakeman noted that visits to those locations were working trips and not getaways. Bush's staff would travel with him, and work would continue as usual. The Crawford ranch was known as the ""Western White House"" because of the infrastructure there. As for calls that Obama should vacation in the Gulf, Simmons said, ""Where he chooses to take his days off should really be up to him. We don't want to get into a situation where the president is making familial vacation decisions based upon polling or political maneuvers."" Scott Stanzel, Bush's deputy press secretary who often traveled with the president when he was away from the White House, said that changing locations provided a good opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of Washington. ""President Bush, on the weekends, would often go to Camp David because the size of the bubble you are in expands, so you can go out for a walk or bike ride without having to arrange security detail,"" he said. Stanzel was in Crawford with Bush for a number of crises that could not have been planned for, like the conviction of Saddam Hussein, the death of President Ford and the assassination of Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto. Bush was notified of Bhutto's death immediately and delivered a statement to the press pool. ""It would have almost been like we were at the White House in terms of the teams that would convene and talk about the issues surrounding that assassination,"" Stanzel said. The problem for Obama, Stanzel said, is the visuals that could come out of his trip. A picture of Obama playing golf alongside images from the Gulf could send a negative message. Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and former adviser to President Clinton, said that vacationing or not, ""The president is the president wherever he is. ""I thought it was silly when people attacked Bush for going on vacation, so I'll be consistent and say it's silly when people attack President Obama for going on vacation,"" he said. ""Of all of the concerns that Americans may have, they do not need to worry whether President Obama is a hard-working man. They may agree or disagree with his policies, but there is just no doubt that the guy is busting his rear end.""","Obama and family at Mount Desert Island, Maine, for the weekend .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British Airways employee accused of funding terrorism and planning suicide bombings -- including his own -- appeared in court Thursday. Prosecutor Colin Gibb called the suspect, Rajib Karim, ""a very dangerous individual, facing very serious offenses and likely to face a serious term of imprisonment."" Authorities said Karim -- who was born in Bangladesh and is now a British citizen -- collected money in Britain and sent it to Yemen and Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities. British authorities believe he had significant success in financing terrorist operations, security sources with knowledge of the case told CNN. He volunteered to recruit suicide bombers and to be one himself, prosecutors said in court. He said he would go to Yemen or Pakistan for training, they charged. Karim, 30, is charged with two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and fundraising for the purpose of terrorism, London's Metropolitan Police Service said Wednesday. He appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Karim, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, is an information technology developer for British Airways, authorities have said. The alleged offenses took place between April 13, 2006, and February 25, 2010, ""with the intention of committing acts of terrorism outside the UK or assisting another to commit such acts,"" police said. Karim did not speak during the 15-minute court hearing except to confirm his name and date of birth, November 4, 1979. He wore a black fleece pullover zipped up to the neck and white trousers, and appeared impassive throughout the hearing. He did not enter a plea. The hearing was intended only to outline the charges and discuss bail. Karim did not apply for bail. Prosecutor Gibbs had argued he should not be granted bail primarily because there was an ongoing investigation that could be impeded if Karim were released. Police learned about his alleged activities from encrypted data on his computer at home, which was seized when he was arrested last month. He used his position at British Airways to advise foreign terrorists on airport security measures, including suspicion scans, liquid allowances, and computer systems, prosecutors alleged. He is also accused of offering to take advantage of a possible strike by British Airways crews. Prosecutors believe he advised his contacts that because of the industrial disputes he might have the opportunity to apply to join a cabin crew, giving him information on cabin crew training and on-the-job activity. BA is planning to shuffle staff to cover positions left vacant if the strike goes ahead. Authorities did not say who Karim was aiding or reporting to. They are investigating possible connections to terrorists in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Yemen, security sources told CNN. Magistrate Judge Timothy Workman scheduled Karim's next hearing for March 26 at the Old Bailey in London. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton and producer Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.","30-year-old BA employee appears in court on terror charges .

"(CNN)Anthony Bourdain digs into his past in Massachusetts. Tony's first stop is Provincetown, where he worked in a kitchen for the very first time back in the early 1970s. It is also where Tony -- who is quite open about the heroin addiction he kicked decades ago -- was first introduced to drugs. Bourdain spends a day at sea with Scott and Beau, who are fourth generation fisherman -- scallopers, to be exact. They open up about how each day's catch, and therefore the day's take-home pay, can never be predicted. Scott and Beau explain how the industry is changing, making it increasingly difficult for independent fishermen to continue the traditions their families have held sacred for generations. Tony then heads to Franklin County to learn more about the heroin epidemic that is gripping the area, not unlike multiple rural New England communities. He speaks to a local detective and other concerned citizens about battling addiction in the community. On a lighter note, Tony also visits People's Pint, an eco-conscious local brewery and gastropub that relies totally on food and resources within a 20 mile-radius and composts nearly all of its refuse. Tony also makes a stop at the second-oldest bowling alley in America for some candlepin bowling, going head-to-head with the Holy Rollers, a team of septuagenarians.","Anthony Bourdain revisits his early culinary stomping ground on Cape Cod .

"(CNN) -- A man who escaped from a Florida work release center in 1979 while serving a sentence for armed robbery has been captured in Missouri, authorities said Monday. Oscar Eugene Richardson, 61, was arrested Saturday in Ridgedale, Missouri, as a result of information received through a police hot line, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state Department of Corrections said. He is the first fugitive captured as part of the Florida ""12 Days of Fugitives"" campaign. ""Richardson is the oldest case among the dozen escapees and it is fitting that justice caught up with him first,"" said Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey. Richardson escaped from the Kissimmee Work Release center in March 1979 after serving less than two years of his 10-year sentence, police said. He had robbed a Tampa, Florida, drugstore in January 1977, holding two employees at gunpoint as he demanded money from the store's safe. Two months later he robbed a convenience store in Tampa, holding the clerk at gunpoint and demanding she fill a bag with money, authorities said. He fled but was apprehended minutes later. At the time of his arrest Saturday, Richardson was living under the alias Eugene Ward and using a false Social Security number, officials said. Police believe he had been living in the same area of Missouri for many years. He was arrested by a U.S. Marshals Service task force. The 12 Days of Fugitives campaign, launched December 7, is aimed at Florida's oldest and most violent prison escapees, the departments' statement said. Newspapers are featuring the fugitives in print and online photo galleries and the Florida Outdoor Advertising Association and its member companies are providing donated space on billboards. ""The campaign is designed to reach the public during the holiday season, when investigators believe the wanted men are most likely to contact friends, family and loved ones,"" the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said. More than $22,000 in reward money is available -- up to $2,500 per fugitive -- for information leading to their capture. The money is provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Corrections and the Florida Police Chiefs' Association.","Oscar Richardson, 61, arrested in Missouri after police receive tip .

"(CNN) -- The president of South Africa lashed out Tuesday at NATO's enforcement of the U.N. resolution authorizing the organization to act to protect innocent civilians threatened by Libya's civil war. ""We strongly believe that the resolution is being abused for regime change, political assassinations and foreign military occupation,"" said Jacob Zuma at a budget vote debate before the National Assembly in Cape Town. ""These actions undermine the efforts of the African Union in finding solutions to the problems facing its member states,"" he said in an appeal that called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and called further for reform of the U.N. Security Council. When the council adopted the resolution in March, it was backed by the Arab League and supported by African countries in the council. But Zuma said NATO's actions have exceeded the authority that the resolution granted. Arab Spring unrest, country by country . ""We have spoken out against the misuse of the good intentions in Resolution 1973,"" said Zuma, who led two African Union delegations to Libya, where he met with leader Moammar Gadhafi in failed attempts to broker a cease-fire. Unlike some other world leaders, Zuma has not called for the longtime leader to step down. Neither has Zuma's African National Congress party nor the African Union, which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led. The AU also has criticized the NATO airstrikes. In April, Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli, Libya's capital, where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed, in principle, to the AU's ""road map"" proposal for peace. But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years. U.S. officials and those of some other countries have called for Gadhafi to step down. Separately, NATO refused to say Tuesday whether it would bomb ancient Roman ruins in Libya if it knew Gadhafi was hiding military equipment there. Time magazine gallery: Libya's stunning Roman ruins . ""We will strike military vehicles, military forces, military equipment or military infrastructure that threaten Libyan civilians as necessary,"" a NATO official in Naples, Italy, said, declining to give his name in discussing internal NATO deliberations. But he said the alliance could not verify rebel claims that Libya's leader may be hiding rocket launchers at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Leptis Magna, a Roman city between the capital of Tripoli and rebel-held Misrata. Wing Cmdr. Mike Bracken, a spokesman for NATO's Libya mission, later said it ""would be a concern for us that Gadhafi and pro-Gadhafi forces would choose to contravene international law in hiding themselves in such a location."" And, he said, ""If we were to take on any targets, we would consider all risks."" But he underscored that NATO could not confirm that weapons might be placed at the heritage site. The Bracken briefing came a day after a top British military officer acknowledged that the bombing campaign was straining British resources. ""If we do it for longer than six months, then we have to reprioritize our forces,"" Adm. Mark Stanhope said Monday. ""That does not mean we won't be doing it,"" he added. NATO recently extended its mission -- officially to protect civilians in Libya from Gadhafi's efforts to crush an uprising that has left rebels in control of parts of the country -- for another 90 days, into September. British Minister of Defense Liam Fox said Tuesday that the Libya mission showed ""how capable we are"" and emphasized that the United Kingdom has the world's fourth-largest military budget. Concerns over British capabilities were voiced as concern mounted in Washington about U.S. President Barack Obama's failure to seek the approval of Congress for the U.S. military action in Libya. ""I think he should,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN's ""Situation Room"" on Tuesday. Boehner: Possible violation of War Powers act? Asked whether Obama was violating the law by not having sought a formal authorization, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said, ""I think that you could make that argument, but it's also true that other presidents have ignored the War Powers Act in one way or another."" Still, any prohibition of ground troops would be not only inappropriate but unconstitutional, the decorated Vietnam War veteran added. ""I believe that, if the Republicans continue to push such a thing, it could be viewed as partisanship in my view, because no one, no one believes that we are going to send ground troops into Libya. So, to have a, quote, prohibition for that could only mean that we are somehow taking shots at the president."" He predicted that the White House would send to Congress a report ""and lots of information about what we've done"" in the next day or so. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said late Tuesday that the information would probably be delivered to members of Congress on Wednesday. ""We are in the final stages of preparing extensive information for the House and Senate that will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in Libya, including those raised in the House resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the War Powers Resolution,"" he said. Also Tuesday, Germany's foreign minister visited the de facto rebel capital of Benghazi, and rebels reported progress against government forces in western mountain cities. Guido Westerwelle said Germany had formally recognized the rebel Transitional National Council as the representative of the Libyan people, putting Berlin in line with the United States, France, Italy and a handful of other countries.

"(CNN) -- The suspect in the failed Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. airliner faces a six-count federal indictment issued Wednesday, including an attempt to murder the other 289 people aboard. The seven-page indictment charges Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction; attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; willful attempt to destroy and wreck an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; willfully placing a destructive device in, upon and in proximity to an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; and two counts of possession of a firearm/destructive in furtherance of a crime of violence. Read the indictment . If convicted, the 23-year-old Nigerian national faces a sentence of life in prison. The indictment said AbdulMutallab boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on December 25, carrying a concealed bomb concealed in his clothing and designed to be detonated ""at a time of his choosing."" Authorities say the bomb components included Pentaerythritol (also known as PETN, a high explosive), as well as Triacetone Triperoxide (also known as TATP, a high explosive) and other ingredients. The indictment said that, just before the jet landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Michigan, ""AbdulMutallab detonated the bomb, causing a fire on board flight 253."" The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at the man's seat. He was subdued and restrained by the passengers and flight crew. The airplane landed shortly thereafter, and he was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. AbdulMutallab required medical treatment and was transported to the University of Michigan Medical Center after the plane landed. Explosives expert Sydney Alford said AbdulMutallab probably used a liquid contained in a syringe to mix with a chemical he was carrying to create a fire, which was intended to ignite the TATP. That, in turn, was to detonate the PETN. But the TATP did not ignite as planned, he speculated. TATP has been cited in several terrorism cases. Najibullah Zazi, the 24-year-old Afghan citizen and U.S. resident who was arrested in September and accused of planning to carry out terrorist acts in the United States, was allegedly trying to make TATP in his motel room in Denver, Colorado. A new indictment against Richard Reid specifies that the convicted shoe bomber also used TATP. Judge Nancy Edmunds is assigned to the AbdulMutallab case and will preside over court proceedings, said Gina Balaya, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney, Eastern District, Michigan. The case was presented Wednesday to the grand jury, which determined probable cause to indict. Though arraignments are typically held by a magistrate judge, Edmunds may decide, based on the special circumstances and high-profile security related to the AbdulMutallab case, to handle the matter herself, Balaya said. Edmunds is expected to decide Friday on details for the arraignment and AbdulMutallab's detention, Balaya said. Attorney General Eric Holder said the investigation ""has already yielded valuable intelligence that we will follow wherever it leads."" ""The attempted murder of 289 innocent people merits the most serious charges available, and that's what we have charged in this indictment,"" said U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, who is in her first week on the job.","Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab charged with attempted use of weapon of mass destruction .

"Federal authorities Wednesday arrested an upstate New York man on drug charges in connection with the sale of the drug known as ""molly"" to concert-goers -- including one who died -- at a music festival on Randall's Island last August. Last summer's Electric Zoo festival gained national attention when several people were sickened and two people died after overdosing on the drug MDMA, either in ecstasy pills or in its ""pure"" powder or crystal form, known as molly. The popular festival was cut short as a result of the deaths. The suspect, identified in court papers as Patrick Morgan, was taken into custody early Wednesday, two law enforcement officials told CNN. He faces drug possession, distribution and conspiracy charges. It was not clear whether he has an attorney. He is is believed to have sold the drug that led to at least one of the deaths, according to the officials. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara was expected to announce the arrest later Wednesday along with representations of the New York Police Department and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. MDMA is believed to have caused both of the deaths at the music festival, which was attended by more than 130,000 people, in late August 2013. Police identified the two victims as Jeffrey Russ, 23, and Olivia Rotondo, 20. Morgan allegedly sold about 80 ""molly"" pills to an acquaintance of Russ's for about $1,100, according to court papers. Morgan also is accused of selling Russ and his friends ""molly"" at a concert in Buffalo, New York, earlier that month. On August 30, 2013, near the end of a concert at Electric Zoo, Russ told his friends he wasn't feeling well, according to court documents. He collapsed and suffered a seizure. When Russ arrived at Harlem Hospital Center, his heart was beating rapidly and his temperature was about 108 degrees Fahrenheit, court papers said. Russ was pronounced dead at 3:21 a.m. on August 31. The pills found on Russ contained MDMA and methylone, according to court documents. The medical examiner ruled that Russ died from ""acute intoxication by the combined effects of [MDMA] and methylone with hyperthermia."" Authorities arrested Morgan after a friend of Russ's sent the suspect a text message: ""Hey it was great to see you last week. Glad we got to talk about Jeff a little it was bugging me. Just know that I no longer blame us for giving the molly to him because it was him that made the mistake of taking too much,"" according to court documents. Morgan allegedly responded: ""Yeah man u too call me whenever you  want."" After the deaths,the city recommended the electronic music festival be canceled. Electric Zoo's promoters, Made Event, agreed, police said. What is MDMA? Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, a synthetic amphetamine, was created in Germany in the early 1900s, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. During the 1970s some American psychiatrists felt they'd found in the drug a kind of ""penicillin for the soul."" The drug was said to allow for greater insights and better communication. U.S. officials disagreed, and in the 1985 the Drug Enforcement Administration banned the substance,  as a Schedule I drug, meaning it had no proven therapeutic value. In the 1990s, MDMA, or ecstasy, gained a reputation for party drug at all-night warehouse parties known as raves. Emergency-room visits rose steadily, from 421 in 1995 to 5,542 in 2001, according to DEA statistics. Questions were raised about safety and purity of ecstasy. That's when molly was born. Molly -- short for ""molecule"" -- is touted as the pure form of MDMA, but a spokesman for the DEA says don't believe the hype. According to Rusty Payne, the agency sees MDMA from Asia, Canada and the Netherlands. ""You have no idea the lab environment these chemicals or substances were produced in,"" Payne said. ""If they knew where things were produced, they might think twice."" In 2009, government data found 22,816 emergency-room visits due to MDMA, a 123% percent increase from 2005. But molly still has fans among some in the medical field. An article published last year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that the drug helped reduce the symptoms of PTSD for two-thirds of those enrolled in a study. Still, the sample size in that study was small, just 19 people. More studies are in the works. Despite any potential for future uses, authorities warn that the drug is dangerous. After a giant New Year's Eve party in Los Angeles in 2010, one person died and 18 others were hospitalized for issues relating to MDMA use, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- A man toting an assault rifle was among a dozen protesters carrying weapons while demonstrating outside President Obama's speech to veterans on Monday, but no laws were broken. It was the second instance in recent days in which weapons have been seen near presidential events. A man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against President Obama on Monday in Phoenix, Arizona. Video from the protest in Phoenix, Arizona, shows the man standing with other protesters, with the rifle slung over his right shoulder. Phoenix police said authorities monitored about a dozen people carrying weapons while peacefully demonstrating. ""It was a group interested in exercising the right to bear arms,"" police spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill said. Arizona law has nothing in the books regulating assault rifles, and only requires permits for carrying concealed weapons. So despite the man's proximity to the president, there were no charges or arrests to be made. Hill said officers explained the law to some people who were upset about the presence of weapons at the protest.  Watch the rifle being legally carried at rally Â» . ""I come from another state where 'open carry' is legal, but no one does it, so the police don't really know about it and they harass people, arrest people falsely,"" the man, who wasn't identified, said in an interview aired by CNN affiliate KNVX. ""I think that people need to get out and do it more so that they get kind of conditioned to it."" Gun-toting protesters have demonstrated around the president before. Last week, a man protesting outside Obama's town hall meeting in New Hampshire had a gun strapped to his thigh. That state also doesn't require a license for open carry. U.S. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan acknowledged the incidents in New Hampshire and Arizona, but said he was not aware of any other recent events where protesters attended with open weapons. He said there was no indication that anyone had organized the incidents. Asked whether the individuals carrying weapons jeopardized the safety of the president, Donovan said, ""Of course not."" The individuals would never have gotten in close proximity to the president, regardless of any state laws on openly carrying weapons, he said. A venue is considered a federal site when the Secret Service is protecting the president and weapons are not allowed on a federal site, he added. In both instances, the men carrying weapons were outside the venues where Obama was speaking. ""We pay attention to this obviously ... to someone with a firearm when they open carry even when they are within state law,"" Donovan said. ""We work with our law enforcement counterparts to make sure laws and regulations in their states are enforced.""

"(CNN) -- A man accused of making threatening statements about killing President Obama has been arrested in Nevada, the Secret Service said Saturday. Daniel James Murray was arrested Friday night in the parking lot of the Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada, said Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley. Murray recently withdrew $85,000 from a bank in St. George, Utah, in two separate visits and told a teller, ""We are on a mission to kill the president of the United States,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Utah. According to the complaint, Murray opened an account at Zions First National Bank on May 19 with an $85,000 check. ""With all this mess going on under President Obama with banks and the economy, I'm sure if citizens happen to lose their money, they will rise up and we could see killing and deaths,"" he said, according to the complaint. On May 27, he returned to the bank and tried to withdraw $12,000, but lacked proper identification. ""Not to be disrespectful, but if I don't get this money, someone is going to die,"" Murray said, according to the complaint. A bank manager was summoned and Murray was allowed to withdraw the money without proper identification. Murray would not accept a check and demanded bills no larger than $50, the complaint says. ""We are 94 million miles from the sun, and are in-between the sun and moon, and the eagle that flies between them and it's a giant step for mankind. ... I have traveled thousands of miles to be here and know things that are going to happen. ... the banking system will fail and people will die. ... there will be chaos in the world,"" Murray said, according to the complaint. He then made his threat against the president, the complaint says. The next day, Murray returned to the bank, withdrew the rest of his money and closed the account, a bank teller told authorities.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska on Saturday threw his support behind the Democrats' health care reform bill, giving the party the crucial backing it needed to avoid a Republican filibuster that would prevent a Senate vote. The first of a series of votes is set for Monday at 1 a.m., on a so-called manager's amendment, consisting of amendments crafted in the last week-and-a-half by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. At the request of Republicans, the entire package of amendments -- 383 pages -- was being read Saturday, for hours, on the Senate floor. The Senate could vote on the entire bill, a top priority of President Obama, before Christmas. However, a House Democratic leadership source told CNN that Obama's repeated requests for a health care bill to arrive on his desk by the end of the year won't be met. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the ongoing internal discussions within the party, said there is ""no chance of a conference between Christmas and New Year's."" Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said the latest version of the Senate health care bill ""is a legislative train wreck of historic proportions."" ""If [Democrats] were proud of this bill, they wouldn't be doing it this way,"" McConnell said. ""They wouldn't be jamming it through in the middle of the night on the last weekend before Christmas."" McConnell said the legislation ""will have a profound impact on our nation. This is not renaming a post office. Make no mistake, this bill will reshape our nation and our lives."" Reid and Sen. Charles Schumer of New York spent most of Friday trying to answer concerns from Nelson, who had held back on supporting the bill because of his objections to public funding for abortions. Schumer said negotiations with Nelson over the legislation's health care provisions began Friday morning and ended with handshakes close to 11 p.m. Schumer and others involved in the talks said Nelson didn't want to make a public announcement about his decision to back the bill until the negotiated abortion language was entered into the record. Nelson's backing gave the Democrats the crucial 60 votes needed to move the bundle of recent amendments, which involved a spate of compromises, to the Senate floor. ""Change is never easy, but change is what's necessary in America today. That's why I intend to vote for cloture and for health care reform,"" the Nebraska Democrat told reporters. Cloture is the procedure that allows senators to place a time limit on consideration of a bill or other matters, and thereby overcome a filibuster. Nelson warned, however, that if there are changes to the health bill when House and Senate leaders meet to resolve their differences, he will withdraw his support. The House has passed a different version of the bill. Obama said the Senate's health care reform bill would be the largest deficit-reduction measure in a decade. ""We are on the cusp of making health care reform a reality,"" he said. ""With today's developments, it now appears that the American people will have the vote they deserve on genuine reform that offers security to those who have health insurance and affordable options for those who do not."" According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation would offer a decrease in the deficit of $132 billion over the first decade, and more than $1 trillion in the 10 years after that, Obama said at a brief news conference. The new cost for the revised Senate bill is $871 billion, the CBO said. The previous price tag was $848 billion. Obama's was one of a flurry of press briefings held Saturday after Nelson's announcement. Nelson, a social conservative who opposes abortion, did not want taxpayer funds to pay for the medical procedure. One of his main requests was that states that offer insurance present at least one plan without the abortion option. In addition, he was assured that anyone receiving federal health subsidies would pay separately for an abortion. Two liberal U.S. senators who had not committed to supporting the health bill also announced Saturday that they would vote ""yes"" on its passage. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said he changed his stance because the measure now contains provisions for new community health centers. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said he favored the insurance reforms in the legislation. Neither is totally pleased, but they told CNN it's a good first step. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, who was involved in some talks with Nelson, said she's satisfied that the agreement's language achieves its goal. ""My goal was to try to reach some compromise so we could move forward on health care, where the basic premise was we could separate federal funds from private funds. I think we achieved that."" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, agreed, saying the deal follows the principles of the Hyde amendment, which prevents federal funds from being used for abortions. ""Anyone who is in the exchange who also gets a federal subsidy because they're poor, if they choose a private insurance policy and want any kind of abortion coverage, they have to write that part of the premium from their own personal funds,"" the Florida senator said. The health bill proposes a health insurance exchange for those unable to afford health coverage or don't have coverage. No federal funds could be used to cover abortions for people participating in the exchange, the bill says. In addition, under national plans that would be administered by the Office of Personnel Management, there has to be, if a state chooses those, at least one that does not offer abortion coverage. Meanwhile, two congresswomen said they had ""serious reservations"" about the abortion provision in the Senate version of the health care bill. ""This provision is not only offensive to people who believe in choice, but it is also possibly unconstitutional,"" said U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado, and Louise M. Slaughter, D-New York, in a statement Saturday. ""As we have maintained throughout this process, health care reform should not be misused to take away access to health care. The more than 190-member Caucus will review this language carefully as we move forward on health care reform.""","NEW: Source says Obama's requests for bill on his desk by end of year won't be met .

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- Lufthansa said late Monday that the airline is keeping its strike schedule in place for Tuesday, despite the fact pilots had already suspended the strike. ""It will obviously take a few days until we are back to normal,"" spokeswoman Claudia Lange said. The airline is planning to fly about 1,000 of its normal complement of 1,800 flights, ""plus, where we can, single, additional flights,"" she said. The announcement came shortly after both sides in a pilots strike against German-based Lufthansa, one of of the world's largest airlines, agreed to suspend the standoff beginning at midnight (6 p.m. ET) Monday. The suspension will expire March 8, barring an agreement before then, both sides said in a Frankfurt labor court. ""The judge was very clear,"" Lufthansa spokesman Klaus Walther said. ""He recommended the union to stop the strike action and to return to the negotiation table."" Walther predicted the two sides would reach a final agreement ""pretty fast."" The pilots' union previously had said resuming a normal schedule would take time, because the union had to inform striking pilots of the agreement before they could return to work. In addition, passengers whose flights have been canceled will have to be rebooked. Hundreds of flights were canceled Monday. The walkout by more than 4,000 members of Vereinigung Cockpit, the pilots' union, began at midnight Sunday after a last-ditch effort at negotiations over pay and job security failed, the company said. The strike threatened to disrupt travel on more than two dozen partner airlines, including United, US Airways and Continental. In 2008, Lufthansa was the No. 2 international carrier, with 42.2 million passengers, according to the International Air Transport Association. The industrial action was the largest in German aviation history, Lufthansa said, and it signaled growing labor unrest across Europe. Hours after it started, the union representing most of British Airways cabin staff voted to strike, but did not set a date. On Wednesday in Greece, a mass public and private sector strike is planned to protest the government's austerity plan. British Airways cabin crews vote to strike . In addition, French civil aircraft staff, including air traffic controllers, said Monday they plan to strike Tuesday through Saturday. Four unions called for the strike, denouncing a government project to merge air traffic control operations with those of five other European countries -- Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland, according to Eric Heraud, spokesman for France's civil aviation authority, DGAC, or Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile. The unions are afraid of dismantling DGAC, Heraud said. Under the new proposal, ""nothing will change geographically,"" he said. ""The control towers will stay where they are."" Only the ""map of the sky"" will change, or the sphere of the controllers' concern, Heraud said. Half of Tuesday's flights at Paris, France's, Orly airport were to be canceled because of the action, he said. Twenty-five percent of the flights at Charles de Gaulle Airport were to be canceled. The labor unrest comes as the airline industry is digging out of the worst one-year drop-off in business, according to International Air Transport Association. ""It is the kind of death throes, I guess, of the very strong legacy airline unions,"" said Simon Calder, a travel expert. ""Now, all the old airlines like BA, like Lufthansa, are struggling"" to cut costs, he said. In 2009, air carrier revenues dropped nearly 15 percent worldwide after a record $535 billion the previous year. Passenger travel fell a record 3.5 percent and freight fell more than 10 percent, according to International Air Transport Association figures. Many of Lufthansa's pilots have been working without a contract since March and more than 90 percent of the union's members had voted to strike, a union representative said. The union, which is seeking a 6.4 percent pay increase, is also concerned with the airline's recent buying spree of small regional carriers, such as BMI and Austrian Airlines, a practice that it said cannibalizes flights from union-flown routes. Lufthansa is one of the largest carriers on the Star Alliance, a network of 26 airlines that share ticketing and routes for international travel. Other Star Alliance member airlines are: Adria, Air Canada, Air China, Air New Zealand, ANA, Asiana Airlines, Austrian, Blue 1, BMI, Brussels Airlines, Continental Airlines, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Lot Polish Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Spanair, Swiss, Tap Portugal, Thai Airlines, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways.

"Washington (CNN)When Hillary Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 -- She says she did not try marijuana there -- only 12% of Americans wanted to legalize the drug. In 45 years, however, the tide has changed for legalization: 58% of Americans now want to make consumption legal, two states (Colorado and Washington) already have and two more states (Oregon and Alaska) could join them by the end of the year. Despite their growth in approval, many activists see 2014 as a smaller, but important, step to their end goal. It is 2016, when voters will also decide who they want in the White House, that marijuana activists feel could be the real tipping point for their movement. ""There will certainly be even more on the ballot in 2016,"" said Tamar Todd, director of marijuana law and policy and the Drug Policy Alliance. ""More voters coming to the polls means more support for marijuana reform and in presidential election years, more voters turn out."" Demographics and money are also an important consideration. Big donors who are ready to fund pro-legalization efforts are more loose with their money in presidential years, according to activists, while Democrats and young people are more likely to turn out. This means legalization activists will be better funded to reach the nearly 70% of 18- to 29-year-old Americans who support legalization. On paper, activists feel their plan will work. But it is one yet to be decided factor -- who will be the Democrats' nominee for president in 2016 -- that could throw a wrench into their push. Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, but to many in the marijuana legalization community, she is not the best messenger for their cause. ""She is so politically pragmatic,"" said Alan St. Pierre, the director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ""If she has to find herself running against a conservative Republican in 2016, I am fearful, from my own view here, that she is going to tack more to the middle. And the middle in this issue tends to tack more to the conservative side."" Making a concerted push during a presidential election year means activists' goals will be directly contrasted with the Democrats' presidential standard bearer. This happened in 2004, when more conservative voters helped tip the presidential election for President George W. Bush; at the same time, 11 states had anti-gay marriage questions on the ballot. Clinton has moved toward pro-legalization, though. Earlier this year, during a town hall with CNN, she told Christiane Amanpour that she wants to ""wait and see"" how legalization goes in the states before making it a national decision. At the same event, she cast some doubt on medical marijuana by questioning the amount of research done into the issue. Later in the year, Clinton labeled marijuana a ""gateway drug"" where there ""can't be a total absence of law enforcement."" ""I'm a big believer in acquiring evidence, and I think we should see what kind of results we get, both from medical marijuana and from recreational marijuana, before we make any far-reaching conclusions,"" Clinton told KPCC in July. ""We need more studies. We need more evidence. And then we can proceed."" This is more open, however, than in 2008 when Clinton was outright against decriminalization, a step that is less aggressive than legalization. Despite warming on the issue, Clinton's position causes concern among activists like St. Pierre because he feels they are far from solid. ""If reforms keep picking up... the winds in our sails are clear,"" he said. ""But if we lose one of more or all of those elections this year, [cautious] people around her could make the argument that this thing has peaked and you now have to get on the other side of it."" St. Pierre said he also watched -- laughing -- as Clinton tried to personally distance herself from marijuana at the CNN town hall. ""Absolutely not,"" Clinton said when asked if she would try the drug. ""I didn't do it when I was young, I'm not going to start now."" ""I will eat both of my shoes,"" he said, 'if she and Bill didn't trip their nuts off at Wellesley and Oxford."" What's more, some activists spoke highly of Democrats with executive experience, such as Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who spent eight years as mayor of Baltimore. O'Malley, who is also entertaining thoughts of running for president in 2016, supports medical marijuana; he approved a Maryland law that decriminalized possession of small amounts of the drug in 2014. ""As a young prosecutor, I once thought that decriminalizing the possession of marijuana might undermine the Public Will necessary to combat drug violence and improve public safety,"" O'Malley said in a statement at the time. ""I now think that decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police, and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health."" As for where the governor is on legalization, Lis Smith, his top political adviser, said as long ""as long as it is consistent with the goal of driving down crime,"" O'Malley is ""open to sensible drug policy."" With an eye on 2016, some activists are starting to contrast that view with Clinton's. ""I think in 2016 there is going to be a number of states with legalization initiatives on the ballot and there will be broad support,"" said the Drug Policy Alliance's Todd. ""I don't see standing behind and defending the status quo of this destructive policy as helping a candidate in the 2016 election."" Clinton has come face to face with some aspects of marijuana policy on her trips to stump for Democrats across the country. While raising money in Colorado for Sen. Mark Udall earlier this week, Hillary Clinton saw marijuana in her coffee. Pointing to the foam design atop Udall's latte, Clinton said, ""Look at you, you got like a plant. Is that a marijuana plant?"" To laughs from the baristas at PigTrain Coffee, some who may have seen that the design looked more like a rose than marijuana, one answered jokingly, ""That's exactly what it is.""","Marijuana legalization activists plan to make a big push in 2016.
That push will force candidates, including Hillary Clinton if she runs, to take a stand on the issue.
Clinton says she has never tried marijuana and has not been as supportive of marijuana policy as other Democrats.
""I am fearful... that she is going to tack more to the middle,"" said one activist."
"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Iraqis celebrated in the streets Tuesday for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from their cities and towns under an agreement signed last year with the U.S. government. A crowd gathers Tuesday after a deadly bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. But celebration was tempered by fears of renewed violence as insurgents launched new attacks. At least 30 people, including women and children, were killed in what security sources called a ""huge bombing"" Tuesday in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Dozens were wounded in the attack in a busy shopping area in a predominantly Kurdish part of the disputed oil-rich city. Hundreds died in a series of dramatic attacks in the past 10 days, after months of relative quiet. President Obama hailed the withdrawal as an important milestone. ""The Iraqis are rightly treating this day as a cause for celebration,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""The very fact that Iraqis are celebrating this day is a testament to the courage, the capability and commitment of every single American who has served in Iraq. ... Through tour after tour of duty, our troops have overcome every obstacle to extend this precious opportunity to the Iraqi people."" Citing the Kirkuk bombing, Obama warned of tough times ahead and said the United States would continue to support Iraq as it works to become ""a ""sovereign, stable, and self-reliant"" country. Earlier, the top U.S. general in Iraq insisted shortly before the Kirkuk bombing that much of the country is safe. ""There is not widespread violence in Iraq,"" Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a videoconference from Baghdad.  Watch as Odierno notes the deadline marks an ""important day"" in Iraq Â» . ""There's still gonna be bumps in the road. There's still gonna be violence here,"" he said. U.S. combat troops will remain in Iraq, in bases and outposts outside of major population centers, after Tuesday's pullback. Odierno said the cities would feel ""significantly different"" without U.S. ""battalions,"" even though there will still be Americans in the cities as military trainers and advisers. Newscasters on the state television network Al-Iraqiya draped Iraqi flags around their necks as an on-screen clock counted down to midnight Monday. Earlier Monday evening, hundreds of people danced and sang in a central Baghdad park to mark the U.S. pullout.  Watch Iraqis celebrate in the capital Â» . ""I feel the same way as any Iraqi feels -- I will feel my freedom and liberation when I don't see an American stopping an Iraqi on the street,"" Baghdad resident Awatef Jwad told CNN. There were no columns of tanks rolling out of Baghdad or thousands of troops marching out of other cities as the deadline approached. The U.S. military has been gradually pulling its combat forces out of Iraq's population centers for months, and they were already gone by the weekend, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters in Washington. iReport.com: Spirits are high as Iraqi troops prepare for handover . But Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi and U.S. officials had warned of an increase in attacks around the withdrawal date as remaining insurgents attempt to re-ignite the sectarian warfare that ravaged the country in 2006 and 2007. While many Iraqis publicly said they are glad to see Americans out of their neighborhoods, some were worried about what the future may hold without the U.S. military nearby. ""Without the Americans, we were afraid of each other,"" Hanaa Abdul Hassan, a Baghdad resident, told CNN. ""And now that the Americans are leaving, we will be more afraid. We knew the Americans were holding them back, so now I don't know what's going to happen,"" she said, without specifying who ""they"" were. But U.S. officials believe Iraq's police and army can keep a lid on the violence, which Morrell said was at the lowest point ""in the history of this conflict."" Thomas Ricks, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security who has written extensively about Iraq, said he was not convinced Iraqi security could keep violence under control . ""No one knows whether the forces can handle it. It's a leap of faith we're taking here. My concern is we've taken this leap of faith before and it hasn't worked,"" he told CNN. ""The real thing for Iraqi security forces isn't whether they're trained or better equipped than the militias and the insurgents. The question is whether they're better motivated. The militias and insurgents knew what we were fighting for. The question has always been, do Iraqi security forces know what they're fighting for?"" he said. Four U.S. soldiers serving in Baghdad died Monday of combat-related injuries, the latest of more than 4,300 Americans to die there since the U.S-led invasion in 2003. The U.S. military announced the deaths Tuesday without giving further details. A Web site associated with the Baath Party posted a statement attributed to ex-leader Saddam Hussein's former deputy, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, early Tuesday, calling the American pullout a ""historic victory"" for the insurgents. ""The 30th of June 2009 is your precious and glorious day that embodies your historic victories,"" the statement said. ""For your enemy and the enemy of God decided to flee the battlefields dragging the tails of disappointment and defeat to protect its fleeing soldiers in a few and limited fortified bases, where they think they will find safety from your heroic charges and Godly strikes."" Al-Douri, the highest-ranking member of Hussein's government to remain at large, is believed to be a top figure in the insurgency. His apparent statement urged Iraqis to keep fighting Americans ""wherever they may be in Iraq."" By mid-2006, the conflict had become a low-level civil war, marked by the dumping of bodies in the streets on a daily basis. The conflict began to subside in late 2007, after Washington committed extra troops and supported a turn against the jihadists by Sunni Arab tribal leaders. Under an agreement signed in the waning days of the Bush administration, all U.S. forces will be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Most will be gone by August 2010 under the withdrawal plan laid out by Obama. The 130,000 U.S. troops who remain are now tasked with supporting Iraqi troops and police, and will require Iraqi permission to launch operations in the cities. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Michael Ware in Baghdad, Iraq, contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama: ""Iraqis are rightly treating this day as a cause for celebration""

"(CNN)Following Libya's revolution, oil production has been restored and the country has slipped from the front pages. Once more, Libya has become North African rather than southern Mediterranean, and news dispatches surface only when Western government's worst fears appear close to being realized. As most Libyans admit that after four-plus decades of Moammar Gadhafi, it will take time to build a mature democracy. Yet Libyans remain hopeful that progress is being made. For travelers, this means a renewed opportunity to explore one of Africa's most interesting states. 1. It's vast and empty . At 679,362 square miles, Libya is second in size only to neighboring Algeria among North African countries. It's two and a half times bigger than Texas, almost 85 times the size of Wales and 90% desert. Libya's population is small, just more than 6 million, more than 80% inhabiting the coastal region. More than half of that is concentrated in the just three cities -- Tripoli, Benghazi and Misrata. For first-time visitors, an itinerary based on Tripoli and Benghazi, with day excursions from each city and a connecting domestic flight, makes most sense. Simoon Travel (+44 020 978 0508; www.simoontravel.com) or Temehu (www.temehu.com) are two tour agencies worth knowing. 2. Road travel is exciting but hazardous . By car, the 600-mile journey along the coast between Tripoli and Libya's second city, Benghazi, takes around 12 hours. Heading south from Tripoli to the ancient Berber trading town of Ghadames is an eight or nine hour slog, while the Ubari Lakes in the southern desert region of Fezzan lie some 13 hours from Tripoli. As well as recalcitrant camels, encroaching dunes, sand storms and wildly unpredictable driving conditions and drivers, the insecurity of postrevolutionary Libya demands travelers' full attention before any overland journey. The revolution saw the collapse of many commercial bus services, though these were off-limits to foreigners anyway. Car rental companies such as Sixt (www.sixt.com) and Hertz (www.hertz.co.uk) are building a Libyan presence, though locations are limited and unless you're used to what might be called ""ebullient"" traffic, you may want to take a back seat. Stifling Gadhafi-era group travel restrictions no longer exist, but for tourists with limited time, complicated land explorations are best made through tour operators utilizing their vehicles and drivers. 3. There's no drinking (except there is) The ""Free Officers"" of Gadhafi's 1969 coup d'etat banned alcohol, and there's no chance of change. Despite public conservatism, however, Libyans close to a suitable land border are no strangers to losing themselves in a foreign bar, and regular cross-border traffic means lots of illicit alcohol enters the country from Egypt and Tunisia. It's an open secret that cars of young men parked in out-of-the-way places are often de facto drinking dens. As well as smuggled booze, a drink known as bokha, distilled from dates, figs or grapes, is widely consumed. Unfortunately, some misguided producers add methanol to increase potency. In March 2013, a batch of bad bokha claimed 52 lives in Tripoli -- one reason to stay on the straight and narrow and stick to sweet tea and strong coffee. 4. The ATMs don't work . Plastic cards cannot be relied upon, either to pay bills or get money from ATMs or banks. Functioning ATMs can be counted on one hand, and credit card payments for goods and services are almost unknown outside Tripoli. As a result it's not uncommon to see large, tightly bound bricks of dinars exchanged as a matter of course. Those accustomed to cashless card-driven lifestyles may feel uncomfortable when carrying large quantities of banknotes. Despite recent high-profile outrages perpetrated by militias, religious ideologues or both, crimes against individuals such as muggings and thefts are rare. And in commerce, Libyans are straightforward and honest to a fault. 5. Gas is cheaper than water . Filling the tank of an average car costs around six dinars ($4.76), while a liter bottle of water from a cafe costs one dinar ($0.80). Libyan oil production has returned to prerevolution levels of 1.6 million barrels a day. The country's known reserves are the largest in Africa and fourth-largest in the world -- sufficient for 85 years at the present output. It's a constant refrain among the postrevolutionary populace, however, that ""Libya is a rich country but the people are poor."" Walking around the neglected, crumbling streets of Benghazi, a city that has seen little investment since World War II, one can only wonder where the oil revenues were spent. Economic prospects for Libya may about to improve. The World Bank estimates 16% to 18% growth in GDP for 2013, the International Monetary Fund suggests nearer 20%. 6. It's not all sand . Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) is an achievable day-trip from Benghazi, a good reminder that Libya isn't all desert. Quite literally, the trip provides a breath of fresh air. Relatively high rainfall means these uplands live up to their name -- fields yield healthy cereal crops and orchards produce succulent fruit, while Libya's luckiest sheep graze rolling green hillside pastures. Italian colonial farmhouses, under new management, are still visible, as are abandoned railway stations (trains have long since ceased operations). 7. Omar Mukhtar has replaced Gadhafi as a symbol . Before the revolution, Moammar Gadhafi portrait was everywhere in Libya. Without turning your head, it was easy to reach double figures when counting reproductions of his all-seeing image. Now they're gone, often replaced by images of an elderly man in white robes -- Omar Mukhtar. Who is he? Beginning in 1912 and lasting for almost 20 years, Italian imperial designs on Libya were resisted by a determined local insurgency led by Mukhtar. His bands of fighters utilized guerrilla tactics and superior knowledge of the terrain to ambush Italian columns. Opposition was quelled only when a 73-year-old Mukhtar was captured and executed by Italian armed forces in 1931. Despite attempting to co-opt Mukhtar's legacy as a nationalist hero, Gadhafi ultimately felt threatened by the sheikh and had his body removed from its tomb in the center of Benghazi to an out-of-the-way rural town about 37 miles away. Gadhafi was right to be worried. Omar Mukhtar remained an inspiration to modern revolutionaries, and in 2011, his battle cry of ""We will win or we will die"" was heard once more. 8. It's filled with Greco-Roman heritage . Eighty miles east of Tripoli, Leptis Magna was the hometown of Roman Emperor Septimus Severus. Even those prone to chronic attacks of temple fatigue can't fail to be wowed by the grandeur of its ruins. The site is vast and well-preserved, though to date only one third has been excavated. The almost complete amphitheater and circus outside the main city are made all the more intriguing by virtue of their relative neglect. Some 40 miles east of Tripoli, Sabratha's remains have been restored. While only a quarter of the site has been excavated, mosaics thus far uncovered rival those found in Rome. And 120 miles east of Benghazi, the ruins of Cyrene reflect enduring Greek influences of language and architecture; the city's Temple of Zeus is larger than the Parthenon in Athens. Anywhere else, all three sites would be honeypot tourist destinations, but these days it's possible you'll have them to yourself. Leptis Magna and Sabratha are easy day trips from Tripoli; Cyrene is reached from Benghazi and with an early start can also be visited in a day. Because of poor security, travel eastward to Derna isn't recommended. Though it's easy to visit sites independently, a knowledgeable guide can bring the ruins to life. Temehu (www.temehu.com) can organize excursions in advance. ""North Africa -- The Roman Coast"" (www.bradtguides.com) has a useful section on Libya.","Libya is two and a half times bigger than Texas and 90% desert .

"Spies with surveillance agencies in the  United States and United Kingdom may have spent time undercover as orcs and blood elves, infiltrating video games like ""World of Warcraft"" in a hunt for terrorists ""hiding in plain sight"" online. That's the finding of the most recent round of documents released by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden to British newspaper The Guardian. Agents from the CIA, FBI and Pentagon and England's Government Communications Headquarters infiltrated WoW and virtual world ""Second Life,"" as well as collecting information on the Xbox Live gaming network, according to the documents. A 2008 NSA memo called online gaming a ""target-rich communications network"" where terrorists could communicate ""in plain sight."" None of the newly leaked documents, published this time in conjunction with ProPublica and the New York Times, mentioned specific terrorist activity foiled via the projects. But apparently so many agents were engaged in playing video games for national security that a ""deconfliction"" group was created to make sure government agents weren't accidentally spying on each other. Unlike traditional console and desktop games in which players compete in a closed environment, massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) allow players from around the world to team up and play together, often in real time using in-game communication tools. ""World of Warcraft"" is the most popular online role-playing game ever. It peaked at about 12 million subscribers in 2010 and still has more than 7 million, according to Blizzard. It's unclear whether the agencies had surveillance capabilities within the massively multi-player games that normal players would not. A spokesman for Blizzard Entertainment, which owns ""World of Warcraft,"" told The Guardian it is unaware of any surveillance having taken place. ""If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission,"" the spokesman said. On Friday, Microsoft announced it was strengthening encryption across many of its services in an effort to push back against ""government snooping."" And Monday, the company joined Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Apple, Twitter and LinkedIn issuing a public statement asking the world's governments to rein in online surveillance. While acknowledging the scope and popularity of online gaming, some security experts were questioning Monday whether spying on digital playgrounds is either wise or effective. ""I think I've heard it all now,"" wrote British security analyst Graham Cluely.

"Mikhail Furtado was extremely worried about his 12th-grade exams. A few days before he was due to get his results, his father walked in and found him dead. ""I opened the cottage door, put the light on and I found him hanging. He was hanging,""  Anthony Furtado says. When the results came out, his father learned that Mikhail had sailed through with good grades. He says he still can't bring himself to go and collect the results. But Furtado is trying to use his devastating experience to benefit others. He provides counseling and is a regular at suicide prevention workshops. ""Sometimes, at the end, I do break down,"" he says. Highest rate in the world among young . The scale of the problem among India's young people is huge. According to a recent World Health Organization report, India has the highest suicide rate in the world for the 15-to-29 age group. It stands at 35.5 per 100,000 people for 2012, the last year for which numbers are available. Across all age groups, nearly 260,000 people in India killed themselves that year. Bobby Zachariah, who runs a suicide prevention group, says he blames a breakdown in India's traditional family structure. ""There were big families, there was a lot of support available,"" he says. ""Nowadays, there is one child in the family,"" Zachariah says. ""And the kind of parenting styles that were applied to them when they were kids doesn't apply to their children any more."" Reducing stigma . Some experts say a key problem is that families brush mental health issues under the carpet rather than facing them head on. ""Mental illness is like any other illness and is treatable,"" says Dr. Arun John of the Vandrevala Foundation, which aims to help people with mental health issues and other problems. This can only be tackled once greater awareness is created, he says, calling for the establishment of helplines. The Indian government took a step toward reducing some of the stigma around suicide this week, making it no longer a crime to attempt it. Officials were acting on a recommendation of a law commission report that said the desire to commit suicide should be seen as a condition needing treatment, not punishment. But in a rapidly developing India, pressures remain high to get good grades and high-paying jobs. ""Parents and schools do not make a child mentally and psychologically strong enough to handle pressure,"" John says. This leads to a ""feeling of worthlessness,"" he adds. 'I'm so much better now' One 20-year-old man in the city of Pune, near Mumbai, talked about reasons behind his brush with death. The man, who declined to be identified, said he never fared well in school and had few friends. He had problems with his girlfriend and felt his parents didn't understand him. In his depression and desperation, he would cut himself, he said, showing the scars. He attempted suicide but was saved by a timely medical intervention. Nowadays, he gets counseling and enjoys playing the guitar. He also counsels others. ""It helps them to know I've been there,"" he says. ""And that I'm so much better now.""","Report: India has the highest suicide rate worldwide for ages 15 to 29 .

They also seem to verify that the latest update to the company's mobile operating system, iOS 8.1, is coming Thursday. Additional details were minimal. The physical designs of the new tablets appear to be largely unchanged from existing iPad models, and the iPad Air 2 is getting a burst photography mode. CEO Tim Cook and crew will still have plenty to talk about at the press conference. Apple is expected to announce new Macs and discuss the latest Apple Pay and OS X Yosemite release dates.

"(CNN) -- The fight to save lives may no longer be the most stressful part of work for some Florida surgeons. Operation Room staff are being fitted with data-collecting RFID chips at the 'Sunshine State' Celebration Health facility. The chips, embedded in regular ID badges, track their movements and time management, feeding into a central database. The Operation Room is a new frontier for a scheme that started in 2011 with the hospital's nursing staff, and has been spreading ever since. Management have been encouraged by the results. ""There was nervousness at first about being tracked,"" says Ashley Simmons, performance manager at the hospital. ""But over time as we showed it was not being used punitively, they adapted very quickly and got into their normal routines."" If the data is effective, those routines will be greatly improved. Based on the feedback received, Simmons says that staff have been located too far from each other and patients, and that the workplace environment is to be modified to improve communication. The figures are also helping to reconstitute shift patterns to best suit staff, who are given access to their performance data and provide input on what their ideal routine would be. The model can facilitate dramatic improvements in efficiency and transparency across the industry, Simmons believes: . ""This gives us the ability to better manage our resources. For a value-based purchasing model, we need to better understand patients and staff to make the right decisions, which other industries have been doing for years. ""Hopefully we can get to a place where we are truly transparent with patients and their families -- where we can allow them to access data and track patients through the OR."" Celebration Health represents the cutting edge of the increasingly pervasive and diffuse field of workforce analytics. From efficiency gains to unmasking misconduct and promoting well-being, the incentives for employers are clear. It is increasingly common for firms to monitor their employees' computers - down to the key stroke - and to rifle through their communications made using company equipment. Tools for monitoring active workers in the field are also developing. GPS tracking is now industry standard for long-haul truck drivers. Ostensibly for the purpose of productivity, and occasionally protection in the case of high-risk cargo, the satellite can paint a vivid picture of the subject's life on the road. Wearable trackers, such as the hospital's RFID tags, can provide even more detail. Major companies such as Amazon and Tesco have fitted their staff with devices that allow micro-analysis of their performance, and are also used to direct them. The reach of quantified health has extended into the workplace. In a pioneering initiative, Autodesk distributed Fitbit devices to provide health and activity feedback for their employees. The company says the benefit is in greater wellbeing for their staff, leading to improved performance, although it acknowledges the data will also save them money on insurance premiums. But if there are disturbing possibilities, the opportunities outweigh the risks, believes Ben Waber, founder of Sociometric Solutions, an offshoot of MIT's Human Dynamics Lab, and a passionate evangelist for the benefits of workforce analytics. The start-up produces arguably the most advanced wearable trackers, including sensors for motion, sound, infra-red, that break down behaviour patterns into granular data. This is gathered on an opt-in basis and is made available to the employees themselves, while management have anonymized, aggregated data to guide improvements. ""You can see the top performers and change behaviour accordingly, to be happier and more productive,"" says Waber. ""In a retail store, you might see that you spend 20% of your time talking to customers, but the guy who makes the most commission spends 30%."" The simple and consistent lessons from the data can have a transformative effect on company culture and practice, Waber believes. ""What's fascinating is that in any industry the interaction between employees is the most important thing that happens at work...The sort of feedback we're giving is 'have lunch with a colleague you haven't met before' or 'only eat lunch with people on your team'. We relate outcomes to behavioural data, which shows the value of relationships between people."" A new paradigm for a worker-oriented ""village"" may sound romantic, but Waber says this is backed up by hard results. ""In Bank of America call centers we have increased performance by 20% and reduced turnover by 28%. But it's not just a case of saving tens of millions of dollars -- I can also point to thousands of people that say they like their job better."" Sociometric's technology has been tested at several dozen companies, and Waber anticipates that half of the Fortune 500 will be using the model within 10 years. But if he is excited about the possibilities, he acknowledges the risk. ""My worry is that some companies come into the space that force people into it, give companies (de-anonymized) data on those people, and then the whole field gets legislated out of existence."" Waber would like to see regulation introduced along the lines of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which precludes medical providers from sharing patient data. But academics specializing in workforce analytics believe it is fraught with ethical issues. ""There are huge concerns over work intensification and increased stress, people have different stress reactions,"" says Professor Kirstie Ball, of the Open University's Center for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy. ""Monitoring raises the stakes in the employment relationship and can have negative effects if it's applied to the wrong activity, which would be better managed qualitatively."" Ball hopes that limits are established for use of data collection. ""Monitoring technology is potentially pervasive into private life, and we do ethically need to think about privacy boundaries, particularly if (the technology) intrudes on the body or social space."" Performance data may also lead to harsher workplace environment, suggests Professor Michael Blakemore of Durham University, author of the 2011 paper 'From Workplace Watch to Social Spy.' ""The technology allows you to get rid of people at the lower end of performance range, which pushes average performance up. You could have what happens in finance with audits on a quarterly basis with the bottom 10% sacked."" Both academics agree with Waber in that legislation is behind the technology, and ill-suited to preventing abuse. Employees are often unaware of their rights to challenge pervasive monitoring, and may be forced into 'hacking' as their only means to avoid it. At the dystopian end of the scale, there are fears that the field could run amok to the point of even allowing chips under the skin, as has been practiced with US patients. For all the possibilities of increased productivity and even well-being, workforce analytics must contend with severe trust issues.

"The revolution will not be televised but it will be tweeted, instant messaged or, in the case of Hong Kong, broadcast on mesh networks like FireChat. FireChat -- an 'off-the-grid' smartphone app -- emerged this month as the technological glue holding Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests together and a powerful weapon in the hands of mass movements, dissidents and protesters. The app works by creating its own network outside the internet, relying simply on the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi link that exist between one phone and another. Unlike mobile and internet networks which come under strain and break down the more users tax the system, the more people in a mesh network like FireChat, the better it works. ""We were pretty much forced to use it almost at the start of the protests because there were just so many people in the protest areas, it made the cell network so slow,"" said Pamela Lam, an 'Occupy Central' pro-democracy activist. ""FireChat doesn't need data to work -- a lot of people were downloading it."" The company that developed the application, Open Garden, initially struggled to keep up with its new-found popularity, adding more capacity as news of the app spread from Hong Kong to rest of the world. Unexpected success . For a start-up that only launched in March this year, the numbers were staggering. In the first two weeks of the protests, between September 27 and October 10, the service registered 500,000 downloads in Hong Kong alone (61% on Android and 39% on iOS), 10.2 million chat sessions and 1.6 million chatrooms. ""We were not expecting this and we were very surprised,"" FireChat marketing chief Christophe Daligault told CNN. ""We saw this enormous surge in our service and realized something really big was happening. ""Now we've seen spikes just about everywhere in the world and there may be two reasons for this. The first is that there are some people who use it to get the latest information about what's happening in Hong Kong and the second are people who just want to see what the fuss is all about."" Chinese language users, in particular, have taken to the app, expressing support for the movement from as far away as Australia and the United States. With the buzz now dying down, Daligault said that the volume of downloads was tailing off but activity is trending up and the chat sessions have got shorter as people keep communications focused on important information. ""What that says to us is that quite a few people are sticking with it,"" Daligault said. 'Giant megaphone' Unlike other messaging applications, FireChat is not limited to a user's circle. What goes up on FireChat is available for everybody to see. ""It's like a giant megaphone,"" he said. ""You could be in a place and shout I'm in this precise location and we need water bottles right now and someone whom you don't know can answer that message  come with those bottles. ""That would be harder to do with Facebook or Whatsapp where you're limited by the people you know as far as the reach of your communication is concerned."" The co-founder and CEO of Open Garden Micha Benoliel happened to be in Hong Kong on a layover when the protests started and extended his stay to get live feedback on the service. Authentic voices . One thing that protesters complained about was that everyone could read the traffic, including opponents of the Occupy movement. Since then FireChat has added a verification component that stamps the messages as coming from a particular user or group. ""Apparently there was misinformation being spread on FireChat and people were putting up scare messages to try to convince people to go home,"" Daligault said. While FireChat became the app of choice in Hong Kong's -- and saw similar success in protests earlier this year in Taiwan -- Daligault said the app was never designed as a messaging tool for protesters. ""What we envisioned was a service that would provide communication for people in places where there was poor connectivity and a large population density. Cities such as New Delhi or Mexico City,"" he said. More options . FireChat is now only one of a number of apps -- Serval Mesh, Commotion and Storymaker - that are competing in the mesh-network services space. A Russian mesh-networking app called Telegram was used in South Korea in May after the government announced a crackdown in response to rumors that were spreading on the Korean homegrown messaging sevice Kakao Talk. As many as 35 million people reportedly used the service, which allows users to erase their messages or chats after a certain length of time. Private messaging is now one of the options that FireChat is developing in the wake of the gigantic beta test its service received in the Hong Kong protests. ""We are working on adding private messaging with encryption. But this will take months, not weeks,"" said Daligault. ""This is much harder than for other communication apps as we need to make this work off the grid."" While FireChat was a useful device for relaying information and encouragement during the early mass protests in Hong Kong, it became less useful once Occupy moved into a game of cat and mouse with the police. ""The problem with FireChat is that everyone around you can get your message, including the police,"" explained Hong Kong-based student Michelle Zheng. ""If you're discussing your deployment through FireChat, the police know straight away where your weak links are."" Read more from Tomorrow Transformed: .

"(CNN) -- This is getting ridiculous. While the threat of Ebola is very real in Africa, the paranoia it's generated in the United States is unreal. You can count the number of documented cases in America on two hands -- and still have fingers to spare. There are eight confirmed cases. And in each one, the patient was either infected in Liberia or Sierra Leone, or had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian returnee who's the sole fatality of the disease in the U.S. Health care professionals, both within the government and those with little reason to parrot a party line, insist that the chances of any of us catching the virus are minuscule. If we really need something to worry about, they say, worry about getting your flu shots. From 1976 through 2007, flu-related causes killed between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the U.S. And yet, the disproportionate hysteria over Ebola multiplies contagiously. Mel Robbins, a CNN commentator and legal analyst, has given it a name: Fear-bola. ""Fear-bola attacks the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking,"" she says. ""It starts with a low-grade concern about the two health care workers diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas and slowly builds into fear of a widespread epidemic in the United States."" Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak . How bad is it? So bad that nearly two thirds of those queried in a Washington Post/ABC News poll said they're concerned about an epidemic in the U.S. So bad that the Centers for Disease Control, in the first week of October, fielded 800 calls from concerned Americans. So bad that even after a Dallas lab worker -- who isolated herself in her cabin during a Carnival Cruise because she may have possibly handled Duncan's clinical specimen -- was cleared, the Moore, Oklahoma, Public Schools asked students and faculty who were on the same cruise not to come to school. Here are some more examples of our overreaction: . From Nigeria? Not this year . Navarro College, a two-year college about 60 miles from Dallas, sent out rejection letters to some applicants from Nigeria because the country had a few Ebola cases. ""With sincere regret, I must report that Navarro College is not able to offer you acceptance for the Spring 2015 term,"" the letter read. ""Unfortunately, Navarro College is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases."" The college called it ""the responsible thing to do."" ""At this time, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to postpone our recruitment in those nations that the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. State Department have identified as at risk."" Incidentally, Nigeria had 19 cases, but none in the last 43 days. In fact, the World Health Organization declared it Ebola-free on Monday. Who shouts 'Ebola' on a plane? Get sick in a parking lot, force a shutdown . A woman boarded a shuttle bus in a Pentagon parking lot Thursday, got off and vomited. A hazmat team responded, the area was cordoned off, military officials going to a Marine Corps ceremony were temporarily quarantined, the woman was put into isolation. A Pentagon spokesman said it was ""out of an abundance of caution."" The woman didn't have Ebola. Get sick on a plane, stay in the bathroom . A passenger who vomited in the aisle of an American Airlines plane from Dallas to Chicago was allegedly told to stay in the lavatory for the rest of the flight. ""They told her to stay in the bathroom, and she stayed in the bathroom,"" Martha Selby, a University of Texas professor who was on the flight, told the Houston Chronicle. ""They said, 'We can't let you out.'"" The airlines told the paper that the woman wanted to stay in the bathroom, and that ""there were no concerns related to Ebola."" The woman didn't have Ebola. Go to a conference, go on leave . An elementary school teacher in Maine was put on 21 days' leave - the incubation period for Ebola -- because she went to Dallas for an education conference. While there, she stayed at a hotel about 10 miles from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where a patient died of the disease. Still, parents were concerned, and the school district said it obliged. Here's how the Portland Press Herald put it into perspective: About 5 million Americans passed through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in August, the latest month for which statistics are available. The woman, of course, didn't have Ebola. What's more contagious than Ebola? Concern about its spread . Go to a funeral, go on vacation . A middle school principal in Hazelhurst, Mississippi, who went to his brother's funeral in Africa is now on a weeklong paid vacation. Why? Because parents pulled their kids out of school Friday once they learned of the trip. And where in Africa did the principal go? Zambia, which has reported a total of zero Ebola cases. The principal didn't have ... you know the rest. Don't like the team, taunt the player . A West African high school soccer player in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, was taunted with chants of ""Ebola"" by players of the opposing team during a game earlier this month. The opposing team's head coach and assistant coach resigned the next day. The player ... so on and so forth. What's more disturbing than Ebola? The outrageous commentary . Yell 'Ebola,' trigger panic . Last week, a masked man in a Los Angeles public bus yelled, ""Don't mess with me, I have Ebola!"" The bus driver was quarantined and the bus taken out of service. The man disappeared. But officials doubt he has Ebola. Pat down = paid leave . A TSA agent at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is now on paid administrative leave because he/she pat down Amber Vinson. She's one of the nurses who contracted Ebola after treating Duncan. And before her illness was apparent, she took a Frontier Airlines flight to Cleveland, then a flight back to Dallas. The agent wore gloves during the pat down, the TSA told Newsnet5 in Cleveland. And yet, the leave was ""out of an abundance of caution."" Never mind that Ebola is only spread through direct contact with blood, sweat, feces, vomit, semen and saliva. And the uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin that would allow entry of the virus. The agent hasn't shown signs of Ebola. Game the system, stoke hysteria . A newly booked inmate in the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas hit on a novel way to be spared the gen pop: Tell the guards you just got back from Africa and you're experiencing Ebola-like symptoms. He was taken away from other inmates to a hospital, the staff put on protective gear, the area was decontaminated, CNN affiliate News 3 reported Sunday. Turns out, the guy not only didn't have Ebola, he's never been out of the U.S., let alone to Africa. ------ . The examples go on and on, and each new day brings a couple of fresh ones. And with flu season coming up -- with its symptoms of fever, ache and fatigue that are very similar to Ebola's -- expect the hysteria to ramp up. ""All we've known of Ebola is that it's some exotic disease in a faraway land that kills people in a very gruesome way. That's all we knew about it -- most Americans did -- until a couple of months ago,"" says CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""So, it's going to take some time to reset some of that thinking."" Until then, perhaps we'll all benefit from this handy quiz: . .","A college sends rejection letters to applicants from Nigeria .
A teacher who went to a conference in Dallas is put on leave .
A principal who went to his brother's funeral in Africa is now on vacation .

"A Philadelphia woman was indicted this week, accused of abducting a 5-year-old girl from her school by posing as her mother, raping her and leaving her barely clothed and crying at a playground. Christina Regusters was charged Monday with aggravated assault, kidnapping, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and several other offenses in the January incident that had police searching door to door and parents clutching their children tightly. The little girl's ordeal began January 14 when a woman wearing a burqa -- a head-to-toe covered garment with a slit for the eyes -- went to a West Philadelphia school shortly after classes started and scribbled her name on a sign-in sheet, police said. The woman did not show identification but said she was the child's mother and wanted to take her out for breakfast. She then proceeded to the child's classroom and asked for the girl by name. The girl was taken to a nearby house. Once inside the home, authorities say, the girl was told to remove her clothing and was given a black T-shirt to wear. She was blindfolded and forced to hide under a bed, they said. At some point, the girl, now 6, was sexually assaulted, police say. A Good Samaritan . The abduction spurred a massive search. Officers searched house to house. The city offered a $10,000 reward. But as night fell that Monday, the efforts to find the girl proved fruitless. The next morning, a sanitation worker walking to his workplace near a city park heard a young girl's pleading voice. ""When I got closer, it sounded clear: 'Help, help,'"" the worker, Nelson Mandela Myers, said at a January news conference. ""When I saw her under the slide, I was shocked,"" he said. ""She was there by herself and only had a shirt on."" Myers alerted police. He received the reward. Regusters was arrested the next month. She worked at a daycare that the girl attended, her lawyer Fred Harrison Jr. told CNN affiliate KYW. But, Harrison said, Regusters was not a ""major participant"" in the incident -- but did not elaborate. Questions raised . The abduction raised questions about the Philadelphia's school district protocol. Policy requires anyone signing out a student to go to the main office and provide identification that matches a list of approved individuals, school officials said. ""It's disturbing that an adult is able to walk into a classroom and have the teacher release the child without knowing who the adult is,"" Fernando Gallard, a school district spokesman said at the time. The family attorney, Tom Kline, says more people need to be charged. ""We look forward to the day when all those involved in this heinous crime against an innocent, precious child will be brought to justice,"" Kline said.","The girl was abducted in January, police say .

"RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated Thursday after addressing a large gathering of her supporters. The bomb explodes near Bhutto's vehicle following a political rally in Rawalpindi. Bhutto died of a gunshot wound to the neck, the Pakistani Interior Ministry said. The attacker then blew himself up. The bomb attack killed at least 22 others, doctors said. Video of the scene just moments before the explosion showed Bhutto stepping into a heavily guarded vehicle to leave the rally.  Watch how the tragedy unfolded Â» . John Moore, a photographer for Getty Images, said Bhutto was standing through the sunroof of her vehicle, waving to supporters, when two shots rang out. Bhutto fell back into the vehicle, and almost immediately a bomb blast rocked the scene, sending twisting metal and shrapnel into the crowd, he added. Police sources told CNN the bomber, who was riding a motorcycle, blew himself up near Bhutto's vehicle. Watch aftermath of the attack. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital -- less than two miles from the bombing scene -- where doctors pronounced her dead. Her body was removed from the hospital -- carried above a crowd of supporters -- late Thursday night, and a Pakistan Air Force plane is flying the body to Sukkur, accompanied by her husband and three children, said Pakistan People's Party leader Sen. Safdar Abbasi. Bhutto is scheduled to be buried in the ancestral graveyard of the Bhutto family at Gari-Khuda Baksh in Sindh province Friday afternoon, he added. Chaos erupted at the hospital when former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif arrived to pay his respects to Bhutto less than three hours after her death. Hundreds of Bhutto supporters crammed into the entrance shouted and cried, some clutching their heads in pain and shock. Sharif called it ""the saddest day"" in Pakistan's history. ""Something unthinkable has happened,"" he said. Watch Benazir Bhutto obituary Â» . Sharif said his party will boycott Pakistan's January 8 parliamentary elections in the wake of the assassination. President Pervez Musharraf said the killers were the same extremists that Pakistan is fighting a war against, and announced three days of national mourning. Police warned citizens to stay home as they expected rioting to break out in city streets in reaction to the death. Rioters burned tires and blocked roads in Karachi and other cities, police sources said. Police fired on an angry mob, killing two people, in the city of Khairpur in the Sindh province, Geo TV reported. Bhutto's husband issued a statement from his home in Dubai saying, ""All I can say is we're devastated, it's a total shock."" He arrived in Pakistan late Thursday.  President Bush said those responsible ""must be brought to justice"" and praised Bhutto as a woman who had ""fought the forces of terror."" He said: ""She refused to allow assassins to dictate the course of her country."" The number of wounded was not immediately known. However, video of the scene showed ambulances lined up to take many to hospitals. The assassination happened in Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh Park, named for Pakistan's first prime minister -- Liaquat Ali Khan -- who was assassinated in the same location in 1951. The attack came just hours after four supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif died when members of another political party opened fire on them at a rally near the Islamabad airport Thursday, Pakistan police said. Several other members of Sharif's party were wounded, police said. Bhutto, who led Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and was the first female prime minister of any Islamic nation, was participating in the parliamentary election set for January 8, hoping for a third term. A terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi killed 136 people on the day she returned to Pakistan after eight years of self-imposed exile. View timeline. Â» . CNN's Mohsin Naqvi, who was at the scene of both bombings, said Thursday's blast was not as powerful as that October attack. Thursday's attacks come less than two weeks after Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf lifted an emergency declaration he said was necessary to secure his country from terrorists. Bhutto had been critical of what she believed was a lack of effort by Musharraf's government to protect her. Two weeks after the October assassination attempt, she wrote a commentary for CNN.com in which she questioned why Pakistan investigators refused international offers of help in finding the attackers. ""The sham investigation of the October 19 massacre and the attempt by the ruling party to politically capitalize on this catastrophe are discomforting, but do not suggest any direct involvement by General Pervez Musharraf,"" Bhutto wrote.

"Rose Anne Schulman has been known to go into the grocery store, buy fried chicken and eat four pieces of it in the parking lot. But that was the old her. Now when she has that craving she buys a rotisserie chicken, takes the skin off and eats only one piece. She doesn't actually know how much weight she's lost over the last year-and-a-half because she previously was too embarrassed to get on a scale. She knows she once wore a size 20. Now she's a size 4. A former dance teacher, Schulman never thought about what she was eating because she burned so many calories with aerobics, jazz, clogging, tap and ballet. Then a broken foot landed her on the couch. She remembers sitting in her house for weeks, eating her sorrows away. ""Every time there was a crisis I turned to food for solace,"" the Atlanta resident says. And once she started, she couldn't stop. Her weight went up and down as her foot healed and her husband recovered from two different life-threatening illnesses. Schulman would lose 20 pounds then put it back on, then lose and gain again. Two years ago, she was shopping for a dress to wear to her son's wedding. Everything she tried on she thought looked like a potato sack. When she finally found a dress, the saleswoman told her it would look better if she lost 5 pounds. Schulman remembers thinking the woman really meant 35 pounds. With five months until the wedding, she went home and decided to try to lose five pounds by watching what she ate. Those five pounds disappeared pretty quickly. She started questioning all her food choices. ""Is it worth it to eat this piece of cake?"" she would ask herself. The answer was usually ""No."" She soon realized she didn't need what she calls the frills, such as croutons and mayonnaise-based dressing on salad. She became more and more careful about what she put in her mouth. She read food labels. She stopped sampling her recipes while cooking. People often say to her, ""You can't lose weight that way,"" she says, and she proudly tells them, ""Yes you can because I did."" Soon that dress for her son's wedding in June 2012 was too big. She needed a size 16 and was elated to fit into a ""normal"" size. ""I didn't look like the fat lady anymore, but I didn't look like the skinny lady either,"" she says. She kept at it by making simple changes -- a strategy she continues today. At breakfast, for example, she'll go for low sugar instant oatmeal, which is 110 calories instead of 160 calories for the regular packet. All those extra calories add up over the course of a year, Schulman says, and to save them you aren't really giving up anything. upwave: Try it now! Cut back on added sugar . Portion control is also important, she says. Instead of eating a sandwich or two for lunch, she has soup and tuna salad or cottage cheese. Because she lacks discipline, she buys individual cups of cottage cheese instead of a big container to prevent herself from eating twice as much as she should. She wants people to know eating healthy doesn't have to be horrible: ""You just have to think about what you are doing."" These days she doesn't even have the urge to eat anything fattening, although she did enjoy some chocolate cake with ice cream on her birthday. She shared it with her husband, Alan, who is also reaping the benefits of his wife's change in lifestyle. Alan has lost 85 pounds. Schulman lost 25 pounds before she even added exercise into the equation. Now she takes a Zumba class twice a week and walks several miles to and from her synagogue to attended religious services on Saturday. She says that walk is much easier at her current size than it used to be. She's tried other exercise routines such as walking on the treadmill, but says that bores her and she ends up going home and eating afterward. One year after trying to take off five pounds to fit into that size 20 dress, Schulman was wearing a size 8. On a recent shopping trip, she came out of the fitting room in a dress and the saleswoman told her it was too big. Schulman laughed and showed the woman a picture of the old her. Then she bought a size 4. She says she was happy when she got down to a size 10, but she's happier at a size 4. ""This is the first time in my life that I feel like I don't need to lose weight,"" she says. Schulman, now 65, worries about gaining the weight back but knows it's different this time. She's still getting used to her new body but says it's definitely not temporary. ""I didn't go on a diet,"" she says. ""I changed my lifestyle.""","Rose Anne Schulman wore a size 20; now she's a size 4 .

"The U.S. drone killing of American-born and -raised Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a major figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has re-energized a national debate over the legal and moral quandaries of a government deliberately killing a citizen. The issue has been roiling throughout the U.S. campaign against terrorism, but Friday's drone missile killing of al-Awlaki and a second American, Samir Khan, provided a stark, concrete case of a U.S. policy that authorizes death for terrorists, even when they're Americans, analysts said. A government source who was briefed Friday morning by the CIA confirmed the U.S. missile strike, which killed two other people in a car in Yemen. While President Obama on Friday applauded the U.S. action as ""a major blow"" against al Qaeda, civil libertarians assailed the U.S. decision to kill a citizen. ""The targeted killing program violates both U.S. and international law,"" ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement. ""As we've seen today, this is a program under which American citizens far from any battlefield can be executed by their own government without judicial process, and on the basis of standards and evidence that are kept secret not just from the public but from the courts."" Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul denounced Obama for ""assassinating"" al-Awlaki, saying that the American cleric should have been tried in a U.S. court. ""If the American people accept this blindly and casually, that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys. I think it's sad,"" Paul told reporters after a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, Friday. ""Al-Awlaki was born here, he's an American citizen, he was never tried or charged for any crimes,"" Paul said. ""To start assassinating American citizens without charges - we should think very seriously about this."" But U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York,  chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the lethal strike was lawful. ""It was entirely legal. If a citizen takes up arms against his own country, he becomes an enemy of the country. The president was acting entirely within his rights and I fully support the president,"" King said. Al-Awlaki was believed by U.S. authorities to have inspired acts of terrorism against the United States, including a fatal shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, and the December 25 bombing attempt to bring down an airliner flying to Detroit. His facility with English and technology made him one of the top terrorist recruiters in the world, and he was considered the public face of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. Ed Husain: U.S. shouldn't have killed al-Awlaki . Al-Awlaki was killed about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the Yemeni town of Khashef, east of the capital, Sanaa, said Mohammed Basha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. In what one source called a joint U.S. military-intelligence operation, the strike was launched at 9:55 a.m. Friday, officials said. Also killed was Khan, an American of Pakistani origin, who specialized in computer programming for al Qaeda and authored the terrorist network's online magazine, Inspire, officials said. Much controversy preceded the fatal drone strike. Al-Awlaki's father even sued Obama, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and former CIA Director Leon Panetta to prevent them from having his son killed, but last December, a federal judge threw out the ""unique and extraordinary"" suit, leaving open the question of whether the U.S. government can legally target American citizens for death abroad without a trial. Panetta: It was legal to kill al-Awlaki . U.S. District Court Judge John Bates dismissed the case on procedural grounds, saying that Nasser al-Awlaki did not have standing to sue and that the officials were immune from such lawsuits anyway. Last year, Dennis Blair, director of U.S. national intelligence, told Congress that the government has the right to kill American citizens abroad if they present a direct threat to U.S. security. ""We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community,"" Blair told a House intelligence committee. ""If that direct action -- we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Friday that the wartime dilemma pivots on how the terrorists targeted by the American military don't have a practical access to U.S. courts to challenge their listing on a government kill list. ""The Obama administration says it is authorized by Congress"" to issue an order to kill or capture al-Awlaki, Toobin said. ""One of the very important things to point out about this whole legal controversy is that it's never been in court. ""No judge has ever evaluated it, and because of the weird legal setting, it's not clear that a court ever will. When you think about Osama bin Laden, Awlaki, they don't really have the opportunity to go to an American courtroom,"" Toobin said. Al-Awlaki's father's legal challenge was thrown out of court because it was the son -- not the father -- who was on the kill list, and so the dad didn't have standing, Toobin said. ""I cannot conceive of how any of these people could ever really get access to an American courtroom,"" Toobin said. ""Will a court ever judge thumbs up, thumbs down on this policy? Frankly, I doubt it."" But Mary Ellen O'Connell, an expert on international law at the University of Notre Dame, said the key question concerned not citizenship but location. ""The real concern is where is this person?' she said. ""He is not in an armed conflict zone, not in a battle zone."" Al-Awlaki should have been arrested, she said. ""It's basic law, it's basic morality, that you do not kill people without warning in non-battlefield situations. International law is clear about where a battlefield is and is not. We don't get to just make it up because we particularly dislike this guy and we want to declare where he is suddenly a battle zone without doing the hard work of a country to arrest him and put him on trial."" International law, she said, says a battlefield where a person can be killed without warning ""is a place where there's intense, organized, inter-group fighting; that was not the situation."" She said the United States was supposed to be leading the world in moving toward more human rights, more zones of peace and more use of law enforcement to respond to criminal suspects, but that hasn't proven to be the case. ""Instead, it started with the Bush administration but, ironically and even more damagingly, the Obama administration has carried this forward. In fact they're doing far more killing away from battlefields than ever occurred in the Bush administration."" She said people tend to cooperate more with authorities when they know an individual is going to get a fair trial instead of a summary execution. But Panetta, who is now defense secretary, showed no regret. ""This individual was clearly a terrorist and yes he was a citizen, but if you're a terrorist, you're a terrorist. That means that we have the ability to go after those who would threaten to attack the United States and kill Americans. There's no question that the authority and the ability to go after a terrorist is there."" Al-Awlaki was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and lived in the United States until the age of 7, when his family returned to Yemen. He returned to the United States in 1991 for college and remained until 2002. It was during that time that as an imam in California and Virginia, al-Awlaki preached to and interacted with three of the men who went on to become hijackers in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to the 9/11 Commission Report. He publicly condemned the attacks afterward.","""You do not kill people without warning in non-battlefield situations,"" law expert says .

"(CNN)Monica Lewinsky told an audience in Philadelphia on Monday that her new mission in life was to end cyberbullying. Her speech -- and her goal -- come as the former White House intern steps into the public eye after years of trying to live privately. ""Having survived myself, what I want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive, too,"" she told the audience at Forbes' 30 Under 30 summit. ""I want to put my suffering to good use and give purpose to my past."" Lewinsky, who as an intern in 1995 had an affair with President Bill Clinton, said she was ""patient zero"" of online harassment. ""There was no Facebook, Twitter or Instagram back then,"" she said. ""But there were gossip, news and entertainment websites replete with comment sections and emails which could be forwarded. Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went. A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly 'social media'."" Lewinsky became emotional when describing the months after her 1998 scandal with the president, when national attention was fixed on her. ""Staring at the computer screen, I spent the day shouting: 'oh my god!' and 'I can't believe they put that in' or 'That's so out of context,'"" she said. ""And those were the only thoughts that interrupted a relentless mantra in my head: 'I want to die.'"" Lewinsky also recapped her affair with Clinton. ""Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college, a 22 year old intern in the White House -- and more than averagely romantic -- I fell in love with my boss in a 22-year old sort of way. It happens,"" Lewinsky said. ""But my boss was the president of the United States. That probably happens less often. Now I deeply regret it for many reasons, not the least of which is that people were hurt. And that is never okay."" The former White House intern -- who since has received a masters from the London School of Economics and tried her hand as a purse designer -- said the affair was ""my everything."" Lewinsky, however, struck a resilient tone, according to Forbes, and focused on what she wants to do going forward: End cyberbullying. The former White House intern has said in past interviews and essays that she feels a connection with people who have been caught up in online scandals that forever changed their lives. In a May Vanity Fair piece, where she discussed life after her affair with Clinton, Lewinsky cited the 2010 Tyler Clementi case as the reason she was going public with her cause. Clementi was a freshman at Rutgers who committed suicide after his roommate secretly used a webcam to stream his sexual encounter. ""My own suffering took on a different meaning,"" Lewinsky wrote about her reaction to the Clementi case. ""Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?"" In the piece, Lewinsky said her new goal was to ""get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums."" Lewinsky's speech comes on the same day that she joined Twitter, a move that is just the latest step in Lewinsky's re-entry into public life.","Monica Lewinsky said Monday that her new goal was to end cyberbullying.

"Even in the Bible Belt, coroners don't use the word ""miracle"" lightly. But Holmes County, Mississippi, Coroner Dexter Howard has no qualms using the word for the resurrection, as it were, of Walter Williams, who was declared dead Wednesday night. Howard received the call from Williams' hospice nurse, who told Howard that the 78-year-old had passed away. A family member called as well, saying the same, Howard said. Howard and Byron Porter from Porter & Sons Funeral Home in Lexington, Mississippi, drove to Williams' home to collect the body for funeral preparations. Howard checked Williams' pulse about 9 p.m. and pronounced him dead. ""There was no pulse. He was lifeless,"" Howard said. The coroner completed his paperwork, placed Williams in a body bag and transported him to the funeral home, he said. There, something strange happened: The body bag moved. ""We got him into the embalming room and we noticed his legs beginning to move, like kicking,"" Howard said. ""He also began to do a little breathing."" They immediately called an ambulance. Paramedics arrived and hooked Williams up to monitors. Sure enough, he had a heartbeat, so they transported him to the Holmes County Hospital and Clinics. ""They were in shock. I was in shock. I think everybody at the hospital was in shock,"" Howard said. Howard is an elected official and not a doctor.  More than 1,500 counties in the United States elect coroners and most don't require medical degrees. Neither in his 12 years as county coroner nor during his decade as deputy coroner has Howard seen anything like it. Howard was absolutely certain Williams was dead. The only reasonable explanation he could think of, Howard said, is that Williams' defibrillator, implanted beneath the skin on his chest, jump-started his heart after he was placed in the body bag. ""It could've kicked in, started his heart back,"" Howard said. ""The bottom line is it's a miracle."" Overjoyed family members are thanking God for saving the life of the longtime farmer they call ""Snowball."" ""So it was not my daddy's time,"" daughter Martha Lewis told CNN affiliate WJTV. ""I don't know how much longer he's going to grace us and bless us with his presence, but hallelujah, we thank Him right now!"" Nephew Eddie Hester told CNN affiliate WAPT he was at Williams' Lexington home when Howard and Porter zipped up the body bag, so he was more than a little stunned when his cousin called at 2:30 a.m. Thursday and told him, ""Not yet."" ""What you mean not yet?"" Hester recalled asking his cousin. ""He said, 'Daddy's still here.' "" ""I don't know how long he's going to be here, but I know he's back right now. That's all that matters,"" Hester told WAPT. Howard visited Williams on Thursday at the hospital and said he was still ""a little weak"" but was surrounded by family members and talking. Mike Murphy, the coroner for Clark County, Nevada, and past president of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners, said he couldn't comment on this specific case without knowing all the details, but he's read news reports of people returning to life at funeral homes ""from time to time."" Asked if he'd ever heard of a case in which a defibrillator played a role in bringing someone back to life, Murphy said he hadn't, ""but just because I haven't heard it doesn't mean it hasn't happened.""","Mississippi man declared dead Wednesday, returns to life Thursday, coroner says .

"In London on Tuesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for more Western involvement in Syria to fight ISIS, and praised the U.S.'s British allies for everything from their love of defending freedom to the boy band One Direction. Perry's foreign policy address at the Royal United Services Institute, a British national security think tank, was greeted with laughs and applause -- especially when he highlighted reasons Americans get along so well with their English-speaking friends across the pond. ""It's not just because to Americans, you always sound so darn smart and refined no matter what you're saying,"" he said. ""And it's not just because of your many cultural exports from James Bond to Julie Andrews to Simon Cowell to One Direction -- well, that might be a bit of a mixed bag. So many good things in the world began in Britain, and so many good things in the world to this day depend on Britain."" Perry's stop in London comprises the first leg of his European excursion this week, which also includes visits to Germany, Poland and Ukraine. The purpose of his trip is to explore trade opportunities between Texas and the European countries, according to a press release from Perry's office. His decision to travel away from Texas as a second case of Ebola was diagnosed there has drawn the ire of top Texas Democratic party operative Will Hailer, who called the governor an ""irresponsible leader,"" according to Bloomberg news. Perry, referring to himself as a ""proud patriotic Texan,"" outlined a moral argument in favor of robust Western intervention in Syria by drawing a stark contrast between the ""so-called religious warriors of ISIS"" and the ""special strength and character"" of Western forces. ""To see to it that security is defended -- that is what is required of Western nations and the great alliances we have formed,"" he said, admitting that the overseas conflict ""will draw heavily on our wealth, our will and our wisdom."" ""The plainest imperative of all is the resources we commit to the common defense, holding nothing back if it will better insure our security."" He called out his political adversaries at home -- and even the United Nations -- for their reluctance to get involved in foreign affairs. ""This attitude of cultural relativism, it certainly doesn't approve of harsher violent actions,"" he said, ""but it does question the right of Britain, the U.S. or other western powers to do anything about it."" Toward the latter half of his address, Perry got emotional about the plight of innocent people living in the Middle Eastern war zone, lowering his voice and pausing periodically for effect. ""Who cannot identify with the mother or the father running with their baby, or with an elderly woman who is struggling to keep up with the others?"" he asked, drawing similarities between Syrian civilians and victims of bombings over London during World War II. ""Who can't identify with the children who got away but saw what happened to their parents?"" ""And when they look up and they see and RAF or a Danish or an American bomber, they feel precisely as you and I would feel. The sight must seem like an answer to a prayer, a prayer that can be understood in every faith: Save my family. Save my home. Save my village. Save me from this evil.""","Texas Gov.

"The National Security Agency's internal watchdog detailed a dozen instances in the past decade in which its employees intentionally misused the agency's surveillance power, in some cases to snoop on their love interests. A letter from the NSA's inspector general responding to a request by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, lists the dozen incidents where the NSA's foreign intelligence collection systems were abused. The letter also says there are two additional incidents now under investigation and another allegation pending that may require an investigation. At least six of the incidents were referred to the Justice Department for possible prosecution or additional action; none appear to have resulted in charges. The letter doesn't identify the employees. Several of the cases involve so-called ""Loveint"" violations. In one case, detailed by the NSA's watchdog, a civilian intelligence employee assigned overseas was found to have used the NSA's signals intelligence collection system to listen to the phone conversations on nine phone numbers belonging to foreign women from 1998 to 2003 without any valid reason. The signals intelligence system is used to spy on foreign targets for national security reasons. Yahoo and Facebook ask for more NSA transparency . The case began because a woman, a foreign national employed by the U.S. government, told another employee she suspected the man with whom she was in a sexual relationship was listening to her calls. The employee who misused the NSA's systems also incidentally collected the communications of a U.S. resident on two occasions, a move that requires a court warrant. The NSA's vast surveillance powers are under fire after the disclosure of internal documents by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Intelligence officials have sought to defend the NSA's surveillance activities by saying the agency doesn't misuse its authority. Grassley wrote to the NSA last month seeking to find out how often the NSA's authorities are misused. ""I appreciate the transparency that the Inspector General has provided to the American people,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""We shouldn't tolerate even one instance of misuse of this program. Robust oversight of the program must be completed to ensure that both national security and the Constitution are protected."" NSA violated phone rules, misinformed secret court . In many cases the employees who intentionally abused the NSA's spying systems resigned before they could be punished. Several were demoted in rank or otherwise sanctioned. In one 2004 case, a civilian employee told NSA security that she had spied on a foreign phone number because she found it on her husband's cell phone and suspected he was being unfaithful. She collected his phone calls. The employee's infraction was referred to the Justice Department, but she resigned before she could be fired. Some of the violations appear to have been uncovered by the NSA's own auditing systems.Others were self-reported, including one during a polygraph of an employee. One employee violated NSA's rules on the first day he had access to the agency's signals intelligence collection system. He queried six e-mail addresses belonging to a former girlfriend. He told investigators he wanted ""to practice on the system"" using his former girlfriend's e-mail addresses and that he received no information, and hadn't read any emails. He was demoted and his pay was reduced, and the NSA's inspector general recommended he not be given a security clearance.","The agency found at least 12 cases of misuse .

"Concepcion, Chile (CNN) -- The death toll in Chile was revised downward Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of dead in the Maule region. Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende said the casualty count in Maule, originally reported at 587, included more than 200 people who are missing but not confirmed dead. Therefore, the official nationwide death toll is lower than the 802 figure given by emergency authorities. In an attempt to reduce confusion, Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans who had been killed and identified by Thursday evening. He said he would update that official number regularly. This new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims. With disasters of this magnitude, ""the number of dead change daily,"" Rosende said. ""It takes months sometimes to compile the information because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene."" Rosende also announced that President Michelle Bachelet has called for three days of national mourning, beginning Sunday. He called Chileans to fly the country's flag outside their homes as a sign of solidarity for the earthquake's victims. Bachelet toured devastated parts of central and southern Chile on Thursday, five days after the 8.8-magnitude earthquake. Bachelet first visited the battered seaport of Talcahuano, where a quake-induced tsunami roared through many parts of the city. See scenes of devastation . Wearing a blue windbreaker and surrounded by military, local dignitaries and TV cameras, Bachelet walked for several blocks before stopping to make a lengthy statement. ""This is the time for action,"" Bachelet said upon her return to the capital Thursday afternoon, where she met with leaders of the Catholic Church. The church has been a partner in providing help in the quake's aftermath. The top priority remained the needs of those affected, followed by reconstruction efforts, the president said. ""Despite the adversity, despite the challenges, Chile will come out on top,"" she said. Monsignor Alejandro Goic shared a note from Pope Benedict XVI expressing sadness for the tragedy and supporting the Chilean people. ""This is the time for unity,"" Goic said. Talcahuano, the nearby city of Concepcion and other parts of the region were the hardest-hit areas and the scene of days of looting and lawlessness. Many residents, including the mayor of Concepcion, complained that federal aid was slow in arriving. Some aid still had not arrived Thursday. ""Today we have not received one measure of water from the National Emergency Office, understanding that there are some difficulties,"" said Eduardo Soto, mayor of Rancagua in central Chile. Bachelet dispatched more than 13,000 soldiers and other military personnel to restore order in the area. Food and water started to arrive late Tuesday in Concepcion, and officials said they distributed 3,500 aid packages on Wednesday. She later toured Talca, another devastated area. Watch rescue efforts under way . President-elect Sebastian Pinera does not take office until March 11, but he named six officials Thursday to head up recovery efforts. ""Our government will not be a government of the earthquake,"" Pinera said in a speech in which he named the six individuals. ""Our government will be a government of reconstruction."" In other developments, the Chilean Davis Cup tennis team will open competition in Coquimbo, Chile, against Israel on Saturday, not on Friday. Team officials and players said they would be playing in honor of the quake's victims and that they hope to bring the country happiness. ""It will be difficult, but we will do our best for our country,"" said player Fernando Gonzalez. Also Thursday, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake hit northern Chile, the opposite part of the country devastated by last week's quake. No immediate reports of damage or injuries have been made. A telethon, dubbed ""Chile Helps Chile"" by organizers, was slated for Friday to raise funds for quake victims. Bachelet's visits to the hard-hit areas came a few hours after new tremors rocked parts of Chile early Thursday. A 4.9-magnitude aftershock struck near the already devastated Maule region about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It came hours after a 6.1-magnitude aftershock struck near Valparaiso, raising fears that already vulnerable buildings could topple. More than 120 aftershocks of 5.0 magnitude or greater have hit Chile since Saturday's earthquake, USGS geophysicist Don Blakeman said. Concepcion is less than 10 miles inland from Talcahuano, but the two towns suffered very different fates. In Concepcion, fatalities and injuries resulted largely from buildings that had collapsed. Ninety-two people died in Concepcion, police commander Eliecer Solar Rojas told reporters Thursday morning. In coastal Talcahuano, the damage was caused by a tsunami that roared into town about an hour after the quake. When the waters receded, they left large boats stranded inland. In one spot, four shrimping vessels were stacked on top of each other. Much of the port city looked as if a bomb had exploded in it, with buildings reduced to rubble. Full coverage of Chile's earthquake . The greatest number of deaths occurred in the Maule region, where disaster also visited two cities in different ways. In the central city of Talca, an ancient municipality, the earthquake wiped out many older adobe structures, crushing hundreds of residents. Thursday's early morning aftershock struck about 40 miles north of Talca. In the seaside town of Constitucion, survivors tried to hold on to the little that remained. Saturday's earthquake had flattened rows and rows of homes, leaving a path of destruction that led to the sea. Many residents had left, but Sofia Monsalve Gutierrez and Emilio Gutierrez stayed near the concrete slab that used to be their home. On Wednesday, they were searching for their 4-year-old son. They had not seen him since he ran from their home and jumped into a boat during the massive earthquake. ""If you know my son, please keep pictures of him. I don't have any pictures left of him. It's very important to me,"" the mother said. CNN's Sara Sidner, David Ariosto and Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.","NEW: Casualty count in Maule includes people who are missing but not confirmed dead .

"The Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown didn't stop him because he was suspected in a convenience-store robbery, but because he was ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic,"" the city's police chief said Friday. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson -- hours after documents came out labeling the 18-year-old Brown as the ""primary suspect"" in the store theft --  told reporters the ""robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown."" So why did Ferguson police opt to release surveillance video of the convenience-store incident Friday -- the same day they named, six days after the shooting, the white police officer who fatally shot the African-American teenager -- if the two situations aren't related? Jackson said he distributed the store videotape ""because the press asked for it,"" noting he couldn't withhold it indefinitely. The chief added ""we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting,"" though he didn't elaborate on why. Identifying the officer was one key demand of demonstrators, along with pressing for other details on the shooting amid allegations of a police coverup. The flurry of details Friday added intrigue and, in some ways, anger to a case that's spurred protests in the St. Louis suburb and beyond among those upset by Brown's shooting and what they decry as a heavy-handed police response afterward. Brown's family wasn't told ahead of time anything about the robbery or store surveillance video, family lawyer Benjamin Crump told CNN's Jake Tapper. Regardless, whatever happened there doesn't matter, said Eric Davis, a cousin of Brown's mother. ""It's a diversion, and it's an attempt to smear Michael's character,"" said Davis, who added the family has ""not been happy"" with the Ferguson police department's handling of the case. ""... It (should be) more about what happened on Canfield Drive, where Michael was executed."" The man heading security in Ferguson amid the unrest -- Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson -- stated the robbery and shooting of Brown ""are separate issues."" ""I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go,"" he told CNN on Friday evening. ""Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family."" Hours earlier, in video captured by CNN affiliate KSDK, Johnson emphasized authorities have an obligation to be upfront, not to say ""some things and now everybody says, 'what does that mean?'"" ""I think if we're going to give answers, we need to not give hints,"" Johnson said. ""We need to say it."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Chief: Police officer involved in shooting 'a gentleman' Police identified the officer who shot Michael Brown as 28-year-old Darren Wilson -- a six-year police veteran, including four years with the Ferguson force. Authorities had refused to name him, citing threats to his safety. The fact they have now done so satisfies a major demand of protesters. But many remain perturbed that additional details have not come out about Brown's shooting. What the police chief did do on Friday was express ""every confidence"" in Wilson, who had one side of his face swollen in his encounter with Brown, according to authorities. ""He (is) a gentleman ... a quiet officer,"" Jackson said. The entire situation is ""devastating, it's absolutely devastating"" to Wilson. Much more information was provided about the reported convenience store robbery. That includes the surveillance video, which shows a large African-American man pushing aside a smaller man who seemingly tries to stop him, then leaving the store. Crump said the larger man ""appears to be"" Michael Brown. Newly released police documents claim the teenager roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with the box of Swisher Sweets. Read the police documents . The cost for the box of cigars, according to the documents: $48.99. Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, told CNN that Wilson confronted Brown for being in the road, not the robbery. ""I guess that is when he might have seen ... evidence and connected it"" to the robbery, Jackson said -- without explicitly tying the two incidents together himself. Relative: Actions 'fueled the distrust' toward police . A key complaint of protesters has been -- while police have said the shooting occurred during a struggle for the officer's gun -- witnesses say the officer shot Brown as the teenager stood with his hands in the air. Tiffany Mitchell, who saw what happened, told CNN that ""it looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in."" Instead, a shot went off, the teen broke free, and the officer got out of the vehicle and ran about 20 feet in pursuit, she and co-worker Piaget Crenshaw said. Another man, Dorian Johnson, said he was with Brown at the time of the shooting and that police shot Brown without provocation. ""We wasn't committing any crime, bringing no harm to nobody, but my friend was murdered in cold blood,"" he told CNN affiliate KMOV. Jackson confirmed to reporters Friday that Johnson, at least, ""did not commit a crime and was not complicit in a crime."" The information released Friday seems unlikely to quell the anger in the eastern Missouri city or elsewhere. Eric Davis, speaking for Brown's family, expects the opposite will be the case -- even as he stressed that any protests must remain peaceful. ""This (police) chief ... is just inciting the crowd and making everybody angry,"" Davis said. ""It just fueled the distrust that was already out there for the Ferguson police department."" Yet there were also some who said the robbery is not necessarily irrelevant to what happened next. ""A robbery doesn't justify shooting Mike Brown, but it definitely changes your perspective on his mindset at the time of police encounter,"" read one Twitter post from @OneTermTooMany. Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting . 'Police chiefs are watching' The full, complicated story has stirred an intense, nationwide discussion on race in the United States, and on the shooting itself as well as the response to demonstrators afterward. Accusers accused some protesters of violence and looting, while many on the other side have ripped what they call an over-the-top, militarized police response. So what's next? There's still the possibility that action -- including, potentially, criminal charges -- could be taken against Officer Wilson. Then there's the potential for political fall-out affecting Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon or Ferguson's police chief. And there's still a lot of anger about the shooting and the ensuing police response, and there are many angry people on the streets. A major rally is set for Sunday to demand action by authorities. ""This situation has been handled very badly,"" civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said Friday from Ferguson. ""People here must turn their pain into power."" Undeterred by rain, people still made their voices heard Friday night on the streets of Ferguson -- some raising their hands up high, like they say Brown did before being shot dead by Officer Wilson. ""It's tragic what happened, but we're all united and working together,"" said Tiffany Greene. ""It's not a race thing, it's a right-or-wrong thing."" The scene -- which mixed in chants and sign-holders with live music -- was a stark contrast to earlier in the week. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and armored equipment, and accused some protesters of throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. One demonstrator, Charla Griffin, noted the peaceful and communal nature of Friday's gatherings, saying, ""We're having a good time in the name of Michael Brown."" It's seemingly no coincidence that things calmed calmed significantly Thursday, which was the day the state highway patrol took over security. Rather than confront protesters, Johnson figuratively and literally has embraced them. Talking later to CNN, the highway patrol captain said he thinks this whole ordeal -- as it relates to race relations between communities and law enforcement, as well as how authorities respond to protests -- ""will create change throughout our nation."" For example, he expects there will be talk about diversity training and tactics. ""This is all over the world, and I think police chiefs are watching -- deciding what they need to do and what they need to do better,"" he said.

"(CNN)Mystery surrounds the fiery weekend death of Jessica Chambers, but the Mississippi teen may have given firefighters a clue in her killing, a prosecutor said Wednesday. The volunteer fire department that responded to her car blaze Saturday night got there quickly because it was at another call a couple of miles away, said John Champion, district attorney for Mississippi's 17th Circuit. When firefighters arrived at the scene near Courtland, Mississippi, Chambers approached one of them and spoke. She was not on fire, as has been widely reported, the prosecutor said. Champion didn't divulge what she said but told CNN, ""It has certainly given us a lead we're following up on."" Chambers, 19, was loved by everyone who knew her, older sister Amanda Prince told CNN's Don Lemon. ""She was crazy. Very athletic. Outgoing. She was just ... Jessica,"" Prince said. ""She was happy all the time. She made everybody laugh."" Prince said her sister had talked about becoming a nurse and also wanted to become an author. Investigators looking at cell phone . Though authorities are releasing sparse details of the crime and investigation, they have determined an accelerant was used in the blaze, but it's not clear whether the accelerant was poured on the car or Chambers herself, Champion said. The state fire marshal is processing the evidence to determine what type of accelerant, and it's possible the evidence will need to be sent to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Atlanta, he said. Prince said she was told the attacker had gotten into the car and set Chambers on fire inside the vehicle. Peter Odom, an attorney who prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" that investigators are looking for something in particular when they interview people involved in the case. ""They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,"" he said. Investigators believe her phone will be ""the key to everything,"" the prosecutor said. She received a call before she left her house, he said. An autopsy was performed but results have not been made public. Sister: She was supposed to come home . Despite reports she was going to a party, her appearance -- her hair was in a bun and she was wearing camouflage pajama pants -- suggests that wasn't the case, Champion said. Police have also spoken to partygoers, who don't recall seeing her there, he said. Prince said her sister called their mother from a gas station and said she would be home right after she cleaned her car. The prosecutor also said investigators found no evidence in a store surveillance video that appears to show Chambers prepaying for gas. She walks to the store's front door when something or someone catches her attention. She waves and walks off camera briefly, comes back into the camera's view, enters the store where three men chat by the doorway and spends about a minute at the counter before going back outside and pumping gas. The business, which Champion characterized as a rural mom-and-pop store, is about 2 miles from Chambers' home. She purchased something to drink there, the prosecutor said. The clerk who helped her said nothing seemed out of sorts. ""She seemed normal,"" Ali Alsanai told CNN affiliate WREG. ""She didn't seem like something was going wrong, you know? She just seemed normal. She just pumped some gas, we had a talk, and she left."" A Facebook page titled Justice for Jessica has drawn more than 75,000 likes and that number was climbing rapidly Wednesday. The page states it was created ""to keep Jessica's name alive & out there."" ""They have ripped everything I have,"" Jessica's mother, Lisa Chambers, told CNN affiliate WMC. CNN's Steve Almasy, Dave Alsup and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report .","Jessica Chambers' words to firefighters have ""certainly given us a lead,"" prosecutor says .

"The 71-year-old ex-police officer accused of shooting dead a man inside a Florida movie theater won't get the chance to go home -- at least for now -- after a judge Friday decided not to grant him bail. Judge Pat Siracusa made his decision after two days of wrenching, evocative, at times seemingly contradictory testimony inside a Dade City, Florida, courtroom. ""The state did, in fact, meet their standard,"" Siracusa said of prosecutors argument that Curtis Reeves shouldn't be allowed to post bond. ""And I am going to detain Mr. Reeves, pretrial. He will remain in custody."" Reeves' lawyer signaled his intention to appeal a decision that -- while not unexpected, given this is a homicide case -- he believes is unwarranted. The attorney, Richard Escobar, said that he's optimistic about not only the appeal on bail, but that a jury of six citizens will side with his client. ""Mr. Reeves is truly an innocent man,"" Escobar told reporters. ""And we look forward to proving that at a jury trial at some point."" The widow of the man that Reeves killed, meanwhile, applauded Siracusa's decision. ""I'm just very happy and relieved,"" Nicole Oulson said. ""... I have no doubt in my mind that it was the right decision."" No threats before shooting, widow says . Was it self-defense or an overreaction? As Siracusa took pains to point out, his opting not to grant bail has nothing to do with his or others assessment of Reeves' guilt or innocence. That won't happen until trial. The date for that hasn't been set, though Siracusa did schedule the next pretrial hearing for March 12. That falls on one day under two full months since Chad Oulson was shot dead inside the Grove 16 theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel. Was the younger, more physically imposing Oulson killed in self-defense, as Reeves' lawyer claims? Or did Reeves overreact -- to the idea that Oulson was texting his toddler daughter as movie previews played -- by taking out his gun inside the theater and firing, as the prosecution argues? The bail hearing, which began Wednesday and resumed Friday after a day off, served almost as a mini-trial in itself. Both sides called witnesses, then often strongly challenged those put on the stand by the other side. Reeves' daughter, Jennifer Shaw, testified that her father was supportive and even-keeled, having never erupted in anger at a stranger from her recollection. The prosecution called a number of people who'd been in the Florida theater the afternoon of January 13. Charles Cummings talked about overhearing Reeves and Oulson talking, and at one point, the latter said, ""I'm just texting my 2-year-old daughter."" Soon after that, a ""very agitated"" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later. At that point, a fairly calm Oulson -- according to Mark Douglas Turner, a retired Air Force veteran who worked as a clandestine officer -- asked aloud whether he could check a voice mail from his daughter's babysitter. The situation devolved after more words were exchanged. Alan Hamilton, an off-duty Sumter County sheriff's corporal, said he heard Oulson say, ""I am trying to text my f**king daughter, if you don't mind"" -- using graphic language that Reeves' lawyer said suggested Oulson was angry and threatening. Popcorn flew in Reeves' direction soon thereafter. ""And almost immediately,"" recalled Turner, who said Oulson threw the bag, ""the gun comes out and there are shots fired."" Reeves to police: Oulson 'scared the crap out of me' Hamilton testified that, soon thereafter, Reeves' wife told her husband ""that was no cause to shoot anyone."" Reeves responded by pointing his finger at her and saying, according to Hamilton, ""You shut your f**king mouth and don't say another word."" On Friday, those in the Dade City courtroom got to hear from Reeves himself -- not because he took the stand, but because audio of his interview with police was played in court. During that interview, Reeves told police he had ""reason to believe (Oulson) was going to kick my ass"" after Reeves confronted the 43-year-old Navy veteran over his texting during the previews to ""Lone Survivor."" Widow: 'My whole world just got shattered' Reeves and his wife both told police that Oulson began using foul language, and Reeves left to talk to a theater manager. When he returned, Oulson stood up and turned to confront Reeves, he said. ""I see that he's very explosive, unnecessarily,"" Reeves told police. ""It scared the crap out of me."" Oulson edged toward Reeves -- and ""he's virtually on top of me"" -- and Reeves told him either ""no, no, no"" or ""whoa, whoa, whoa,"" he couldn't remember which, he told the police interrogator. ""He hit me with something. I assume it was his fist,"" Reeves told police. ""I think he had a cell phone in his hand because I saw the blur of the screen. ... My face went sideways. My glasses came partially off."" In her own interview with police, Vivian Reeves backed much of her husband's story, spelling out the f-word for police as she described  Oulson's language during the altercation. Asked, though, whether she saw Chad Oulson strike Curtis Reeves, she replied no -- though she said it's what her husband told her after the shooting. The same went for the various theater witnesses who testified earlier for the prosecution. None of whom said that they saw Reeves getting hit by anything beyond perhaps a bag or some kernels of popcorn before he opened fire. Surveillance video captures theater shooting . Beyond hearing from various witnesses, the public -- thanks to the gathered media -- got their own glimpse of what happened inside that movie theater, thanks to surveillance video. The jumpy, grainy footage shows Reeves return to his seat at 1:26:19 p.m., according to the video's time stamp. Six seconds later, Reeves appears to lean forward, but only for a second. At 1:26:30 p.m., the video stops -- likely because the motion sensors weren't activated, according to previous testimony in Reeves' bail hearing this week -- but it starts recording again five seconds later. That's when a hand extends in front of Reeves, from the seat where victim Chad Oulson was reportedly sitting, and appears to snatch something from Reeves -- the defense has repeatedly said Oulson threw popcorn -- and throws it into Reeves' face. Reeves' right hand, the one Reeves told police he used to shoot Oulson, thrusts forward at 1:26:37 p.m. A strange dust falls in front of the surveillance video lens as theater patrons begin walking over to the area where Reeves remains seated. It's the row behind where a mortally wounded Oulson -- after stumbling then collapsing on another moviegoer -- is taking his last breaths.

"Investigators are working to determine what caused a helicopter crash in central Peru that killed seven people, including five Americans. The team was supporting oil exploration operations near Pucallpa, Peru, when the helicopter they were traveling in crashed Monday afternoon, according to Columbia Helicopters, the Portland, Oregon-based company that employed the victims. Minutes after the helicopter took off from the Pucallpa Airport, authorities lost communication with the pilot, and people in the control tower could see a heavy smoke column in the distance. A company official said Tuesday that it was unclear what caused the crash. ""We've notified all the authorities and are cooperating with everyone fully, and we'll do everything we can to learn any causes ... of the accident,"" said Michael Fahey, Columbia Helicopters president and CEO.

"Peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians are about to run out of oxygen. The final weeks of a nine-month negotiating window closes at the end of April and the two sides still stand far apart. The talks could end in a matter of days with disturbing consequences. What to do? Secretary of State John Kerry has an idea: How about releasing Jonathan Pollard, the convicted American spy who has already spent almost three decades in prison for passing information to Israel? According to a number of reports, a deal to free Pollard and extend talks through 2015 is in the works. Pollard has nothing to do with the two-state solution, with the future status of Jerusalem, with whether or not Palestinians will ever recognize Israel as a Jewish state, with West Bank settlements, or with any of the issues in dispute. But releasing him could give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu some political cover to make unpopular decisions. Over the years, a growing number of Israelis -- along with many prominent U.S. officials -- have come to see the severity of the sentence imposed on the former civilian intelligence analyst as a gross injustice. A major turning point in perception of the case came when a former U.S. assistant secretary of Defense made an explosive accusation about why Pollard is serving a life sentence. Lawrence Korb, who worked in the Department of Defense when Pollard's crime came to light, wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging Pollard's release. ""I can say with confidence,"" he told the President, ""that the severity of Pollard's sentence is a result of an almost visceral dislike of Israel ... on the part of my boss at the time, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger."" As the 59-year-old Pollard languishes in prison and his health reportedly deteriorates, his plight has gained enormous emotional power, turning him into a valuable negotiating chip. Not everyone in Israel agrees that he should be released. And many American Jews are also deeply uncomfortable with the prominent place that Pollard has assumed in relations between the U.S. and Israel. After all, Pollard did commit a crime. Still, his spying, as a recently declassified CIA damage assessment showed, aimed to collect information not about the U.S., but about weapons systems in the hands of Arab states, Pakistan and the U.S.S.R. If Pollard were released after 29 years in prison for a crime that did not harm America -- in fact, it harmed Israel and its relations with Washington -- no one would argue he was not punished for his crime. Releasing pollard would constitute a low-cost effort to keep the peace talks alive and give Netanyahu enough room to make politically unpopular decisions at home. Kerry, whose plate is overflowing with other crises, has invested an astonishing amount of time to bring Israelis and Palestinians together, with no sign of a loss of enthusiasm or erosion of earnestness. His original goal, a peace deal before the end of this month, will not occur. Still, he would like to extend the talks. The Palestinians say they will walk out of the talks and refuse to extend them unless Israel frees 26 more jailed Palestinians, a fourth round of releases, which have included men convicted of murdering Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had agreed to the releases as part of the current talks, says he will not free any more unless the Palestinians promise not to walk away from peace negotiations. The talks are in the middle of a thick logjam. And, if that were not depressing enough, the logjam is just about whether or not to continue talking. The sad reality is that there is no sign that any tangible progress has been made on the core issues. During the recent meeting of the Arab League, Arab leaders disagreed about practically everything, but they came together in their rejection of accepting Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians doubt that Israelis ever intend to relinquish any territory in the West Bank for a Palestinian state, and Israelis doubt that Palestinians are genuinely willing to accept Israel's existence as the state of the Jewish people. Each side is deeply skeptical of the other's true intentions, even as majorities of both Palestinians and Israelis say they support a negotiated agreement leading to a peace agreement and a two-state solution. If there is any good news, it is that throughout all the failures of peace-making, the popular desire for a negotiated solution has survived. Despite the high obstacles, the peacemakers know that without negotiations, lasting peace cannot come. And that's where Pollard comes in. The scraggly man who has spent decades in a prison could become the instrument of yet another round of negotiations, allowing Israel to free more Palestinians. That might just be the worst punishment for him. Pollard is reported to be adamantly opposed to what he calls a ""shameful deal."" Every release of prisoners is a triumph for Abbas and a wound for Netanyahu. Israelis cringe when they see the celebrations greeting Palestinian men who have spilled Israeli blood. They seethe at articles in the foreign media that speak of how Israelis ""demonize"" Palestinians convicted of murdering Israelis, and they feel betrayed knowing those same men have received salaries from the Palestinian Authority while serving their sentences in Israeli prisons. The pressure from the Israeli hardliners is building on Netanyahu. Deputy Defense Minister Danny Dannon said Palestinians are tricking Israel, with no intention of ever making peace with Israel, just so they can free more prisoners. Dannon says he will resign if a fourth round of releases goes through. Palestinians accuse Netanyahu of reneging on a deal. Amid charges and recriminations from both sides, Kerry just made another rushed trip to the region, seeking to salvage what has increasingly come to be seen as his peace process. The idea of freeing Pollard has come up several times before, at times of crisis in the process. Each time the plan has fallen apart. Pollard remains in prison and peace between Israelis and Palestinians remains barely a dream. But, as stubborn optimists know, things stay the same until they change.","U.S. may release the spy Jonathan Pollard as a chip in Middle East negotiations .

"Wall Street protests swelled Wednesday to their largest numbers yet, after local unions pledged support to a third week of demonstrations against income inequality, corporate greed, corruption and a list of other social ills. Thousands meandered from lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park -- considered a rallying point for the largely leaderless group -- to Foley Square near City Hall. The crowd then looped back to the park, punctuating a 19-day protest that promotes a wide, if not ambiguous, range of messages. Causes range from social awareness to radical change in America's financial and political systems, while other participants appeared content to simply get caught up in the spirit of demonstration. Still, while the fledgling movement has struggled in its definition, demonstrators appear steadfast in their general criticism of the country's wealthiest 1% and its purported influence. Some carried placards and shouted slogans denouncing corporate excess, while others said they were ""fed up"" with high unemployment and a lack of economic opportunity. Still others said they had simply been waiting for a moment to express their voice and kick-start a conversation about inequality. The crowd stretched along a dozen city blocks, chanting ""All day, all week, occupy Wall Street."" The protestors also have begun printing a newspaper called The Occupied Wall Street Journal in an effort to garner an additional media attention. And following a string of arrests, they say they are pursuing a class action lawsuit against the New York Police Department and Mayor Michael Bloomberg for their ""unconstitutional effort to disrupt and suppress"" demonstrations. The group seemed to gain momentum after a September 24 pepper spray incident involving protestors and New York police officers. On October 1, police arrested hundreds of protestors as they marched across a roadway leading to the Brooklyn Bridge, blocking city traffic for hours. Meanwhile, social media sites such as Twitter seem to be spurring similar protests in other cities, though in vastly smaller numbers. Dozens gathered in Boston; Hartford, Connecticut; and Seattle, while demonstrations were also scheduled later Wednesday in Savannah, Georgia, among other cities. Demonstrations were also expected to take place in Washington, D.C., and Tampa, Florida, on Thursday. A Twitter account called Occupy Boston mentions a citywide college walkout  there later Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Massachusetts Nurses Association said hundreds of the city's nurses would rally with the Occupy Boston protesters later Wednesday. The association said the protest would be part of the opening day activities for a national nursing convention in Boston. iReport: Send us your photos, videos . In New York, several unions endorsed the Occupy Wall Street movement and planned to join the protesters' street theater Wednesday, labor leaders said. The voices of #OccupyWallStreet . ""It's really simple. These young people on Wall Street are giving voice to many of the problems that working people in America have been confronting over the last several years,"" said Larry Hanley, international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which has 20,000 members in the New York area. ""These young people are speaking for the vast majority of Americans who are frustrated by the bankers and brokers who have profited on the backs of hard-working people,"" Hanley added in a statement. ""While we battle it out day after day, month after month, the millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street sit by -- untouched -- and lecture us on the level of our sacrifice."" Transport Workers Union Local 100 spokesman Jim Gannon said the Occupy Wall Street movement, which denounces social inequities in the financial system and draws inspiration from the Arab Spring revolutions in Africa and the Middle East, has advanced issues that unions typically support. ""Their goals are our goals,"" Gannon said. ""They brought a spotlight on issues that we've believed in for quite some time now. ... Wall Street caused the implosion in the first place and is getting away scot-free while workers, transit workers, everybody, is forced to pay for their excesses. ""These young folks have brought a pretty bright spotlight,"" Gannon added. ""It's kind of a natural alliance."" Time magazine: 'Indignados' occupy Wall Street . President Michael Mulgrew of the United Federation of Teachers, the sole bargaining agent for most nonsupervisory New York City public teachers, with 200,000 members, said he was proud to support the demonstrators. ""The way our society is now headed, it does not work for 99% of people, so when Occupy Wall Street started ... they kept to it and they've been able to create a national conversation that we think should have been going on for years,"" Mulgrew said. The labor officials couldn't provide a projection of how many of their members will take the day off from work Wednesday and join the protests. View a high-resolution gallery of the protests . In New York, the demonstrators have camped out in Zuccotti Park, calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months."" The protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag #occupywallstreet on the microblogging site Twitter -- began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. And for more than two weeks, demonstrations have addressed issues such as police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. Open Story: Occupy Wall Street protests . Occupy Wall Street is a leaderless movement made up largely of twenty-somethings upset about the economy, the Afghanistan war, the environment, and the state of America and the world in general. In less than three weeks, the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected Americans at a time when an overwhelming majority of U.S. adults say the country is on the wrong track. Wall Street protesters inspired by Arab Spring movement . Besides the other cities, protests have also been held in Chicago and Los Angeles. Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in U.S. history during times characterized by economic stress. That said, it would be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda, said Susan Olzak, a Stanford University sociology professor. ""It's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history,"" she said. ""Clearer goals could eventually emerge, but there's no guarantee."" She added, ""Many movements fizzle out. Others become more organized. (But) I think we run a risk (by) taking a snapshot at any one point in time and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot. The only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time.""","Wednesday's protests have the largest numbers since demonstrations began .

The student, Jameson Hsieh, recorded a video of the incident, but had little to say afterward. ""He didn't say anything. We rode all the way home in silence,"" said Beam, who lives 50 miles away in Higginsville. ""We were just ashamed, and he didn't ask any more questions. I think he had seen enough. It is just disgusting."" Condemnation came from organizers and politicians alike. The Missouri State Fair Commission called it ""unacceptable"" and said the clown has been banned ""from ever participating or performing at the Missouri State Fair again."" ""The commission reiterated that the statements and actions Saturday night were inappropriate and not in keeping with the fair's standards,"" the agency said in a written statement. ""The Missouri State Fair apologizes for the unconscionable stunt."" The board of directors at Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association also issued an apology. ""The Sport of Rodeo is not meant to be a political platform. We are taking measures by training and educating our contract acts to prevent anything like this from ever happening again,"" a statement on the group's website said. ""All Members of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association are very proud of our Country and our President."" And Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder called for those responsible to be held accountable. ""I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS"" -- president of the United States -- ""the other night,"" he said in a post to his official Twitter account.  ""We are better than this."" U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill echoed Kinder. ""The state fair is funded by taxpayer dollars, and is supposed to be a place where we can all bring our families and celebrate the state that we love,"" she said. ""But the young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse, that somehow it's ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the president of our great nation.""","State fair commission bans clown after Saturday night's ""unconscionable stunt""

"Civil rights luminaries joined throngs of protesters carrying ""Justice for Trayvon"" signs on Saturday, slowly marching to the Sanford, Florida, police headquarters to demand the arrest of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin's killer. ""We will march on, we will rally, pray, petition, challenge elected officials, judges, law enforcement, attorneys, in the courthouse and in the White House, until justice for Trayvon Martin is real,"" high school senior Clarence Moore III, a member of the NAACP's College and Youth Division. Roslyn Brock, chairwoman of the NAACP board of directors, urged demonstrators to turn their anger into constructive action, telling them to register and vote. ""Your vote is the key that will unlock justice in this community,"" she said. Organizers said demonstrators arrived on buses from around Florida and the Southeast to participate in the rally, which came 34 days after neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman fatally shot Martin after calling police to report him as a ""suspicious"" person. Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk, according to an Orlando Sentinel report that was later confirmed by Sanford police. Authorities have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there were no grounds, at the outset, to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, racially profiled the teen, who was black, and ignored a police dispatcher's directive not to follow him. The Sanford police department has come under intense scrutiny for its actions following the shooting, and protesters renewed their call for the firing of police Chief Bill Lee, who stepped aside temporarily this month amid criticism. Activists also demand punishment against others involved in the case. ""The same thing that happened to Trayvon Martin can happen to your kids as well,"" said Seminole County NAACP President Turner Clayton. ""We want a clean house at Sanford P.D."" Video: Zimmerman in handcuffs . Speakers -- included the Rev. Al Sharpton and NAACP President Ben Jealous -- described Martin's shooting as the latest in a long line of examples in which black men, particularly, have been victims of racially motivated crimes. As he has in recent days, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said that Martin's killing is symptomatic in part of the larger problem of violence in the United States. Yet he also said he believes that the teenager's skin color contributed to his death. ""This is about race profiling, and therefore a quest for racial justice,"" said Jackson, who added later, ""It's hope time, it's healing time."" Martin's parents did not attend the Sanford event, though they were at one later Saturday at a park in Miramar, Florida. Unlike the rallies condemning racial profiling and calling for justice in their son's case -- which occurred Saturday not just in Sanford, but also in places such as Washington and Springfield, Massachusetts -- the event in Miramar was more about remembering Martin, the person. The teenager had played for the Miramar Optimists football program, where his father was a coach. Many of the scores in attendance Saturday night knew him personally. ""Trayvon was a young, handsome, hardworking kid,"" one of his former coaches, Carter Eve, told CNN. ""He gave you his all."" At a news conference that preceded the Sanford march, Jealous and Sharpton took pains to rebut reports that Sharpton's National Action Network was considering calling for a boycott of Sanford or Seminole County. Sharpton said such a boycott was ""never on the table."" But he said he would consider action against businesses supporting efforts on behalf of Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which police have cited as a reason they did not immediately arrest Zimmerman. The law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. Critics say it is a ""shoot first"" law that justifies violence. Opinion: Martin's death more than teachable moment . A special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott is investigating the case, as is the U.S. Department of Justice. An open letter on the NAACP's website -- directed at the special prosecutor, Angela Corey -- points to what it calls ""evidence of racial bias, investigative mishaps, and the true nature of the circumstances surrounding Trayvon's killing (that) have shaken us to the core... ""However, nothing shakes us more than the knowledge that Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, remains free."" The letter ends with a plea for Corey ""to prosecute the case judiciously, and to passionately pursue justice."" In an interview Thursday with CNN's Piers Morgan, the shooter's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., questioned the job done by Corey's office thus far. In Depth: CNN peels back the layers . He cited leaks of details -- which have not been confirmed to have come from Corey or her office -- and described the account that his brother ""chased a person"" as ""absolutely false."" ""Ms. Corey's investigation has been compromised,"" the brother said. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi stood staunchly behind Corey, in an interview Friday with CNN's John King. She noted that Scott appointed Corey after consulting with her. Corey ""is ethical. She is honest. She is tough as nails. She is compassionate,"" Bondi said. ""And if any leaks are coming out of this investigation, it is certainly not from Angela Corey's office."" Bondi added that she thought criticism of Corey -- both by those, like Robert Zimmerman Jr., who support George Zimmerman and those calling for his prompt arrest -- ""completely undermines the integrity of the investigation."" What the witnesses are saying . Everyone involved, Bondi said, would be best off if they ""wait and let (the investigation) happen."" That means being patient in the face of fervent demands from activists that Zimmerman be detained and charged as soon as possible, said the attorney general. ""You never want to make an arrest too soon,"" Bondi said. ""We need justice, but you never want to make an arrest without having all the answers."" While George Zimmerman has not spoken out about the case, his family members have taken their case public this week. Besides the brother, Robert Zimmerman Sr. -- the shooter's father -- told Orlando TV station WOFL that Martin ""continued to beat George"" and he said something to the effect of, ""You're going to die now."" But as more information surfaces, the picture of what happened between Martin and Zimmerman becomes more complicated. Despite the twists and turns, Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, has said that she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case. ""I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation,"" she said. ""We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We're trying to be patient, and we're trying to press on for justice.""","Martin's parents join scores to remember their son at a Miramar, Florida, event .

"The Senate will hold a hearing on the increasingly political debate over the government's handling of the Ebola outbreak -- but not until after the midterm elections. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski will hold an Ebola hearing Nov. 6, two days after Election Day. That will mark the first hearing in the Democratic-led Senate since the first three U.S. cases of the deadly virus were diagnosed in Dallas, according to a committee release out Monday. The GOP-controlled House held a hearing last week to grill Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials over the Ebola response. The Ebola outbreak is quickly emerging as a top issue in the midterms, scrambling the political calculus in several races in the final stretch of campaigning. Senate Democrats from Republican-leaning states are under growing pressure to join GOP calls for a ban on travel between west Africa, which is the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, and the United States. North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan is the latest Democrat to back a travel ban, though she initially questioned the effectiveness of such a move and said it only made sense as one part of a broader strategy. Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Georgia Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn are also supporting a travel ban. Those defections are ratcheting up pressure on other Democrats -- both vulnerable incumbents and hopeful challengers -- to support a ban that top U.S. and world health officials have said would not be effective and could harm prevention efforts. The Louisiana GOP issued a statement Friday attempting to goad Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu into supporting a travel ban after her opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy expressed his support. It's Hagan's endorsement of the ban, though, that most clearly reflects the political pressure Democrats are feeling as a result of the threat of Ebola -- largely because it came just days after she'd expressed reservations about a similar call from her GOP opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis. ""That's not going to solve this problem,"" Hagan said at a press conference early last week. ""That's not going to contain the epidemic that we see happening in Africa."" But in a statement Friday Hagan said she had ""said for weeks that travel restrictions should be"" part of the plan to contain Ebola. ""A temporary travel ban is a prudent step the President can take to protect the American people, and I believe he should do so immediately,"" Hagan said in the statement released Friday afternoon. Hagan, Pryor and Nunn are all facing tough challenges from the right and their campaigns are crucial to Democrats' chances of holding on to the Senate.","A Senate panel plans a Nov. 6 hearing on the Ebola threat.

"They braved bullets and bombs, risking their lives for their country. Now -- having been passed over in some cases for decades due to their ethnicity or skin color  -- the U.S. government is giving them their just reward. President Barack Obama announced Friday that 24 Army veterans would receive the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest military award, bestowed on U.S. troops who show ""gallantry above and beyond the call of duty "" -- for their combat actions in Vietnam, Korea and during World War II. Many of their fellow soldiers received this medal long ago, for doing similar things in similar places at similar times. But not these 24 men. In 2002, Congress -- as part of the Defense Authorization Act -- set up a review of Jewish and Hispanic veterans who served in combat since the middle of the century ""to ensure those deserving the Medal Of Honor were not denied because of prejudice,"" explained the White House. The congressional action was later amended to open the door for any serviceman or woman denied the award due to discrimination. Twenty-one of the new Medal of Honor recipients -- with last names including Garcia and Weinstein and Negron -- aren't alive to receive the award. But three others, including Melvin Morris, are alive to be recognized. Morris was 19 when he volunteered to go to Vietnam. In 1969, the Army Green Beret got hit multiple times by bullets during combat. Bleeding, he ""charged into a hail of fire"" to rescue his dead and wounded comrades in what the Army characterizes as a show of ""determination possessed by few men."" His heroics were recognized in 1970 with the Army's Distinguished Service Cross award. Now 72, Morris -- who is black -- will wear his country's highest military honor. So, too, will Santiago J. Erevia, a native Texan. The radio-telephone operator was caring for wounded colleagues in 1969 in Vietnam when his position came under attack. According to the Military Times, ""without hesitation Specialist Erevia crawled from one wounded man to another,"" charged while armed toward the hostile fire, before eventually returning to take care of the injured troops he'd left behind. The last surviving new Medal of Honor recipient is Jose Rodela, who like Morris and Erevia also won a Distinguished Service Cross. While commanding a mobile strike force in Vietnam, Rodela was ""wounded in the back and head by rocket shrapnel while recovering a wounded comrade,"" according to a military commendation, yet he still single-handedly ""assaulted and knocked out (a) rocket position"" before returning to lead his men. One of those who will posthumously receive the award is Leonard Kravitz, an assistant machine gunner in the Korean War. He is the uncle and namesake of actor and rock musician Lenny Kravitz. Retired Marine Col. Harvey Barnum, who is white, says he is eager to welcome all the new award recipients into the fold. Barnum, who earned a Medal of Honor himself in 1967 for his service in Vietnam, said he ""had heard rumors ... that there were certain people that people thought should have received the medal."" Now that they're finally being justly recognized, Barnum said, ""I'll look forward to putting my arms around them, and calling them brother, and saying welcome home.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor has spoken for years about how her experiences as a Latina woman have influenced her public and private life. Judge Sonia Sotomayor has been meeting with lawmakers in advance of her confirmation hearings. In her speeches, she often discussed her ""Latina soul"" and explained how even the traditional dishes of her Puerto Rican family shaped her views. And she often said that she hoped those experiences would help her reach better judicial conclusions than someone without such a varied background might reach. The line was almost identical every time: . ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would, more often than not, reach a better conclusion."" That sentence, or a similar one, has appeared in speeches Sotomayor delivered in 1994, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2001. In that speech, she included the phrase ""than a white male who hasn't lived that life"" at the end, which sparked cries of racism from some Republicans. Those instances were included in documents Sotomayor sent Thursday to Capitol Hill, part of her response to the lengthy questionnaire sent to her by the Senate Judiciary Committee before her Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Sotomayor supporters brought up the 1994 speech themselves, after former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, radio host Rush Limbaugh and others labeled Sotomayor a racist over the remark. Gingrich has since recanted. The supporters point out that Republicans did not object to those remarks in 1998 during Sotomayor's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sotomayor has spent the last three days in meetings with senators on Capitol Hill answering their questions about her judicial record -- and defending those comments. While the judge has made no public comments herself about the matter, others have. See Sotomayor's key rulings Â» . ""She told me she had used the phrase before but that she would not be using it again,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""She's clearly a very bright individual who learns from her past mistakes,"" Collins said. But Collins said she was ""still uncomfortable that she [Sotomayor] made the statement, particularly as a sitting judge."" ""I can understand her explanation that it was intended to be a statement to inspire the young people to whom she was talking and that it did not reflect how she approaches cases before her,"" she said. ""But that's why I want to read more of her cases to make sure that is the case."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said after meeting with Sotomayor that the judge had told her, "" 'It was a poor choice of words. If you read on and read the rest of my speech you wouldn't be concerned with it, but it was a poor choice of words.' "" But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wasn't mollified. ""If it was a bad choice of words, it was a bad choice of words repeatedly ... leading one to believe that it probably wasn't just an isolated statement but a core belief,"" he said. Sotomayor's point -- that a person's experiences influence how he or she sees the world -- doesn't sit well with some Republicans, who believe that viewpoint means the law takes a back seat to a more nuanced judgment. It also highlights a basic difference in how many conservatives and liberals view the federal judiciary. Many conservatives seek a strict adherence to the law as it is written, while many liberals believe that the circumstances of individual cases could lead to differing decisions even if two cases appear nearly identical on the surface. CNN's Dana Bash and Emily Sherman contributed to this report.","Sotomayor discusses her ""Latina soul,"" how Puerto Rican dishes shaped her .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal firearms agents in Arizona cringed every time they heard of a shooting after letting waves of guns pass into the hands of Mexican drug gangs, some of those agents told a House committee Wednesday. It was part of an operation aimed at tracking the flow of weapons across the U.S.-Mexican border, but the operation has come under intense criticism since the December killing of a U.S. Border Patrol officer. Operation Fast and Furious, as the program was known, was ""a colossal failure of leadership,"" said Peter Forcelli, a supervisor at the Phoenix field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. When U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was wounded and six others were killed in a January assassination attempt in Tucson, Forcelli said, an agency spokesman told him ""that there was concern from the chain of command that the gun was hopefully not a Fast and Furious gun."" Another agent, Lee Casa, said, ""This happened time and time again."" ""Every time there's a shooting, whether it was Mrs. Giffords or anybody, any time there is a shooting in the general Phoenix area or even in, you know, Arizona, we're fearful that it might be one of these firearms,"" Casa told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The killings of three people connected with the U.S. consulate in Juarez, Mexico, caused similar anxiety, Casa said. And a third agent, John Dodson, told lawmakers: ""I cannot begin to think of how the risk of letting guns fall into the hands of known criminals could possibly advance any legitimate law enforcement interest. I hope the committee will receive a better explanation than I."" Operation Fast and Furious focused on following ""straw purchasers,"" or people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for Mexico. But instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands, Operation Fast and Furious called for ATF agents to let the guns ""walk"" and wait for them to surface in Mexico, according to a committee report. The idea was that once the weapons in Mexico were traced back to the straw purchasers, the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down. Instead, the report argues, letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths, including that of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Terry was killed last year just north of the Mexican border in Arizona after he confronted a group of bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants. Two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to Fast and Furious. ""I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe it at first,"" Terry's mother, Josephine, said of when she learned that the ATF may have let some of the guns used in the attack slip through its fingers. Terry's family said they want all those involved in his killing and who helped put the weapons in their hands to be prosecuted. ""We ask that if a government official made a wrong decision, that they admit their error and take responsibility for his or her actions,"" Robert Heyer, Terry's cousin and family spokesman, testified. The committee's chairman, California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, called the operation ""felony stupid."" As many as 2,000 semi-automatic rifles reached the hands of the cartels as a result, and Issa said the top two ATF officials were briefed the program regularly. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich testified that the ATF never knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers, who then transported them into Mexico. But Issa and other congressmen said the claim was deceiving. Although it is technically true that straw purchasers didn't cross any weapons into Mexico, they did transfer them to third parties who did, they said. Issa also was upset over heavily redacted documents that his committee had received from the attorney general's office. Weich said his office was cooperating to the greatest extent possible, given concerns about disrupting the ongoing investigation. But Weich said he did not know or was not able to answer questions about who authorized the operation. ""The attorney general has said he wants to get to the bottom of it,"" he said. Speaking before the committee, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that the operation started with the flawed assumption that there was a large arms trafficking network that was operating. ""That kind of assumption can cause you to start with a conclusion and work backwards, looking for facts that fit the case. Until you figure out that you've got the cart before the horse, you're probably not going to get anywhere,"" he said. Casa said ATF supervisors in Phoenix, where the project was based, brushed off several agents' concerns over letting guns go. And Dodson said that despite evidence that straw purchasers were giving their weapons to cartels, the agency went no further than to do some surveillance. ""Knowing all the while, just days after these purchases, the guns that we saw these individuals buy would begin turning up at crime scenes in the United States and Mexico, we still did nothing,"" he said. Forcelli, also criticized the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona for what he described as a tendency not to prosecute arms trafficking cases, and said ""toothless"" laws against straw buyers made it difficult to recruit low-level operatives as witnesses. ""With these types of cases, for somebody to testify against members of a cartel where the alternative is seeing a probation officer once a month, they're going to opt toward not cooperating with the law enforcement authorities,"" he said.","NEW: Agent tells of fears over possible link to Giffords' shooting .

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities in New York seized more than $9 million worth of opium hidden inside a shipment of porcelain figurines last month at John F. Kennedy International Airport, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Thursday. The seizure happened on January 21, the agency said in a press release. More than 30 porcelain cats were discovered in a shipment from Thailand, labeled ""plastic samples"" and despite an X-ray scan that yielded nothing suspicious, authorities chose to open the cargo and crack one of the figurines open, according to John Saleh, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. During the inspection, authorities discovered a total of 205 pounds of a brown, tar-like substance that turned out to be raw opium, mostly used to make heroin, Saleh said. The agency estimated the value of the opium at more than $9 million. Saleh couldn't comment on the exact source of the package but did say it was intended for an address in the greater New York area. ""Most times we find cocaine and heroin,"" Saleh said. ""Opium was kind of unusual to find, especially in that quantity."" Federal authorities said there have been no arrests, and the investigation is continuing.","The drugs were hidden in porcelain figurines .

"Items taken from Trayvon Martin's cell phone -- including a text-message discussion of drug use and pictures of a gun and marijuana plants -- are among new details released Thursday by attorneys for the neighborhood watch volunteer accused of killing him without provocation 14 months ago. The evidence, George Zimmerman's attorneys say, paints a different picture of the 17-year-old than the one portrayed by his family and supporters. Lead defense attorney Mark O'Mara says he will try to use the evidence if prosecutors attempt to attack Zimmerman's character during his trial on second-degree murder charges, set to begin next month. Also Thursday, O'Mara filed motions in court. One asks for sanctions against the state for withholding evidence and for saying it didn't have more evidence when asked. The second requests that his client's trial be delayed. Much of the new evidence disclosed Thursday in filings by Zimmerman's attorneys comes from Martin's cell phone, including photos showing a semiautomatic pistol and ammunition and small marijuana plants growing in pots. In other pictures, Martin is pictured making obscene gestures in an apparent self-portrait, as well pictures showing him with friends and in other settings. The text messages include a conversation from November 2011 in which he appears to say his mother has kicked him out of the house after ""da police caught me outta skool."" ""So you just turning into a lil hoodlum,"" the person with whom he is texting says. ""Naw, I'm a gangsta,"" the text message read. In other messages, text message exchanges appear to be discussing guns. ""U wanna share a .380 w/ (blacked out),"" one text message sent from Martin's phone reads. The text messaging logs are also peppered with references to marijuana use. ""I got weed nd I get money Friday,"" a message sent from his phone reads. ""I hid m weed,"" another text sent from Martin's phone reads. ""its wrapped."" The attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, says the evidence is ""irrelevant"" and predicted it would never be used at Zimmerman's trial. Zimmerman to argue self-defense, will not seek 'stand your ground' ""Is the defense trying to prove Trayvon deserved to be killed by George Zimmerman because (of) the way he looked?"" Crump said in a statement released Thursday. ""If so, this stereotypical and closed-minded thinking is the same mindset that caused George Zimmerman to get out of his car and pursue Trayvon, an unarmed kid who he didn't know.  The pretrial release of these irrelevant red herrings is a desperate and pathetic attempt by the defense to pollute and sway the jury pool."" Instead, he said, jurors will focus on Zimmerman's arrest for battery on a police officer, a domestic violence injunction and other issues he said demonstrate a ""propensity for violence."" Zimmerman's defense also released Thursday a handwritten note that was allegedly written by someone who was on the phone with Martin when the confrontation with Zimmerman took place. Arrest 'solely to placate the masses,"" Zimmerman's mother writes . The note, dated March 19, 2012, is not addressed to anyone in particular and it's not clear why the person wrote it. It reads: ""He started walking then noticed someone was following him. Then he decided to find a shortcut cause the man wouldn't follow him. Then he said the man didn't follow him again. Then he looked back and saw the man again.  The man started getting closer.  Then Trevon turned around and said why are you following me!! ""Then I heard him fall, then the phone hung up.  I called back and (not legible) no response.  In my mind I thought it was just a fight.  Then I found out this tragic story."" Zimmerman recently waived his right to a pretrial hearing under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force when threatened regardless of where they are. His attorneys will claim self-defense at trial. A representative of the special prosecutor handling the case did not immediately return an e-mail message seeking comment on the evidence. Prosecutors renewed their motion for a gag order in the case Thursday because, they say, they're concerned about finding an impartial jury given the ""inordinate amount of media coverage."" Two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied. George Zimmerman's brother apologizes for offensive tweet .","Prosecutors renew their motion for a gag order .

"The Syrian government has warned protesters in the city of Homs to stop demonstrations, hand in weapons and surrender defecting military members by Monday night or face bombardment, an opposition leader said. A 72-hour warning was given Saturday, said Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdo of the Free Syrian Army. Activists on the ground said the ultimatum was issued on Friday. The Syrian National Council, the country's leading opposition movement, had warned earlier of a potential bloodbath at the hands of the Syrian regime in Homs. ""If the world continues to watch, then the massacre of Hama in the '80s will be repeated,"" said Hamdo, referring to 1982, when Syria's military -- acting under orders from current President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- launched an assault on the city, killing thousands. Opposition: Anti-regime doctor killed . The military has dug trenches around Homs, Hamdo said. ""There is no electricity, water, or communication whatsoever now and the communication breakdown has extended even closer to the Turkish border,"" he said. The Syrian government denied reports of water and electricity being out in the city, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). The government made no mention of the reported deadline on the news agency's website Sunday morning. Opposition figures launched a nationwide anti-government strike Sunday, which they called the ""strike of dignity."" The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gets information from people in different parts of the country, said people in Homs and neighboring towns widely joined the strike. ""All shops were closed on all main roads in the city,"" the group said. Several videos posted on Youtube purported to show government loyalists breaking locks of shops that closed in support of Sunday's anti-government strike. But on SANA, the Syrian government quoted people across the country as saying there was no strike and no sign of a strike.  ""It was a normal trading day in markets throughout the Syrian provinces as people bought and sold consumer goods, vegetables, fruit and clothes as economic elements shrugged off all inflammatory tendentious calls by terrorist groups that are associated with foreigners,"" the government insisted. Protesters attack employees at Syrian Embassy in Jordan . As violence raged Sunday in parts of the country, the death toll reached 23, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC). Five of the dead were children, the group said. The toll includes six people in Hama; six in Homs; five in Idlib; three in suburbs of Damascus, and three in Daraa, according to the LCC, a network of anti-regime activists in the country. One of the deaths in the Daraa area took place in Jasem, where a man was arrested and then returned to his family dead after about three hours, the LCC said. In the city of Aleppo, security forces burned down a factory in an industrial area that was participating in the strike, the LCC said. SANA, meanwhile, reported that the ""bodies of 13 martyrs from the army, security and police forces"" were  taken ""to their final resting place.""  Four were from Homs. Authorities in Homs arrested ""armed men who tried to impose an obligatory sit-in"" and who shot at people in cars and streets, SANA said. CNN cannot independently confirm events because the Syrian government restricts access of international media to the country. The Syrian government said authorities in Idlib ""confronted members of an armed terrorist group"" who were blocking a road and ""killed and injured a number of its members.""  Authorities also chased another ""armed gang"" and killed two of its members, SANA said. In Hama, Syria said, officials arrested ""a member of armed terrorist groups"" who was trying to plant an explosive device near residential buildings. SANA said the military dismantled the bomb and no one was injured. Throughout the Syrian uprising, government officials have described some opposition fighters as armed terrorists and gang members. There were clashes Saturday in Khan Sheikhon, where authorities ""arrested a number of the terrorists and killed three of those groups' prominent leaders,"" SANA said in a report Sunday. In the city of Kfar Takharim, ""a number of the members of armed terrorist gangs were killed or injured in clashes with the authorities on Saturday evening,"" SANA said, adding that one member of the authorities was killed and six others were injured. Fierce clashes were underway Sunday in the Daraa Province village of Busra al-Harir as Syrian troops battled defectors, leaving many people wounded, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Residents said members of Syria's 12th Armored Brigade, which is based near the border with Jordan, ""stormed"" Busra al-Harir.  They said they heard explosions and heavy gunfire in the city and just north of it in Lujah,  where defectors were believed to be hiding, the observatory said. Security forces in Idlib were using mosque speakers to threaten residents to end their strike and to force people to reopen businesses, the observatory said, citing eyewitnesses. The Arab League announced it will hold emergency meetings this week in Cairo. In a statement on Egypt's state-run MENA news agency, an Arab League official said leaders will ""discuss the Arab response to a message from Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem to approve the signing of an agreement on an Arab League observing mission to Syria with conditions."" World leaders have widely condemned Syria's crackdown and called on it to halt violence against the opposition. On Saturday, France expressed its concerns about events in Syria, and warned against Syria launching a military operation against the city of Homs and its population, the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Al-Assad's regime has denied targeting peaceful protesters. The regime's actions have outraged world powers and sparked sanctions by the Arab League, Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Israeli President Shimon Peres on Sunday described Syrian President al-Assad as a ""killer,"" implicitly comparing him to Libya's ousted ruler Moammar Gadhafi. ""The world decided -- including the Arab world -- to intervene when a leader is beginning to kill his own citizens,"" Peres told CNN in an interview. ""It happened in Libya; it's happening in Yemen; it's happening by the Arab League, for the first time in their experience. They decided to put pressure on an Arab state because the leader is killing his people."" The United Nations said this month that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since the crackdown began in mid-March. Protesters have been demanding the end of the al-Assad regime and democratic elections. Al-Assad has been in power since 2000; his father, Hafez, ruled Syria for three decades. Local elections are set to take place Monday for municipal posts. In its 2010 Human Rights Report about Syria, the U.S. State Department said Syria's elections have not been fair in the past. ""Although the constitution provides the right for citizens to peacefully change their government through elections, in practice they did not have that right because elections were neither free nor fair,"" the report said.","Residents of Homs widely participate in Sunday's national strike, an opposition group says .

"British lawmakers tore into the chief executive of the security contractor that will be unable to deliver enough guards for the Olympic Games, forcing Nick Buckles to agree Tuesday that the fiasco is ""a humiliating shambles."" Buckles, the chief executive of G4S, said the company should not have agreed to provide 10,400 guards for the Olympics, six days after the security giant admitted it could not do so. ""We regret signing the contract,"" Buckles said under pressure from lawmakers. The company's failure forced the government to call in 3,500 military personnel to help, and will also require extra police to be deployed. Olympic-level security . G4S has a Â£284 million ($444 million) government contract to provide security staff for the Olympic Games, but only 4,000 guards are trained and ready. Buckles said there was a company ""expectation"" that 7,000 will be ready by the time the Games begin on July 27, although he called the exact number ""a moving target."" Lawmakers appeared incredulous at the chief executive's assertion that G4S should still claim a Â£57 million ($89 million) management fee as part of the contract. ""Why?"" demanded Keith Vaz, the chairman of Parliament's Home Affairs Committee. ""You haven't managed."" G4S may lose $77m over guard shortfall . Hammered by Vaz for saying he was ""disappointed"" about the failure, Buckles first said he was ""deeply disappointed"" and then that he was ""sorry."" Labour lawmaker David Winnick then laid into Buckles, insisting several times that the snafu was ""a humiliating shambles."" Buckles finally said he could not disagree. He repeatedly tried to evade a question from lawmaker James Clappison about whether he was confident about the number of guards who would show up on the first day of the Games. Guarding the games . Vaz intervened again, demanding: ""You can't give Mr. Clappison the assurance he seeks?"" ""I cannot,"" Buckles said. The company will reimburse police forces that have to provide officers to cover for G4S shortfalls, and will ""consider"" paying bonuses to military and police who are called in to help, he said. Buckles said he was surprised when he got his first indication on July 3 that his company would be unable to fulfill its contract. The information came ""completely out of the blue,"" he said. He knew for certain on July 11 the company could not fulfill its contract, he told the committee, which is looking into security for the Games. The company accepts ""100% responsibility"" for its failure, and is ""extremely grateful to the military and police for helping us out,""  Buckles said. Athletes fret on lost bus as Olympic arrivals begins . Closing the session, Vaz said lawmakers considered the company's performance ""unacceptable, incompetent and amateurish"" and implicitly suggested Buckles should resign after the Games. The G4S recruits are supposed to perform tasks including venue perimeter security, such as manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles and operating closed-circuit television systems, G4S said Sunday. The Home Office said Monday that the contractor was suffering from a software problem, which meant it could not guarantee who would turn up where and whether guards had the right training. G4S has not responded to CNN questions about the accusation. Share your Olympics sights and sounds . Britain's Department for Transport said Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was sending a small number of Transportation Security Administration officials to Britain for the Games.

""The TSA staff will not be conducting security screening operations or security inspections,"" the statement said.

"A U.S. Border Patrol agent has shot and killed an apparently undocumented migrant who allegedly threw rocks at the agent, striking his face, on the California-Mexico border near San Diego, authorities said. A social justice advocacy group on Wednesday criticized the Border Patrol's use of deadly force in the Tuesday incident, saying there's a disturbing trend of Border Patrol ""killings of rock throwers, some of whom were teenagers and some whom were U.S. citizens"" on the U.S.-Mexico border, said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego. The Border Patrol declined to comment directly on this week's incident, which is under investigation by local authorities, but in the past, the agency has highlighted how agents are seriously injured in rock-throwing incidents and resort to lethal force to protect themselves. Guerrero said, however, some police experts advise using nonlethal force such as pepper-ball guns to respond to rock throwings. ""Border agents should adhere to best policing practices and only use lethal force as a last resort, not the only resort,"" Guerrero said. In the San Diego sector on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Border Patrol has recorded more than 400 assaults, including rock throwings, on agents since 2010. The numbers have fluctuated in recent years, from 130 assaults in 2010, 77 in 2011, 133 in 2012 to 73 in 2013, according to the agency's statistics. Names of the agent and the apparently undocumented migrant in this week's deadly encounter haven't been released by authorities. Rock-throwing incidents have been controversial on the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly when Mexicans have thrown projectiles from the Mexico side of the international line toward Border Patrol agents on the U.S. side. In some cases, U.S. Border Patrol agents have fired their guns at the rock throwers on the Mexico side of the border, killing the rock thrower. Mexican officials have condemned the Border Patrol's use of lethal force as excessive. The U.S. Border Patrol said the incident occurred in a rugged section of the Otay Mountains near San Diego where the agent was trying to arrest several immigrants who crossed the border illegally. ""During the attack the agent was struck in the head with a rock,"" the Border Patrol said in a statement. ""Fearing for his life the agent discharged his service issued weapon resulting in the death of one assailant."" Two other undocumented migrants were arrested and in custody, the agency said. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which is investigating the killing, said in its account that two Border Patrol agents were trying to detain a group of suspected undocumented migrants in rugged terrain in the mountain's White Cross area about four mile east of the Otay Mesa border crossing. ""The two agents were out of sight of each other when one of the agents was struck in the face by a rock thrown by one of the suspects,"" Lt. Glenn Giannantonio said in a statement. ""Fearing for his safety, the agent fired his duty pistol at the man, striking him. The man was pronounced dead at the scene."" The border patrol agent who fired his service weapon suffered minor injuries, the sheriff's homicide unit said.","A Border Patrol agent shoots an apparently undocumented migrant near San Diego .

"The family of a Florida teen who died after being Tasered by police wants answers from authorities in Miami Beach. Miami Beach police said officers spotted aspiring artist Israel Hernandez spray-painting the side of a vacant McDonald's off Collins Avenue, the city's main drag. Hernandez led them on a foot chase, ignoring commands to stop, until he was cornered, they said. ""In order to affect his arrest, an officer deployed his conducted electrical weapon (TASER),"" police said in a prepared statement. But afterward, Hernandez ""displayed signs of medical duress"" and was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 6 a.m. Tuesday. ""We're in a country that defends human rights -- a country that sets an example and dares to ask countries that use excessive force,"" his father, also named Israel Hernandez, told CNN. ""That is my son's case. Excessive force."" Hernandez and his family moved from Colombia to the United States for a safer life. Now the family is mourning the 18-year-old , whose artwork packs their home. ""He was an amazing artist, a very passionate person, a very passionate artist,"" said his sister, Offir Hernandez. ""It's unfair to end his life for something he loved."" Miami Beach police say they have an ""open and ongoing investigation"" into Hernandez's death. Autopsy and toxicology results for Hernandez are pending, the medical examiner's office told CNN. Miami Beach said Friday it has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to conduct an independent review of the incident. City officials have been in contact with the Hernandez family ""to personally extend their condolences and provide assurances of a full and fair investigation,"" according to a statement. Police identified the officer who used the Taser as Jorge Mercado, who has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is routine any time a person dies in custody. ""We've never had someone die from a tasing before,"" a police spokesman said. ""We've only had Tasers eight or nine years. Now everyone is issued one when we start working here."" Hernandez tagged buildings under the signature ""Reefa."" Thiago Souza, a friend who had been acting as a lookout, said police looked ""almost like they were proud of what they did"" after subduing Hernandez. ""They're all congratulating each other and all that,"" Souza said. ""They were all clapping over his body and like giving high fives and laughing."" Police did not respond to a request from CNN for comment on Souza's account. ""Electronic control devices"" such as the Taser are now common equipment among police, who say the devices give officers an option short of deadly force to subdue a suspect. Taser International Inc., citing a 2009 study by researchers at the Wake Forest University medical school, says fewer than 1% of those shocked with a Taser or similar device suffer any injury. A 2006 report by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement concluded that ECDs ""are not likely to cause serious injury or loss of life for suspects or law enforcement officers, except in situations where certain medical conditions and drug use are factors."" But human rights group Amnesty International says 42 people in the United States died after being shocked with Tasers in 2012, with more than 540 deaths since 2001. Hernandez is not without critics. Many commenters on Miami news outlets defended the officers, saying Hernandez should have complied with police commands. But Hernandez's girlfriend, who asked to be identified only as ""Alexandria,"" said he was ""the farthest thing from a thug."" ""He ran because he was scared,"" she said. ""You know, he's just a kid. He only weighed 140 pounds. He was just a child in so many ways. He was such a pure and innocent person.""

"A 20-year dispute between a Nevada rancher and federal rangers over illegal cattle grazing erupted into an Old West-style showdown on the open range this week, even prompting self-proclaimed members of militia groups from across the country to join the rancher in fighting what they say is U.S. ""tyranny."" What began as a legal fight between longtime rancher Cliven Bundy and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has escalated as Bundy kept his cattle on the federal land, and the government has responded by beginning roundups of the livestock. A confrontation teetered on violence Wednesday when Bundy family members and dozens of supporters angrily confronted a group of rangers holding Tasers and barking dogs on leashes near Bunkerville, about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted. Bundy family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a Taser. In the end, the rangers got into their white SUVs and drove away, a YouTube video of the incident showed. ""Get out of our state!"" the cheering protesters yelled at the rangers as they departed in several vehicles. ""BLM go away! BLM go away!"" they added, referring to the Bureau of Land Management. The entire incident is now under investigation, Amy Lueders, the bureau's director in Nevada, said Thursday. To some, the 67-year-old Bundy is a hero who hails from a long family of ranchers stretching back to the Wild West. To environmentalists and the feds, however, he's an outlaw of sorts who owes U.S. taxpayers more than $1 million in unpaid grazing fees. The U.S. government is rounding up Bundy's cattle that it says have been grazing illegally on public lands in Clark County for more than 20 years, according to the land-management bureau and the National Park Service. Between Saturday and Wednesday, contracted wranglers impounded a total of 352 cattle, federal officials said. Bundy says he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials are planning to confiscate for illegal grazing, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Bundy told the newspaper that each head of his livestock is worth about $1,000. Since the roundups began, protesters have been confined to two areas to publicly declare their grievances, but the peaceful protests in recent days ""have crossed into illegal activity, including blocking vehicles associated with the (roundup), impeding cattle movement, and making direct and overt threats to government employees,"" the two federal agencies said in a statement. On Wednesday, a bureau truck driven by a civilian employee assisting in the roundup ""was struck by a protester on an ATV and the truck's exit from the area was blocked by a group of individuals who gathered around the vehicle,"" the agencies' statement said. In the scuffle with protesters, a police dog was kicked, and officers protecting the civilian driver were threatened and assaulted, the two agencies' statement said. ""After multiple requests and ample verbal warnings, law enforcement officers deployed Tasers on a protestor,"" the statement said. The profanity-laced tussle was captured on a video posted on YouTube. A group that said it posted the video didn't respond to requests for comment. In the video, protesters demanded to know why a backhoe and a dump truck were being used in the roundup -- and whether any livestock were killed. On Thursday, Lueders said the heavy equipment was used for field restoration. ""No BLM! No BLM!"" the protesters chanted to rangers in the middle of a two-lane rural highway. What sounds likes zapping Tasers can be heard in the video. In the wake of the publicized protests, members of various militia groups have been traveling from Virginia, Texas, Montana, Idaho and Wisconsin and arriving at the protest site and Bundy's ranch to support the family, said Stephen L. Dean, 45, of Utah, a member of one such group called the Peoples United Mobile Armed Services. ""It's tyranny in government,"" Dean said when asked what brought him to Nevada. And, he added, ""stealing people's cattle."" One banner at the protest side stated: ""Has the West been won? Or has the fight just begun!"" In removing Bundy's livestock from public lands, the park service and land bureau are carrying out two U.S. District Court orders from two different judges. ""Cattle have been grazing in trespass on public lands in Southern Nevada for more than two decades,"" the National Park Service said. ""The BLM and NPS have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially. Impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is an option of last resort."" Added the BLM: ""Mr. Bundy has also failed to comply with multiple court orders to remove his cattle from the federal lands and to end the illegal trespass."" The bureau does allow grazing on federal lands -- it administers 18,000 grazing permits and leases on 157 million acres across the country, the agency said. Bundy's dispute with the government began about 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000-acre Gold Butte area to protect an endangered desert tortoise, KLAS reported. Bundy refused to abide by the changes and stopped paying his grazing fees to the federal bureau, which he contends is infringing on state rights. His family has been ranching since the 1800s, before the U.S. Department of Interior was created and endangered species became a federal issue, he said in an interview with KLAS. ""My forefathers have been up and down the Virgin Valley ever since 1877. All these rights I claim have been created through pre-emptive rights and beneficial use of the forage and the water. I have been here longer. My rights are before the BLM even existed,"" Bundy told the station. ""With all these rangers and all this force that is out here, they are only after one man right now. They are after Cliven Bundy. Whether they want to incarcerate me or whether they want to shoot me in the back, they are after me. But that is not all that is at stake here. Your liberty and freedom is at stake,"" he continued. And Bundy sees it as a state issue. ""The federal government has seized Nevada's sovereignty ... they have seized Nevada's laws and our public land. We have no access to our public land and that is only a little bit of it,"" he said. This week, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval told the bureau of residents' criticism of the roundup. What Sandoval said he found ""most disturbing"" was the BLM's use of a ""First Amendment area"" that confined protesters to a designated area. Such an area ""tramples upon Nevadans' fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution,"" Sandoval said. ""No cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all Nevadans.""In response, federal officials are allowing the protesters to gather on public lands as long as they don't impede the roundup, said Lueders, the BLM's director in Nevada. Bundy is digging in for a long fight. ""I've been fighting this for a number of years. It's not about my cows, I'll tell you that much,"" he said at a town meeting on Wednesday night. ""It's about freedom and liberty and our Constitution ... and above all it's about our policing power. Who has policing power today?"" With the growing controversy, it was uncertain Thursday how long the cattle roundup will now last. At Wednesday night's meeting, residents gave Bundy a standing ovation when he publicly spoke. ""I love you people. And I love this land, and I love freedom and liberty,"" Bundy told the crowd. ""I know without doubt that our Constitution didn't provide for anything like the federal government owning this land, and so when I pay my grazing fees -- if I owe any grazing fees -- I will sure pay it to the right landlord, and that will be to Clark County, Nevada.""","Feds: Cliven Bundy's livestock has been illegally grazing on U.S. lands for 20 years .

"(CNN) -- The Tamil Tigers have been invited by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lay down their arms after government forces retook the city of Kilinochchi Friday, once the center of power for the rebel group. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa has called on the Tamil Tigers to stop fighting. But while Colombo celebrated the government success with fireworks, within an hour a suicide bomber abruptly shattered whatever hopes the president may have had for immediate peace. The bomber, riding a motorcycle, blew himself up outside air force headquarters in Colombo, killing two air force police officers and a member of the bomb-disposal unit, authorities said. The new year may signal a turn in Sri Lanka's conflict -- but it is unlikely to be an end. The Tamil Tigers have their roots in the earliest days of Sri Lanka's independence in 1948. But since then they have grown from a political group intent on protecting their rights to a fierce rebel movement classified by the United States and others as a terrorist organization. The conflict between the Tigers and the government has lasted more than 25 years and left at least 65,000 people dead. The Tigers are part of the island's minority Tamils, an ethnic group that has lived on the island for centuries since their ancestors came over from southern India. These Sri Lankan Tamils are distinct from Indian Tamils, an even smaller minority, who came with the British colonists in the 19th century. Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese have lived on the island much longer than the Tamils and represent about three-quarters of the population, according to the U.S. State Department. Most historians believe they came over from northern India in the 6th century B.C. It was Sri Lanka's post-independence government that sparked the rise of the Tamil Tigers. After 1948, Tamils started growing uneasy with the country's unitary government and apprehensive that the Sinhalese might abuse Tamil rights. They felt marginalized when S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike became prime minister after winning the 1956 elections on a platform of Sinhalese nationalism. The Tamils bristled at his declaration that Sinhala would be the official language and protested against government policies deemed favorable to the Sinhalese. Violence and radicalization started to grow during the following decades, and by the 1970s, Tamil politicians were demanding a separate Tamil state -- Tamil Eelam -- in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, the Tamils' traditional homeland. Other Tamil groups, however, sought a separate state by force. Among them were the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), founded in 1976 -- and now simply known as the Tamil Tigers. The violence still raging today intensified in 1983, when the Tamil Tigers killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers. It led to the largest outburst of violence in the island's history, with hundreds of Tamils killed, tens of thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fleeting to south India, according to the U.S. State Department. The government began trying to suppress the Tamil Tigers in the north and east while the Tigers launched terrorist attacks in the capital of Colombo and elsewhere. Fighting has continued for the most part since then, halted briefly by a handful of peace agreements, some of them high-profile. Under an accord signed with India in 1987, the government gave in to some Tamil demands, including devolution of power to the provinces and official status for the Tamil language. But fighting continued. The Tamils fought an Indian peacekeeping force deployed in the north and east as part of the 1987 accord, and after years of bloody fighting, the Indians withdrew in early 1990. The United States designated the LTTE as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. In February 2002, Sri Lanka's government and the LTTE signed a cease-fire agreement at Norwegian-sponsored talks. But the LTTE dropped out of the negotiations a year later, claiming they were being marginalized. They launched a suicide bombing campaign the next year. The Tigers stepped up their attacks in April 2006 with an explosion at a Sinhalese market and two suicide bombings that killed a top army commander and seriously wounded another. Weeks later, the European Union designated the LTTE as a terrorist organization. Sri Lankan government forces engaged the rebels in heavy fighting in 2008 in the Kilinochchi region, once the capital and center of political power for the Tamil Tigers. The Tigers ran a parallel administration from Kilinochchi with their own police force, courts, prisons and taxes. But after Sri Lanka launched a new offensive against the rebels in the autumn, the insurgents moved their nerve center and logistics bases to Mullaitivu, on the northeastern coast. After hovering on the outskirts of Kilinochchi for more than a month, government troops retook the city. Rajapaksa declared it a ""victory against separatism"" -- but violence soon followed.","Conflict between Tamil Tigers and government has lasted more than 25 years .

"When you get married, ideally it's for keeps. That's wonderful and devoutly to be wished for -- but you're also left with a wide and weird base of knowledge that you'll (hopefully) never use again. My husband and I planned our wedding in the course of 83 days, and by all accounts, things went pretty well for both us and the guests. Friendships were forged, food and drink were savored, a baby (not ours) was made, and everyone left danced-out, hung-over, happy, and asking us if we would please consider hosting a wedding reunion the next year. I also got a crash course in managing my stress levels, tempering my expectations, leaning into the people who love us, and all sorts of other emotional matters that the glossy bridal mags might not necessarily cover. Six-and-a-half years later (and still going strong!), perhaps a bride- or groom-to-be might find these tips a useful addition to their hope chest. Wedding photos: When snap-happy guests go too far . 1. Give in to the chaos . The ice swan may melt, the sound system could go on the fritz, it might rain toads -- you'll still be just as married as you would have been had everything gone according to plan. I spent countless hours fussing over hand-writing little table cards, decoupaging candle holders, researching glove lengths and going over all possible natural disasters that could keep our loved ones from attending our nuptials. All that did was stress me out and deflect from the actual purpose of the day: marrying the man I love, in the company of our friends and family. Then a wise, kind friend offered some perspective. She told me that the two of us could serve Tic-Tacs and iced tea in a 7-Eleven parking lot, and everyone would be just as happy, because they'd be there to celebrate the union of two people they love. While I still put in some fretting hours after that, it helped me see the wedding as being less about perfection, and more about celebration. 2. Remember that they're all rooting for you . Say something does go off kilter -- you trip on your hem and faceplant into the cake, the wedding elephant has an accident on the floor or you fumble the name of your beloved a la Princess Diana. If people laugh, it's because it's all part of the grand story that's unfolding -- not because they're gleeful about a screw-up. They're there because they're on your side and are grateful to be part of this momentous occasion, and if they're not, why the heck are they at your wedding? Seriously, take a look at that guest list and snip, snip, snip. 3. Let your loved ones help -- but on your terms . My husband and I had a fairly DIY wedding -- both to cut down on costs and to put our own stamp on the ceremony that would mark the beginning of our married life. We also didn't have a wedding party, because it was a small-ish event and we didn't want people to feel left out. So we asked people if they'd like to help in ways that didn't cost them anything, celebrated their talents in ways they were happy to share, and where we provided supplies and general guidelines. Two musician friends sang as we walked down the aisle, an artist friend carved pumpkins to decorate outside, my sister-in-law rallied willing guests to arrange the flowers we'd bought and picked, and some writers crafted a ritual that celebrated our communal love of food. My best friend from college looked after our mutually-beloved whippet dog, another surprised me with a piece from my favorite poet (Frank O'Hara). My husband's best friend officiated the ceremony, and we let our musically-inclined friends pick the songs they'd most like to dance to. People were also free to simply eat, drink and be merry. The upshot is that our loved ones felt like they had a stake in our wedding -- and in our marriage -- and that feeling continues to this very day. 4. Stay awake and pay attention . I took to calling this ""bridal fugue."" Ask just about any married person if they can remember every detail of their wedding and reception and chances are that it's riddled with big, blurry chunks. It's a joyous, often overwhelming day -- and it's only going to happen once. On the advice of a dear friend, I picked up Sheryl Paul's ""The Conscious Bride."" The author is a counselor who specializes in transitions from single to married, childfree to parenthood, and the like. Paul suggests preparing yourself to stop and take mental snapshots of what's going on around you, and how you feel in that moment, so you can be extremely present on your wedding. Thanks to this, while I don't have every second of our wedding day running on an endless loop in the back of my brain, I have very vivid memories of taking vows, looking out into the room to see so many people I adore all assembled  in one place, funny surprises from my friends and family, and dancing until my feet felt like they were on fire. Even if we were to lose every single picture from that day, these images and feelings would be locked in my heart forever. 5. There's a letdown -- and that's OK . After our post-wedding day brunch, I sat down in a walk-in closet and cried. This had nothing to do with regret, second-guessing or sadness; I'd just married my favorite man on Earth and I was happier in my life than I'd ever been before. But we'd just spent the vast majority of our time over the previous months focusing our energy on planning the joyous event, and the last guests had just said their goodbyes. All those wedding guests we adore were never again going to be in the same place at the same time, the spotlight was off me, and I was no longer a single woman, girlfriend or bride-to-be. I was someone's wife -- a wonderful, but slightly scary new role. And it was time to step into it. I cried a little more and spent a moment saying goodbye to the single self I'd always known. Then I took a deep breath, stood up, walked out of that closet and went to find my new husband.

"What if this is it? After 13 days of searching amid fears that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may never be found, investigators said Thursday that satellites have beamed down a ray of hope -- images of a debris field floating in the southern Indian Ocean that may show wreckage of the jet. It was not immediately clear just how long it would take before investigators could track down just what those images are. Still, ""It is probably the best lead we have right now,"" said John Young, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Australian authorities poring over images that were shot Sunday spotted the debris floating in one of the world's most remote places -- the southern Indian Ocean more than 1,500 miles off the southwest coast of Australia. The images were brought to the authority's attention Thursday morning, it said. The find warranted attention from the Australian Prime Minister. ""Two possible objects related to the search have been identified,"" Tony Abbott told parliament. But satellites have been wrong about Flight 370 before. And Australian authorities warn that the pictures, too, could end in a goose chase and disappointment. If the photographs do show wreckage of the Boeing 777-200ER that departed Kuala Lumpur on March 8 and never arrived in Beijing, what would be next? Locate . The first mission is to find the ""blob,"" as Young called it. One piece of the debris is 24 meters (79 feet) long. ""The size and fact that there are a number located in the same area really makes it worth looking at,"" he said. He urged caution. ""Our experience is that there is debris out there -- from ships, for example, falling overboard,"" he said. ""I don't want to speculate about what they are until we get there and we see them."" One expert said that might happen soon. ""I would say a day -- guessing,"" said Capt. Timothy Taylor, president of Tiburon Subsea Services and an ocean search expert. Time is critical, given that the batteries powering the pings emanating from the plane's voice and data recorders go dead after about 30 days. ""There's a clock ticking,"" Taylor said. ""Maybe 18 days left."" Overcome complications . Complicating the search -- which the Australian Maritime Safety Authority suspended Thursday night and will resume Friday morning -- is the fact that the debris field is probably far away from where it was when it was spotted in satellite images shot four days ago. ""It could have drifted a thousand miles,"" he said. And he noted, too, that the debris may be unrelated. ""It could be just a false lead,"" Taylor told CNN's ""New Day."" John Blaxland, senior fellow at Australian National University and an expert on Australian radar, agreed. ""I'm a little bit pessimistic,"" he told ""New Day."" He said the debris might be one of the ubiquitous cargo containers carried by ships around the world. ""It's not at all inconceivable that that's exactly what it is,"" he said, adding that other satellites have been steered to the area to get a better view. ""The problem now is we don't know exactly where"" it is, he said. And poor visibility has not helped. ""It's still really hard, in this kind of environment, to pick out these little semi-submerged blips,"" he said. ""You're looking for something that is potentially not even there anymore."" Search . Four planes were involved in Thursday's search, which covered 8,880 square miles (23,000 square kilometers) about 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometers) southwest of Perth, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. An Australian plane has flown over the area, and more planes were on their way, including at least one from the United States and one from New Zealand. But the planes burn much of their fuel just to get to the remote spot, leaving them little time to search. ""We are in the most isolated part of the world,"" Australian Defense Minister David Johnston told Sky News. If pilots do find the field, they would drop a buoy to mark the spot and to transmit data to help ships find it, aviation expert Bill Waldock said. But the area is known for high winds, and white-capped waves could obscure any debris, he added. And on top of that, a storm in the area may have foiled one flyover. The crew of a Royal Australian Air Force P-3 Orion was unable to find the objects, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a tweet. Clouds and rain made things hard to see. Eyeball . ""What we're looking for is a confirmation that it does belong to the aircraft, or it does not,"" Young said. If a ship reaches the suspected wreckage, it would take some of it back to land for inspection, he said. But the expanse of ocean contains a mass of floating garbage from around the world, which could mingle with any plane parts. Recover . In a stroke of luck for investigators, a Norwegian merchant cargo vessel carrying 19 sailors and a cargo of cars reached the suspected debris location and is pitching in on the search. ""All men are on deck to continue the search,"" said Erik Gierchsky, a spokesman for the Norwegian Shipowners Association, in a telephone interview with CNN, adding that they were planning to work through the night in shifts, using lights and binoculars. ""It's OK weather, with some fog,"" he said. The 755-foot (230-meter) Hoegh St. Petersburg is owned by Hoegh Autoliners. It had been headed to Melbourne, Australia, from South Africa when it diverted to help in the search, he said. Its presence opens great possibilities, said former CIA counterterrorism expert Jeff Beatty. It could serve as a base for the salvage teams, especially if it is equipped for helicopter landings, which Gierchsky said might be possible, given that the ship has a flat deck. If refueled in the air, the choppers could carry divers to the ship, and they could search for any debris. Asked how long it would remain on site, Gierchsky said, ""It will be there as long as required ... at least all of tomorrow."" Another merchant ship arrived in the area Thursday evening, the maritime authority said. In all, six merchant ships have aided in the search since an appeal was issued Monday night. And the Royal Australian Navy ship HMAS Success was en route to the search area on Thursday. The issue of the remaining lifetime of the batteries powering the cockpit recorder and flight data recorder looms. They were stored inside the tail of the jetliner. If the tail is found, it may have to be disassembled. French rescuers have underscored to Malaysia's leaders the importance of finding the recorders quickly, said Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister. After Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic in 2009, it took two years and a special submarine for investigators to find them. Malaysia does not have that submarine technology, which makes finding the data recorders before the signals fail all the more important, he added. Analyze . The recorders could be invaluable to investigators trying to find out what happened to the flight. The flight data recorder holds about 17,000 pieces of information, said David Soucie, author of ""Why Planes Crash: An Accident Investigator Fights for Safe Skies."" And then there is the cockpit recording. Though it keeps only two hours of recordings, it too could prove key. ""The last two hours of what happened before this aircraft impacted could be really important to determine whether or not there was foul play,"" he said. Keep an open mind . The searchers have not put all of their resources into hunting for the tantalizing debris. On Thursday, four aircraft continued to search along the northern corridor, and 25 aircraft and 18 ships were searching along the southern corridor, Hishammuddin said. ""Until we are certain that we have located MH370, search and rescue operations will continue in both corridors,"" he said. China was using 21 satellites to search within its borders, the airline said.

"A New York grand jury has declined to indict a white police officer who shot and killed an ailing 68-year-old black veteran in his own apartment, the Westchester County District Attorney's Office said Thursday. The shooting occurred in November after police responded to a call that Kenneth Chamberlain, who suffered from respiratory and heart problems, had set off his medical alert device, indicating he needed help. The encounter was recorded by audio and video devices which police released to the public yesterday to counter charges they had engaged in excessive force and racial profiling. District Attorney Janet DiFiore called the shooting ""a tragedy on many levels"" but said the grand jury had not chosen to indict after hearing from 42 witnesses, including Police Officer Anthony Carelli, who fired the fatal shots. ""There were civilian witnesses, there were police witnesses, there were expert witnesses,100 exhibits went before that jury. And in this case most of this event was captured in audio of video tape,"" DiFiore said.  ""All of that information was before the people who made the determination in this case."" Following her announcement, the White Plains Police Department released much of this evidence, including portions of the audio and video tapes and 200 pages of documents. In the very early hours of November 19, Chamberlain had accidently set off a medical alert pendant he wore around his neck in case of emergency. The company that monitors the device alerted the city which dispatched an ambulance to the scene. Police arrived first and are seen entering on a hallway security camera. An audio tape of a speakerphone inside Chamberlain's apartment records the dispatcher asking Chamberlain if he is okay. He repeatedly says he is fine and asks for police to go away. ""This is your health center, Full life aid. Mr. Chamberlain do you need help?,"" they ask him at one point. ""Yes, this is emergency, I have the White Plains Police Department knocking on my door and I did not call them and I am not sick,"" he replies, then he is heard asking the police to please go away. In the written reports, Officer Stephen Demchuk describes Chamberlain as an irrational man who stuck an 8-inch butcher knife through a crack in the door and jammed it shut with a chair when police tried to enter. Police carried a Taser gun with a video camera on it that recorded about 20 minutes of their determination to get inside. A metal object is protruding through a crack in the door but it is unclear what it is. Next, police can be seen forcing the door open and firing the taser at Chamberlain who is wearing only shorts. He is standing there with only one arm visible at his side and yells ""shoot me, shoot me, mother (expletive), shoot me:"" It is unclear whether the Taser fire strikes him. He is left standing there when the video cuts off. Police say that after the Taser failed they shot bean bags at Chamberlain, then forced their way in. Demchuk says Chamberlain made """"continuous slashing motions towards my head and face"" and that officer Carelli only fired real bullets when Chamberlain went after another officer ""with the butcher knife raised."" Photos of the crime scene show signs of forced entry, blood on the floor and an overturned chair. There is no video of the the shooting. ""He feared for his life,"" said Chamberlain's son, also named Kenneth. ""He kept asking them to go away and that he didn't need their help."" He said his father was an old man who was sick and said police were not justified in forcing their way in when he had committed no crime. Shooting draws parallels to Trayvon Martin case . ""They were supposed to be there to help him because of a medical alert,"" he said. Chamberlain's niece, Tonya Greenhill, was outside the door with police, asking them to let her talk to her uncle instead of forcing their way in, she said. ""I heard my uncle begging and pleading them to please leave him alone,"" Greenhill said.  ""I could begin to almost hear fear in his voice."" Chamberlain, a former Marine, had such severe respiratory problems he could not walk a flight of stairs, according to his medical records. An autopsy released yesterday showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.11 -- high enough to be considered legally drunk. Greenhill, who lives in the building, said her uncle told them he was fine when they arrived but did not want to open the door. She said she insisted to police that they let him talk to his family, but they refused. David Chong, White Plains public safety commissioner, told reporters: ""We are obligated as a police department never to walk away from an emergency and we're not going to."" He added that his department would be reviewing the entire case and how they deal with emotionally disturbed people in the future. The city has said it will also conduct an independent review. In wake of the case of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed, black 17-year-old who was shot and killed in Sanford, Florida, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, the Chamberlain case gained national attention with more than 206,000 signing an online petition asking for the district attorney to charge the officers involved in the shooting with murder and civil rights violations. The family said they believed Chamberlain was treated differently because he lives in a housing project and is black. They said could hear one of the police officers on the audio tape referring to Chamberlain by using the N-word. That was not part of the evidence released yesterday, but the district attorney confirmed it was on the tape and said: ""The use of a racial epithet in any context is offensive to the dignity of all of us.""","Grand jury declines to indict police officer who fired fatal shots in November .

"President Barack Obama has signed a covert directive authorizing U.S. support for Syrian rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday. The secret order, referred to as an intelligence ""finding,"" allows for clandestine support by the CIA and other agencies. It was unclear when the president signed the authorization for Syria, but the sources said it was within the past several months. CNN inside Syria . The Obama administration has said it will step up its assistance to the opposition in the wake of last month's failure by the U.N. Security Council to agree on tougher sanctions against al-Assad's regime. Exactly what type of support the finding authorizes is also unclear. The Obama administration has ruled out arming the rebels for now, providing only nonlethal assistance, such as communications equipment. Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department approved a license allowing the Washington Syrian Support Group to provide direct financial assistance to the Free Syrian Army.  The Washington-based representative of the Free Syrian Army is allowed to conduct financial transactions on the rebel group's behalf but is not allowed to send military equipment. During the war in Libya, Obama signed a similar directive authorizing covert assistance for rebels in the battle against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The Obama administration has resisted arming the opposition, in part, because U.S. officials don't know enough about the rebels. Al-Assad to army: Restore order to Syria . U.S. officials have told CNN that Washington is cooperating with countries that are arming the rebels, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to help find groups worthy of aid. Diplomatic sources have also said the United States is providing intelligence on Syrian troop movements, which is then passed to rebel groups. Foreign policy experts on Wednesday urged the Obama administration to increase its support of the armed opposition. Testifying before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy argued the United States should start arming the Syrian opposition, but only under the right conditions. ""At this point, given the direction of the conflict, I think that what we need to do is assess which groups could we and should we arm at what point, and make that decision,"" Tabler told the Senate panel. ""I think that we're actually at that decision, given where the conflict is going."" James Dobbins of the Rand Corporation agreed. ""The time has come to consider and pick those groups that are most consistent with our interest and our vision for the future and begin to advantage them in terms of the internal politics, by providing assistance, including perhaps money as well as arms and advice,"" Dobbins said. Syrian rebels hold pro-government prisoners . Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel now with the Brookings Institution, recommended arming the opposition, but in a ""wise way."" ""We need to do it in a way that, first of all, we understand who we're supporting and what their intentions are,"" Indyk said. The State Department said Wednesday the United States has set aside $25 million for ""nonlethal"" assistance to the Syrian opposition, with another $64 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people. The humanitarian aid, which includes funding for the World Food Programme, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other aid agencies, helps support the tens of thousands of refugees streaming across Syria's borders to neighboring Turkey and Jordan.

"London (CNN)One of the most successful businessmen of all time, Henry Ford, once said: ""Whether you think you can, or think you can't -- you are right."" The implication is that your mind is a powerful tool -- if not the most powerful tool -- in securing your success. So, how do you begin to leverage that power? ""Goal setting is possibly the most powerful skill a person can have,"" says Brian Mayne, author of ""Goal Mapping."" ""The key is to command your subconscious. It is like your own personal navigation or satellite system."" Research tells us that the subconscious might indeed be a powerful partner. According to a study by former Stanford cell biologist Bruce Lipton, the conscious mind can process roughly 40 bits of data per second, while the subconscious mind can process over 40 million per second. Studies also show that if you plant a goal in your awareness -- your subconscious will keep you working towards it -- even without you being aware that you are doing so. Read more: Is a wandering mind a creative mind? Essentially, your conscious mind can be compared to the front screen of your computer, while the subconscious is like the internal control program that runs the show, says Mayne. The trouble of course, is that we generally have no clue what's going on behind the scenes of our consciousness -- let alone how to direct it. Get out the crayons . One way to start taking charge of your subconscious, says Mayne, is to get out the crayons. ""Typical goal setting involves only words, and words have limited power on the subconscious."" ""Drawing up a map of your goal does two things,"" he says. It engages both the analytical and creative side of the brain -- creating more clarity and more access to the subconscious."" Putting a box of crayons in front of leaders and asking them to draw a picture, may seem a rather bold move. But, the reviews are impressive. Brian Mayne's 7 Steps to Goal Mapping . Step 1: DREAM:  What do you want to achieve . Step 2: ORDER: Which goals take priority . Step 3: DRAW: Communicate your goals to your subconscious . Step 4: WHY: Identify your emotional drivers . Step 5: WHEN: Define your timeline . Step 6: HOW: What are the actions you will need to take . Step 7: WHO: Choose the people or organizations that can support you . Mayne's creative-analytical approach has been picked up by companies and school systems around the world. British Telecom uses goal mapping with new employees and in performance reviews. Read more: Why we all have creative powers . Microsoft's United Kingdom division had their best results ever, the year they were introduced to goal mapping. ""We got a lot of credit for that,"" says Mayne, ""and they then asked us to duplicate it in an online program, which they have used with 65,000 of their people around the world."" The process, he says, is similar to the use of visualization in sports -- where the technique is well-known and well documented. But drawing, he says, can be especially helpful to people who have a harder time visualizing. ""Science tells us again and again, that athletes who visualize sinking the putt or getting it in the hoop do a better job,"" says Frank Niles, Ph.D., social scientist and managing partner of Scholar Executive Group. ""Those moments when you think about an experience and get excited about it -- what happens to your pupils, your skin, your breathing -- that is exactly what visualization does. It primes you to act. You are basically tricking your brain into thinking you are an expert already."" World kickboxing champion Katalin Konya, says mapping out her goal, helped her to win the championship. ""It is hard to explain what it does, but it gives me a feeling of 'yes, I can do it,' and 'yes I can achieve it.' I usually explain it as a bridge between my dreams and my reality."" Konya didn't just draw her way to a kickboxing championship -- just like you probably won't dream your way to a senior VP position. The steps to success . Effective goal setting involves planning, practice, and action. ""You can visualize the mountain peak, but if you don't know how to get there, you wont get there,"" says Niles. ""The difference is known as process versus outcome visualization. Break the goal down into small steps, and that basically sums up what science tells us about how visualization works,"" he says. And that may be why goal mapping is so effective. In one study, University of California researchers had a group of students visualize doing well in an exam, and another group visualizing taking the necessary steps to reach the goal. The results were clear in favor of the group who visualized studying, reading and gaining required skills and knowledge. They not only did better, but spent longer preparing, focused more attention on the steps needed to reach the goal, and reduced anxiety in the process. ""Goal settting is a science,"" says Mayne. ""A lot of people think goal setting is something you do once per year, around sports. But we should all be setting goals for ourselves all the time."" Nothing's impossible . Mayne's first goal? Learning how to read at 29. Read more: The power of positive thought . ""I grew up in a traveling family, and never really went to school,"" he says. At the age of 30, having just learned to read -- his passion for learning and teaching people how to set goals, took off.

"A St. Louis-area police officer has been fired after making what his chief called ""very concerning and inappropriate"" Facebook comments on the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, according to a city official. ""These protesters should be put down like a rabid dog the first night,"" Matthew Pappert, a police officer in the city of Glendale, wrote in one post, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. There were reportedly five inappropriate posts, KMOV said. Pappert was originally suspended on August 22 after the comments came to light. An inquiry was initiated that day. ""Officer Pappert was dismissed following the conclusion of the investigation,"" Glendale City Administrator Jaysen Christensen said. ""Our focus at this point is to move past this, and turn the focus back to healing in the City (sic) of Ferguson."" Glendale, like Ferguson, is a municipality in St. Louis County. The two suburbs are about 15 miles apart. In announcing a week ago that Pappert had been suspended, Glendale Police Chief Jeffrey Beaton cited what he called ""very concerning and inappropriate posts on his personal Facebook page,"" according to the Webster-Kirkwood Times, an online news outlet in the area. Police have come under fire for their heavy-handed response to the protests in Ferguson that followed the shooting death earlier this month of an unarmed black teenager by a white Ferguson police officer. An attorney for Pappert issued a statement saying the officer was sorry for his comments. ""Officer Pappert is deeply remorseful about what he posted on social media,"" his lawyer, William Goldstein, said. ""We ask for (the) same spirit of forgiveness and the opportunity for redemption.""

"(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir says he will accept the results of a referendum this month that could see the country split in two.

He called on the government in the south to provide a safe environment for the referendum. ""The referendum process shall go on with God's blessings, with the trust of our commitment that we will renew at this moment,"" al-Bashir said, ""and accepting the result that will come from the desire of the citizens and their choices."" Al-Bashir made the comments in a speech Friday marking Sudan's 55th Independence Day. He also promised to negotiate what comes after the referendum.

"(CNN)How are Quebecois chefs putting their unique spin on traditional French cuisine? Who are the language police, and what do they really do? Inhabitants of Quebec, Canada's largest French-speaking province, pride themselves on being different from their neighbors, and that sentiment extends from the language they speak to the food on their plates, and beyond. If there's anything that unites all Quebecers, it's their joie de vivre: Quebec is a place where fun is taken seriously. Consider these truths for a better understanding of the province: . 1. This is French soil, with a language police . This tiny francophone enclave has some of the strictest language laws in the world. French must be the predominant language on signs, retail or food service employees always greet customers in French, and there are even laws dictating whether parents can send their children to English or French school. O Canada! Our home and delicious land . About 80% of the province's nearly 8 million inhabitants have French as a mother tongue, and outside of multicultural metropolis Montreal, most people only speak French. Time.com: Quebec's war on English . There's an entity called the OQLF (Office quebecois de la langue francaise), otherwise known as the language police. They enforce the rules by doling out fines to noncompliant businesses, and are usually plain clothed and covert. Recently, language tensions have risen among locals, and OQLF overzealousness was the main culprit. 2. There are Catholic churches for sale . Given that Quebec's most popular curse words (""tabarnak"" and ""ostie"") are derived from church terms, it's not surprising the Catholic church once played a big role here, but today many of the parishes are empty and have fallen into disrepair. Many of the buildings are for sale, and buyers have been difficult to come by. Some are being demolished, while others have been converted for non-religious purposes. Montreal band Arcade Fire recorded their Grammy Award-winning album The Suburbs in a church in rural Farnham, Quebec, but they recently put up their ""Petite Ã©glise"" (little church) for sale, citing a damaged roof. 3. Quebec has its own national holiday . Canada Day is on July 1, and while Quebecers still get that day off, those celebrations are muted compared to those of St. Jean Baptiste Day -- known as FÃªte Nationale  -- held a week earlier on June 24. Because it falls right at the start of summer, the festivities are held outdoors. Quebec has a robust francophone music industry, with its own stars, and St. Jean Baptiste Day is the perfect time to check out the folk revival scene live. There's a strong nationalistic component to the holiday -- especially for the current minority who believe Quebec should be its own country. Just be sure to wear blue and keep all Maple Leaf-related paraphernalia at home. 4. Quebec loves small town hockey . The Montreal Canadiens are the only Quebec-based team in the NHL, but outside of Montreal, the storied Habs aren't unanimously adored. The province has its own junior hockey league for players aged 16-20, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, with teams hailing primarily from smaller towns (including a few outside of Quebec). It's the league where NHL Hall of Famers Mario Lemieux and Patrick Roy cut their teeth. There's also the rock 'em sock 'em minor-pro North American Hockey League, more famous for fights than goals. While Quebecers don't participate in hockey en masse the way they used to, it's still the most popular sport there, and in the winter, towns will erect their own free, outdoor rinks. 5. Many Quebecers speak joual . The language of MoliÃ¨re has evolved considerably in the former French colony. Each region has its own linguistic quirks (they're not all called joual, but the term has become a catch-all), and visitors from other French speaking places are often taken aback by the unique contractions and ""anglicisms"" that have crept into the daily vernacular. The most creative and colorful joual from the Montreal region usually entails combining multiple words into one, lopping off extraneous syllables or casually dropping English terms with French pronunciation. For instance, most people simply say ""weekend"" instead of ""fin de semaine."" Sentences often end with ""tsÃ©,"" which means ""tu sais,"" or ""you know""? Joual is considered a working-class dialect, so while it's celebrated for being homegrown, people of a certain stature aspire to speak a more refined French. 6. Montreal and Quebec City have their own haute cuisine scenes . With almost no outside interference, Montreal has forged its own strange culinary identity, bringing formal French education and homegrown ingredients to rich, meat-heavy Quebec staples. Expect a lot of foie gras (duck liver), Princess scallops, Matane shrimp, organic vegetables, cheese and high-quality pork. For those interested in game, venison and caribou appear on some menus. In Quebec City, where the cooking scene is more youthful, there's a fierce commitment to using only made-in-Quebec ingredients. Quebec is by far the world's largest producer of maple syrup, and during the spring thaw in March, sugar shacks (cabanes Ã  sucre) offer the tasty treat, poured over snow or with a full meal of pancakes, beans, pork and more. Because cooking school is subsidized by the provincial government, trained chefs in Quebec tend to come from more diverse backgrounds. 7. Even the poutine is being reinvented . The cat is out of the bag concerning Quebec's slimiest treat. The famous dish -- consisting of fries, sauce brune (gravy) and cheese curds -- is being copied in the rest of Canada, and has even made its way down to New York. In Montreal specifically, some chefs have expanded upon the traditional poutine by adding fancier toppings like foie gras and duck confit. The greasy spoon (or casse-croÃ»te) favorite is no longer just for famished drunks. A few towns in Quebec claim to have invented poutine, but the loudest and proudest of those is Drummondville, an hour east of Montreal. 8. Quebec's biggest party is also when it's coldest . Carnaval du Quebec is held every February in Quebec City, the provincial capital, and the success and sheer size of the event is a testament to Quebecers' defiance toward the cold. There are myriad outdoor activities to partake in over the two-week-long, tourist-friendly festival, but the biggest draws are the massive, illuminated ice palace and the ice sculpture contest. The ice palace is meant to be the home of Bonhomme, the festival's smiling mascot. The big guy's reach extends far beyond Carnaval though: he's one of Quebec's most recognizable faces. 9. Bear the cold: Quebec's best activities are done outdoors . Ice fishing and snowshoeing -- two activities that were long ago done for necessity -- have evolved into beloved pastimes. Wherever there's a frozen lake in Quebec, expect to see a handful of temporary huts over it. Renting the necessary gear during the season -- which goes from December to February -- is a painless process. Snowshoe technology has modernized dramatically. Snowshoes don't look like oversized tennis rackets anymore: they're made with lightweight synthetic materials, and there are different types, depending on whether you're walking in the deep snow for leisure or sport. In the summer, there's the Route Verte: a network of bicycle paths that stretches across the province from West to East. 10. Expo 67 modernized Montreal, and there are still remnants of it . Montrealers can be shameless braggarts when it comes to civic pride, and the World's Fair the city hosted in 1967, known simply as Expo 67, is considered by many natives to be a high-water mark for the city. Much of the infrastructure built for the Fair remains. The city's underground public transportation system, the Metro, opened a year before the Expo, and the dirt that was excavated was used to create the artificial island ÃŽle Notre-Dame, which is where the Formula One racetrack and casino (formerly the French Pavilion) are located. There's also Habitat 67, a gravity defying housing development originally conceptualized using Lego pieces (and it shows), and the Biosphere, a geodesic dome that was originally the American Pavilion. Another international Pavilion that survived the test of time? Jamaica's -- it's used for private events now. 11. The roads are in bad shape . Blame the weather, the materials used or government ineptitude, but Quebec roads don't seem to hold up as well as those of their American or Ontarian neighbors. In addition to mammoth potholes and cracks, road surface markings seem to fade quickly. Road conditions are especially bad during spring, when the snow melts and temperatures rise. And that's to say nothing of Montreal's crumbling interchanges and overpasses, which probably look worse than they really are. Be prepared to be redirected a fair bit during the summer, because that's when most construction work is done.","The ""language police"" enforce strict rules aimed at preserving French in Quebec .

"In the space of a short few months, the self-styled Islamic State (also known by the acronym ISIS) has claimed to have established a fundamentalist state and revived the Caliphate, while seemingly monopolizing the market on young foreign fighters from Europe and North America, while conducting a sophisticated social media and propaganda campaign. Amid the highly publicized beheadings of Western journalists, soldiers and aid workers accompanied by personal messages to U.S. President Barack Obama, ISIS has established itself as the main jihadist group in the world today, leaving al Qaeda struggling to make an impact. However, al Qaeda is now fighting back and seem eager to reclaim some of the limelight. In a 55-minute video released less than two weeks ago, the current leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, promised to ""raise the flag of Jihad"" and to spread Islamic rule across the South Asia by operating in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, under the new rubric ""Qaeda al-Jihad."" Although government officials are still trying to verify the authenticity of the video, the idea has already been welcomed by the Pakistani Taliban, whilst India has expressed deep concerns over al Qaeda's plan to establish a permanent presence in the region. Al-Zawahiri's announcement did come as a bit of a surprise, as the recent activities of ISIS had been dominating news headlines all over the world and led many to believe that al Qaeda has now dwindled and faded into the background, as newer, younger and more sophisticated groups have replaced it. As to why the Indian subcontinent has been declared as the new home for al Qaeda, Zawahiri cites the aim of rescuing Muslims from oppression and injustice in the region as the group's main driving force. 'Muslim lands' In the video, al-Zawahiri makes reference to tribal violence in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Assam and Kashmir, as well as violence against the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar. By arguing that places such as Bangladesh and Myanmar were once ""Muslim lands"" until the enemy occupied and fragmented them, al-Zawahiri proposes that the lives of Muslim people in the region can be improved and liberated through the establishment of an Islamic state guided by Sharia law. However, the timing of the video suggests the reasons al-Zawahiri gives are surface deep. In truth, this bold announcement by al Qaeda is more likely an attempt to branch out into new and untapped markets that are viewed as beyond the reach of its rival, ISIS. This would be an obvious and natural thing for al Qaeda to do since ISIS clearly has far more success both globally, in terms of publicity, and locally, in that they have eclipsed the local al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al Nusra. ISIS has also managed to do things al Qaeda never could. For one, being primarily focused on fighting a distant enemy -- the West -- al Qaeda has been unable to evolve beyond being a terrorist organization, whilst ISIS has moved from being an al Qaeda offshoot to progressing into a fully-fledged state -- or at least that is how they and their fellow jihadists view things. This has enabled ISIS to attract foreign fighters on a far larger scale than al Qaeda ever did. More worryingly, from al Qaeda's perspective, is the fact ISIS seems to be attracting smaller splinter groups previously viewed as being in al Qaeda's domain of influence. For example, the Algeria-based ""Soldiers of the Caliphate"" group, which was previously viewed as an al Qaeda-linked faction in North Africa, recently declared itself an ally of ISIS. Regardless of the reasons al Qaeda gives -- or does not give -- as to why it is expanding into the Indian Sub-Continent, the strategic and tactical implications of this move are potentially immense. Firstly, although 80% of the population is Hindu, according to a 2011 census, India alone houses around 140 million Muslims whilst another 132 million or so Muslims are in Bangladesh. This means roughly one fifth of the world's Muslims are in these two countries alone, whilst Myanmar is home to a small Muslim community that is being systematically persecuted. Al Qaeda's plan will fail . With the Pakistani market being saturated and ISIS increasingly dominating the Middle East, one can understand why al Qaeda has decided to push into this largely untapped market, especially since so few jihadist recruits, in relative terms, have been from these two countries historically. However, there are good reasons why India and Bangladesh have not been fertile breeding grounds for jihadists in the past. These countries have their extremist minorities too but they have not experienced the large influx of Gulf State largesse that neighboring Pakistan has, and they have much more pluralistic cultural traditions. In the case of India at least, there is also a much more robust democracy and in the case of both countries Islamist-inspired groups do not have significant influence in government. In all likelihood, al Qaeda's attempts to branch into India and Bangladesh will fail. In fact, al-Zawahiri is illustrating his cultural naivety by making this announcement and assuming that these countries are just like Pakistan. They have also got off to a very bad start by mistakenly attacking a Pakistan frigate which they mistook for an American aircraft carrier a couple of days ago. Three terrorists were killed and seven arrested in the failed attempt. It is clear is that al Qaeda is panicking and witnessing the rise of ISIS with dread and jealousy. However, they will have to work a lot harder to regain the momentum they lost after the killing of Osama bin Laden.","ISIS has established itself as the main jihadist group in the world today .

"(CNN)Longtime New York City radio and television personality Joe Franklin has died. He was 88. ""Joe went unexpectedly and passed away Saturday night,"" friend and former producer Steve Garrin said. Franklin was a fixture on late-night radio and TV in New York, working at WJZ and WOR, and recently at the Bloomberg Radio Network. ""The last two weeks were the first time he ever missed a broadcast in over 60 years"" Garrin said. Though he never broke onto the national scene, Franklin was ""in many ways, the pioneer of the modern TV talk show format,"" according to his website, which says he interviewed more than 300,000 guests. The likes of Woody Allen, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Bill Cosby and Liza Minnelli got early exposure on his show. He also interviewed offbeat characters who would give ""The Joe Franklin Show"" a ""great uniqueness. On any given night you might find a world renown artist sitting next to a balloon folder from New Jersey,"" his website says. He was remembered as a ""NYC legend"" and ""radio and TV icon who was the spirit of a hard-working New Yorker"" by fans on Twitter. Others said that his ""accidental absurdism was like an Ionesco play every night"" and that ""Joe Franklin was every New Yorker's oddball, congenial neighbor."" People we've lost in 2015 . Franklin, who was often parodied on ""Saturday Night Live"" by Billy Crystal, also played himself in such films as ""Manhattan,"" ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Broadway Danny Rose."" He was an avid collector of entertainment nostalgia. His website says he had more than 50,000 movie stills, 170,000 magazines, 20,000 playbills and 200,000 pieces of sheet music. Photographs show a lot of his collection crammed into his office. Actress Martha Plimpton tweeted: ""All the best things about New York are going away. RIP Joe Franklin."" And a tweet from Actor Harvey Fierstein read: ""Joe Franklin gone!!!! Damn! He gave me my first TV exposure and I certainly wasn't alone in that."" That sentiment may be his enduring legacy, as comedy writer Chris Regan tweeted: ""Before YouTube, Twitter, etc., the ambitious-but-not-necessarily-talented had few options.

"Last week, the Anti-Defamation League issued a warning: The Passover holiday was coming up Monday. So was Adolf Hitler's birthday next Sunday -- two events that could coincide with the increased possibility of violent attacks against Jewish community centers. On Sunday, that dire prediction came true. A 73-year-old Missouri man with a long resume of anti-Semitism and white supremacist activism is accused of opening fire outside two Jewish centers in the Kansas City area. Police say Frazier Glenn Cross killed a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather in the parking lot of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, and a 53-year-old woman in the parking lot of the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Community, also in Overland Park. While authorities haven't disclosed any suspected motive, Cross -- who also goes by Frazier Glenn Miller -- has been active in the white supremacy movement since the 1970s. But after cooperating with federal authorities following an arrest in the mid-1980s, he became an outcast among much of that community, the ADL said. The group described Cross -- referring to him by his pseudonym of Miller -- as ""a perennial but peripheral figure"" in the movement in recent years. Attempts at launching white supremacist publications flopped, and the votes he received in a 2010 write-in bid for U.S. Senate failed to break the double-digit mark. 3 dead in separate shootings . Sunday's attacks come at a time when anti-Semitic incidents in the United States are at their lowest level in decades. In an audit released this month, the ADL reported 751 incidents in 2013, down 19% from the previous year. But while the number of total incidents dropped, there was a significant increase in violent anti-Semitic assaults in 2013. The ADL audit recorded 31 anti-Semitic assaults on Jewish people or those perceived as Jewish in 2013, up from 17 in 2012. ""The high number of violent in-your-face assaults,"" said ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, ""is a sobering reminder that, despite the overall decline in anti-Semitic incidents, there is still a subset of Americans who are deeply infected with anti-Semitism and who feel emboldened enough to act out their bigotry."" And Cross was ""among the most-over-the-top, violent white supremacists"" of the 1980s, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino. ""He was one of the pioneers in the modern hate world,"" he said. ""He's been entrenched in the hate movement his entire adult life."" Cross obtained the guns allegedly used in the shootings from a straw buyer -- a person with a clean background check who buys firearms on another person's behalf, a U.S. law enforcement official said Monday. Views shaped early . A Green Beret who served 20 years in the Army, including two tours in Vietnam, Cross has racist views that were shaped early in life, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. The SPLC, like the ADL, referred to Cross by his pseudonym of Miller. His father gave him a copy of a newspaper published by the National States' Rights Party, and within two minutes, he said he knew he'd found a home in the movement. Who were the victims? In the early 1980s, he founded and ran the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. But instead of the traditional white robe of the Klan, he preferred fatigues and recruited active-duty soldiers as members. According to the ADL, which released a summary of its files on Cross/Miller on Monday, the group ""drew notoriety for its paramilitary training exercises"" and was behind several attacks on African-Americans during that era. Cross himself  ""was one of the more notorious white supremacists in the U.S."" The SPLC sued him for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and for intimidating African-Americans. The two sides settled, with the Knights barred from operating. But a month later, Cross resurfaced with an offshoot: the White Patriot Party. A kill list? In 1986, a Marine admitted selling the group anti-tank rockets, mines and explosives, according to the SPLC. Because he founded another paramilitary group when a court forbade him to do so, Cross was found in criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison. He appealed, and then bolted. While underground, he sent supporters a kill list, to which he had assigned a point system, according to the SPLC: Blacks (1 point); ""White race traitors"" (10); Jews (10);  judges (50); SPLC founder Morris Dees (888). The FBI caught up with him in Missouri, where they tear-gassed him out of a mobile home. Inside, they found a cache of weapons. Cooperating with the feds . He served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for plotting robberies and the assassination of Dees.  The short sentence was a result of a plea bargain he struck with federal prosecutors. In exchange, he testified against 14 white supremacists in a sedition trial in Arkansas in 1988. ""He was reviled in white supremacist circles as a 'race traitor' and, for a while, kept a low profile,"" according to an SPLC profile of him. ""Now he's making a comeback with The Aryan Alternative, a racist tabloid he's been printing since 2005."" According to the ADL, the tabloid folded after two issues. But because both had large press runs, the copies were passed around for years. Prolific poster . The SPLC calls Cross ""a raging anti-Semite"" who has posted more than 12,000 times on the Vanguard News Network, an anti-Semitic, white supremacist website. Its slogan: ""No Jews. Just Right."" He has called Jews ""swarthy, hairy, bow-legged, beady-eyed, parasitic midgets."" He ran for office multiple times, including a run for U.S. House and Senate seats. His 2010 campaign for the Senate was ""It's the Jews, Stupid."" According to the SPLC, he received seven votes. Racism meets religion . According to Cross' 1999 autobiography, he is an adherent of Odinism, a neo-pagan religion that experts say has become one of the most vicious strains in the white supremacist movement. ""I'd love to see North America's 100 million Aryan Christians convert to the religion invented by their own race and practiced for a thousand generations before the Jews thought up Christianity,"" he wrote, describing Odinism as ""the religion for a strong heroic people."" In his autobiography, ""A White Man Speaks Out,"" Cross wrote that he had prayed to the Norse god Odin to spark a race war in the United States. Though Odinism has been appropriated by white racists, most adherents are peaceful, earth-loving pagans, said Jonathan White, an expert on white supremacists and a professor at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan . 'Not a fringe character' On Saturday, Cross left for a casino in Missouri. His wife told the SPLC that he called about 10:30 Sunday morning to tell her his winnings were up and all was well. She didn't hear from him after that. The shootings at the Jewish centers took place around 1 p.m. As the gunman sat in the back of a patrol car after his arrest, he shouted, ""Heil Hitler."" Overland Park Police said detectives were investigating statements the suspect made after his arrest but declined to provide additional details. ""This is not your average hate offender,"" said Levin, the California State University professor. ""He's a badass. He's not a fringe character."" Son killed in 2008 shooting . Police shot and killed Cross' son in 2008, according to Rick Witthuhn, police chief in Marionville, Missouri. The incident unfolded after a traffic accident. Jesse Miller, Cross' son, used a shotgun to kill a man who stopped to help him after the crash, CNN affiliate KSPR reported. Then, when a police officer arrived at the scene, he shot at the officer. That same officer then shot and killed him, Witthuhn said. What the killings say about U.S. hate groups .","Frazier Glenn Cross was an adherent of Odinism, a neo-pagan religion .

"There's never been a better time to visit North Korea. The specter of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, a potential nuclear test, assassinations of defectors in South Korea, and general saber-rattling haven't prevented a record 4,000 tourists from arriving in Pyongyang this year. There's even a hopeful air among diplomats that the two Koreas, as well as China and Japan, might find the right balance of words and gestures to smooth out their emotional grievances that fuel regular nationalist flare-ups. The scene at Beijing airport already gives clues into how North Korean society continues to defy economic gravity. Pyongyong elites check in dozens of boxes of household goods (from electronics to wine glasses) for their own use or to resell. Like upscale Iranians ferrying in and out of Dubai, the international, multilingual and urbane class may seem like precisely the ones to support regime change, but also profit the most from the status quo. If you're willing to part with your mobile phone at Pyongyang customs (hint: you have no choice, but they'll give it back to you on departure), you'll clear the airport with an efficiency that puts New York's JFK to shame. Despite Typhoon Bolaven battering the country at the start of our visit, we came during a week when student groups, worker units, and families from all parts of the country flocked to Pyongyang for the Arirang mass games, which take place in the 150,000-capacity May Day stadium and feature up to 100,000 performers in the most spectacularly choreographed precision movements ever staged -- almost every single night. North Koreans are no longer afraid or suspicious to engage with foreigners. Soldiers and students, bus drivers and guards, all smile and wave, snap pictures and shake hands. We encountered locals at the mass games, film studios, world's deepest underground metro, art schools, and delicious restaurants. This is not a society voluntarily marching in lockstep. Like Iranians and Cubans, they are told one story but increasingly encounter the other viewpoints through media and tourism. Our appreciation of their beautiful cultural offerings reminds them that they are a rich civilization temporarily trapped in an anachronistic state. Outside of Pyongyang one witnesses the reality afflicting many of the country's 20 million-plus citizens: poverty and malnutrition. Most of those labeled defectors into China are actually economic migrants, and even in Pyongyang one can tell which children come from poor villages by their ragged sandals and brownish hair, made lighter by long hours under the sun in the fields. One of Pyongyang's crown jewels is the 150-meter tall Juche tower, which celebrates the country's ideal of self-reliance. Plaques in the lobby commemorate the visits of dignitaries and earnest academics from Gambia, Tunisia, Pakistan and dozens of other nations who devoted serious study to North Korea's Juche ideology in the 1970s and 1980s. We all know what's happened to them. North Korea too feels on the cusp of a new phase. Though it hasn't accepted Japanese apologies for World War II imperial atrocities, and its many monuments excoriate in stone America's Korean War aggression in which 420,000 bombs were dropped on Pyongyang alone (greater than the number of residents in the city at the time), the concrete high-rises with intermittent water supply and belching buses are all reaching the end of their shelf-life. Soviet support and fuel subsidies collapsed in the early 1990s, and food security has been tenuous ever since. Most investment now comes from China, but much less so ideological support. Nominally committed to the same Communist ethos, China has still become one of the world's largest economies while North Korea lacks a credit rating. It's not likely that the young regime of Kim Jong-Un will actually collapse. Though the Arab Spring teaches us not to put much faith in the softer sons of iron-fisted rulers, North Korea is a deeply Confucian society and symbolically views itself as still run by Jong-Un's late grandfather and national revolutionary Kim Il-Sung and father Kim Jong-Il. Jong-Un is something of a caretaker while the old clique continues with anti-Japanese propaganda, nuclear brinksmanship, and threats against the South. The country's premier, Kim Jung Nam, has been increasingly visible as a decisive government official, but as with everything else in North Korea, it is a carefully staged diversification of authority, not a transition towards democracy. As one wanders through lively street arcades full of roller-skaters and volleyball games, one has to hope that Confucian communism can make enough space for capitalism such that the burden of isolation falls on the regime rather than society. More tourism, mobile phones, and industrial joint ventures all help. One of the most promising is the Chinese funded special economic zone of Rason at the intersection of Russia and China, a warm water port that would serve all three countries. A decade from now, it could be North Korea's Shenzhen. Another is Dandong, also on China's border. Suddenly North Korea is making flat-screen televisions and its own DVD players. While not wanting to buttress the Kim regime as China has, South Korea fears being marginalized for influence in the North and is returning to the economic engagement of its 1990s ""sunshine"" policy, and is considering expanding investment in its own special economic zone at Kaesong. But a rail line meant to connect Seoul and Pyongyang remains dormant. Still, the North too fears becoming too dependent on China, and like Myanmar, is courting more foreign investment for those with a high appetite for risk. North Korea does indeed have plenty to offer. Its largely mountainous territory is rich in gold and magnesium. Mining operations are picking up, with serious interest from Australia and other extractive giants. Its mighty rivers could be key hydropower resource both to electrify the country and sell power to the South. It also produces agricultural staples like rice, corn, soybeans and potatoes. And of course there could be much more tourism, including to scenic Mt. Paekdu and to witness the centuries of well-preserved Korean traditions in Pyongyang. For example, Beijing-based Koryo Tours has increased its tourist volume from 200 to 2,000 over the past decade, almost half of which are American. The nation's capital, the largest of its half-dozen large cities, feels like an Asian Kiev. Like Ukraine's capital, it has broad avenues with revolutionary monuments and fountains, but also a laid-back, leafy feel. Czech made trams still roll through the city ferrying workers and students between homes, offices, and schools. North Koreans are not automatons but citizens, loyal but misinformed, curious and educated. Whether in schools, billiard halls, or karaoke bars (Some Pyongyang girls have perfected Celine Dion's ""Titanic"" theme song), the people can be quite open about their concerns. Some mothers would rather their kids practice the piano than spend hours training for the mass games; some teachers want their kids to focus more on math. Outside the capital, where information flow is more a one-way street, Western powers and responsible neighbors have to provide the young Kim with opportunities to change the hostile rhetoric. After the New York Philharmonic performed in Pyongyang, the reciprocal visit was effectively killed by Washington, which rejected the North Korean visas. But how about having the mind-blowing Arirang youth performers take stage at halftime in the Superbowl? Surely Kim wouldn't call for America's destruction after that. Indeed, Jong-Un has an opportunity now his failed Arab counterparts missed: to lead the rehabilitation of his country and enjoy his remaining decades not as a pariah but a statesman, not feared by his people but admired by them. Rather than being banned from most international travel he could enjoy basketball games in Europe as he did during high school in Switzerland. Whether or not the North reunifies with the South like West Germany absorbing the East in the early 1990s, the current priority should be turning the country into a passageway between China and South Korea rather than a buffer. There's no guarantee that economic opening will lead to political reform; indeed, China is if anything a more likely future model of governance for North Korea than outright democratization or sudden reunification. All the more reason then to stop pretending that placing conditions on investment such as freezing the nuclear program will actually work. Diplomacy with pre-requisites has a very poor track record with nuclearizing states. Rather than wait for statues to be violently yanked down in city centers, the goal should be de facto economic integration without political humiliation. The heavily fortified De-Militarized Zone (DMZ), then, would quickly go from Cold War flashpoint to nature park given its unique ecosystem and flora. The past 20 years of revolutions followed by slow, halting, and even reversed transitions from the Balkans to the Middle East teaches us to be guarded in our optimism about the pace of change in countries whose political and economic systems have been frozen in time. Today North Korea is like Turkmenistan, isolated and ideological. Even with a surge of infrastructure investment and technology, a decade from now it could at best become like post-Communist Romania, exporting industry and agriculture but still corrupt and destitute. But it would be an economic passageway with greater freedom and opportunity for its people, and have a greater stake in peace than war. So come to North Korea, and come soon: the Pyongyang International Film Festival takes place in September with documentaries and avant garde movies being screened from a dozen countries.","North Korea offers a rich experience for travelers, says Parag Khanna .

"It's the cup of brandy that no one wants to drink. On Tuesday, in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, the surviving Doolittle Raiders will gather publicly for the last time. They once were among the most universally admired and revered men in the United States.  There were 80 of the Raiders in April 1942, when they carried out one of the most courageous and heart-stirring military operations in this nation's history.  The mere mention of their unit's name, in those years, would bring tears to the eyes of grateful Americans. Now only four survive. After Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, with the United States reeling and wounded, something dramatic was needed to turn the war effort around. Even though there were no friendly airfields close enough to Japan for the United States to launch a retaliation, a daring plan was devised.  Sixteen B-25s were modified so that they could take off from the deck of an aircraft carrier.  This had never before been tried -- sending such big, heavy bombers from a carrier. The 16 five-man crews, under the command of Lt. Col. James Doolittle, who himself flew the lead plane off the USS Hornet, knew that they would not be able to return to the carrier.  They would have to hit Japan and then hope to make it to China for a safe landing. But on the day of the raid, the Japanese military caught wind of the plan.  The Raiders were told that they would have to take off from much farther out in the Pacific Ocean than they had counted on.  They were told that because of this they would not have enough fuel to make it to safety. And those men went anyway. They bombed Tokyo, and then flew as far as they could.  Four planes crash-landed; 11 more crews bailed out, and three of the Raiders died.  Eight more were captured; three were executed.  Another died of starvation in a Japanese prison camp. One crew made it to Russia. The Doolittle Raid sent a message from the United States to its enemies, and to the rest of the world: . We will fight. And, no matter what it takes, we will win. Of the 80 Raiders, 62 survived the war.  They were celebrated as national heroes, models of bravery.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced a motion picture based on the raid; ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" starring Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, was a patriotic and emotional box-office hit, and the phrase became part of the national lexicon.  In the movie-theater previews for the film, MGM proclaimed that it was presenting the story ""with supreme pride."" Beginning in 1946, the surviving Raiders have held a reunion each April, to commemorate the mission.  The reunion is in a different city each year.  In 1959, the city of Tucson, Arizona, as a gesture of respect and gratitude, presented the Doolittle Raiders with a set of 80 silver goblets.  Each goblet was engraved with the name of a Raider. Every year, a wooden display case bearing all 80 goblets is transported to the reunion city.  Each time a Raider passes away, his goblet is turned upside down in the case at the next reunion, as his old friends bear solemn witness. Also in the wooden case is a bottle of 1896 Hennessy Very Special cognac.  The year is not happenstance: 1896 was when Jimmy Doolittle was born. There has always been a plan: When there are only two surviving Raiders, they would open the bottle, at last drink from it, and toast their comrades who preceded them in death. As 2013 began, there were five living Raiders; then, in February, Tom Griffin passed away at age 96. The name may be familiar to those of you who regularly read this column; in 2011, I wrote about the role Mr. Griffin played at his son's wedding. What a man he was. After bailing out of his plane over a mountainous Chinese forest after the Tokyo raid, he became ill with malaria, and almost died.  When he recovered, he was sent to Europe to fly more combat missions.  He was shot down, captured, and spent 22 months in a German prisoner of war camp. The selflessness of these men, the sheer guts ... there was a passage in the Cincinnati Enquirer obituary for Mr. Griffin that, on the surface, had nothing to do with the war, but that emblematizes the depth of his sense of duty and devotion: . ""When his wife became ill and needed to go into a nursing home, he visited her every day.  He walked from his house to the nursing home, fed his wife and at the end of the day brought home her clothes.  At night, he washed and ironed her clothes.  Then he walked them up to her room the next morning.  He did that for three years until her death in 2005."" So now, out of the original 80, only four Raiders remain: Dick Cole (Doolittle's co-pilot on the Tokyo raid), Robert Hite, Edward Saylor and David Thatcher.  All are in their 90s.  They have decided that there are too few of them for the public reunions to continue. The events in Fort Walton Beach this week will mark the end.  It has come full circle; Florida's nearby Eglin Field was where the Raiders trained in secrecy for the Tokyo mission. The town is planning to do all it can to honor the men: a six-day celebration of their valor, including luncheons, a dinner and a parade. Do the men ever wonder if those of us for whom they helped save the country have tended to it in a way that is worthy of their sacrifice?  They don't talk about that, at least not around other people.  But if you find yourself near Fort Walton Beach this week, and if you should encounter any of the Raiders, you might want to offer them a word of thanks.  I can tell you from firsthand observation that they appreciate hearing that they are remembered. The men have decided that after this final public reunion they will wait until a later date -- some time this year -- to get together once more, informally and in absolute privacy.  That is when they will open the bottle of brandy.  The years are flowing by too swiftly now; they are not going to wait until there are only two of them. They will fill the four remaining upturned goblets. And raise them in a toast to those who are gone.","Bob Greene: This week, the few remaining Doolittle Raiders will reunite .
In 1942 the 80 men bombed Tokyo in death-defying mission, retaliation for Pearl Harbor .
A case of 80 goblets is brought to their annual reunions. When a Raider dies a cup is upended .
This year, there are four left. They'll toast the Raiders with aged cognac, and end reunions ."
"The extremist group that's taken over a large swath of western and northern Iraq announced on Sunday the establishment of a ""caliphate,"" an Islamic state stretching across the region, and said it would now be known as the Islamic State rather than the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The announcement was made in a newly released audio message and written statement purportedly from the official spokesman of ISIS, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani al-Shami. He said ""Al-Baghdadi"" is the emir of the caliphate, using his real name Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al Samarrai, but who is more commonly known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group said its flag flies from the Aleppo province in Syria to Diyala province in Iraq. The murky battle for Tikrit . Iraq's government is touting military offensive to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists, with some officials taking to state-run television over the weekend to declare the army had defeated the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. But those who live in the city nestled along the Tigris River, about 140 kilometers (about 87 miles) northwest of Baghdad, told a different story on Sunday. ""There are no Iraqi troops here,"" one woman told CNN by telephone from Tikrit. The only presence, at least in her neighborhood, is the ""Islamic state,"" she said, referring to ISIS. The woman in Tikrit, who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety, said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle, in the form of shelling, being carried out by both sides. A video posted on YouTube appears to support her assertion. In it, a man gives a tour of the city to show, he says, that there were no Iraqi security forces on the streets on Saturday -- the day Iraqi forces said they launched the offensive. On the video, the man can be heard repeatedly saying ""June 28, 2014,"" presumably to offer evidence of the date. The man says ""Thank God, Tikrit is safe and still in the hand of tribesmen and not troops of 'al-Haliki,'"" a derogatory reference to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that refers to his death. The video also shows a concrete blast wall erected around government buildings being taken down. Witnesses inside and outside of Tikrit said Iraqi forces were heavily shelling the city. At the same time, state-run Iraqi TV showed video footage of large plumes of black smoke billowing from the city. Another video, released by the Ministry of Defense, showed Iraqi troops and convoys loaded with heavy weapons driving through the desert. The video was titled ""cleansing the road between Samarra and Tikrit."" CNN cannot independently confirm the claims. Key question in Iraq right now: Who controls Tikrit? Clashes south of Kirkuk . Fighting erupted Sunday between Shiite militiamen and Sunni militants believed to be ISIS fighters in a village about 30 kilometers south of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, police officials told CNN. About 100 Shiite militants backed by Turkmen fighters attacked the village of al-Basheer, which was seized two weeks ago by ISIS fighters, the officials said. At least 12 Shiite militia fighters were killed and eight others were wounded in the fighting that lasted for several hours. Sporadic clashes continued to be reported into the evening. Al-Basheer has a mixed population of Shiite Turkmen and Sunnis. Fighting in Jalawla . Members of the Kurdish fighting force -- known as Peshmerga -- battled ISIS fighters near the town of Jalawla, about 85 kilometers (53 miles) north of Baghdad, on Sunday, police officials told CNN. The fighting was still ongoing, the officials said. Jalawla is under the control of the Peshmerga, but ISIS controls al-Saadiya about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) to the south. ISIS attacks Iraqi military base, again . ISIS fighters and allied militants launched an attack Sunday on a military base south of Baghdad, the second such attack in as many days, two officials with the Ministry of Interior told CNN. The attack came amid reports that a roadside bomb blast hit a vehicle carrying the Iraqi army commander for the area, killing two of his guards and wounding four others, the officials said. The commander survived, they said. The attack occurred at the military base Jurf al-Sakhar, on the outskirts of Hilla, where an infantry brigade is based. At least seven soldiers, mostly new recruits, were killed and 15 were wounded, the officials said. The fighting is ongoing, they said. Atta: Operations underway across Iraq . Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, said in televised briefing that multiple operations were under way across Iraq that resulted in the killing of 142 ISIS fighters. The Iraqi flag, he said, was hoisted above government offices in a number of cities and towns near Tikrit, where security forces are continuing operations to retake the city. The advance on the Tikrit is continuing, with troops worked to disarm ""hundreds"" of roadside bombs and booby traps that have been planted by fighters, he said. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims.","We're now calling ourselves the Islamic State, the group known as ISIS proclaims Sunday .
Iraqi government touts offensive to retake Tikrit; residents ask so where are the troops?
Shiite militants backed by Turkmen fighters fight ISIS south of oil-rich Kirkuk .

"(CNN)  -- Military personnel threw away, and ultimately burned, confiscated Bibles that were printed in the two most common Afghan languages amid concern they would be used to try to convert Afghans, a Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday. Afghan workers enter a walkway on March 3, 2009, at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. The unsolicited Bibles sent by a church in the United States were confiscated about a year ago at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan because military rules forbid troops of any religion from proselytizing while deployed there, Lt. Col. Mark Wright said. Such religious outreach can endanger American troops and civilians in the devoutly Muslim nation, Wright said. ""The decision was made that it was a 'force protection' measure to throw them away, because, if they did get out, it could be perceived by Afghans that the U.S. government or the U.S. military was trying to convert Muslims,"" Wright told CNN on Tuesday. Troops at posts in war zones are required to burn their trash, Wright said. The Bibles were written in the languages Pashto and Dari. This decision came to light recently, after the Al Jazeera English network aired video of a group prayer service and chapel sermon that a reporter said suggested U.S. troops were being encouraged to spread Christianity. The military denied that earlier this month, saying much in the video was taken out of context. ""This was irresponsible and dangerous journalism sensationalizing year-old footage of a religious service for U.S. soldiers on a U.S. base and inferring that troops are evangelizing to Afghans,"" Col. Gregory Julian said. The military says a soldier at Bagram received the Bibles and didn't realize he wasn't allowed to hand them out. In the Al Jazeera video, which shows the Bibles at the prayer service, an unnamed soldier says members of his church raised money for them. The chaplain later corrected the soldier and confiscated the Bibles, Wright said. Military officers considered sending the Bibles back to the church, he said, but they worried the church would turn around and send them to another organization in Afghanistan -- giving the impression that they had been distributed by the U.S. government. That could lead to violence against troops or U.S. civilians, Wright said. Al Jazeera English, a Qatar-based international news service, said its reporters tried to get a response from military officials for its story but were unable to do so. The U.S. military air base at Bagram is home to thousands of troops from all branches of the U.S. military. The vast majority of the troops do not leave the base and are in various support roles for U.S. troops across Afghanistan. CNN's Mike Mount at the Pentagon contributed to this report.","Unsolicited Bibles sent by U.S. church were confiscated about a year ago .
The Bibles were printed in two most common Afghan languages .
Military feared they could be used for proselytizing, which is forbidden to troops .

"Two U.S. embassy officials were wounded Tuesday in a shooting, apparently at a strip club, in Caracas, Venezuela. The U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details. The shooting occurred at the Antonella 2012 club, said Miroslava Gomez, a police spokeswoman. Police and investigators combed the club, in the basement of a mall, but did not speak to reporters outside on Tuesday. Mall security said the establishment is a strip club. Signs posted outside the door of the club described it as a ""weapon-free zone"" and said the entrance of couples, unaccompanied women or anyone under 30 is forbidden. Images of scantily clad women dancing around poles were plastered on a wall just inside the club's entrance. The club's manager said on Tuesday night that the shooting had occurred inside the establishment. The injured U.S. officials worked with the embassy's defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The two injured embassy officials were shot at a club in northeast Caracas, said an attending physician at a hospital in the Venezuelan capital. One was shot in the abdomen and the leg, and the other in the abdomen, Dr. Carlos Pacheco said. The State Department did not immediately release the names of the two injured officials. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell would not elaborate on what kind of establishment the officials were at, except to say it was ""some sort of social spot."" Asked Tuesday afternoon whether the shooting had occurred at a strip club, Ventrell told reporters, ""I have no information on the site whatsoever."" The department was not aware of any arrests, Ventrell said, but it is in contact with local authorities. Embassy security and health unit personnel were at the hospital and have reached out to the officials' families, Ventrell said.","Two U.S. officials say the embassy staffers shot in Venezuela are military officials .

"Is the tea party changing the Republican Party from the inside -- or selling out to the GOP? As Republicans prepare to officially roll out Mitt Romney as their party's presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention this week, major tea party groups and figures have descended on Tampa, Florida, to schmooze with party bigwigs and rally for Romney. But Romney's conservative credentials have long been viewed with suspicion by the movement. So it came as a surprise when, before at least one event, tea party organizers committed what some activists would consider heresy: seeking approval from establishment Republicans to rally. How much of a damper will Isaac be to convention? All of it has opened up a once unthinkable charge: the movement that's rabble-roused and rocked the GOP establishment since 2009 is now too cozy with it. ""The top national groups have already sold out,"" said Judd Saul, a prominent Iowa activist associated with the Cedar Valley Tea Party. ""They don't truly represent the grassroots."" ""Even before the caucuses, these guys were all pushing for Romney even when the primaries were going on,"" Saul added. ""It's a pretty widespread (sentiment). A lot of activists have noticed that."" But presidential historian Douglas Brinkley doesn't see this phenomenon as anything new. ""I think it happens all the time in politics,"" said Brinkley, a political analyst and professor at Rice University. ""The grassroots people are the people who are hypermotivated. They are people willing to go to rallies and hold bake sales and ... and they're always later kind of seen as auxiliary players once it gets to the main game when the elections come in the fall."" Get the latest political news at CNN's Election Center . ""I think selling out is too strong,"" added Brinkley. ""But you can say something to the effect of they've tricked the tea party movement into believing they were going to have a meaningful role in the 2012 election."" Others are taking their groans to social media. ""I think it is time not only to clean up Washington but we as well need to clean up or clean out the top dogs in the RNC that are turn coats,"" tea party supporter Margaret Robinson posted on the Facebook page for theteaparty.net. ""Not only TAKE BACK AMERICA but also need to TAKE BACK OUR REPUBLICAN PARTY. "" Saska Mare, who describes herself as a ""tea party Republican"" and Newt Gingrich supporter, wrote: ""Now is the time for All Good Patriots to come to the aid of their Country and QUIT MITT & RECRUIT NEWT!!"" The president and CEO of one of the largest tea party sponsors knows that not everyone is happy with the commingling between the two groups. ""There's always purists in any movement who think that anything less than perfect is a sellout,"" said Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks, based in Washington. ""But that's not how the American system works. "" The head of another group was more blunt. ""Anyone at this point who is trying to disrupt the convention or protest the nomination of Romney is blinded by irrational enthusiasm,"" said Dustin Stockton, chief strategist for theteaparty.net. There is one problem with such rationalities: They contradict the movement's belief that to change the system, it must be blown up. Since its birth three years ago, tea party activists have railed against compromise, leaned on lawmakers, launched RINO hunts against moderates deemed ""Republicans in Name Only"" and sought swift action on their ideas of reduced government spending, lower taxes and increased adherence to the constitution. For them, political patience was not a virtue. But since then, the tea party has gradually moved from anger and impatience toward acceptance and embrace. Several leaders say they understand the slow pace of change and stress the need to change the political system from the inside. Stockton's group sponsored a rally on Sunday in Tampa, a few miles away from the GOP convention site, featuring prominent tea partiers Herman Cain and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, both former presidential candidates. The 30-year-old tea party leader is adamant that the event's goal is to continue advocating for the tea party. ""We wanted to make sure that when (activists) tune in to the convention and the convention starts, they know that the tea party is still here -- still fighting for the values they believe in,"" Stockton said. ""Because that's really uniting more than Republicans, actually the American people in general. And we wanted to do it right before the conventions to try and set the tone for the entire convention."" Yet Stockton also revealed something that will surely cause some activists to fume. ""In order to get the venue and everything, we did get the blessings of the Romney camp and the RNC to hold the event months ago,"" Stockton said. ""And the Romney camp is sending (Utah) Congressman Jason Chaffetz as a surrogate for Romney. So they're on board with it. "" Many tea partiers support efforts to unify the movement with the GOP. Kibbe's group is also holding GOP-friendly events during the convention week. But he, too, beats back any notion that the tea party is toeing the Republican line. ""I would describe us as having a foot in the door and a seat at the table,"" the FreedomWorks chief said. ""Things are definitely trending in our direction."" Kibbe also noted another achievement: the GOP embrace of core tea party proposals. FreedomWorks had pushed the RNC's platform committee to adopt 12 items. ""We had a whole delegation of tea partiers at the platform committee,"" Kibbe said. ""And we feel like we made a lot of progress. We feel like we had success on 11-and-a-half of them."" Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, also claimed that the Republican Party is coming around to the tea party -- not the other way around. ""We have a huge Tea Party Express rally (in Tampa). In fact, we already have 15,000 reporters sign up to be there. We've called it the '2012 Republican National Convention,' "" Russo joked. Though Stockton is promoting unity during convention week, he has a special gripe: one prominent tea partier is not on the speaking list. ""I'm incredibly frustrated at the speaker lineup -- it doesn't include Sarah Palin,"" Stockton said. ""And Palin should have definitely been invited. He also lamented that two former presidential hopefuls in 2012, Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, will not have a prominent presence. Palin on her lack of a speaking role at convention . Meanwhile, after long viewing Romney as a suspect conservative, how are activists feeling about him now? ""I say there's a solid 50-50 split within the movement"" for and against Romney, Saul said. He added: ""I will hold my nose and pull the lever for Romney. Legitimately, I think that President Obama is the worst of the two evils. And Romney has a shot. And with some backing and some pushing, he could do some better things for the economy and the country. "" But the FreedomWorks chief stressed political patience. ""The practical reality of presidential politics: it takes years to build your brand, and your machine, your ability to fundraise,"" Kibbe said. ""And the tea party class was very green; they weren't ready."" In the face of some activist criticism, Russo said the movement should celebrate a milestone. ""I think (the tea party) has successfully yanked the Republican Party back to where it's sort of always been since Reagan yanked it back -- which is an opposition to an increasing size, cost and intrusiveness of the federal government,"" Russo said. Calling tea party opposition to Romney and the RNC ""silly,"" Russo said: ""I mean, sometimes people don't know when to declare victory.""","Some in tea party feel they are being absorbed by more mainstream Republicans .
Others believe the movement has been successful in shifting the GOP to the right .

"(CNN)It's been more than six months since the United States first sent warplanes to conduct airstrikes against the militant group ISIS, and four months since the formation of an international coalition to help fight the terror group. Since then, warplanes from Western and regional members of the coalition have flown hundreds of missions against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. While the United States has contributed the bulk of the military might, some 60 nations in all have participated in some way, according to the U.S. State Department. On Monday, Egypt sent fighters to Libya to bomb ISIS positions after the execution of 20 Egyptian Christians. ""Everybody in this coalition contributes what they can, and we're grateful for all of that,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in February. Here's a look at the contributions of some of the nations involved in the coalition: . Australia: Australia has participated in airstrikes and humanitarian missions in Iraq, and has sent special forces and other troops to help train Iraqi security forces in first aid, explosive hazards, urban combat and working dog programs, according to the defense ministry. As of February 12, Australian aircraft had carried out about 13% of all coalition airstrikes, Vice Adm. David Johnston told reporters. Bahrain: The oil-wealthy Gulf nation east of Saudi Arabia was part of the first handful of nations that participated in airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria. Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al Khalifa, speaking on CNN in September, called ISIS a ""deviated cult"" that must be fought. On Sunday, Bahrain announced it was sending aircraft to Jordan to participate in anti-ISIS efforts. Bahrain has had close relations with the United States for years, and the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is in based in Bahrain. Belgium: The country has conducted airstrikes against ISIS targets, according to U.S. Central Command. In January, Belgian authorities broke up a plot by ISIS veterans to launch a terror attack in the country. Canada: Its warplanes have flown 310 sorties against ISIS targets as of February 11, the Canadian armed forces reported. Canadian aircraft have also flown dozens of aerial refueling and reconnaissance missions in support of the anti-ISIS fight, and its cargo aircraft have been used to deliver military aid from Albania and the Czech Republic, the Canadian military said. The military has also sent a small detachment to help advise the Iraqi government and donated $5 million in humanitarian aid. Denmark: It has conducted airstrikes against ISIS targets, according to U.S. Central Command. Egypt: The country struck ISIS targets in Libya on Monday after the group reportedly executed 21 Egyptian Christians, and called on anti-ISIS coalition partners to do the same, saying the group poses a threat to international safety and security. Egypt had previously agreed to join the anti-ISIS coalition, but details about its role, if any, have been scarce. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said Egypt has a critical role to play in countering ISIS ideology, and Egypt's grand mufti condemned the terror group, saying that its actions are not in line with Islam, Al-Arabiya reported. France: French planes have taken part in airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, and the nation has flown reconnaissance flights over Iraq, contributed ammunition and made humanitarian drops over the nation. France's air force was also part of an operation in the Iraqi town of Amerli, along with Australia and Great Britain, that pushed back ISIS fighters. ISIS has called for attacks against Western citizens, singling out ""the spiteful and filthy French"" for punishment. A video emerged of militants who have pledged allegiance to ISIS beheading Herve Gourdel, a French citizen who was kidnapped in Algeria. Germany: Although it has declined to participate in airstrikes, Germany has provided Kurdish forces in Iraq with $87 million worth of weapons and other military equipment, along with a handful of troops to help with training, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported. Germany has also banned activities supporting ISIS,  including making it illegal to fly the trademark black flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Italy: It has sent weapons and ammunition valued at $2.5 million to Kurdish fighters in Iraq, along with 280 troops to help train them, according to Foreign Policy magazine. Iraqi Kurdistan: The Kurdish fighting force, the Peshmerga, is battling ISIS on the ground. Kurdish fighters helped expel ISIS forces from the Syrian city of Kobani in January, and are fighting ISIS forces near Mosul, Iraq, and Sinjar Mountain, the site of a dramatic siege this summer by militants of ethnic minority Yazidis. Read more: CNN coverage of some of the bloodiest battles between the Kurds and ISIS . Jordan: The country initially joined in airstrikes against ISIS but suspended its participation when one of its aircraft went down in Syria, leading to the capture of pilot Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh. The kingdom resumed its attacks in February after ISIS released a video depicting the pilot being burned to death in a cage. ""We are upping the ante. We're going after them wherever they are, with everything that we have. But it's not the beginning, and it's certainly not the end,"" Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN. Jordanian officials have also said one of the country's key contributions would be intelligence information. Netherlands: The Dutch government sent F-16 fighter jets to bomb ISIS targets and troops to help train Kurdish forces. As of early February, Dutch warplanes had conducted nearly 300 strikes on ISIS targets, the Defense Ministry said. Recently, the Dutch military said two F-16s dropped bombs on armed ISIS vehicles in northern Iraq that were shooting at Kurdish fighters. The ISIS vehicles were destroyed, the military said, and ISIS fighters were ""possibly killed."" Qatar: The small but rich Gulf nation that hosts one of the largest American bases in the Middle East has flown a number of humanitarian flights, State Department officials said. In late September, in his first interview as the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani vowed to support the coalition. Qatar has been accused of funding terrorism, which the Emir dismissed. ""We don't fund extremists,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""If you talk about certain movements, especially in Syria and Iraq, we all consider them terrorist movement."" Of the coalition, he said, ""We've been asked by our American friends if we can join, and we did."" Saudi Arabia: The kingdom has sent warplanes to strike ISIS targets in Syria and agreed to host efforts to train moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS. It also donated $500 million to U.N. humanitarian efforts in Iraq. Turkey: Though the NATO member initially offered only tacit support for the coalition, Turkey's government in 2014 authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations, including ISIS, as the militant group's fighters took towns just south of Turkey's border. Foreign troops have also been allowed to launch attacks against ISIS from Turkey.  U.S. officials said it had earlier taken steps to cut the flow of money to ISIS and denied entry to or deported several thousand foreign fighters heading to Syria to join the extremists. United Arab Emirates: Like its ally Jordan, the UAE initially took part in anti-ISIS airstrikes -- the country's first female fighter pilot led one of the missions. But the government suspended its participation in December after the downing of a Jordanian fighter whose pilot was later killed. It resumed airstrikes in February, flying F-16s from Jordan against militant targets. United Kingdom: The UK began airstrikes against ISIS in October, hitting targets four days after its Parliament approved its involvement. British planes helped Kurdish troops who were fighting ISIS in northwestern Iraq, dropping a bomb on an ISIS heavy weapon position and shooting a missile at an armed pickup, the UK's Defence Ministry said. Since then, warplanes have struck targets in Iraq dozens of times, and British planes had been involved in reconnaissance missions over that country. The British military is also helping train Kurdish Peshmerga and has sent advisers to help Iraqi commanders. Britain has also pledged more than $60 million in humanitarian aid. Read more: Britain vows to 'confront' ISIS . Other nations: Also participating in one way or another are the Arab League and the European Union as well as the nations of Albania, Andorra, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Panama, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and Ukraine. Some countries -- such as Kuwait -- are providing bases. Some, like Albania, the Czech Republic and Hungary, have sent weapons and ammunition. Others are providing humanitarian support, taking legal steps to curb recruitment or providing other, unspecified aid. Read more: How ISIS lures Westerners .

"""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" might not be so amazing, judging from some early reviews of the anticipated May 2 sequel. The Marc Webb-directed feature again stars Brit actor Andrew Garfield as the web-slinging Spider-Man and his girlfriend, Emma Stone, as on-screen love interest Gwen Stacy. A sequel to 2012's franchise reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" ""Amazing 2"" is supposed to pack in even more suspense and star power. Jamie Foxx plays the villain Electro, Paul Giamatti is Rhino, and Dane DeHaan is the Green Goblin. Yet on RottenTomatoes.com, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is on the wrong side of ""fresh."" ""I'm sorry people, the most I can go with is 'adequate,' "" says Rolling Stone's film critic, Peter Travers. ""I would call this movie 'The Adequate Spider-Man 2.' "" Uh oh. The problem, at least according to Travers, is that all the villains, who were supposed to add thrills, instead make the movie ""top-heavy."" The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday, too, thought the sequel added up to ""an unforgivably long assemblage that never coalesces into a compelling story."" And over at the Wall Street Journal, critic Joe Morgenstern was straightforward. ""How bad is this one, though? Amazingly so,"" he critiques. ""Villainy abounds, but the villains are strident contrivances. Spider-Man flies, but does so dutifully, without joy."" Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty tried to be more measured, noting that ""there's a lot riding on 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,' not just commercially (although there is that) but also as a signpost of what lies ahead."" ""Thankfully,"" the review continues, ""director Marc Webb's dizzy, slickly enjoyable sequel gets a ton right. It's a Marvel spectacle that manages to deftly balance razzle-dazzle, feel-it-in-your-gut slingshot moments of flight and believable human relationships. There's psychological weight to go with all of the gravity-defying, webslinging weightlessness."" The New York Times' Manohla Dargis was also kinder to Spidey, thinking the movie moved along ""nicely ... until a late, badly handled turn for the grim."" The saving grace for Dargis and a few others was the starring actors. Stone, Dargis writes, ""brightens"" the sequel, while Garfield, ""who's making a career out of playing delicate flowers, fits the role, suit and moist sniffling fine."" If Garfield checks out the Times' review, he might not be pleased with the verdict but will probably appreciate the attentiveness to his sensitive side. As the 30-year-old actor told CNN at ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2's"" New York premiere, personality traits he may have felt insecure about actually come in handy when he portrays Peter Parker. ""I think my gifts, weirdly, are the things that I thought I should've been ashamed of as a kid,"" Garfield said. ""Sensitivity, vulnerability, a very 'feeling' nature, you know? Qualities that boys aren't allowed to really have growing up."" After trying to downplay those characteristics as he came of age, it eventually dawned on Garfield that those are actually qualities that would help him in his career. ""They've led me to playing Spider-Man,"" he said.

"Barbara Ann Fenton made what was for some a shocking suggestion at one of the most traditionally conservative meetings leading up to the Republican National Convention. The 31-year-old delegate from Rhode Island formally suggested that her party's ideological manifesto recognize civil unions for same-sex couples as well as straight ones. ""As a Roman Catholic, there's nobody in this room who believes (more than I do) that the definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, but those are my religious beliefs,"" Fenton said as she made the motion Monday. ""This country was founded on the separation of church and state."" She added, ""For my own generation, a lot of times homosexuality is not the biggest deal in the world. And that's OK."" Many other controversial amendments were met with ""crickets,"" as one Republican staffer said. Meaning, on those topics, there wasn't even a move to vote on the matter. Can 'true Catholics' support same-sex marriage? Fenton's initiative, much to her own surprise, was met with a resounding shout of ""second"" from not one, but from a couple of people in the room. Themis Klarides, a state representative from Connecticut, was one of the delegates who affirmed Fenton's motion. ""I'm from New England, where support for gay couples is really old news,"" Klarides said. In 2005, her state became the first to create a law that allowed civil unions for same-sex couples without judicial interference. She voted in favor of the law on several occasions until it got through. ""This speaks to the heart of what Republicans believe in -- less government interference in our lives,"" Klarides said. ""We want our party to focus on growth and the economy and allowing us to thrive as a people, not on telling people what they should do in our private lives."" Klarides' fellow Republicans on the platform committee did not agree. She describes what it felt like to listen to the ensuing debate. ""I called my mom afterward and said this woman put this amendment out there, and I seconded it, and you would have thought I took off all my clothes and stood in the middle of the aisle,"" Klarides said. Fenton also called her mom after the meeting. Her mother had read about her daughter's amendment suggestion online. ""My mom said, 'You are creating mischief again. I'm so proud of you,' "" Fenton said. Others on the platform committee didn't share that sentiment. In his argument against the amendment, Indiana delegate Jim Bopp characterized civil unions as ""counterfeit marriage."" Bopp, an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pointed to the popularity of constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage and argued that the party benefits politically from its opposition to it. ""This suggests that strongly supporting traditional marriage is actually quite popular and would enhance the support of our candidates,"" Bopp said. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, made a strong argument against Fenton's motion, calling ""traditional marriage"" a cornerstone of a healthy society. ""This would move the party away immensely (from) the position this party has held,"" Perkins said. The motion failed resoundingly. Republican mayor's pro-same-sex marriage ad to air during convention . The platform committee went on to include several other anti-gay issues in its proposed draft.  An editorial in The New York Times called it ""more aggressive in its opposition to women's reproductive rights and to gay rights than any in memory."" The draft affirmed the support of state constitutional amendment efforts under way to restrict same-sex marriage. It criticized the Obama administration's ""open defiance"" of existing laws that should put a limit on gay people's rights and ""its handling of immigration cases, in federal personnel benefits, in allowing a same-sex marriage at a military base, and in refusing to defend DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act) in the courts."" And it reiterated the party's support for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage. ""It's funny -- sitting in that room, I felt like people thought what I was proposing meant I was campaigning for President Obama,"" Fenton said.  ""Back home where everyone is so much more liberal, people think I'm so right wing. Geography is everything."" Fenton said after the meeting she had only one disturbing run-in. ""One person did come up and tell me I should renounce my Catholicism -- that what I was spewing was pure evil,"" Fenton said. ""It was hard to keep a straight face."" But for the most part, the reaction she received from other delegates and Republican staffers was positive. She said she felt that behind the scenes, the party was much more supportive. ""People kept buying me drinks and kept coming up to me saying how they wanted to support my group for doing this. I don't have a group,"" Fenton said. ""Some people asked me if I was gay. I told them you could still be for gay rights and be a heterosexual. I don't think that's political suicide. If it was, I wouldn't be a part of this party."" She said, ""One guy even dropped a note in my lap. I thought I was going to get bashed with some nasty note, like you'd get in fifth grade. But what it said essentially was, 'I'm in the closet. Thank you so much for this.' ""People may now realize you can be gay and still be welcome in the GOP party."" While the Republican Party may take anti-gay positions on paper, behind the scenes many who advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes feel more accepted.  There is even an ad that will run during the convention that will feature San Diego's Republican mayor, Jerry Sanders, speaking out in favor of allowing same-sex marriage. Sanders urges his party to do the same. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups within the convention at Tampa say they are still optimistic about their future. ""The platform is a piece of paper,"" said Jimmy LaSalvia, executive director of GOProud Inc., which will attend the convention and hold ""Homocon 2012,"" a giant dance party with Republican notables after the speeches Tuesday. GOProud is the first gay Republican group to endorse Romney for president. ""The platform doesn't carry rights and responsibilities that the candidate is bound by,"" he said. ""Routinely after the platform is out, candidates quickly make statements that they don't agree with it."" LaSalvia is not discouraged -- in fact he said he's excited about how much they can do to support the ticket. ""This election is bigger than one issue. We are in a crisis in this country and gay people need jobs. Sure same-sex marriage is important, but we can't base our presidential vote on it,"" LaSalvia said. R. Clarke Cooper, who runs the Log Cabin Republicans, a national Republican gay and lesbian grassroots organization, said he's optimistic about the party's future as well despite the platform. ""It's disappointing, sure,"" Cooper said. ""But all the polling data shows that the party is growing and strengthening because of this younger generation of Republican who believes in the true definition of conservatism, which is individual liberty and not having the government involved in your personal life."" Cooper said leading up to the platform committee meeting, his group was invited for the first time to be directly involved in drafting the platform. Log Cabin hasn't endorsed Romney yet, but members will decide that issue soon. In the meantime, Cooper points to small aspects of the platform that he thinks will benefit the LGBT community. ""The original draft said one could not receive refugee status for nonpolitical reasons, which would mean that there are LGBT people running for their lives who aren't political dissidents but who couldn't come here,"" he said. ""They struck that from the language. That was a win."" He also said in the marriage section, the platform committee added a caveat that ""everyone deserves dignity and respect."" And he celebrates even the small victories. His group's educational material was on a table ""next to the stacks of Family Research Council material,"" Cooper said. ""I'm sure they were reeling, but if they asked leadership why it was there, they would hear it is because the RNC asked that all materials be put out there for delegates and press to pick up. ""It is a small thing,"" he said, ""but our presence was known here. We were invited to be much more engaged in the process than we ever have been before."" The Log Cabin Republicans have several events planned for the convention, including brunches with other gay conservatives, and candidate meet-and-greets. The Log Cabin PAC is also hosting a party to celebrate its congressional allies. ""I always wear my Log Cabin pin, and people are always welcoming to us when we are here,"" Cooper said. ""It's extremely evident that there is an even bigger thing happening with the party. All the polling data shows that there is a generational shift that makes our party more accepting, even if it did not manifest itself in the platform.""","Rhode Island delegate urged her party to recognize civil unions for same-sex couples .

"A Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan plans to take her case to the country's highest court after a high court last week rejected her appeal, her attorney says. Asia Bibi, a mother of five from Punjab province, was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during a 2009 argument with Muslim fellow field workers. The workers had refused to drink from a bucket of water she had touched because she was not Muslim. In November 2010, a Pakistani district court  found Bibi guilty of blasphemy. The offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code, and Bibi was sentenced to hang. On October 16, the Lahore High Court upheld the verdict. Human Rights Watch described the court's decision as a ""disgrace to Pakistan's judiciary."" ""Asia Bibi's case is an example of how Pakistan's vaguely worded blasphemy law has led to discrimination, persecution and murder since its imposition almost three decades ago,"" spokesman Phelim Kine told CNN. Bibi's attorney, Naeem Shakir, told CNN on Monday that he would file an appeal once he had received a detailed copy of the judgment. ""I have a very strong case, I am sure the Supreme Court will provide us with relief. There is no concrete evidence against Asia Bibi, and the courts are only relying on the statement on those two women,"" Shakir said. Blasphemy allegations . At a 2010 media conference, Bibi said the allegations against her were lies fabricated by a group of women who didn't like her. ""We had some differences, and this was their way of taking revenge,"" she said. An investigation by Shahbaz Bhatti, who was then Pakistan's minister for minority affairs, also found the charges stemmed from religious and personal enmity, and he recommended Bibi's release. Bhatti was the only Christian member of the Cabinet in Pakistan, where 95% of people are Muslim, and had opposed the blasphemy law. In 2011, he was assassinated in Islamabad. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility, saying the killing was ""a message to all of those who are against Pakistan's blasphemy laws."" Two months earlier, the governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, had been shot dead by his security guard because he, too, had supported Bibi and spoken out against the law. Court reaction . Speaking Monday after last week's verdict, Shakir admitted also feeling that his life was in danger. ""I do feel threatened. Even in the court, there were some two dozen people who were against Asia Bibi. I have not received any threats literally, but the presence of people there makes the environment very hostile toward us,"" he told CNN. Those calling for Bibi's execution welcomed the court's ruling, Shakir said: ""Some of them were so overjoyed and happy that they started crying in delight on hearing the decision of the court."" Qari Saleem, one of the clerics pursuing the case, told CNN via phone that Bibi deserved the punishment. ""I am very happy at the decision of the court, and justice has been done,"" Saleem said, adding that sweets had been distributed in court after the ruling ""out of joy and happiness."" Human rights groups' reaction . Initial news of Bibi's death sentence sparked outrage among international human rights groups, which condemned Pakistan's blasphemy law as a source of violence and persecution against religious minorities. Human Rights Watch's Kine said the law largely targeted religious minorities  and was ""all too often manipulated to seek personal disputes."" ""Pakistan's Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif should use the power granted to him under Pakistan's Constitution to end Asia Bibi's nightmare of years of imprisonment and the threat of a death sentence by pardoning her and repealing or reforming the country's blasphemy law to prevent such tragic mockeries of justice from occurring in (the) future,"" he said. Amnesty International last week described the decision as ""a grave injustice."" ""Asia Bibi should never have been convicted in the first place -- still less sentenced to death -- and the fact that she could pay with her life for an argument is sickening,"" an Amnesty spokesman said. In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI called for Bibi to be released, and in 2012, activists presented a petition to the U.N. Human Rights Council calling on Pakistan to free her. Bibi wrote about her ordeal in a 2012 book called ""Get Me Out of Here."" It includes a letter she wrote to her family urging them to have faith in God. ""My children,"" she wrote, ""don't lose courage or faith in Jesus Christ.""","Human Rights Watch describes latest ruling as a ""disgrace to Pakistan's judiciary""

"One man more interested than most in what President Barack Obama will have to say in his address to the nation Wednesday night is al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. In his hideout somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he will likely be hoping that the President sets out a plan to exterminate the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a group that has eclipsed al Qaeda and made al-Zawahiri seem virtually irrelevant. Al-Zawahiri and the core of al Qaeda are locked in battle with ISIS for the leadership of the global jihadist movement -- offering very different visions and strategies. ISIS was expelled from al Qaeda in February after rejecting al-Zawahiri's demand that it restrict its activities to Iraq. ISIS has captured the imagination of a new generation of jihadists -- from Arab and European states alike -- with its ruthless pursuit of a Caliphate, dramatic territorial gains and relentless propaganda machine. Its chilling brutality toward non-Muslims and Muslims who don't share its rigid interpretation of Islam echo the behavior of its predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, whose vicious attacks on Shia Muslims and moderate Sunnis drew the ire of the late al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden. In short, ISIS'  ""traipse through Iraq represents a serious organizational, strategic, and ideological blow to al Qaeda,"" analyst Barak Mendelsohn wrote in Foreign Affairs in June. So far, the leaders of al Qaeda affiliates have remained loyal (if not enthusiastically) to al-Zawahiri. After the death of its leader Ahmad Abdi Godane last week, Al-Shabaab quickly reiterated its allegiance to the al Qaeda leader, and Nasir al Wuhayshi, al Qaeda's No. 2, remains at the helm of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Prominent jihadi preachers like Abu Muhammad al Maqdisi and Abu Qatada have blasted ISIS for deviancy. Appealing to a new generation of jihadists . But the younger generation of jihadists appears to be more impressed by action than sermons. Al Qaeda foot-soldiers -- from Yemen, Libya, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere -- are flocking to ISIS' standard. To them, its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is confronting the apostates and building the Caliphate, while al-Zawahiri talks. It's impossible to know the scale of this exodus. But last week, a group calling itself The Supporters of the Islamic State in Yemen released a video pledging allegiance to al-Baghdadi, calling him the ""Caliph of the Muslims... the mujahid in the first row of attack against America."" Even AQAP -- the most effective of the group's affiliates -- has expressed solidarity with ISIS fighters, condemning what it calls the ""declaration of war"" by the United States on Muslims in Iraq, and calling on ""all Islamic groups to support their brothers by afflicting America."" By contrast, it's been a long time since al Qaeda central has carried out any attack of note. Four years ago, a strategy document set out ideas for attacking targets such as cruise ships, dams and bridges as well as aircraft.  But very little beyond ""lone wolf"" attacks by distant sympathizers of al Qaeda has happened since. Over the last three years, the most significant terror attacks against western interests have been against the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, where there may have been some involvement by members of al Qaeda affiliates; the gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013, carried out by a maverick group that pledged allegiance to al Qaeda but does not appear to have been acting on its instructions; and the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya -- the work of Al-Shabaab, apparently planned without reference to the al Qaeda leadership, even if it was exactly the sort of operation al-Zawahiri had urged. Attacks against U.S. military, diplomatic and government targets in Afghanistan have largely been the work of the Taliban and Haqqani Network, though al Qaeda fighters are enmeshed with these groups. Some al Qaeda affiliates have been forced on the defensive over the last couple of years. The French intervention in Mali pushed back groups linked to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which had taken over half the country. AQAP seized and then lost several towns in southern Yemen in early 2012, and resorted to suicide bombings and fighting Yemeni government forces from remote hideouts. Al-Shabaab lost its leader Godane in a U.S. missile strike last week and has lost large areas of Somalia it once controlled to ground offensives by Kenyan, Ethiopian and African Union forces. It has also suffered vicious infighting.  And in Pakistan, the army has gone on the offensive against the Pakistani Taliban -- an al Qaeda affiliate also riven by division -- in the North Waziristan tribal area. Al Qaeda strongholds still exist . There are still plenty of places where al Qaeda supporters are active and their operations growing: eastern Libya, Syria and the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, where they have found breathing space amid a collapse of state authority. But amid these fast-moving events, al-Zawahiri has seemed more the cheerleader than the leader, reacting to events rather than directing them. Last week, in an effort to reclaim relevancy, he announced the creation of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, led by Asim Umar, which will include at least one faction of the Pakistan Taliban. According to a translation by the SITE Institute, the new offshoot's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, said its basic goals included jihad against America, supporting the Taliban and establishing a Caliphate (implicitly rejecting the Caliphate claimed by al-Baghdadi). The announcement steps up the philosophical battle between al Qaeda and ISIS about how the dream of the Caliphate, to which Muslims the world over would owe allegiance, is achieved. Mahmoud spoke of ""a Caliphate where the emirs are proud in their closeness to the honest scholars... a Caliphate in whose shadow even the disbelieving people of dhimma (non-Muslim citizens of an Islamic state) have a life of safety and security."" The last condition was clearly aimed at ISIS and its merciless campaign against non-Muslims and non-Sunni Muslims in both Iraq and Syria. Not to be outdone, ISIS' propaganda machine recently posted photographs showing residents of the Iraqi city of Nineveh enjoying ""prosperity... under the shade of the Caliphate."" Al Qaeda's hope for the future . Al-Zawahiri may be looking to the withdrawal of most U.S. combat forces from Afghanistan as his best chance of reviving al Qaeda's fortunes. Last week's announcement reiterated al Qaeda's allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar as the leader of the Islamic Emirate. Several analysts have also noted a stream of statements from al Qaeda that hint at the coming of a ""counter-Caliphate."" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Thomas Jocelyn pointed out in Foreign Policy that despite the U.S. surge in Afghanistan, ""The remote provinces of Kunar and Nuristan are home to significant cadres of al Qaeda fighters, and al Qaeda continues to operate side by side with its allies in other parts of the country."" There is also the prospect -- or as some would say, likelihood -- that ISIS will over-reach much as did its predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq -- alienating the Sunni tribes, taking territory it cannot defend and mobilizing more enemies than it can resist. If the coalition now building against it can split ISIS' Syrian and Iraqi possessions and prize cities like Mosul from its grasp, the momentum crucial to its success and appeal will be lost. The Obama administration seems poised to borrow a page out of its strategy against al Qaeda to deal with ISIS. Last week, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes noted: ""We've been able to significantly degrade al Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, decimate its leadership ranks, reducing the threat that they pose."" Now a repetition in Iraq of the U.S. strategy that reduced al-Zawahiri to a spectator may be his best chance of overcoming the challenge posed by ISIS. The risk is that Washington and its allies will neglect imminent challenges in Afghanistan while refocusing on the militant challenge in Iraq. We've seen that movie too.","ISIS was expelled from al Qaeda in February .

"The Venezuelan government says it is investigating allegations that unauthorized Brazilian gold miners killed dozens of Yanomami Indians in an attack in the Venezuelan Amazon. The announcement Wednesday followed calls for action this week by a Yanomami organization and other indigenous groups. The Venezuelan government said that two public officials had been asked to carry out the inquiry into the alleged attack from a helicopter. Survival International, a London-based organization that advocates tribal peoples' rights worldwide, published online what it said was a declaration from a group of organizations representing indigenous peoples and communities in the Amazon about the alleged attack. The indigenous organization's declaration said that the number of people killed had yet to be fully established, but that of about 80 Yanomami people who lived in the community, only three survivors had been found. The alleged attack on the community of Irotatheri in the Venezuelan municipality of Alto Orinoco, near the Brazilian border, is believed to have taken place in July. Survival said in its own report that information is only just beginning to emerge because of the remote location of the community. The Yanomami, who live in Venezuela and Brazil, are considered the largest indigenous group in the Americas that remains largely untouched by advances in the outside world. Anthropologists have described the tribe in a variety of ways, ranging from fierce warmongers to mystics to introspective intellectuals. In recent years, the tribe has been under increasing pressure as miners illegally entered their land in the search of profits. Miners in Brazil have transmitted diseases such as malaria and flu to the Yanomami, who have little resistance to such diseases, observers say. The site where the attack is alleged to have happened is a five-hour helicopter ride, or 15 days on foot, from Puerto Ayacucho, the main Venezuelan city in the Amazon, the government said. The harm caused to indigenous peoples and the environment by Brazilian gold miners working in the border area is a long-standing issue. The Brazilian police carried out an operation last month targeting miners operating on the Brazilian side of the border. In its report on the situation, Survival cited Yanomami people who had spoken to Indians who said they had seen burned bodies and bones in the area where the attack is alleged to have happened. One of the people it quoted, Luis Shatiwe Yanomami, a leader of the Yanomami organization Horonami, said he had been told that those who survived had been out hunting when the community's communal house was set on fire. ""For three years we have been denouncing the situation,"" Survival quoted him as saying. ""There are lots of gold miners working illegally in the forest."" Both Survival and the indigenous organizations referred to an attack in 1993 on the Yanomami community of Haximu in Brazil in which they said 16 Indians were killed. Several miners were subsequently convicted for their role in the attack, Survival said. The organizations called for a criminal investigation into the alleged attack in July, and for measures to clamp down on the illegal activities in the area. ""This is another appalling tragedy for the Yanomami -- heaping crime upon crime,"" said Stephen Corry, director of Survival. ""All Amazonian governments must stop the rampant illegal mining, logging and settlement in indigenous territories.""

"With the deaths of three top Syrian officials, questions arose Wednesday as to whether the Damascus attack marks a turning point in the presidency of Bashar al-Assad. As the crisis unfolded, experts looked beyond the day's events to the roots of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's power for insights into the 16-month rebellion that grips the Middle Eastern nation. Al-Assad grew up in the shadow of his father, President Hafez al-Assad, a Soviet ally who ruled Syria for three decades and helped propel a minority Alawite population to key political, social and military posts. By most accounts, the elder al-Assad governed with an iron fist, forging a police state that quashed opposition by jailing dissidents and marginalizing other political groups. Hafez al-Assad was born into a poor family and graduated from á¸¤omá¹£ Military Academy as an air force pilot, before rising in Baath Party leadership and gaining power in the ""Corrective Revolution"" of 1970. His son, Bashar, enjoyed rare privileges and education as he studied abroad, while his older son, Bassel, was the man groomed to succeed him and assume power. Showdown or stalemate in Syria? But when Bassel died in a car crash in 1994, Bashar was thrust into the national spotlight and switched his university focus from medicine to military science. ""Dr. Bashar,"" who had headed the Syrian Computer Society, earned a degree in ophthalmology and enjoyed windsurfing, may have appeared an unlikely choice. But many observers in Europe and the United States seemed heartened by the incoming president, who presented himself as a fresh, youthful leader who might usher in a more progressive, moderate regime. Asma Akhras al-Assad, whom he married in 2000, is a former investment banker of Syrian descent who grew up in London. Get to know Syria's first family . When al-Assad's father died in June of that year, it took just hours for the Syrian parliament to amend the constitution and lower the presidential age of eligibility from 40 to 34, a move that allowed Bashar to succeed his father. Within weeks, he was also made a member of the regional command for the ruling Baath Party, a requirement of succession. ""I shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfills the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people,"" al-Assad said during his inauguration speech. But Western hopes for a more moderate Syria sank when the new leader promptly maintained his country's traditional ties with militant groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Attack threatens al-Assad's grip on power . Suspicions later surfaced among the country's regional neighbors over whether Syria was developing a covert nuclear program. Meanwhile, al-Assad repeatedly vowed to stamp out corruption while strengthening his own grasp on power. But in recent months -- and after more than a decade in power -- the Syrian leader has drawn criticism from around the globe as he's met popular protests and unrest with force. Damascus Spring came early in presidency . Thousands have been killed and many more displaced as the conflict has unfolded, with state security forces firing on demonstrators, many of whom have joined opposition groups, including armed rebel brigades. As pressure has mounted, the inner circle of the Syrian leader has became more of a family affair, said David Lesch, a professor of Middle East history and author of ""The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and Modern Syria."" ""That's part of what Bashar has been doing ever since he came to power,"" Lesch said. ""He has put members of his extended family ... in various parts of government and military security apparatus. If the day came -- and it did come -- where there was a threat to the regime, he could count on the loyalty of those closest to him."" The president's family belongs to the country's minority Alawite sect, who are largely driven by fears that they could be overwhelmed should al-Assad lose power, according to the president's uncle Rifaat. Recent reports, however, suggest discontent even within the minority community over his handling of the crisis. Jordan's king calls attack 'tremendous blow' to regime . Al-Assad's youngest brother, Maher, is thought to be Syria's second-most powerful man, overseeing two of the army's strongest units: the Republican Guard, which protects the regime in Damascus, and the elite Fourth Armored Division, which suppressed the early uprisings in southern Syria. But on Wednesday, a rebel attack killed Defense Minister Dawood Rajiha; Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat -- al-Assad's brother-in-law; and Hasan Turkmani, al-Assad's security adviser and assistant vice president, according to state television. Shawkat was once in charge of the army's intelligence services and was said to be one of the president's closest allies. Interior Minister Ibrahim al-Shaar was among those injured in the blast, state TV said, adding that he ""is in good health and that his condition is stable."" Wednesday's attack occurred during a meeting of ministers and security officials and was coordinated by rebel brigades in Damascus, opposition groups say. Al-Assad quickly named Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij as defense minister, according to the state-run news agency SANA. State media also reported that authorities have killed or captured a ""large number"" of terrorist infiltrators in Damascus and inflicted ""heavy losses"" on terrorists in Homs and Idlib. But video from a Damascus suburb showed Syrians rejoicing after news spread of the bombing. Meanwhile, reports of deaths across the country occur almost every day, with a London-based opposition group reporting last week that government forces carried out a massacre in Hama province, killing 220 people there. Horrific images out of Douma . Al-Assad's administration has consistently said that its forces are targeting armed terrorists funded by outside agitators. In early July, al-Assad told a German television station that a months-old peace plan aimed at ending the violence hasn't failed, but rather has yet to be implemented because foreign countries are supporting ""terrorists."" Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, named as a special envoy to the region, has spearheaded the peace effort. The president's remarks came on the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held that the days for the Syrian regime are numbered. Noting recent defections, Clinton said, ""The sand is running out of the hourglass.""","Al-Assad grew up in the shadow of his father, the late president Hafez al-Assad .

"A full moon hung just right in the night sky as the fierce Southern Army faced the encroaching Union troops in the spring of 1863. Though they were outmanned and outgunned, the momentum of the war seemed to be on the side of Generals Robert E. Lee and ""Stonewall"" Jackson in Northern Virginia. But the tide turned in the American Civil War not long after Jackson's own men inadvertently shot him that May night at the battle of Chancellorsville in Virginia. And for that, say two researchers, Americans can thank that full moon. It's an intriguing concept put forth by astronomer Don Olson and researcher Laurie E. Jasinski from Texas State University in a study appearing in this month's issue of Sky & Telescope magazine. They say that when the men of the 18th North Carolina Infantry Regiment fired upon Jackson, the whitish lunar light likely obscured the target. They didn't know it was him. In other words, they say, a moon phase is partly responsible for the molding of a nation ""dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,"" as President Abraham Lincoln put it in the Gettysburg Address. The two reconstructed the scene of the shooting using moon phases and maps, and published the results 150 years after the incident. Moonlight or no? History seems divided on whether or not the moon shone bright that night, the researchers say, but they back up their hypothesis with recorded anecdotal accounts. ""The Moon was shining very brightly, rendering all objects in our immediate vicinity distinct...,"" one confederate captain wrote years later. ""The Moon poured a flood of light upon the wide, open turnpike."" Jackson rode out with a party of officers on a scouting mission to see if the Confederate Army could find a way to cut off Union Army troops, according to the National Park Service, which cares for the nation's Civil War battlegrounds. They were shot as they returned. Olson and Jasinski say that a Confederate officer spotted them in the moonlight and ordered his men to open fire. Jackson was wounded in his left arm, which had to be amputated, according to the Virginia Military Institute, where Jackson taught. He died from complications on May 10, 1863. His arm was buried separate from the rest of his body. The South went on to win the Battle of Chancellorsville, but without Jackson, took a decisive blow in July 1863 at the bloody Battle of Gettysburg, often thought of as the turning point of the war. Back lighting . If Jackson's reconnaissance party was riding in bright moonlight, then his own men should have recognized them as they returned from the Union's side, but Olson and Jasinski say they did not -- for good reason. ""The 18th North Carolina was looking to the southeast, directly toward the rising moon,"" they said. It stood at ""25 degrees above the horizon"" at the time, just at the wrong angle. ""The bright moon would've silhouetted Jackson and his officers, completely obscuring their identities."" The Confederate infantrymen likely thought their own men returning were Union cavalrymen on the approach. ""Our astronomical analysis partially absolves the 18th North Carolina from blame for the wounding of Jackson,"" Olson says. It comes too late for the man who gave the order to fire. Maj. John D. Barry died at age 27 --  just two years after the end of the war. ""His family believed his death was a result of the depression and guilt he suffered as a consequence of having given the order to fire,"" the Virginia Military Institute site says. Stonewall Jackson may have appreciated the Texas State researchers' hypothesis, not only because it would have alleviated the conscience of the men who took his life. Before joining the Confederate Army, he was a science professor.","General Stonewall Jackson was shot at the battle of Chancellorsville .

"I was gob-smacked as we made our final approach into the ruins of the airport in Tacloban -- the first major population center in the Philippines to be struck by Super Typhoon Haiyan. Entire forests of palm trees on hilltops had been flattened by the sheer force of the storm. I'd never seen anything like it. It was a sight the other Filipino passengers on our plane had never seen either. As we got closer to the town we could make out villages, their roads completely flooded. Then Tacloban itself -- it looked completely devastated. It was as if a giant hand had come from the sky and just crushed it. The damage was primarily caused by a wall of ocean water -- a storm surge -- so powerful it had even lifted up ships and tossed them onto dry land -- onto what had been houses. These scenes brought home the fact that an entire city of more than 200,000 people had been destroyed. I was on an aerial tour of the storm-hit region with government officials. The scene was pretty overwhelming. You've got people wandering around in a city that's been leveled so they were looking for everything: water, shelter and hot food. Some were also concerned about lawlessness. One of the first people I talked to expressed concern about the looting of what hadn't been destroyed by the storm in the town. He was the owner of a local chain of donut shops. He told me people were actually stealing furniture from one of his ""Mr. Donut"" franchises. He said he and other property owners were now arming themselves for protection. He also wore a little green whistle around his neck -- they'd been using them as a kind of makeshift alarm system to protect their street. IN PICTURES: Trail of destruction . ""We have firearms, we will shoot within our property,"" he warned. ""We are afraid of being robbed."" Back in the air, we flew west to survey other areas affected by Haiyan. We saw damage caused by the record high winds -- everywhere you looked houses had lost their roofs -- but the damage was not on the scale of Tacloban because these areas had not been smashed by the wall of Pacific Ocean water during the storm surge. I spoke to the chairman of the Philippines Red Cross, Richard Gordon. He was concerned about other communities along the eastern coast of the island of Leyte -- where Tacloban is located -- as well as the neighboring island of Samar. He explained this was where U.S. General Douglas MacArthur chose to land his allied forces during World War II because of its easy access from the Pacific, which explains why it was also vulnerable to the tsunami-like effects of the storm surge. He told me he was afraid many other communities were also hit but couldn't give estimates of casualties at this point due to the difficulties accessing many parts of this region. He said aid workers were in shock because they'd seen so many dead bodies already. When you have whole communities destroyed, it's important to note that the first responders -- often from these same areas, they are also victims. That dramatically hampers the rescue effort because your policeman, fireman, ambulance man have also probably suffered enormous losses and are themselves in shock and trying to cope. There are so many unknowns at this stage -- such as how many people could have been sucked back out to sea during the storm surge. The Philippines Civil Aviation director I traveled with -- a former air force commander -- told me the local air force base commander in Tacloban was swept out to sea. Remarkably, he was found on another island hours later and is now recovering in hospital. But in many areas the scene is depressing because it's clear the more rudimentary the construction of the housing, the more vulnerable they are to the force of the elements. The poorest people are always the hardest hit. What little they have is gone and they don't know where to turn to. Tacloban is a small place in relative terms to the rest of the Philippines, but you're still talking about around 200,000 people made homeless in a matter of hours. There are already signs of recovery in some areas less affected by the typhoon, as people set about rebuilding their homes and businesses. At the same time -- even though they were away from the storm surge -- many of these people -- even those in their 60s and 70s -- say this was the worst storm they'd ever witnessed, and this is a country accustomed to at least 20 typhoons a year. While the government issued warnings to evacuate ahead of the typhoon, no-one anticipated a storm that could generate a wall of water powerful enough to break through the sea wall protecting the airport in Tacloban. It literally smashed open stretches of the seawall and washed away concrete buildings.  That's something new for this country -- a country that is no a stranger to typhoons and even earthquakes.","CNN's Ivan Watson toured the typhoon-devastated region by air .

"(CNN)While many people are recovering from a hangover, Englishman Steve Abraham will be cycling more than 200 miles on New Year's Day. And he then aims to do the same again every day for the remainder of 2015 as he attempts to break a record that has stood for 74 years and many consider to be unbeatable. It was set by another Englishman, Tommy Godwin, who covered 75,065 miles (120,805 kilometers) in a calendar year -- an average of 205 miles (330 km) per day. What is more, Godwin continued on to complete a staggering 100,000 miles (160,930 km) in 500 days, finishing his epic ride in London on May 13, 1940. Abraham, 40, who lives in Milton Keynes in central England, knows only too well just how tough the mark will be to beat -- it's the equivalent of cycling around the world three times. He will need to be in the saddle, riding a steel-framed Raleigh bike similar to that used by his hero Godwin, for up to 20 hours per day, surviving on minimal sleep, particularly in the more favorable summer months. But Abraham, a veteran of other long distance cycling challenges, has been building up to this attempt for a number of years. Extreme challenge . ""It's just something I fancied doing, but it is a bit extreme,"" he told CNN. The heyday for the record was in the 1930s when various cycling publications ran competitions to encourage attempts but according to the official website for Abraham's 2015 bid, the year record has never been formally sanctioned by a national cycling federation, or ratified by the Guinness Book of Records. Instead, it is being run under the rules of the Ultra-marathon Cycling Association (UMCA) -- which stages the annual Race Across America and other distance classics. It will be tracking Abraham's progress using technology and random checks. The UMCA has also assigned its 24-hour champion Chris Hopkinson to support his fellow Englishman and offer valuable advice. The 47-year-old Hopkinson, from Yorkshire, where the Tour de France started in 2014, told CNN that Abraham was made of the right stuff. ""If anyone can break the record, Steve can,"" he said. ""And I plan to help him get there,"" he added. As well as the inclement weather, with the majority of his rides planned around the flatter central belt of England, Abraham will need to be kept constantly fed and watered, burning up to 10,000 calories each day with his marathon efforts. Volunteers from the cycling community have pledged to support him on food stops and Abraham is grateful for their help and encouragement. Inspirational attempt . ""I think it just inspires people, I know that's a big headed thing to say, but I hope this will bring people together to have a good time."" Abraham has had to give up his job as a warehouse worker to free up the necessary time for such an all-consuming record attempt.  He is also single. ""This is not the sort of record that a married man would attempt,"" said Abraham's media spokesperson Idai Makaya. Ahead lie the dangers of spending many solo hours on the busy UK roads, where an accident could spell the end of his record hopes. ""A crash could be nothing, or it could be life or death,"" Abraham admitted. He is also doing all he can to steer clear of colds and flu, which again could derail his daunting schedule. With so many imponderables, so much sacrifice and potential hazards, it begs the question why attempt such a daunting record? Fighting talk . ""I would be crazy not to try it because if I don't I would never know [if I could achieve it],"" he said. ""I would rather fail than not try it. I can't see the sense in not trying it."" Abraham is hoping that the warmer summer months will see him, like Godwin before, clock up tallies of 300 miles per day (483 km) so he can reach his target of 80,000 miles (1287km). He has also hoping to compete in the Paris-Brest-Paris challenge in August, a famous and grueling 1200 km (745 miles) endurance event run under Audax rules, which means it is not a race, but riders must complete the distance within a set time to be classified. Abraham was the youngest Briton to finish the event within the 90-hour mark and has completed it five times. It is his performances in races such as Paris-Brest-Paris that first persuaded Abraham that he could try to beat Godwin's record, having previously believed it was out of reach. American challenge? There may well be another contender for the year mileage best. Arkansas-based cyclist Kurt Searvogel, a winner of prestigious long distance events in the United States, is ready to begin his attempt on January 10, long-time rival Hopkinson told CNN. Searvogel, who has the nickname of ""Tarzan"" is set to take a different approach to the ""long and slow"" method being deployed by Abraham, looking to complete his daily 200 mile efforts at a much higher average speed. ""I wish Kurt the best of luck,"" said Abraham, who believes that riding too fast would leave him at risk of burning out too quickly.","Steve Abraham attempting record for miles cycled in a year .

"Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis is resigning in the wake of a deadly supermarket roof collapse, his spokesman said Wednesday. Dombrovskis is ""taking political responsibility for the tragedy,"" spokesman Martin Punke told CNN. The roof collapse last Thursday in the Zolitude neighborhood of the capital, Riga, left more than 50 people dead -- the deadliest incident in Latvia since the country became independent in 1991. Dombrovskis, who has been prime minister since March 2009, is expected to address the nation in a news conference Wednesday afternoon. His decision to step down came after a meeting with the president, according to Latvia's national news agency, LETA. The news agency quotes Dombrovskis as thanking Latvians for their support during the economic and financial crisis and apologizing ""for all that we have failed to achieve."" A total of 54 people, including three firefighters, died in the collapse and several dozen were injured, LETA said. In the wake of the tragedy, President Andris Berzins told Latvian television that ""nature could not be blamed"" and that those involved needed to think about what they had done, so that action could be taken. ""This incident is basically the mass murder of a large number of defenseless civilians. We must act accordingly,'' Berzins said. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation. However, Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs told CNN last week that authorities think building materials stored on the roof caused it to collapse.","Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis announces his resignation over the roof collapse .

"(CNN)Where Katy Perry needed a big cat, the New England Patriots were carried to a stunning comeback by the resilience of Tom Brady. The 37-year-old, sacked and twice intercepted, refused to give in as the Patriots -- at one point down by 10 -- fought their way to a 28-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona. They were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history, as Seattle threw a second consecutive Super Bowl title into the hands of Malcolm Butler. Patriots rookie Butler made a game-saving interception when the Seahawks, with the ball on the one-yard line and seconds to play, mysteriously chose to pass after an improbable, juggling miracle-catch by Jermaine Kearse. That moment gave Brady and coach Bill Belichick a fourth Super Bowl victory, a feat matched by only two other quarterbacks: Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw. ""I just had a vision that I was going to make a big play and it came true,"" said Butler, 24. MVP Brady said: ""This has been a long journey. I've been at it for 15 years. This one came down to the end and this time, we made the plays. ""Our defense, what can you say about them? Malcolm, what a play. For a rookie to make a play like that and win us the Super Bowl is unbelievable."" Ahead of the game, Belichick had been booed inside Glendale's University of Phoenix Stadium -- the retractable roof, unusually, left open -- as Idina Menzel, the voice of Frozen's Elsa, sang the pre-game national anthem. Belichick and Brady have denied any wrongdoing regarding the lengthy and unresolved 'deflategate' saga, which concerns underinflated footballs in the AFC Championship game against Indianapolis. However, Brady was evasive on the subject in a pre-game interview aired on Sunday, and the jeers as Belichick appeared on the big screen made the feelings of many clear. With that controversy sidelined for the night, the 49th Super Bowl's momentum changed as rapidly as Perry's halftime hits and outfits. The Patriots had largely outplayed Seattle before the interval, Brady wearing down the Seahawks defense drive by drive. Brady, in his sixth Super Bowl, found Brandon LaFell for the opening touchdown. In the process, the Patriots left Seattle's famed 'Legion of Boom' verging on bust. Seattle cornerback Jeremy Lane had already departed the field with an ugly arm injury -- the price he paid for a successful interception -- and, with team-mates Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman all carrying injuries, substitute Tharold Simon became the latest Seahawk on the wrong end of a collision as he failed to stop LaFell. Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson, essentially anonymous to this point, struck back with the night's first phenomenal pass to 25-year-old rookie and former shoe salesman Chris Matthews. That allowed the NFL's quiet man -- Marshawn Lynch -- to drive over the line and score. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski mowed down KJ Wright to restore New England's advantage, but that only served to cue up one of the gutsier plays in Super Bowl history. With seconds remaining in the half, the Seahawks abandoned the safe option of a field goal. Instead, Wilson wasted just 1.79 seconds in delivering a bullet pass down the throat of a jubilant Matthews in the end zone. Cue Katy Perry, who brought an almost overwhelming array of lights, pyrotechnics and songs to a halftime show she dedicated to her younger self. Arriving on a giant, mechanical lion before graduating to a shimmy with sharks, Perry opened with Roar before cramming in split-second blasts of Dark Horse, I Kissed a Girl, Teenage Dream and -- lastly -- Firework, during which she ascended aboard a shooting star. Guest star Missy Elliott emerged to an energetic Get Ur Freak On, relegating the show's other name, Lenny Kravitz, to the background. When play restarted, Seattle were at the fore. Having barely seen the ball, that last-gasp score sent the Seahawks into the second half in possession and in control. The reigning champions immediately moved up by three, Matthews again wrapping up a 45-yard pass play to set up a Seahawks field goal. After Brady threw his second interception of the night, Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin expertly lost New England's Darrelle Revis by running him into an official -- leaving Baldwin all alone in the end zone, and the NFC champions ahead by 10. Brady had been nowhere near perfect but demonstrated his determination as he shrugged off a poor throw, missing Julian Edelman, to find Danny Amendola and get the Patriots rolling again. Watched by the likes of Paul McCartney, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the intensity of New England's offense ground down the depleted Legion as the final minutes ticked away. With two minutes remaining, Brady once again tried to find Edelman in the end zone. This time he was successful, and the Patriots had overcome a 10-point deficit. Seattle, however, should have had the last laugh. Having been granted a near-unbelievable slice of good fortune as the falling Kearse used both knees and a hand to somehow hold on to a pass, the Seahawks made what some observers labelled one of the worst calls in football history. On the brink of back-to-back Super Bowl victories, Seattle elected to throw the ball, shunning Lynch and gifting Butler the interception. Following that staggering climax, the game's dying moments descended into a mass brawl which led to the ejection of the Seahawks' Bruce Irvin. By that point, the fight simply delayed an inevitable New England victory. ""I can't even tell you, I can't even feel it,"" said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll of the decision to throw the ball. ""For it to come down to a play like that, I hate that we have to live with that."" New England's Edelman said: ""We made more plays, we executed when we had to, we have a mentally tough team that works their tails off. ""We are the epitome of what Boston is all about.""","Malcolm Butler makes vital interception after Brady and Patriots recover 10-point deficit .

"""Breaking Bad"" is in blue heaven. The AMC series -- about a chemistry teacher-turned-drug lord who rides a powerful methamphetamine called ""Blue"" to wealth and pain -- concluded its triumphant run last year as one of the most-lauded TV series of all time: the story of ""Mr. Chips turning into Scarface,"" as creator Vince Gilligan liked to describe it. On Monday, the show received one more set of honors: a slew of nods at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, including the Emmy for outstanding drama series. The show won six Emmys total, second only to ""Sherlock: His Last Vow's"" seven among all programs. Quick read: Full list of winners . There was some tough competition this year, notably from ""True Detective,"" the moody HBO detective series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Bryan Cranston won the lead actor Emmy for his performance as meth king Walter White, beating out the Oscar-winning McConaughey, who was the subject of laudatory and humorous remarks all night long. ""Even I thought about voting for Matthew,"" joked Cranston, and then turned serious. ""My own family nicknamed me Sneaky Pete,"" he said, noting he didn't expect he'd find his niche. And then he found acting. He dedicated the Emmy to ""all the Sneaky Petes of the world. ... Take a chance, take a risk. It's really worth it."" Cranston pulled off a rare double, winning a Tony and an Emmy in the same year. (He won the Tony in June for ""All the Way."") Bob Fosse won three honors -- an Emmy, Tony and Oscar -- in 1973. Aaron Paul got his third win for playing Jesse Pinkman, White's sometimes undependable right hand. ""I've learned so much, on screen and off,"" he said to Cranston, sitting in the audience. And Anna Gunn won for outstanding supporting actress for her performance as White's wife. She also won last year. Show writer Moira Walley-Beckett also won. ""Detective"" wasn't completely shut out. It won four technical awards at the Creative Arts Emmys on August 16 and another one on the telecast, the latter for director Cary Joji Fukunaga. Repeat performances . ""Breaking Bad's"" win wasn't its first; it also won best drama last year. And many of Emmy's other winners may have seemed equally familiar. ""Modern Family"" won outstanding comedy series for the fifth straight year, despite stiff competition. In addition, the show's Ty Burrell won outstanding supporting actor and Gail Mancuso won for directing. Backstage, Mancuso hoped her Emmy gave young girls a sign that there were jobs for them besides acting. ""Seeing a woman winning an Emmy is a wonderful image to project to young girls who think they can do something besides in front of the camera,"" she said. Julianna Margulies won outstanding lead actress in a drama for her performance in ""The Good Wife."" She won in 2010 and has been nominated each year since. Jim Parsons won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a comedy. It's his fourth win in the category, all for his performance in ""The Big Bang Theory."" Julia Louis-Dreyfus (""Veep"") earned an Emmy for lead actress in a comedy, her second straight. In congratulations, Cranston -- a former ""Seinfeld' co-star -- gave her a passionate kiss. (It was OK -- they checked with their spouses beforehand.) ""He went for it. He goes for it in everything he does,"" she said later. And ""The Amazing Race"" won for reality competition, a return to the winner's circle after losing to ""The Voice"" last year. It's now won 10 of the 12 Emmys given out in the category. Sneaky 'Sherlock' However, the Emmys weren't entirely surprise-free. Despite 16 nominations, the HBO TV movie ""The Normal Heart"" -- based on Larry Kramer's 1985 play about the beginnings of the AIDS crisis -- won just two Emmys. It did win in the most important of its categories, that of outstanding TV movie. ""This is for all of the hundreds of thousands of artists who have passed from HIV/AIDS since 1981,"" said director Ryan Murphy. But it was ""Sherlock: His Last Vow"" that took home many of the genre's awards. Lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch, supporting actor Martin Freeman and writer Stephen Moffat all took home trophies, with Freeman beating out four performers from  ""The Normal Heart."" ""Fargo"" won two Emmys, including an award for outstanding miniseries, and ""American Horror Story: Coven"" picked up two awards, for actresses Kathy Bates and Jessica Lange. Asked backstage if she had any other goals, Lange offered an unlikely objective: ""I want to win the Belmont Stakes,"" she said. Williams: 'He made us laugh' The ""In Memoriam"" tribute was set to the music of ""Smile,"" sung by Sara Bareilles. It concluded with Robin Williams. ""He made us laugh -- hard -- every time you saw him,"" said Billy Crystal, telling stories about Williams' quick wit in a broadcast booth and at a family gathering. ""It's very hard to talk about him in the past because he was so present in all of our lives,"" he said. Backstage, Kathy Bates remembered Williams' good nature. One year at the Golden Globes, in a time before cell phones were commonplace, she was waiting at a pay phone to call her mother -- and didn't have change. It was Williams who gave her a quarter. Years later, he was presenting the Oscar for supporting actress, for which Bates was nominated. She didn't win that time. ""I won this time, and this is for you,"" she said, getting choked up. Louis C.K. also reflected on Williams. ""I grew up watching him. He was somebody who worked so hard at it and was explosive with energy,"" he said. ""He was a beacon when I was a kid."" The two became friendly later, with Williams telling Louis C.K. he was a fan of ""Louie."" ""He was a big influence on me as a person and comedically,"" he said. Brisk hosting . Host Seth Meyers kept things lively with some winning skits and a brisk monologue. He opened the show with pokes at the very timing of the Emmys itself. Noting that the awards show was on a Monday night in August -- so it didn't conflict with Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards and an NFL game on Emmy network NBC -- the host noted that could only mean one thing: It's ""about to get canceled."" ""Breaking Bad"" never had to undergo that indignity. The show simply got better throughout its five-season run, gaining audience, gripping fans, leaving on its own terms. ""This is a wonderful icing on the cake,"" said creator Gilligan. ""The cake itself, the substance, was getting to work with these wonderful people for six years. ""It's going to be a tough one to top, that's for sure.""","""Breaking Bad"" wins best drama; stars also win .

"(CNN)It used to be that the way to literary fame and fortune was to write the Great American Novel. Nowadays, it's more useful to mine your past -- or someone else's. So we are awash in memoirs and biographies. In 2007, more memoirs were accepted by publishers than debut novels, reported an industry newsletter. The trend has shown no signs of abating. How can you separate the promising from the pulp? Amazon has come to the rescue. The mammoth online store, which remains a dominant bookseller, just issued a list of ""100 Biographies & Memoirs to Read in a Lifetime."" Readers can chime in with their own choices via Goodreads, an Amazon affiliate. The list is the latest of Amazon's list compilations. (Last year the company did a general fiction/nonfiction list of ""100 Books to Read in a Lifetime."") ""A lot of people were saying, 'I love to read biographies' and it was going to be Presidents' Day, and we thought of all the presidential biographies, so we said let's do biographies,"" said Sara Nelson, Amazon's Editorial Director. The Amazon staff compiled a list of about 200 books and winnowed it down to the final 100. Among their choices: Bill Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods,"" Mary Karr's ""The Liar's Club,"" Elie Wiesel's ""Night,"" ""The Andy Warhol Diaries"" and Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ""The Gulag Archipelago."" Naturally, the staff here at CNN had some worthy books that didn't make Amazon's list. Here are 10 more suggestions, in alphabetical order by author: . ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" Jean-Dominique Bauby . The writing of Bauby's slim 1997 memoir is a story in itself. The author, a French magazine editor, suffered a stroke that left him with ""locked-in syndrome"" -- physically paralyzed but mentally present. He wrote the book by blinking his left eyelid. In it, he recalls the events of his life and demonstrates that even though the body is immobilized the mind can still wander freely. Bauby's book was made into a 2007 movie. ""All Over But the Shoutin',"" Rick Bragg . Bragg, a former New York Times reporter, describes his life growing up poor in northern Alabama and his struggle to escape the cycle of poverty that claimed many of his neighbors. ""Bragg is showing us a place we have not seen before, not quite like this,"" wrote Anthony Walton in The New York Times Book Review in a 1997 review. ""The Long Season,"" Jim Brosnan . Amazon has Jim Bouton's hilarious and revelatory ""Ball Four"" on its list, but before Bouton's diary there was Brosnan's 1960 chronicle, detailing his pitching life in a season with the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. It was ""the first honest portrayal of the life of a baseball player,"" wrote Mark Armour for the Society of American Baseball Research, and remains a crackling good read. ""The Night of the Gun,"" David Carr . Before Carr, who died last week at age 58, was a well-respected media reporter for The New York Times he was a drug addict -- the kind of irresponsible dope hound who would leave his children in a car on a freezing Minnesota night while he went to score. ""The Night of the Gun,"" from 2008, tells how he hit rock bottom and worked his way back up -- while willing to investigate his life with the same kind of unsentimental focus he brought to his columns. ""The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace,"" Jeff Hobbs . Hobbs' book, released late last year, describes the life of Robert Peace, an African-American from Newark, New Jersey, who became a standout student at Yale, came back to his hometown to teach and then was shot to death at age 30. Hobbs, his college roommate, is determined to show that ""Rob Peace was not a cliche,"" as he told NPR. The book has received outstanding reviews. ""How to Be a Woman,"" Caitlin Moran . Moran, a columnist for the Times of London, published this half-memoir, half-manifesto in 2011. She's a staunch feminist and bluntly casts a wide net: ""Do you have a vagina? Do you want to be in charge of it?"" she asks. She takes on the idea of womanhood versus the reality and makes you laugh in the process. ""The joy of this book is just that: the joy,"" wrote Miranda Sawyer in The Guardian. ""John Lennon: The Life,"" Philip Norman . There are plenty of terrific Beatles biographies -- just a couple years ago, Mark Lewisohn published ""Tune In,"" the first volume of his projected three-volume work on the Fabs -- but few good ones about the band members as individuals. Norman, who wrote the Beatles bio ""Shout!"" in 1981, published his 800-page biography of Lennon in 2008 and managed to capture a well-rounded portrait of a complex man. ""Twelve Years a Slave,"" Solomon Northup . The basis for the Oscar-winning best picture still packs a wallop more than 150 years after it was first published. Northup, a free man living in upstate New York, was kidnapped on a trip to Washington, sold into slavery and spent the next 12 years at a Louisiana plantation. ""If I have failed in anything,"" Northup wrote, ""it has been in presenting to the reader too prominently the bright side of the picture."" Essential. ""You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,"" Julia Phillips . Phillips was a rarity in early-'70s Hollywood: a woman producer. She and her then-husband Michael had a hand in three major films -- the Oscar-winning ""The Sting,"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" -- but, thanks to a drug addiction, she had a precipitous fall. ""You'll Never Eat Lunch,"" which came out in 1991, can be hard to read but offers a distinctive take from an even more distinctive personality. ""Samuel Pepys: The Unequaled Self,"" Claire Tomalin .

"Britain's Ben Ainslie became the most decorated Olympic sailor in history with his fourth successive victory  -- and then declared it was his last involvement at the Games. The 35-year-old came ninth in Sunday's medal race but, crucially, finished ahead of his main rival for the gold medal -- Denmark's Jonas Hogh-Christensen. Pieter-Jan Postma, from the Netherlands, had an opportunity to leapfrog both Ainslie and Hogh-Christensen but a poor last stretch saw him finish fourth overall. France's Jonathan Lobert took the bronze. It marked a fairytale ending for Ainslie, who had trailed Hogh-Christensen through the majority of the competition, only to take gold at the last in front of a vociferous crowd at Weymouth, on England's south coast. Follow the action on day nine with our London 2012 live blog . But he said he was unlikely to defend his crown for a fifth time at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ""It's times like this you are supposed to come out with something clever but I can't think of anything,"" Ainslie told the host broadcaster, after eclipsing Denmark's Paul Elvstrom as the sport's best. ""I am speechless. I am just so glad for everyone who has supported me over the last four years. It has been an amazing Olympics. ""After six races I was in a bit of trouble. Thankfully I turned things around and got it right when it counted. This was one of the hardest courses I have raced on and I don't want to do anything like that again. ""You can never say never but I don't think I can sail one of these again, it's killing my body so I don't think you will see me in Rio. But it's the best way to bow out at a home Olympics."" Ainslie claimed a silver medal in the Laser class at the Atlanta Games in 1996 and then gold four years later in Sydney. He switched to the heavyweight Finn division at Athens in 2004 and took another gold, which he successfully defended in Beijing. Ainslie endured a disappointing start to the regatta and didn't beat Hogh-Christensen until the seventh race but maneuvered himself into contention in the last of the fleet races. The Briton kept himself ahead of his Danish rival but slipped down the field and was dangerously close to losing his gold when Postma challenged New Zealand's Dan Slater for second place. But Postma clipped his rival's boat and had to take a penalty turn, ending his hopes and handing Ainslie another Olympic triumph. It came as a relief to Ainslie, who had been expected to deliver in front of his home crowd. ""It's been incredibly hard -- there's a huge amount of pressure to perform at a home Games,"" he added. ""It's been the hardest couple of weeks of my life but you just have to get on with the job. ""I learned to sail for fun so it's been a long road but I have had a lot of support over the years and I am just so glad to have done it."" Earlier in the day, Team GB's Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson were piped to the Star gold medal by Sweden's Max Salminen and Fredrik Loof. Percy and Simpson, who won the two-hand Star class in Beijing four years ago, went into the final race leading but could only finish eighth, leaving the door open for the Swedes. The Brazilian pair of Robert Scheidt and Bruno Prada took the bronze medal.","Britain's Ben Ainslie takes his fourth successive sailing gold in the Finn class .

"Of all the things to say about Robin Williams, the truest may be this: He made people smile. They might be those who packed comedy cubs for his frenetic, improvisational, hilarious routines. Or those who fell in love with him as the lovable alien Mork and stayed in love through fun films such as ""Aladdin"" and serious ones such as ""Good Will Hunting."" Or those who had the pleasure of knowing him as a man -- a kind, decent, generous soul who made others' lives better. Throughout his 63 years, Williams rarely failed to impress others with his charisma, his talent, his heart. All the while, he fought his personal demons -- including substance abuse that led to at least two rehab stints, the most recent coming last summer. Ultimately, those struggles led to his end. According to police, Williams apparently hanged himself with a belt this week in a bedroom of his Marin County, California, home. Someone who'd given so much to so many over the years, in ways big and small, decided to take his own life after struggling with depression. Officials: Williams apparently hanged himself . Still, while Williams never denied his struggles, he was never defined by them either. Just ask those who rubbed elbows with him, whether they were big-time comedians or fathers he could give joy to their ailing children. Invariably, they had a story that involved him laughing, telling stories and making people feel good. ""His impact on the world was so positive,"" tweeted comedian and occasional co-star Ben Stiller. ""He did so much good for people. He made and so many people laugh so hard for a very long time."" 'A comedy force of nature' The son of a model and an auto company executive, Robin Williams was born in Chicago on July 21, 1951, yet spent most of his childhood in and around Detroit. Chubby and sometimes bullied, Williams laid low growing up -- the latter being expected in his family, Williams told People in a 2009 interview, even if it's opposite of the bigger-than-life persona he'd cultivate through his career. ""The ideal child was seen, not heard,"" he said then. In an interview with the Detroit Free-Press, Williams characterized himself as ""the opposite of a class clown"" while at Detroit Country Day, a private boys school. He worked hard, played soccer and wrestled and ""just went out of my way to fit in."" ""I loved school, maybe too much really. I was summa cum laude in high school,"" he told the Free-Press. ""I was driven that way."" As a teen, Williams moved to Northern California's Marin County -- attending high school and college there before enrolling at New York's prestigious Juilliard School for performing arts. He'd later return to the Bay Area, handing out Halloween candy and boosting local causes. The once shy boy also found his place and his voice on stage at comedy clubs. Even after making a name for himself in Hollywood, he kept coming back to do stand-up at establishments such as Cobb's, Catch a Rising Star, the Improv and The Comedy Store because, as he told People: ""It was my only release."" ""To see Robin perform was an experience,"" fellow comedian Gilbert Gottfried recalled in a piece on CNN.com. ""He was more than a comedian. He was a comedy force of nature."" Mork from Ork . The comedy clubs may have been where Robin Williams felt at home. But he made it into millions of Americans' homes in his role as Mork from Ork. Just as there's never been anyone else like Williams, there's been no other character like Mork -- an alien who took an egg-shaped spaceship to Earth and, thanks to Williams, ended up stealing many Earthlings' hearts. The character debuted on the sit-com ""Happy Days,"" whose star Henry Winkler ""realized I was in the presence of greatness"" during Williams' first rehearsal. From the start, his delivery, myriad faces and improvisational talents made him hard to resist. ""I just realized my only job is to keep a straight face,"" said Winkler, who played ""The Fonz."" ""And it was impossible. Because no matter what you said to him, no matter what line you gave to him, he took it in, processed it, and then it flew out of his mouth, never the same way twice. And it was incredibly funny every time."" The ""Happy Days"" appearance was such a hit that CBS created ""Mork and Mindy,"" pairing him with his human roommate played by Pam Dawber and fellow alien (and real-life idol) Jonathan Winters. The show's run ended four years later in 1982, during which time Williams also starred as the titular character in the movie, ""Popeye."" Williams didn't rest on his laurels. In fact, the beloved comedian turned his career on its heels by turning to dramas, starting with ""The World According to Garp."" Instead of tickling people's funny bones, he tugged at their heartstrings. And as he had done at comedy clubs, Williams excelled in roles in films such as ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and ""Dead Poets Society."" Seesawing between comedy and drama . Williams went back and forth over the decades to come, from family-friendly fare such as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and as the voice of the genie in ""Aladdin"" to more adult-themed movies such as ""The Birdcage"" and ""The Fisher King."" What turned out to be biggest role yet was actually a small film led by two then unknown actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, in ""Good Will Hunting."" Playing sage psychologist and community college Professor Sean Maguire, Williams won the Oscar -- after losing out three other times-- for supporting actor. As he stepped on stage to accept the award, he said, ""This might be the one time I'm speechless"" -- before launching an emotional, humble, joke-laden speech thanking all those involved in the film and his life. ""And most of all, I want to thank my father, up there. the man who, when I said I wanted to be an actor, he said, 'Wonderful, just have a back-up profession like welding.' "" As the years rolled by, Williams didn't slow down. He seesawed in his roles -- from dark pieces such as ""One Hour Photo"" and ""Death to Smoochy,"" to the lighter likes of ""Happy Feet"" and the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. He even went back to TV on the short-lived CBS comedy, ""The Crazy Ones."" The admitted workaholic at one point turned out eight movies over a two-year period. He told The Guardian in 2010 that he'd ""take it slow ... and enjoy the ride"" after his 2009 heart surgery, though that doesn't seem the case: Four more films -- ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"" ""Merry Friggin' Christmas,"" ""Boulevard"" and ""Absolutely Anything"" -- are expected to be released posthumously. ""You have this idea that you'd better keep working, otherwise people will forget,"" he said. A funny man and humanitarian . Yet, as hard as he worked, Williams was never just about his work. For all the admiration of his talents, other actors remembering Williams tended to talk first about his huge heart, as the type of person who made you feel special, made you feel loved and made you laugh. And then there is his considerable charity work: Look to the Stars, a website that compiles the charitable work of celebrities, notes that Williams offered his time, money and celebrity to over 50 causes. Williams' charity legacy . That humanitarian work ranges from hosting Comic Relief, biking in a fundraiser for good friend Lance Armstrong's cancer support charity Livestrong, to appearing pro bono in TV spots and then some for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The United Service Organization, or USO, hailed Williams for his 12 years performing for nearly 90 military personnel in 13 countries. He connected many more times one-on-one. That might mean boosting the confidence of an up-and-coming comedian, bringing the first smile to former Juillard roommate and close friend Christopher Reeve after he was paralyzed or reaching out personally to young people suffering from serious illnesses. ""I couldn't believe it,"" CNN iReporter Mark Cole said about Williams' chartering a plane, at his own expense, to visit and trade jokes with his ailing daughter in 2004. ""I felt very privileged that he came to spend the day with her like that. It was the most moving thing I've ever seen in my life."" Patients' families: A 'comedic Mother Teresa' Survived by wife and three children . Yet as his death showed, Williams wasn't always upbeat. He made no secret about his battles with substance abuse, even as he joked that ""cocaine is God's way of telling you that you too much money."" His fight didn't get easier as he got older; if anything, it got harder. ""When you relapse, you fall deeper,"" Williams told People in 2009. ""I found myself drinking to blackouts. It's like your brain goes into witness protection."" Beyond that, his media representative Mara Buxbaum noted that Williams ""has been battling severe depression of late."" His personal life wasn't always smooth either. He had a son, Zak, with his first wife, Valerie Velardi. Williams then spent 19 years with wife Marsha -- a union that led to two more children, Zelda and Cody, before ending in divorce in 2008. In October 2011, he wed graphic designer Susan Schneider in Napa Valley, California. On her Twitter feed, his daughter Zelda remembered her dad with a quote from Antoine De Saint-Exupery's ""The Little Prince."" ""In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night ... You -- only you -- will have stars that can laugh."" Zelda added, ""I love you. I miss you. I'll try to keep looking up."" Complete coverage on Robin Williams .

"Al Qaeda's affiliate inside Syria is now the best-equipped arm of the terror group in existence today, according to informal assessments by U.S. and Middle East intelligence agencies, a private sector analyst directly familiar with the information told CNN. Concern about the Syrian al Qaeda-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the al-Nusra Front, is at an all-time high, according to the analyst, with as many as 10,000 fighters and supporters inside Syria. The United States has designated al-Nusra Front as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda in Iraq. That assessment is shared by some Middle Eastern intelligence agencies that have long believed the United States is underestimating the Sunni-backed al Qaeda movement in the country, according to a Middle East source. It is also believed that Iran is running training camps inside Syria for Hezbollah and that other Iranian militia fighters are coming into the country to fight for the regime. The analyst has been part of recent discussions with the U.S. intelligence community, which is urgently working to understand what is going on inside the war-ravaged country and is consulting outside experts. The analyst, who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the information, stressed that all assessments about Syria are approximate at best because of the lack of U.S. personnel on the ground. With the growing strength and support for al-Nusra, U.S. concerns are growing about its influence to further destabilize Syria and potentially pose a greater regional threat, administration officials have told CNN. Next moves for the U.S. on Syria . ""They are making desperate attempts to get chemical weapons,"" the analyst told CNN, noting that in the past few weeks, security services in Iraq and Turkey arrested operatives who were ""trying to get their hands on sarin."" A senior U.S. intelligence official told CNN recently that gathering intelligence on Syria, including its potential future use of chemical weapons, is now one of the top priorities of the U.S. intelligence community. The Obama administration announced last week that it will start arming rebels because Syria crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons -- including sarin gas -- against the opposition. The development is likely to be at the center of the Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland on Monday, setting a riveting backdrop to the meeting after Syria's longtime ally Russia said the move supports ""those who kill their enemies and eat their organs."" Opinion: Peace in Syria? Talk to Iran . In one corner, the United States, the United Kingdom and France say rebels need more help in ousting a 42-year dynasty and ending a regime that crushes dissent with lethal force. In the other corner, Russia says its supply of arms to the Syrian regime isn't nearly as bad as sending weapons to the rebels. ""I believe you will not deny that one should hardly back those who kill their enemies and eat their organs. ... Do you want to support these people? Do you want to supply arms to these people?"" Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Sunday. He was referring to a widely circulated video that allegedly showed a rebel fighter eating the heart of a dead soldier. The video, posted by a group loyal to the Syrian government, raised questions about the rebels' credibility, even though the Syrian opposition widely condemned the act. On Monday, Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama will meet one-on-one to discuss the war that has now killed more than 92,000 people, including thousands of children. On the ground in Damascus: Locals defiant toward more U.S. help of rebels . Chaos on the ground . While world leaders struggle to form a unified front, the seesaw battles rage on inside Syria -- and at a staggering price. About 5,000 Syrians are killed every month, the United Nations said. The opposition once controlled the Damascus suburb of Yarmouk, which served as a Palestinian refugee camp. But Palestinian fighters supporting the regime say they're taking the area back. ""We will keep fighting until we get rid of Jabhat al-Nusra and al Qaeda and all other insurgents in Syria,"" fighter Abu Ihad told CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Yarmouk. The pro-government fighters said they're angry about the U.S. decision to arm the opposition, especially since members of al-Nusra Front have joined the rebels. In recent weeks, the rebels have suffered a series of devastating setbacks. Their loss of the stronghold Qusayr coincided with the arrival of Hezbollah fighters supporting Syrian troops. Syrian rebels have pleaded for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, saying they are outgunned by President Bashar al-Assad's military. Explosions rock Damascus military airport . The U.S. has a new game plan . Obama has not detailed the increased military support, but Washington officials told CNN that the plan includes providing small arms, ammunition and possibly anti-tank weapons to the rebels. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told CNN's Candy Crowley there is a strong consensus on arming Syrian rebels. ""As the Foreign Relations Committee voted nearly a month ago on a strong bipartisan vote of 15-3 ... we believe the rebels need to be armed, the moderate elements of those rebels,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey. ""Public intelligence sources have said that we've come to know who, in fact, we could ultimately arm. And the reality is we need to tip the scales, not simply to nudge them. And the president's moving in the right direction."" Britain has not decided whether to provide weapons to rebels but has provided technical assistance and training alongside the United States, France and its other allies. ""I'm in no doubt that responsibility lies with President Assad. It is the onslaught that he has inflicted on his own people which is the primary cause of the suffering, the humanitarian catastrophe and the deaths we have seen,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday. Russia's president said he believed both sides were responsible for the bloodshed. Putin said he hoped the G8 summit this week would help broker a peace deal to end the carnage. But it's unclear how many more lives may be lost in the meantime.

"The unprecedented natural disaster that came in the form of Typhoon Haiyan is a potential medical disaster for the Philippines, according to emergency crews on the ground. The Red Cross says it has ordered 10,000 body bags in preparation for the number of bodies it believes it will have to retrieve. The official death toll, currently in the hundreds, is likely to grow quickly as rescue crews are better able to assess the situation. What is left behind are some 4.2 million people who have been affected by the storm, many of them injured, thirsty or hungry. The Philippines storm -- some three and a half times more forceful than Hurricane Katrina -- has created serious food and water shortages. Typhoon Haiyan: 3 days in, little relief for survivors . A second round of deaths may be imminent, given limited food and water, along with pools of standing, possibly polluted water amid a breakdown in ordinary sanitation. Relief agencies are worried about outbreaks of disease and infections in the storm's wake. ""We don't have the full picture yet, but there is a lot of destruction, which means that next to a high number of deaths the possibility of wounds will be high,"" said Meinie Nicolai, the president of Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders in Belgium. ""We worry about more deaths because of infection."" Medecins Sans Frontieres  says in the first stage of its recovery efforts, it will work to keep infection rates down and then work to vaccinate people for tetanus. The bacteria that causes tetanus when it enters a deep flesh wound can be deadly. The agency will also provide ongoing psychological help to the victims of the disaster many of whom will be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Nicolai said. ""People in the Philippines are used to typhoons, but the scale of this is completely unprecedented. People will suffer a lot of trauma from the death and destruction they are seeing and will be scared for future typhoons. We will make room for people to speak with a professional and will set up group sessions where people can talk through their trauma."" People are so desperate for food and water there are reports of crowds breaking into warehouses and stores. Medical supplies are also scarce. The few hospitals left standing have had to turn people away because they are overwhelmed with the injured. Many people desperate for medical attention have made their way to the airport, where the military is trying to administer medical care. The World Health Organization is supporting the Philippines Department of Health in strengthening its early warning alert and response network to watch for disease outbreaks and other public health threats related to food scarcity, water contamination and other environmental hazards. It is also helping the government coordinate the international assistance to make sure the field hospitals and medical teams and supplies go where there is the most critical need, and is re-establishing bases for the supplies that are coming in from all over the world. USAID, one of the first agencies to reach victims after the typhoon, came with food, water, hygiene kits and sanitation equipment. U.S. Marines have been helping distribute the aid. Americares has an emergency shipment on the way to the Philippines with enough medical aid for 20,000 survivors, including antibiotics, wound care supplies and pain relievers. International Medical Corps has pre-positioned medical supplies and a team on the ground offering support. Direct Relief is also sending 1.5 tons of emergency medicine, which also includes antifungal medications and chronic disease medicines. C-10's are bringing in supplies from the World Food Programme, which has sent high-energy protein biscuits to feed half a million people. The World Food Programme has 10 people on the ground already, and they will be setting up bases and getting information to the rest of the World Food Programme hubs to determine how much food and supplies are needed, said Bill Campbell with the World Food Programme. How Haiyan could teach world how to adapt to extreme weather . The government has declared a State of National Calamity, which among other powers gives the government price controls for goods including food. The problem at the moment is being able to assess exactly how many people are hurt.  Geography complicates matters. The Philippines population is spread over 800 of the 7,100 islands that make up the country. ""We are having to rent boats and helicopters and are trying to do whatever we can to get to the remote areas,"" Nicolai said. Medecins Sans Frontieres is one of the hundreds of agencies that has crews on the ground trying to assess survivors' needs; Nicolai spoke as trucks were being loaded outside her office with medical material, tents to create makeshift hospitals, water and sanitation equipment, generators and medical equipment. The good news, if there can be good news in such a disaster, is that the Philippines does have a medical infrastructure already -- at least compared to the other regions in which Medecins Sans Frontieres works, according to Nicolai. ""That means you do have an educated medical staff with experience there, but we are learning many are missing or dead, so we, like a lot of other groups that are responding, will try and reinforce and help what is there.""

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:05 PM on 17th June 2011 . Pleaded: Colton Harris-Moore, aka the Barefoot Bandit, pleaded guilty to a string of sensational thefts . The young Washington state man who gained international notoriety during a two-year run from the law in stolen boats, cars and planes has pleaded guilty to seven charges in the 'Barefoot Bandit' case. Colton Harris-Moore, 20, entered the plea in federal court Friday morning, reversing a not guilty plea made last week and ending the latest chapter in his fugitive saga. He could receive between 5 1/4 and 6 1/2 years in prison when he's sentenced in October, said Harris-Moore's attorney, John Henry Browne. Federal prosecutors were to give details of the plea deal reached with the 20-year-old's lawyers after the Friday morning hearing. The two sides had been negotiating whether Harris-Moore could participate in book or movie deals, with proceeds used to repay victims. His lawyers have said restitution could total about $1.3 million. Prosecutors have said Harris-Moore hopscotched his way across the United States, frequently crash-landing planes in rural areas and stealing cars from parking lots at small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane and made for the Bahamas, where he was captured last July. Harris-Moore earned the 'Barefoot Bandit' moniker by committing some of the alleged crimes without shoes. His escapades earned him cult status as an authority-mocking folk hero, and federal prosecutors have expressed reluctance to let him sell his story because it could compound the publicity he's received. Colton Harris-Moore could have gotten decades in jail, but his plea deal is likely to net him just a few years behind bars . Notoriety: Harris-Moore, dubbed the 'Barefoot Bandit', is charged with stealing cars, aircraft and boats while on the run from a safe house in 2008 . Harris-Moore is also expected to face state charges later on in the county where his crimes began. The . federal charges, though, stem from a spate of crimes in late 2009 and . early 2010, when Harris-Moore is accused of flying a stolen plane from . Anacortes, in northwestern Washington, to the San Juan Islands. Authorities say he then stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and . took a plane from a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare . footprints on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls, . Wash., after it ran out of fuel, prosecutors said. He made his . way to Oregon in a 32-foot boat stolen in southwestern Washington - . stopping first to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Wash. From . Oregon, authorities said, Harris-Moore travelled across the United . States until he made it to the Bahamas . In all, Harris-Moore is suspected of more than 100 crimes across nine states. Harris-Moore's lawyer, John Henry Browne, said his client has already agreed that he does not want to benefit from his past behaviour. 'Everything is already agreed to. Colton does not and did not want a . dime and thinks it's wrong to benefit from this,' Browne told the Seattle Times.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:23 AM on 30th June 2011 . A clot-busting drug that can reduce the chance of dying from a second heart attack by 20 per cent has been given the all clear by an NHS watchdog. Clot inhibitor Clopidogrel had been considered the 'gold standard' for current treatment regimes. However research shows that new drug, Ticagrelor, cuts the overall risk of dying from heart disease by 21 per cent, and reduces the risk of suffering a further heart attack within 12 months of the first by 16 per cent. Take heart: Patients on new drug Ticagrelor will have their overall risk of dying from heart disease reduced by 21 per cent . Doctors estimate that it could prevent 1,500 heart attacks every year if survivors and unstable . angina patients take the new pill. It works by preventing the . formation of new blood clots and maintaining blood flow to the heart. Thanks to the ruling Ticagrelor can now be prescribed on the NHS to thousands of patients. Taken with aspirin it is suitable for . people who have had a heart attack or a condition called unstable . angina, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical . Excellence (NICE). Doctors expect more than 180,000 people a year to benefit from the treatment - 70,000 with unstable angina and around 113,000 who have suffered a heart attack. About 136,000 people are admitted to hospital every year in England and Wales following a heart attack or unstable angina. People who have suffered a heart attack are at greater risk of suffering a second. The new drug currently costs Â£54.60 for a pack of 56 tablets - compared to just Â£3.40 for Clopidogrel. The European Union cleared the drug for general use in December last year while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet concluded its assessment of the clot inhibitor for prescription. New pill: Ticagrelor, not pictured, costs Â£54.60 for a pack of 56 tablets - compared to Â£3.40 for Clopidogrel . Dr Carole Longson, NICE health technology evaluation centre director, said: 'Ticagrelor is the latest in an ever-increasing number of important new drugs and interventional techniques that have been shown to reduce deaths in patients with acute coronary syndromes. 'From the evidence considered, the independent appraisal committee concluded that, compared with Clopidogrel, reductions in heart attack and death from vascular causes were significant - 16 per cent and 21 per cent respectively - for patients randomised to the Ticagrelor group.' Patients stay on the drug, made by AstraZeneca, for up to a year. Side-effects can include gastrointestinal, hematoma andÂ  bleeding along with nosebleeds and shortness of breath, although there was no difference between ticagrelor and clopidogrel when it came to risk of major bleeding. Rash and itching was also observed in one per cent of those patients who took the drug.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:22 PM on 20th June 2011 . Allegation: US Republican Senator from Arizona John McCain has accused illegal immigrants of starting wildfires . Republican senator John McCain has accused illegal immigrants of starting wildfires raging across Arizona, prompting a furious response from Latino civil rights groups. He spoke as thousands more Arizona residents were evacuated from the paths of the biggest wildfires ever in the state's history. The fires are under investigation and no suspects have been named, but local media have run anecdotal reports of fires starting at known illicit border crossing points. Mr McCain said: 'There is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally. 'The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border.' Latino civil rights campaigners slammed the remarks, presented without any supporting evidence, as 'careless and reckless'. Speaking to CNN, Randy Parraz, a . Latino Democrat who ran against Mr McCain in 2010, said: 'It's easier to . fan the flames of intolerance, especially in Arizona'. Firefighters are currently battling wildfires that have burned a combined 732,427 acres across the state. Mr . McCain had suggested that illegal immigrants had started the fires to . send signals, to keep warm or to distract border security. But . he did not pin down which fires were allegedly started by illegal . immigrants, nor provide details of the 'substantial' evidence he cited. Tragic: Pete Tunstall leans on his rake while at his home that burned along the south side of Ramsey Road near State Route 92 . Meanwhile thousands more people were driven from their homes as powerful winds pushed the flames from one wildfire towards populated areas. The Monument fire just south of the city of Sierra Vista was one of several blazing through dry brush and timber in Arizona and New Mexico where fire crews have been dogged for days by hot, windy weather. About 3,000 people from 1,700 homes were evacuated on Sunday as the blaze - which has been burning for a week - picked up speed with winds gusted up to 60mph. Fire crews from Rio Rico and Helmet Peak mop up hot spots in a storage trailer in Sierra Vista, Arizona, after the Monument Fire burned through the area overnight . 'Winds pushed fire across Highway 92, making run so fast and so hot that the danger to citizens in the path was significant,' said Cochise County sheriff's spokesman Carol Capas. The flames raced down a mountain and into a heavily populated area, forcing crews to abandon their lines and set up in new spots. Sunday's evacuations brought the total number to about 10,000 people from 4,300 homes forced to flee the flames of the Monument fire, she said. Fire trucks escape the flames near South Andalusian Way after the fire jumped State Route 92 near Sierra Vista, Arizona . Evacuees have been staying with friends and relatives, at three evacuation shelters, and at local inns. 'This is horrible. This is a nightmare,' Debbie Schmidlin told the Arizona Daily Star. She said she was evacuated twice in the past week from homes east and west of Highway 92. 'If this fire gets there, I'm leaving Arizona,' she added, as she watched from behind police lines two miles north of her home. The Monument Fire burns a hillside just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona. Authorities have ordered more evacuations . Before the winds spread the flames earlier in the day, the blaze was reported 27 percent contained at about 21,000 acres or nearly 33 square miles. In eastern Arizona, the massive Wallow fire that has been burning for three weeks kept about 200 residents of Luna, New Mexico, under an evacuation order for a second day. A containment line that had held through days of high winds was breached on Saturday and the fire raced toward town before shifting winds steered it clear. It was moving to the north into an area of scattered ranches late on Sunday afternoon, fire information officer Michael Puentes said. Flames are seen over homes in Sierra Vista, Arizona. The biggest wildfire in state history is closing in on a half million acres burned. Despite the evacuation order for Luna, about half the town's residents remained in town. 'If the fire comes back around or things change where they have to get out, we still have an egress point, so we will still escort them out of town,' Catron County Undersheriff Ian Fletcher said. The Wallow blaze has consumed nearly 800 square miles, a little more than 511,000 acres, and more than 3,500 firefighters were trying to stop its advance. It is larger than a 2002 fire that burned 732 square miles and destroyed 491 buildings that had been the largest in state history. Despite its size, the latest fire has destroyed just 32 homes and four rental cabins. Containment rose to 51 percent Sunday. The Wallow fire, which is burning up much of Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, is the largest of several wildfires burning in spots across the southwestern United States.","Wildfires have burned 732,427 acres across the state .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 1:33 PM on 6th July 2011 . The public is in danger of losing confidence in court decisions because judges are too male, white and elitist say leading figures. Top decision-makers such as Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former Labour Lord Chancellor and Lord Collins of Mapesbury have all spoken of the need to appoint judges from outside the current elitist, male pool. Despite attempts to diversify the judicial system, as of last year just 20 per cent of judges were women, which includes one solitary female judge in the Supreme Court â€“ Baroness Hale of Richmond, who was appointed in 2004. Criticism: Senior figures have said that too many judges are white and male . The figure represents a slight improvement from 1998, when just 10 per cent of judges were women, but senior decision-makers say that this is not nearly good enough. Lord Falconer is concerned that it may take more than 30 years for the numbers of women judges to reflect society, according to a report in The Times. Some figures in the profession are worried that training to become a lawyer is so expensive that only the very privileged can afford to do it. Peter Lodder, QC, the Chairman of the Bar Council, told The Times: â€˜Thereâ€™s a danger that with the cost of university and training for the profession, people from less advantaged backgrounds will not be prepared to take on the debts and the risks of being taken on.â€™ The House of Lords today launches an inquiry into how judicial appointments are made.

Dontay Mosley crept downstairs in the family home, picked up a gas oven lighter and set fire to the carpet. His mother's partner Joseph Perkins realised what had happened after smelling smoke. He dashed downstairs, but was forced back by the flames. Dontay Mosley and his mother Milly, with their dog Boss, who had to be revived by firefighters . Dontay's mother Milly managed to grab her son and escape from the house with Joseph and one of their pet cats. But their other cat, Fluffy, and dog Boss, were both overcome by smoke inhalation. Firefighters saved the dog by giving it oxygen but could not revive the cat. The blaze destroyed all of the family's possessions - including Dontay's fourth birthday presents. Milly, 24, said: 'We have lost everything but we are all very lucky to be alive. 'We were in bed asleep when my partner woke up and said he could smell smoke so we both ran downstairs - but the fire blew Joseph backwards. 'I got my son and got out. He was . just sat in the kitchen eating his cereal as he didn't realise what he . had done. He didn't mean to kill the cat - it was an accident. The fire, which was started by the three-year-old, caused thousands of pounds of damage . 'He has done things like this before so I put the lighter up high. He must have managed to get it. 'He doesn't understand. I took him back to the house to show him the damage and that upset him. 'Now he's having lessons at the fire station - we're very lucky that he shut the door.' The blaze started at about 7.30am on Saturday at the house in Derby. After evacuating the house, dog Boss amazingly went back into the house to look for Milly's daughter, Destiny Thomas, six. Milly added: 'She wasn't there but Boss didn't know that - I think he was making sure she was safe.' Boss then collapsed from smoke inhalation but firefighters revived him outside by giving him oxygen. Crews managed to contain the blaze in the room but the rest of the house was severely damaged by smoke. The family were last night staying with relatives but Milly said she had contacted the council about emergency accommodation. She said their private rented home had not been fitted with smoke alarms.Milly's sister, Nicola, said the family had lost everything but were comforted by the kindness of strangers who had donated goods. She said she posted a message on social networking website Facebook telling people about her sister's situation.

"Last updated at 5:37 PM on 17th June 2011 . A government office worker who faked a spinal tumour stole Â£70,000 to to buy 22 designer handbags has been jailed. Zaira Beg cashed 35 forged cheques so that she could splash out on luxury items including a Â£4000 Louis Vuitton bag. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that her haul of exclusive leather goods also included top name designers Gucci and Hermes. Expensive: A Gucci bag similar to the luxury model that was bought with the stolen cash, a London court heard . And that when they were discovered some of them remained unused and in their original packaging. Beg, 26, forged the cheques over a nine month period while she worked for welfare-to-work provider Ingeus UK Ltd. Prosecutor Karen Maxwell-Burnside said Beg ripped off her employers between February and October 2009. She told the court the treasury assistant faked a spinal tumour and regularly feigned illness to take time off. The court also heard that in the days after she cashed a forged cheque she would go shopping. Beg was eventually caught when an investigation was launched into her repeated absences and she was unable to explain and back up her reasons for taking time off. Coveted: Handbags by Louis Vuitton, like this one, were found unused after Beg's shopping spree, Snaresbrook court heard . Prized: Luxury brands like this Hermes were targeted by Beg the court in London heard . She later complained that she had been bullied at work and passed over for promotion. Ms Maxwell-Burnside added: 'The timing of the cashing of the cheques seemed to correspond with the times she was on sick leave. 'It seems she would go and get the money when she was not working. 'Although she took time off work she would return for the odd day to complete the monthly reconciliation forms in an effort to ensure her fraud was not discovered. 'In total Beg, who was earning Â£1,700 per month, stole Â£71,350 and bought 22 handbags as well as a laptop computer. But many of the bags were recovered from Beg's home in Walthamstow, east London, unused and still in their original packaging. Ms Maxwell-Burnside said: 'Miss Beg told officers she had been bullied at work. 'She also felt that she had been passed over by less well qualified colleagues on the basis of their dress and their manner.' The court heard that since her arrest Beg had been diagnosed with Bipolar affective disorder and was receiving treatment for the condition. Caroline Jackson, defending Beg, told the court: 'It is not being put forward that she was so unwell that she did not know what she was doing. 'Though, to have some 22 designer handbags at home seems quite odd behaviour.' Sentencing Beg Judge Nicholas Huskinson said: 'This was a very serious offence involving a breach of trust, especially having regards to your position of responsibility. 'It was carried out over a substantial period of time and indeed the last cheque was drawn after you had already been suspended. 'The deviousness with which you operated can be noted in that not only did you forge the cheques but you took substantial sick leave for which your company was receptive and generous to but you came in on the day of reconciliation in order to cover your tracks and that in my judgement shows a degree of calculation. 'Beg, of Walthamstow, admitted one charge of fraud and was jailed for 16 months.","She cashed 35 cheques for raids on luxury labels Gucci and Louis Vuitton .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:43 PM on 18th July 2011 . A nine-year-old boy was handcuffed, blindfolded and taken to a detention centre where he was interrogated for five hours over allegations of rock throwing, an Israeli human rights group claims. According to B'Tselem, the boy was only released after it was determined he was a minor. Troops had earlier seized his eight-year-old brother on the West Bank in February, releasing him only when they realised they were looking for his brother. Over the past five years, Israel's military has detained and tried more than 800 Palestinian youths and children for throwing rocks at soldiers (file picture) Over the past five years, Israel's military has detained and tried more than 800 Palestinian youths and children for throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers, jailing most of them, the group said in a report released today. Drawing on military statistics and interviews for its 70-page report, B'Tselem counted 835 minors who were charged with rock throwing from 2005 through early 2011, including 34 children who were 13 years old or younger.Military spokeswoman Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said around 160 civilians and soldiers were wounded in violent attacks by minors during that period. Her office added that 10 were wounded by rocks. B'Tselem acknowledged that while Israeli authorities needed to enforce the law, they said night raids, handcuffing, blindfolds, interrogations and the denial of access to lawyers for children for hours at a time were frequently disproportionate to the crime. 'The authorities need to enforce the law, but they should do it in lawful ways that is appropriate for the crime and the people committing the crime,' said the report's author, Naama Baumgarten-Sharon. Rock throwing, specifically, is seen as a symbol of the Palestinian struggle (file picture) Leibovich said that the military handled children with sensitivity and that their arrest was a justified response to violence. The B'Tselem report noted the situation for child detainees improved after the military established special juvenile courts, but said Palestinian minors were denied rights afforded to Israeli children. Israel has complained for decades about Palestinian children taking part in often violent demonstrations, charging that they are being exploited. Many Palestinian parents see their children as young fighters resisting Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Rock throwing, specifically, is seen as symbolic of their struggle. The issue has flared in the past few years as Palestinians hold weekly demonstrations in West Bank villages in which young men and boys throw rocks and chunks of concrete at Israeli soldiers. The soldiers have used tear gas, rubber bullets and sometimes live fire in response, killing some demonstrators and badly wounding others. Of the more than 800 minors charged with hurling rocks over the past five years, only one youth was acquitted in a trial. Another 93 percent were given jail terms in plea bargains, agreeing mostly because they feared being detained while they waited for their cases to reach trial, said Baumgarten-Sharon. More than 500 of the youths were around 16 years old, the report said. Another 255 were 14 and 15, and 34 were 13 or younger. The older the youths, the more likely they were given longer sentences, sometimes of months in jail. Military spokeswoman Leibovich said the children's fate lay with their families and Palestinian groups, whom she accused of sending out children to confront Israelis. 'We are talking about minors that actually use rocks and explosive devices to target Israeli civilians and soldiers,' she said.","Soliders had earlier seized the child's eight-year-old brother, Israeli rights group claims ."
"Most common complaints against private security firm related to lost property and poor communication . Two complaints of racism partially substantiated, six dismissed . More than half related to centre near Gatwick airport holding convicted foreign criminals awaiting deportation . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:27 PM on 17th June 2011 . Illegal immigrants made hundreds of complaints last year about a private security company that runs removal centres. G4S, which came under the spotlight last year when Angolan detainee Jimmy Mubenga died after being restrained on a flight, received 773 complaints in 2010. The most common concerned lost property or poor communication - but others related to assault and racism. Removal centre: More than half of all the complaints were made at Brook House (pictured) near Gatwick Airport in West Sussex, which holds convicted foreign criminals facing deportation . G4S said it took all complaints 'seriously' but that the ones substantiated were 'extremely low' and of a minor nature. The figures, disclosed under Freedom of Information rules, revealed the firm received 240 more complaints in 2010 than it did during 2009. Of those 773, almost 640 were found to be unsubstantiated and almost 130 were logged as fully or partially substantiated. There were 48 claims of assault, three of which were upheld. Two complaints of racism were partially substantiated, but six were dismissed. There were 1,497 complaints between December 2008 and April 2011, with eight out of 10 relating to the quality of services, rather than allegations of staff misconduct. During the two-and-a-half-year period some 65,000 people passed through the three centres run by the firm. Total complaints in 2010 were up by 240 over the previous year, but the proportion which were upheld fell over the same period. Concerned: Illegal immigrants, pictured here trying to board a lorry in Calais to come over to the UK, made hundreds of complaints last year G4S, which runs removal centres . G4S runs three removal centres and until recently escorted detainees who were being deported.

Three men remain on bail while police investigate the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan detainee who died after being restrained by three G4S guards on a flight in 2010. Figures recently disclosed in Parliament show the company has contracts worth Â£4.6bn with four government departments, including the Home Office and Ministry of Justice. It will soon take on the government's family accommodation unit near Gatwick. A spokesman for G4S told the BBC: 'Anyone detained within our immigration facilities is given every opportunity to raise concerns about either the treatment they receive from our staff or the services we provide. 'The level of substantiated complaints against our employees over the last three years, at 25, is extremely low and of a minor nature, albeit we take each one very seriously. 'The vast majority of upheld complaints relate to issues at Brook House IRC, which houses some of the UK's most challenging detainees, including a number of convicted criminals, prior to their deportation.' David Wood, head of criminality and detention at the UK Border Agency, added: 'The way complaints are processed and recorded has been made simpler in recent years, which has led to a rise in recording. 'Complaints range from issues about the food served at mealtimes to more serious issues. Importantly these figures show a decrease in substantiated complaints and that the majority of complaints are minor and relate to availability of facilities at the centres.'","Most common complaints against private security firm related to lost property and poor communication .

A doctor who caused a pile-up while over the alcohol limit walked free from court yesterday after claiming he was 'sleep-driving'. GP Donald Clegg, who drank up to eight pints a day, was almost four times the drink-drive limit when he crashed into threeÂ  vehicles. Last night, road safety campaigners hit out at the driver's 'lenient' sentence. Clegg, 59, claimed he was asleep and in a state of 'auto-autonomy' when he got into the Vauxhall Zafira dressed in his dressing gown and slippers after returning home from a restaurant. Witnesses describe him driving 'perfectly normally', but he swung out on to the opposite carriageway and clipped two parked cars before smashing into the third in December. A passerby who went to help Clegg had to snap the key out of the ignition to stop him driving away and said he was muttering about going to visit his mother. Police inquiries revealed that Clegg had driven his car into a tree eight months before â€“ again claiming that he was 'sleepwalking' at the wheel. The GP, of Prestwich, near . Manchester, was banned from the roads for a year after he admitted . drink-driving, but he escaped a prison sentence after magistrates in . Bury accepted his sleep defence. Tests revealed Clegg had 127microgrammes of alcohol in 100millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. Somnambulism (sleepwalking) most often occurs for adults during the REM (repetitive eye movement) period of deep sleep where vivid dreaming is most common. Fatigue, lack of sleep and anxiety are often associated with sleepwalking, and it can also be a reaction to drugs or alcohol. Symptoms include walking, talking and performing other detailed activity while asleep. Those who sleepwalk often don't remember the episode, and are usually confused or sometimes aggressive when woken. Although sleepwalkers often go back to sleep if undisturbed, episodes can last for a few seconds or up to 30 minutes. Gwyn Lewis, defending, said: 'Mr . Clegg was suffering from a state of auto-autonomy and he was . sleepwalking. In other words, he was not conscious at the time of his . actions.' Clegg was fined Â£650, and ordered to . pay Â£300 costs as well as a Â£15 victim surcharge. His 12-month driving . ban can be reduced to nine if he takes part in a drink-drivers' rehabilitation programme. Jean Hinkle, chairman of the Bury magistrates bench, told him: 'The prosecution do not dispute that you were sleepwalking. 'We have considered special reasons, . but we have heard about a similar incident in April where you drove a . vehicle and hit a tree. 'You have told us today that you took . no steps to ensure that it would not happen again. You posed a . significant risk to other road users and pedestrians. 'In all the circumstances, we feel it's necessary and appropriate to impose a disqualification.' After the case, Carole Whittingham, . of the Campaign Against Drinking and Driving said: 'Unfortunately . jailing people for drink-driving is very low down the list of priorities . these days. 'There have been cases of people . killing through drink-driving who have not gone to prison.

"Last updated at 3:31 PM on 19th July 2011 . Cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in Amish colonies in The Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows. The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states. That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000. Amish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years . The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago. As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state. Elizabethtown College professor Don Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land. Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom. In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said. New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Amish population. New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.'New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006, the study found. The largest net losers were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Amish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children. The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000. Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago. 'Empire State of Mind': An Amish man works in the field in Centerville, N.Y., a town with an established Amish community. While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse-and-buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German. Mr Kraybill said: 'It's remarkable that a horse-and-buggy people like the Amish are thriving in the midst of high-tech, Twitter America.' Some areas of concentrated Amish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Amish way of life, so they make the decision to hire a tractor-trailer and head for someplace more remote. Large Amish families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules, said Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam. Ms Johnson-Weiner, whose book on the state's Amish was published last year, said: 'The Amish moving to New York are going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in.' The Amish have been involved in disputes in New York over zoning, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Amish communities for tourism purposes. Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century. 'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there aren't any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Amish,' she said. 'They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas.' Mr Kraybill said Amish migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said. Other Amish migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time. Mr Kraybill said prime farmland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,000 an acre, a daunting challenge for a young farmer, along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment. That makes land prices of $2,000 an acre in other states very attractive. Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Amish population in the new survey, just over 61,000, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:11 PM on 19th July 2011 . Playwright Alan Bennett and the Pet Shop Boys are among campaigners who have launched the first High Court challenge against library closures proposed by local authorities across the country. The campaigners, from the borough of Brent in north London, today asked a judge to declare decisions to close six 'treasured' libraries in their area 'fundamentally flawed and unlawful'. The Brent case is expected to be followed in the near future by similar challenges to closures proposed by Gloucestershire and Somerset county councils, and on the Isle of Wight. Camaigners: Playwright Alan Bennett, left, compare library closures to 'child abuse', while the Pet Shop Boys, right , have contributed towards legal costs . Nick Cave, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and Goldfrapp are among those who have contributed to the Brent campaign costs. Playwright Alan Bennett launched a scathing attack when he spoke at a church benefit to raise legal funds to save Kensal Rise library, one of the six under threat in Brent. He compared the loss to 'child abuse'. Applying for judicial review, Helen Mountfield QC today argued on behalf of local residents that Brent council had failed to comply with its statutory duties when it decided to make the cuts last April. Ms Mountfield told Mr Justice . Ouseley, sitting at the High Court in London, that the pressure on local . authorities to cut spending in the face of significant funding cuts by . central government was no excuse. Brent had adopted 'a fundamentally . flawed and unlawful approach to the making of savings in its budget' by . starting from the false premise that library closures were inevitable. The . council had failed to comply with equality legislation and consult . properly with local people before rejecting the possibility of retaining . libraries through community-based projects, argued Ms Mountfield. There was a failure to assess local needs, in particular those of children attending local schools and nurseries, she claimed. From left: Nick Cave, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode and Alison Goldfrapp, who have all also contributed to the campaign to save Brent's libraries . Ms Mountfield said the case was of some public importance. It was the first judicial review claim to examine the relationship between a local authority decision to close significant numbers of libraries and the duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service. 'We say the council, and council officers, misdirected themselves as to the terms of the 1964 Public Libraries and Museums Act, or unlawfully closed their minds and failed to give full and fair consideration to whether the way to provide a comprehensive library service might be by means of a joint arrangement with third sector groups and volunteers.' Local residents packed the courtroom after demonstrating outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Six of Brent's 12 libraries are facing closure - Kensal Rise, Barham Park, Preston Road and those at Neasden, Cricklewood and Tokyngton. Ms Mountfield told the judge that all were treasured by the local community. There had been some 330,000 visits to them in 2010-2011 and they had almost 12,000 'active users'. Brent council is arguing that the decision of its executive on April 11 to order the closures was not tainted by legal error. Council . lawyers say in court documents the decision was 'rational, made with . great care and was based on a full appreciation of the obligation to act . within the law'. Due regard was had to the 2010 Equality Act, and a careful equality impact assessment was carried out. Brent . borough's population of about 290,000 is the second ethnically most . diverse in the country, with 130 languages spoken in the borough's . schools. Outside court, novelist Maggie Gee was among dozens of campaigners protesting against the closures. She said libraries were needed more than ever in times of recession. 'Libraries . are where the unemployed to go find out information about work, . libraries are where people who've just come into the country find . information, libraries are needed more than ever when times are hard,' said Gee, who lives near Kensal Rise library. She . asked: 'Where do teenagers go to study if they can't find peace and . quiet at home? Where do they find information if they don't have . computers? They go to libraries. 'I . wrote two novels, Grace and Light Years, in the British Library. People . need libraries. A lot of people making these decisions about closures . probably owe a lot to libraries themselves. 'They should be looking at cuts in management costs not closing libraries and front-line library staff.' Public pressure: A campaigner holds a banner outside Brent Town Hall . A spokesman for the Brent SOS Libraries campaign added: 'This decision has been taken despite massive opposition by residents who want to see those libraries remain open as a valuable resource for the whole community.' Margaret Bailey, one of the campaigners bringing the judicial review claim, said: 'The threatened libraries are important for everyone who lives, studies or works locally, but especially for low income families and their children.' She said the proposed cuts, ordered by the council's executive committee in April, 'make no sense legally or otherwise'. John Halford, of Bindmans LLP, the solicitors representing the campaigners, said: 'Brent sought to characterise its proposals as a ""transformation"" of library services. 'But in reality it has simply swung a wrecking ball through local services with little regard to the consequences for those who use them.' The Government has faced criticism from the author Kate Mosse over its refusal to intervene in library closures around the country. She said there had been 'a catastrophic failure of leadership' from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, the Arts Council and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). A DCMS spokesman said: 'We continue to monitor and assess proposals and decisions being made about changes to library services across England. 'We take very seriously compliance by local authorities with their statutory duty to understand the local needs for library services and to provide a comprehensive and efficient service to match that need.'","Residents launch judicial review against Brent council decision to close six out of 12 libraries .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:14 PM on 20th July 2011 . A painstaking conservation effort to . remove old patches and repair weak spots in a 714-year-old copy of the . Magna Carta has revealed that the full text of that English declaration . of human rights remains intact even though some words are faded and . illegible to the eye, the National Archives said today. A $13.5million gift from philanthropist . David Rubenstein - owner of the handwritten document - is funding the . conservation effort as well preparations for an upcoming exhibit. Thanks to the gift, the largest cash . donation to the National Archives, the copy of the Magna Carta . eventually will be shown as a forerunner to the freedoms imagined in the . U.S. Declaration of Independence, Constitution and Bill of Rights. Rare: David Rubenstein poses with a 1297 Magna Carta document, at the National Archives in Washington in March, 2008 . Plans call for exhibiting it along . with documents showing the struggle for rights of African Americans, . women, immigrants and others. The Magna Carta bears the seal of King . Edward I and is dated 1297. It is one of 17 known handwritten copies of . the text that established a tradition for the rule of law that even the . king would honour. It is the only original version in the Americas, . while 15 are held by British institutions and one is held by Australia's . Parliament. Ultra-violet photography revealed the previously illegible writing and a fuller picture of the document's good condition, conservators said. Words on the right side of the text had been hidden by water damage at some point in the past. Lead conservator Catherine Nicholson said: 'It's just sort of a wonderful, magical tool that conservators use to reveal what, just to the naked eye, would seem to be lost forever. Even though things look damaged, there's still a residue there that can be confirmed.' Low-angled light also revealed an embossed image of the king seated on his throne as part of the document's seal. None of the faded ink was replaced during weeks of conservation because the archive abides by a conservative treatment philosophy. Spokesman Susan Cooper explained: 'We consider it part of the history of the document, the fading, we want to leave that there.' During the treatment process, conservators removed old patches and adhesives and added handmade conservation paper to strengthen the weak spots. The Magna Carta was then humidified, flattened and will lie untouched for at least three months under weights to reach the proper moisture level before being placed in a new case with humidified, inert gas for long-term preservation. Less than one per cent of the document's text was illegible because of damage, conservator Terry Boone said. The missing text was not revealed under simple UV light, but only when conservators used a special camera the archives recently purchased. Nicholson explained the findings: 'We're looking at something written in medieval hand, and it's in Latin,' Nicholson said. The future exhibit could include a ultra-violet image with the full text, as well as interactive elements with a translation to show visitors how it is linked to the rights of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot first purchased the document from a British family for $1.5million in 1984 when it was last conserved at a Virginia lab. For 20 years, it was lent to the National Archives and was on public view much of that time. Then in 2007, Rubenstein bought it for $21.3million at auction. The billionaire co-founder of The Carlyle Group, a Washington-based private equity firm, said he bought it to prevent it from being taken out of the United States. He returned it to the National Archives in 2008 on a long-term loan. A new gallery named for Rubenstein is scheduled to open in 2012 with the Magna Carta as a centrepiece.","Seventeen original versions of historical document still exist today .

"By . Fiona Roberts . Last updated at 7:40 PM on 21st July 2011 . A boy aged ten has accidentally shot and killed his five-year-old brother with a gun he found at his home in Belleville, Illinois. The brothers were being looked after by a male babysitter while their parents were out at the time of the shooting. It's the third time in little over a week that a child in the St Louis area has died after picking up a gun they found in the house. Shooting: The ten-year-old accidentally shot his five-year-old brother at a house in the first block of Glen Grove, Belleville, last night . The five-year-old died at around 8pm yesterday in what police described as an 'extremely tragic' accidental shooting. He and his older brother were playing in a room next door to the babysitter when the man heard a shot . He ran in to find the five-year-old . slumped on the floor. He called 911, but when police and paramedics . arrived he was pronounced dead at the scene. Belleville Police Chief Bill Clay said: . 'This was not a self-inflicted wound. We're still trying to determine . how they got access to the weapon.' Disturbing trend: There have been three accidental shootings involving children in the St Louis, Missouri area in little over a week . He said officers were investigating the shooting as an accident rather than a crime, and the boy's parents were cooperating. They are questioning the ten-year-old too, but say he has not been detained. He . told the St Louis Post-Dispatch: 'We're just looking to get to the . bottom of this, to find out what happened, and to get all of the . questions answered.' Police have not released the boys' names, nor revealed to whom the gun belonged. 'Extremely tragic': Police gather on a street in Belleville, Illinois, where a ten-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed his younger brother . Raymond Chamberlin, a neighbour, said the family had lived at the neat one-storey house or about a year. He didn't know them very well, but said they would often see the youngest boy outside and there would always be at least one adult watching over him. He said: 'We'd see him riding around his driveway on his tricycle. A sweet little boy. His brother would be out there playing, too. They were a nice family. It's really a tragedy.' Belleville Police Captain Don Sax warned all parents to keep firearms away from their children. Second tragedy: Just last week Lilianna Moore, three, shot herself in the head after finding a gun hidden underneath a mattress at her home in St Louis . He said: '(Guns) have to be locked up. They have to be secured. Don't even have the possibility of having them someplace where children can get them.' On Tuesday Daniel Metz, a police officer's son, died in hospital after he accidentally shot himself in the chest with his father's handgun at his home in Maryland Heights. His father, Ryan, was one of the first officers on the scene, and watched distraught as his colleagues attempted in vain to resuscitate his little boy.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 2:37 PM on 22nd July 2011 . Taxpayers will foot a $125,000 bill to help fund Casey Anthonyâ€™s legal defence team because she ran out of money. The  'world's most hated mother', 25, of Orlando, Florida, was acquitted earlier this month of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008. Her lawyers, who have been reimbursed for most expenses by the state, say she is safe and receiving hundreds of job and housing offers. Out of jail: Casey Anthony, 25, of Florida, right, pictured with her lawyer Jose Baez, left, was acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee . The $537 balance from her jail canteen fund after her release on Sunday is hardly enough to live on, but she seems to be managing fine. Taxpayers began picking up Anthony's legal expenses in March 2010 after she ran out of money and was declared indigent by the courts. So far, the state has reimbursed her lawyers for $119,000, the Justice Administrative Commission said, with another $5,800 bill pending. Prosecutors have not finalised their overall expenses but have identified at least $91,000 in costs, a State Attorneyâ€™s Office spokesman said. Still being calculated are the costs of the huge three-year police investigation that began in July 2008 when Caylee was reported missing. Anthony falsely claimed her . daughter had been kidnapped by a nanny. The toddler's skeletal . remains were found in December 2008. Dead: Anthony falsely claimed her daughter Caylee had been kidnapped by a nanny. The toddler's skeletal remains were found in December 2008 . Anthony was convicted of lying to detectives during the investigation and sentenced to the maximum four years in jail. But with credit for time served awaiting trial and good behaviour while in jail, she spent less than two weeks more behind bars after her sentencing. Anthony has indicated she will appeal her convictions and is requesting that the state continue to fund her defence. A hearing is scheduled on August 25 for Judge Belvin Perry to decide what portion of the trial and investigative costs Anthony should bear. After that, the question will be whether she is able to pay up. But taxpayers are not the only ones with a stake in Anthony's financial resources. Protests: Casey Anthony's case has captured the nation, with many believing she is still guilty of killing her daughter even though she was acquitted . Lawyers for a woman suing Anthony for defamation are demanding details on any book, film or interview deals she has been offered. They also want to know of any offers for appearances on TV shows or in adverts, or for purchasing the rights to any documents in her possession. Speculation abounds that she could sign a big contract to tell her story, and theories over where she is since her jail release have also run wild. Lead criminal defence lawyer Jose Baez told Orlando station WKMG that Anthony left town. â€˜She's not here in Orlando,â€™ he said. Earlier this week producer Al Taylor claimed to MailOnline that he has already met with Casey Anthony to discuss a $1million television deal.","Casey Anthony, 25, acquitted of murdering daughter .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:33 PM on 21st July 2011 . Detectives have been criticised for a 'shocking and disgraceful' conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was revealed how they took a key murder trial witness to a brothel, paid him cash and allowed him to take cannabis and heroin in their company. A Supreme Court ruling has unearthed how 'supergrass' and convicted robber Karl Chapman had sex with a policewoman, socialised at officers' homes and visited pubs while in custody as West Yorkshire Police sought to secure his continued co-operation. The force also ignored a number of violent crimes allegedly committed by Chapman, including the brutal rape of his cellmate and the vicious stabbing of a fellow prisoner with broken glass bound with twine. Convicted robber Karl Chapman, pictured left in 1996, was the main prosecution witness in the case of Paul Maxwell, right, who admitted murder last month . Chapman received special treatment because he was the main prosecution witness in the case of Paul Maxwell, who last month admitted murdering 85-year-old Joe Smales in Wakefield, West Yorkshire in 1996. Maxwell and his brother, Daniel Mansell, were originally found guilty of the attack after a Leeds Crown Court trial in 1998, but the convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2009 on the grounds they had been 'procured by gross prosecutorial misconduct'. The Supreme Court judgement, published on Wednesday, reveals for the first time the 'variety of wholly inappropriate benefits' given to Chapman by West Yorkshire officers . Five Supreme Court judges ruled by a majority of three to two last year that Maxwell should face a retrial. More than Â£3million of taxpayers' money had been spent on the case by the time he finally admitted his guilt, for which he received a 17-and-a-half-year jail term. The Supreme Court judgement, published on Wednesday, reveals for the first time the 'variety of wholly inappropriate benefits' given to Chapman by West Yorkshire officers. One judge, Lord Brown, who took the view that Maxwell should not have been retried, found that a large number of officers, including 'several of very high rank', were engaged in a 'prolonged, persistent and pervasive conspiracy to pervert the course of justice'. Officers colluded in Chapman's perjury during the trial, the judge found, intending him to lie throughout his evidence about how he had been treated. They ensured Chapman's police custody records presented a 'false picture of the facts', even forging one to conceal the truth, and they lied to the Crown Prosecution Service after the trial. Lord Brown stated: 'To describe police misconduct on this scale merely as shocking and disgraceful is to understate the gravity of its impact on the prosecution process. 'It is hard to imagine a worse case of sustained prosecutorial dishonesty designed to secure and hold a conviction at all costs.' None of the officers involved in the case have been prosecuted or disciplined. All have since left the police service and at least one is understood to be living abroad. The full extent of the corruption was uncovered by a North Yorkshire Police investigation on behalf of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which probes potential miscarriages of justice. It is understood that some West Yorkshire officers refused to co-operate with the inquiry. Investigators found that Chapman regularly had sex with a woman police constable but he cheated on her when her colleagues took him to a brothel - a trip described on the custody record as an outing to 'assist in the locations of crime'. Chapman wrote to the woman officer, apologising: 'I was drunk and stoned on weed, they paraded a dozen beautiful women in front of me and said take your pick.' It is alleged that Chapman later assaulted the officer after they broke up, but the case was one of several against him which were not prosecuted. Maxwell's solicitor Mark Foley said he was stunned by the 'incredible scale of the malpractice exposed'. Deputy Chief Constable David Crompton said: 'In relation to the original investigation back in 1996, the methods used to deal with the main witness were wholly unacceptable and cannot be condoned in any way whatsoever.' Following the North Yorkshire Police inquiry 'the CPS concluded there were no criminal offences committed by any officer'. Mr Crompton said: 'Since the original investigation was carried out 16 years ago there has been a complete root-and-branch overhaul of procedures to safeguard against such failings and to prevent them from ever happening again.'","West Yorkshire Police also ignored a number of violent crimes allegedly committed by Karl Chapman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:05 PM on 21st July 2011 . A â€˜good Samaritanâ€™ Home Guard veteran died after being burgled five times in nine weeks. Following the fourth break-in, Leslie Ashton, 93, developed fatal pneumonia after a callous thug threatened him with a hammer and terrorised him for an hour. During his final stay in hospital, the widower was burgled again by the same man, Mohammed Nawaz, whom a judge said had caused his â€˜eventual deterioration and deathâ€™. Tragic: Leslie Ashton, 93, left, and Mohammed Ahston, who burgled him him twice . Mr Ashtonâ€™s terraced home in Sparkhill, Birmingham, where he had lived for most of his life, was targeted three other times by different offenders. The victimâ€™s devastated niece, Vivian Allen, said: â€˜He would still be alive today had it not been for the burglaries. â€˜He had been living for 67 years at the property and he had never had any problems. â€˜He was determined to stay there because it was his home and he had his pets.â€™ Judge William Davis QC, sitting at Birmingham Crown Court, yesterday gave Nawaz, 42, an indeterminate sentence for public protection and ordered that he remain behind bars for a minimum of six years. The judge told Nawaz: â€˜These were wicked offences. It is not often I deal with wicked men but you are one of them. â€˜You threatened him [Mr Ashton] with a hammer, manhandled him around his own home and stole his property as he watched. â€˜Remarkably your victim was able to get outside and raise the alarm and for a few weeks carried on living at his home address. â€˜I am quite satisfied what you did must have led to his eventual deterioration and death. Nawaz, of Albion Road, Sparkhill, had previously admitted two charges of robbery, two of burglary and two of theft. Mrs Allen said: â€˜I think it was a fair sentence. We feel we have got a little bit of justice for him. â€˜He was a gentleman, a really good samaritan, he helped people in the neighbourhood even when he got old. â€˜He would go shopping and clean windows.Â  He had a warm heart and helped those in need. â€˜When he was young he cycled and loved clocks. He even built a grandfather clock. Terrace: The house in Birmingham where widower Mr Ashton lived for 67 years . â€˜He loved hymns and his favourite programme was Songs of Praise - he never missed it. 'We went out to celebrate his 93rd birthday in September. We all enjoyed the day.â€™ Paul Dhami, prosecuting, said Nawaz first broke into Mr Ashton's at 9.30pm on November 30 last year. He was wearing gloves and a hooded top and demanded money, taking GBP10 from the victim's pocket. He then ransacked Mr Ashton's home. At one point the victim blocked a door after the defendant went into his kitchen, but Nawaz forced it open and threatened Mr Ashton with a hammer. Mr Dhami said Nawaz manhandled the pensioner upstairs and took his mobile phone. He then ripped the landline to his phone from the wall to stop him calling for help. His ordeal lasted for about an hour. Mr Dhami said Mr Ashton was the victim of other burglaries. He died of pneumonia after being admitted to hospital. While he was in hospital Nawaz broke in again and stole a laptop which had been fitted with a tracking device by police. This led officers to him. In between the two attacks on Mr Ashton's home, Nawaz also robbed an 84-year-old woman outside her home, also in Sparkhill, taking her gold watch. He also broke into the home of a 66- year-old woman living in sheltered accommodation, but left empty- handed after her carer stopped him. Charnjit Jutla, defending, said Nawaz, who had previous convictions for robbery and burglary had become desperate for money because of his drug addiction.","Thug, who burgled Leslie Ashton, twice threatened widower with hammer during hour-long ordeal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:10 PM on 22nd July 2011 . Multiple murderer: Andrew DeYoung turned down the offer of a final prayer before receiving a lethal injection . A man convicted of killing his parents and sister was put to death early today as the courts allowed America's first video-recorded execution in nearly 20 years. Andrew DeYoung, 37, received a lethal injection at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia, after courts turned down his appeals. A videographer with a camera on a tripod stood about 5ft away from the trolley inside the execution chamber. The execution was put back a day as the state tried to block the video recording. Lawyers for another death row inmate, Gregory Walker, argued that recording DeYoung's execution would provide critical evidence in his appeal about the effects of a sedative now being used as the first step in Georgia's injection procedure. Walker's lawyers want to show that pentobarbital does not adequately sedate the inmate and could cause pain and suffering. DeYoung, when asked to make a final statement, said he was 'sorry to everyone I hurt'. 'I love you, Dawn. Remember to smile,' DeYoung said. His lawyer said Dawn was an old friend. He declined the offer of a final prayer. Department of Corrections officials said he took a sedative pill offered to him beforehand. When the three-drug injection began, DeYoung blinked and swallowed for about two minutes, then his eyes closed and he became still. He was pronounced dead at 8.04pm Thursday local time. In court filings, state prosecutors argued that having a videographer in the execution chamber would jeopardise the state's carefully-scripted security. They also said creating a video came with the risk of it being distributed.Fulton County Superior Court judge Bensonetta Lane allowed the recording to take place and that decision was upheld by Georgia Supreme Court yesterday. The video will be kept under seal by the court. Governor Nathan Deal said it was up to the courts to decide the matter, though he told reporters following a news conference that he had 'grave reservations' about videotaping executions. A first for nearly 20 years: DeYoung's execution in a chamber like this one was caught on camera by a videographer who stood about 5ft from the trolley . Defence lawyers countered in a motion filed yesterday that the state corrections department had long allowed cameras to film parts of the prison, although they acknowledged the state has never before allowed an execution to be recorded. 'It is simply disingenuous to assert that video recording of Mr DeYoung's execution constitutes a fundamental threat to the security of the institution,' they wrote in the filing. Andrew DeYoung was convicted of killing his mother, father and 14-year-old sister in suburban Atlanta in 1993. Then . a student at Kennesaw State University, he stabbed them to death . as part of a plot to gain control of his parents' inheritance so he . could start a business. Authorities said DeYoung cut the telephone wires of his family's home in the middle of the night. He then attacked his mother repeatedly while she was sleeping upstairs, then stabbed his father and sister Sarah. A brother sleeping downstairs escaped after hearing the commotion and ran to a neighbour's house for help. The use of pentobarbital became an issue in Georgia after Roy Blankenship's June 23 execution. Blankenship . was the first Georgia prisoner put to death using the sedative . pentobarbital as the lead-off drug in the state's lethal three-drug . combination. Blankenship . was witnessed jerking his head several times during the procedure, . looking at the injection sites in his arms and muttering after the . pentobarbital was injected into his veins. Death penalty critics said Blankenship's unusual movements were proof that Georgia should not have used pentobarbital to sedate him before injecting pancuronium bromide to paralyse him and then potassium chloride to stop his heart. State prosecutors have raised questions about the timeline cited in the witness account and argued Blankenship's movements occurred before the sedative took hold. The state attorney general's office has said adequate safeguards are in place to prevent needless suffering, including a consciousness check before the second and third drugs are administered. The consciousness check was used for the first time in Blankenship's execution and was performed again on DeYoung. A nurse in the chamber throughout the procedure touched his eyes and his arm. DeYoung showed no signs of movement and the execution continued. States have been turning to pentobarbital to carry out executions since the manufacturer of another sedative announced it would not resume production in the U.S.. Pentobarbital has been used this year to put at least 18 inmates to death in eight states.","Triple killer Andrew DeYoung, 37, put to death after murdering family to get hold of inheritance .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:57 AM on 21st July 2011 . Shock: Private detective Glenn Mulcaire had his legal fees paid by News International even after he was jailed for phone hacking. This was finally stopped today . News International bowed to pressure yesterday and announced it would cease paying the legal fees of the private investigator jailed over phone hacking. Glenn Mulcaire, who was paid more than Â£100,000 a year under contract to the News of the World, was found guilty of hacking into the phones of several people and sentenced to six months in prison in 2007. The move follows evidence given by James Murdoch to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, when he told MPs he was â€˜surprisedâ€™ that â€˜certain legal fees were paid to Mr Mulcaireâ€™. During a three-hour grilling by a parliamentary select committee yesterday, he also indicated that money has also been paid to disgraced former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman. But less than 24 hours later, the . publisher of the now defunct tabloid, bosses said they had stopped . paying Mulcaire's fees with 'immediate effect'. It did not mention Goodman. It came after Rupert Murdoch vowed to end the payments provided it was not 'in breach of a legal contract'. The admission was the most dramatic revelation during three hours of testimony by Mr Murdoch and his father Rupert. It immediately stoked the suspicion that the company has sought to buy the silence of the men at the heart of the scandal. Mr Murdoch junior spent the hearing . trying to rescue both his company and his father from tough questioning, . smoothly responding to MPsâ€™ inquiries with a combination of denial and . management speak. Goodman and Mulcaire were both jailed in 2007 for intercepting the voicemails of members of the royal household. But James Murdoch stunned MPs when he . said explicitly: â€˜Certain legal fees were paid for Mr Mulcaire by . the company and I was surprised and shocked to learn that as you are.â€™ 'Humble' moment: James Murdoch, left, and his father Rupert Murdoch appear before the Department of Culture Media and Sport Committee. Behind them is Rupert's wife Wendi, wearing a pink jacket . Animated: Rupert Murdoch at first gesticulated wildly as he defended himself. He later became more subdued . But after being asked about Mr . Goodman hiring an expensive lawyer, he referred to payments going to . â€˜thoseâ€™ men in the plural, indicating that he meant Mr Goodman as well. He said the money was handed over â€˜in . accordance with legal counsel and strong adviceâ€™ but both he and his . father said they were trying to put a stop to the payments. Former News International chief . executive Rebekah Brooks later confirmed that it had paid the legal fees . of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson even after he left the . company and added: â€˜I think the same for Clive Goodman. On Glenn . Mulcaire, I think his legal fees would be paid when he was a . co-defendant in the civil cases.â€™ Labour MP Paul Farrelly said: â€˜People . might ask why a company would wish to pay the legal fees of a convicted . felon, whoâ€™s been intimately involved in the destruction of your . reputation, if it were not to buy his co-operation and silence.â€™ Hit: Jonnie Marbles (left) tries to attack Rupert Murdoch (bottom right) with a white substance during the hearing .

The firm said: â€˜News International . declined that request, and so we are still unable to respond in any . detail as to our advice or the scope of our instructions in 2007, which . is a matter of great regret.â€™ James Murdoch was also asked why the . company paid around Â£1.7million to two victims of phone hacking, before . the recent scandal broke, but only Â£20,000 to TV presenter Andy Gray in . recent weeks. He denied News International had paid . â€˜hush moneyâ€™ to Professional Footballers Association boss Gordon Taylor . and PR man Max Clifford. He said those sums were recommended by the . companyâ€™s lawyers.

"By . Fiona Roberts . Last updated at 8:33 PM on 21st July 2011 . Pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai had planned to propose to his beautiful girlfriend, who was found hanging naked from a second-floor balcony at his historic California mansion. A friend has revealed the millionaire wanted to 'spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa, who died two days after Mr Shacknai's six-year-old son Max was fatally injured when he fell down the stairs. The news came a day after police revealed Mr Shacknai, who has been married twice before, had a stormy and violent relationship with his ex-wife, Max's mother Dina. Marriage plans: Jonah Shacknai reportedly told friends he 'wanted to spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa, found dead last Wednesday . They repeatedly accused each other of physical and verbal abuse as their marriage broke down, and three times the fights became so violent they called police. Their six-year-old son died in hospital on Sunday, almost a week after he fell down the stairs while in Miss Nalepa's care. Last Wednesday she was found dead, hanging naked from a second-floor balcony with her hands and feet bound with orange electrical cord. San Diego police are still investigating the case, amid mounting speculation 32-year-old Miss Nalepa committed suicide out of grief for Max's death. Tragic death: Max Shacknai died in a San Diego hospital on Sunday after tumbling down the stairs at his father's 27-room mansion last week . She had been dating Mr Shacknai for two years, and last December quit her job as an ophthalmic technician to devote herself to him and his three children at his historic Spreckels mansion in the affluent Coronado suburb of San Diego. The 32-year-old had recently finalised her own divorce, and in May officially filed to revert back to her maiden name, Zahau. 'Bizarre' death: Rebecca Nalepa was found dead, hanging naked from a balcony with her hands and feet bound . A friend close to Mr Shacknai told Radar: 'It was a very serious relationship. There was a lot of love there. Jonah . had every intention of proposing to Rebecca. Jonah wanted to spend the . rest of his life with her.' Her sister, Mary Zahau-Loehner, has vehemently denied that her sister committed suicide, telling ABC: 'Rebecca was a beautiful, vibrant, loving and kind person and she would never do this to herself.' Today Reed Holman, a personal trainer . at Miss Nalepa's gym, echoed her words, saying: 'She had everything to . live for, she was young, fit and really beautiful.' But Mr Holman also speculated she might have been strong enough to carry out the bizarre suicide. He described Miss Nalepa, who was 5ft . 7ins, as a 'super-fit woman who definitely knew how to work out and . take care of her body.' She regularly visited the gym to train, most often alone but sometimes with her boyfriend. Stormy relationship: Jonah and Dina Shacknai called police three times with allegations of violent domestic disputes as their marriage broke down . He said: 'She was a strong woman. In my opinion she would have been capable of tying her feet and hands . together and hanging herself although I know this seems unlikely to a . lot of people. 'Whether she did or not I donâ€™t really know because Iâ€™m not a detective - . itâ€™s a really sad story all round because she seemed like a really . happy and responsive person.' Yesterday a source revealed Mr Shacknai and his ex-wife had donated Max's organs after his death. The friend said: 'Jonah and Dina were given some solace knowing that three families were able to avoid the horror they are going through.' Tragic home: The historic 27-room Spreckels mansion in Coronado, an affluent suburb of San Diego, where Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend was found hanging naked . Appalling accident: Max Shacknai fell down these stairs last week. He later died in hospital, just days after his father's girlfriend was found hanged . Mr Shacknai is now said to be 'in seclusion' as he mourns the loss of his son and his girlfriend. A source said: '[He] is absolutely inconsolable. Dealing with the loss of his only child and his girlfriend, it's just an epic tragedy.' Homicide Sergeant Roy Frank said police have now searched the house twice as they try to work out what happened to Miss Nalepa. He told The Arizona Republic: 'There are five possibilities in her death, and we know it wasn't natural or accidental. 'We don't want to say ""undetermined"" so that leaves homicide or suicide. We want to be very sure which one it was.' Police are also investigating reports that a loud party was held at the house the night after Max's fall, and just hours before Miss Nalepa died.","Jonah Shacknai 'wanted to spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa .

"By . Fiona Roberts . Last updated at 11:25 PM on 21st July 2011 . The eight-year-old Hasidic boy who was kidnapped, murdered and dismembered had been drugged with a lethal combination of painkillers and muscle relaxants before he was smothered with a towel, an autopsy has revealed. Leiby Kletzky was killed in Brooklyn, New York, last week after getting lost on his way home from a day camp and innocently asking 35-year-old Levi Aron for help. Police searched Aron's home and found the boy's severed feet wrapped in plastic in the man's freezer, and the rest of his body in trash bins near the house. A chopping board and three bloody carving knives were also found in Aron's kitchen, authorities said. Butchered: An autopsy has revealed Leiby Kletzy, eight, was drugged with painkillers and muscle relaxants before being smothered with a towel. Levi Aron, right, has pleaded not-guilty to first-degree murder . Today an autopsy revealed little Leiby died from the combined effects of cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, quetiapine, an antipsychotic, and the . pain medications hydrocodone and Tylenol. He was then smothered with a towel, before his body was hacked to pieces. But Aron was allegedly left with scratches on his arms, suggesting Leiby fought courageously during the horrific ordeal - even though his feet were tied together. The results were released as his family left . their Brooklyn apartment for a walk around the mostly Hasidic . neighbourhood, marking the end of the . traditional mourning period of Shiva. The took the early morning walk to 'escort the soul to its final resting place', Rabbi Jack Meyer told the New York Post. Detectives today said they believe . Leiby was murdered late last Tuesday afternoon, after Aron returned from . work - meaning the boy was alive for a day after he disappeared. Aron has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and kidnapping. Grief: Leiby's mother Esther joined family members for a walk to 'escort his soul to its final resting place' Outpouring: At least 8,000 people gathered in Brooklyn as Leiby's casket was carried to his funeral service . Prosecutors . allege Aron lured Leiby into his home on July 11. Video cameras . captured the fateful encounter between the two on a Brooklyn street as . Leiby's mother waited anxiously just a few blocks away. Police and prosecutors said Aron, a . clerk at a hardware supply store, has confessed to suffocating the boy . with a bath towel, but they continued to work on verifying his horrific . and bizarre explanation for the boy's death. Inside court his attorney, Pierre Bazile, said his client told him he heard voices and suffered from hallucinations. Police said that Aron told investigators . he brought the child to a suburban wedding about 35 miles away and . spent several hours there. Other wedding guests confirmed Aron was there . but didn't see the boy. Today chief police spokesman Paul Browne said: 'Detectives now have reason to believe beyond Aron's confession that Leiby was at the wedding, but not necessarily inside the venue.' Charged: Police walk Levi Aron, centre, to a police car in Brooklyn. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, but has allegedly admitted to police that he abducted Leiby and took him to a wedding . Accused: Levi Aron listens as his defence lawyer Pierre Bazile speaks at his arraignment in Brooklyn last week . By the time the pair returned to the city, it was so late that Aron decided to take Leiby to his home to sleep and left him there Tuesday while he went to work, according to the police version of the confession. Workers at the supply store said Aron showed up as usual that day but seemed troubled. Aron told police he killed Leiby when he got home after being spooked by a massive search for the boy in Borough Park section of Brooklyn, home to one of the world's largest communities of Orthodox Jews outside of Israel. He allegedly told police: 'When I saw the fliers, I panicked and was afraid.' Investigation: Police continue to remove items from Levi Aron's home as they investigate Leiby's death . Final journey: The street in Brooklyn, New York, where Levi Aron lived, and where parts of little Leiby's dismembered body were found . Investigators also have said Leiby may have been tied up and tried to fight back. NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said Aron had scratches on his arms, wrists and elsewhere - a sign 'there was some kind of struggle'. There also were marks on the boy's remains that could have been caused by restraints, the commissioner added. The medical examiner does not comment on any injuries to a body that were not involved in causing death. The autopsy results came as city councilman David Greenfield . announced plans for 'Leiby's Law', which would turn shops on every block . in the city into safe havens for children who are lost. Homes and shops would have to submit to a $50 background check, and could then display green 'Safe Haven' stickers in their windows.","Autopsy finds painkillers, muscle relaxants and anti-psychotic drugs in little Leiby's body .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 10:42 PM on 21st July 2011 . Britain's second-biggest fuel supplier has announced punishing price rises. Scottish & Southern Energy is putting gas up by 18 per cent and electricity by 11 per cent. The move will add Â£171 to the annual average dual fuel bill, taking it to Â£1,265. Costly business: How SSE, Scottish Power and British Gas's price hikes have affected household bills . Scottish Power - Gas will rise by 19 per cent this August and there will be a 10 per cent jump in electricity. It will add around Â£185 to an annual dual fuel bill. British Gas - Gas is going up 18 per cent and . electricity by 16 per cent next month. This will take the average annual . dual-fuel bill to a record Â£1,288. Scottish and Southern Energy - Gas prices will rise by an average of 18 per cent and . electricity prices by 11 per cent from September 14. The increase will . mean a typical annual dual-fuel bill will rise from Â£1,094 at present to . Â£1,265 - an increase of Â£171. These increases are separate from price rises that the industry says will be required by the Government to fund a Â£200billion switch to wind farms, solar and nuclear power. SSE, the third of the 'big six' suppliers to announce big rises, has 5.2million electricity customers and 3.6million with gas contracts, making it second to British Gas in terms of its national reach. The company claimed the increases reflect a rise in wholesale costs for gas and electricity this year. However, this is challenged by consumer groups. They point out that wholesale prices are around one third lower than in 2008, yet the prices imposed on customers will now rise to a record high. Chief executive of the official customer body, Consumer Focus, Mike Oâ€™Connor, said: â€˜This increase heaps more pressure on to already cash-strapped consumers and will tip many thousands more into fuel poverty. â€˜Consumers cannot tell whether these increases are justified and that stokes the lack of trust in energy firms.â€™ He said the energy regulator Ofgem must get to the heart of whether prices are fair or refer the entire industry to an inquiry by the Competition Commission. Figures last week revealed that 5.5million in the UK are living in fuel poverty, defined as spending at least 10 per cent of disposable income on heat and light. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: â€˜We are already seeing people self-ration and self-disconnect as they canâ€™t afford their increasing fuel bills. Energy: British Gas announced an 18 per cent price hike for gas and 16 per cent price increase for electricity two weeks ago, and now Scottish and Southern Energy has joined them . As . many as half of all consumers have never changed energy supplier since . deregulation in the late Nineties, according to energyhelpline.com. Ann . Robinson, of comparison site uSwitch.com, says: 'Despite household . energy bills having rocketed by almost Â£500 or 71% in just over 5 years, . consumers are still being asked to pay more. Household finances are . creaking and groaning. 'There . is no room for complacency and I would urge consumers to act now to . ensure they are paying the lowest possible price and to reduce the . amount they use. Fixing . your energy prices is an option that offers security and peace of mind, . especially for those worried about the impact of price hikes on their . household budget.' â€˜As a result they are going without the heating they need and living in a cold home, which can have a devastating impact on their physical and mental health.â€™ Ann Robinson, of price comparison website uSwitch.com, said: â€˜Despite household energy bills having rocketed by almost Â£500 or 71 per cent in just over five years, consumers are still being asked to pay more. â€˜Household finances are groaning under the weight of price hikes, but the biggest concern is the impact on fuel poverty.â€™ SSE has promised not to raise prices again before August 2012 at the earliest. Chief executive Ian Marchant said: â€˜I am sorry that we have had to announce an increase in household energy prices at a time when many peopleâ€™s budgets are under strain, but the upward pressures on prices have become too great.â€™ Since its last gas price increase, in December, wholesale costs of electricity and gas have risen by 23 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, he said. Domestic energy consumption in the UK rose by 18 per cent between 1970 and 2009, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today. The figure rose from 37 million tonnes of oil equivalent to 44 million tonnes in 2009 - with more than half used for heating. Statisticians attributed the rise to the increased number of households and changes in energy efficiency and 'external temperatures'. Authors of the study said that in 2008, 5.6 per cent of all electricity consumption in the UK was generated from renewable resources - an increase compared to 1.7 per cent in 1990. But the 2008 proportion was dwarfed by the EU average of 16.7 per cent. UK emissions 'of the basket of greenhouse gases' were estimated to have fallen by more than 27 per cent between 1990 and 2009. Last year in the UK, the number of days of moderate or higher air pollution were at their lowest level since 1987 in rural areas (22 days) and their lowest level in urban areas since records began in 1993 (eight days). The details were released by the ONS as part of its 'Social Trends' research. Other findings included recycling, composting or reuse of household waste increasing considerably in England from less than 1 per cent in 1983/84 to 40 per cent in 2009/10. In England, in 2009, the environment was thought to be the third most important issue that adults felt the Government should address after the economy and unemployment.","Scottish and Southern Energy is third of 'big six' energy firms to put up prices .

"Freight distribution firm boss replaces James Caan . Admitted that her first show was 'nerve-wracking' Had a stroke after a tummy tuck went wrong . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:06 PM on 21st July 2011 . The new girl: Businesswoman Hilary Devey is replacing James Caan on the Dragon's Den judging panel . She's the hard-working, tough-talking businesswoman who overcame difficult obstacles on her way up the ladder. But despite her confidence and fiercely-ambitious nature, Hilary Devey said she felt nervous taking her seat as the new judge on Dragon's Den. Devey, 54, has replaced James Caan for the ninth series of the reality TV show, and said she was delighted when the BBC asked her to join the panel. In her first interview since joining the team, Hilary, who is the boss of a . Leicestershire-based freight distribution firm, spoke to the Sun and said: 'I have always . been a fan of the show and I was so pleased when the BBC asked me to be . on it.' And how does she think she was received by the wannabe entrepreneurs? 'Viewers . will have to decide for themselves,' she said, 'but I hope they think I . have brought flair and flamboyance to the Den. Humour too. 'I have brought a competitive edge to proceedings. I enjoy the rivalry. It's fun.' 'I lost my rag a few times as I . thought people were trying to pull one over me. I don't like that. I am . tenacious and I have not been afraid to work hard. She told the newspaper that she was made to feel at ease . by her fellow judges - Duncan Bannatyne, Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden . and Theo Paphitis - but added: 'I was still very nerve-racking on the . first day. I felt like the new girl at school and it did take a few . pitches to find my feet.' Bolton-born Hilary runs Pall-EX which pulls in Â£100million in revenue every year. But she revealed that she worked hard to . get where she is now, even sacrificing her personal life for the job, . but she said her determination to succeed was spurred on by some . horrible times in her life. Hilary, who has divorced twice, had a tummy tuck that gave her a stroke and helping her son battle his heroin addiction. The new line up: Hilary joins Duncan Bannatyne, Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis . Two years ago she went for the cosmetic procedure and said: 'I wanted a flat stomach, like a lot of women, but I did not rest much afterwards and I had a stroke. I am OK now.' She then had to tackle her son Melvin's Â£600-a-day heroin habit - which he funded by stealing from his mother. She said: 'For a long time I had to lock every door behind me. 'He would steal my clothes, food, electrical household items - anything he could sell for money to get a fix.' But Hilary said he has overcome his addiction and said: 'Time is a healer and he is going back to college. 'We are really close and I will always be there for him.' Looking forward, she said: 'I really loved doing Dragons' Den. 'I really hope the BBC will want me back.'

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:02 PM on 22nd July 2011 . A defence lawyer for accused child murderer Levi Aron has sensationally quit the case after more horrific details were revealed about the killing. Gerard Marrone, 37, said his conscience prevented him from continuing defending Aron, 35, over the alleged murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky. The New York lawyer and father-of-three admitted he cried about the case earlier this week and one of his children is just a year younger than the victim. Lawyer quits: Gerard Marrone, 37, left, said his conscience prevented him from continuing defending Levin Aron, 35, right, over the alleged murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky in New York . â€˜I have three little boys,â€™ Mr Marone told the New York Daily News. â€˜You can't look at your kids and then . look at yourself in the mirror, knowing that a little boy, who's close . in age to my eldest son, was murdered so brutally.â€™ Earlier this week it was revealed police found the boy's severed feet in the man's freezer, and the rest of his body in bins near the house, as well as a chopping board and three bloody carving knives. He told ABC: â€˜A little piece of me died when I got the case.â€™ Itâ€™s also believed Aron could face the federal death penalty if convicted after he took Leiby across state lines to New Jersey. Defence lawyer Scott Greenfield has criticised Mr Marroneâ€™s decision. Grief: Leiby's mother Esther joined family members for a walk to 'escort his soul to its final resting place' Outpouring: At least 8,000 people gathered in Brooklyn as Leiby's casket was carried to his funeral service . â€˜He knew the allegations going in,â€™ Mr Greenfield wrote in a blog. â€˜He knew what he was getting involved with. â€˜He's chosen to quit, to walk away . from his client and in the process, to announce that he, as defence . lawyer, is too sickened by his client's actions to remain beside him. This he cannot do.â€™ But Mr Marrone has received support from others. Rachel Bana wrote on his Facebook page: 'So proud of ur decision.' Suzanne Seitz posted: 'Thank you dear man. May you have endless blessing on you and your dear family.' Amateur boxer Mr Marrone was shot in . the back aged 21 and has walked with a limp ever since - although he was . told he would never walk again. Charged: Police walk Levi Aron, centre, to a police car in Brooklyn. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, but has allegedly admitted to police that he abducted Leiby and took him to a wedding . Accused: Levi Aron listens as his other defence lawyer Pierre Bazile speaks at his arraignment in Brooklyn . He says on his website that he fights for the â€˜underdogâ€™ and is â€˜sincere, honest and cares about his clientsâ€™. Aron was indicted this week over the . abduction and death of Lieby in Brooklyn, New York, and is now left with . one lawyer - Pierre Bazile. The Hasidic child got lost and asked a . stranger identified by police as Aron for directions before getting . into his car earlier this month. Police later found the boyâ€™s body . parts and it has since been revealed he was allegedly drugged with pills before . being smothered and dismembered.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:08 PM on 23rd July 2011 . A criminal complaint against two new . suspects describes in graphic detail the injuries suffered by a San . Francisco Giants fan who was beaten nearly to death outside Dodger . Stadium - including cuts to the victim's face and tongue. The charges filed Friday against . Louie Sanchez, 29, and Marvin Norwood, 30, were announced by Police . Chief Charlie Beck as he exonerated a man initially named as the prime . suspect. Sanchez and Norwood were charged with . one count each of mayhem, assault by means likely to produce great . bodily injury, and battery with serious bodily injury, all felonies, in . the attack on Bryan Stow. Brutally beaten: Mr Stow was punched and kicked in the head. Now two . more men have been arrested in connection with the attack which left him . in a coma . Both were being held on $500,000 bail after being arrested Thursday. Mr Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic, remains hospitalised in a serious condition from the attack after the Giants-Dodgers game on opening day, March 31. Mr Stow's family said in a blog post Friday that he appeared to mouth his last name and might have tried to give a thumbs-up. The complaint alleged both men personally inflicted great bodily injury on Stow, 'causing him to become comatose due to brain injury and to suffer paralysis.' Wanted: Police released sketches of the two men they believe to be the attackers . The mayhem count alleged that they 'did cut and disable the tongue, and put out an eye and slit (Stow's) nose, ear and lip.' Dorene Sanchez, believed to be the sister of Louie Sanchez, had been arrested on suspicion of being an accessory after the fact then released. She was not charged. A message left at a number for the parents of Sanchez was not returned, and contact details for Norwood's family could not be found, the Associated Press reports. The arrests came two months after an emotional Mr Beck trumpeted the arrest of the initial suspect Giovanni Ramirez, who was never charged. Despite his exoneration, Ramirez remains jailed on a parole violation. For months, Mr Beck had steadfastly maintained his confidence that Ramirez was the right suspect. 'In policing, it's just as important to exonerate the innocent as it is to implicate the guilty,' Mr Beck said Friday at a terse news conference. 'I want to tell the world that Giovanni Ramirez is no longer a suspect in this case.' Beaten to a pulp: Father of two Bryan Stow . Mr Beck did not provide details of the evidence against the two men but said more details would be released Monday. 'The Los Angeles Police Department never gave up on this case,' District Attorney Steve Cooley said in a prepared statement. Earlier in the day, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing, said police have no forensic evidence against the latest suspects but they had made incriminating statements. Court records show Norwood was sentenced in 2006 to three years' probation and served 118 days in jail after pleading guilty to one felony count of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant. In 2003, Louie Sanchez pleaded guilty to one felony count of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant, and the following year he pleaded no contest to one misdemeanor count of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. Despite those run-ins with the law, neighbours described the men as friendly, baseball-loving fathers. Neighbour Danyelle Dickson said Louie Sanchez and his family are quiet, friendly people, with whom she had exchanged greetings but had little other contact. She often saw Sanchez playing catch on the family's lawn with a woman and boy who she believed to be his wife and son. 'It's just a really nice family, a really quiet family,' she said. Sanchez also was charged Friday with two misdemeanor counts of battery stemming from a separate incident the same day as the beating. Meanwhile, Soledad Gonzalez, the mother of Ramirez, said she was upset about the arrest of her son in May. 'If you don't have any proof, why did you put the picture of him in public?' she asked at a separate news conference. 'That's wrong. There's a big, big mistake that they made.' She said her son would have to decide whether to sue the LAPD. 'We can live with them sending us a letter of apology,' said attorney Anthony Brooklier, who represents Ramirez. Mr Brooklier said attorneys plan to file a writ next week challenging the parole board's decision to keep Ramirez in prison for ten months after police investigating the beating found a gun in the house where he was staying.","Gruesome details revealed in criminal complaint .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:27 PM on 23rd July 2011 . Accused: Catherine Kieu is alleged to have cut off her husband's penis and then dialled the emergency services . A woman who faces life in prison for allegedly drugging her husband before cutting off his penis with a kitchen knife and grinding it up in a garbage disposal has been given a $1million bail. Catherine Kieu, 48, is said to have made her 60-year-old husband dinner at their California home earlier this month and put a poison or drug in the food to make him pass out. When he woke up, he was tied to a bed and could not move while his wife took a 10 inch knife to his genitalia before throwing the organ into the garbage disposal and turning it on, police said. The couple, who married in late 2009, were involved in divorce proceedings and the horrific attack followed an argument over the husband having a male friend around friend to stay at the house, according to prosecutors. In court on Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Debra Carrillo set bail at $1 million. Kieu appeared briefly in a blue jail jumpsuit, with chains . rattling as she walked. Her long dark hair blocked portions of her face, . and she answered Carrillo's questions through a Vietnamese-language . interpreter. Hiding: Catherine Kieu hid her face behind her hair as she appeared in court . Behind bars: Kieu faces life in prison if found guilty and given the maximum sentence . She is charged with torture and aggravated mayhem, with sentencing enhancements for great bodily injury and use of a knife. If convicted of all counts, she could face life in prison without parole. Frank Bittar, Kieu's attorney, declined to comment on the allegations, except to say 'there's a lot there, to the case - more than meets the eye.' Authorities were called to the . couple's home in Garden Grove, just south of Los Angeles, after Kieu . called 911 reporting a medical emergency. Kieu, who works as a real estate . broker, told officers who found her husband tied to the . bed and bleeding from the groin that he 'deserved it'. She had blood spattered on her legs and shirt when authorities arrived, according to court documents. The man was rushed to the University of . California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange where he underwent emergency . surgery. The severed organ could not be reattached. The husband told police she served . him a tofu dinner which tasted 'metallic' and he went to bed at about 9pm feeling tired. Prison: Kieu is being held at Orange County jail charged with poisoning and spousal abuse . While . he was sleeping, Kieu 'tied the victimâ€™s legs and arms to the four . corners of the bed with nylon ropes', prosecutors said. The victim told authorities that when . he woke up, Kieu pulled his pants 'grabbing the victimâ€™s penis and . severing it with a knife'. Kieu then took the penis to the kitchen and . threw it in the garbage disposal, 'turning it on, and mutilating the . organ'. In 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband's penis in Virginia and . threw it out of her car window into a field on the side of the road. She . claimed years of sexual abuse drove her to the attack, and she was . acquitted by reason of insanity. The penis was later reattached.","Catherine Kieu given $1m bail and could get life behind bars for 'attack'

"Hacking group publishes Nato documents about Afghanistan and Kosovo . Hackers vow to fight governments and corporations who are their 'enemy' International swoop on hackers leads to arrests, including a 16-year-old male from south London . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:15 PM on 22nd July 2011 . Nato is investigating claims that its computer network has been infiltrated after a group of hackers boasted they had breached the organisation's security. Hacking group Anonymous bragged that they had 'breached' Nato's security and published two classified documents to prove their claims. The group wrote on Twitter: â€˜Yes, Nato was breached. And we have lots of restricted material. In the next days, wait for interesting data.â€™ Defiant: The hacking group Anonymous brazenly poked fun at FBI and Nato . It added: â€˜We are sitting on about one gigabyte of data from Nato now, most of which we cannot publish as it would be irresponsible.â€™ The hackers also posted links to two documents to prove their claims. The first, dated August 27 2007 and marked â€˜Nato Restrictedâ€™, is a technical document about communication systems at the Joint Communications Control Centre for ISAF forces in Afganistan. The second document, dated 2008 and also . marked â€˜Nato Restrictedâ€™, covers proposals for outsourcing . communications systems for Nato forces in Kosovo. Defiant: The hacking group have declared a war against anyone who tries to stop them infiltrating the system . A Nato spokesman said the organisation was investigating the claims from Anonymous. He said: â€˜Nato is aware that a hackers group has released what it claims to be Nato classified documents on the internet. 'Nato security experts are investigating these claims. We strongly condemn any leak of classified documents, which can potentially endanger the security of Nato Allies, armed forces and citizens.â€™ Anonymous then took to Twitter to mock Nato, saying they had seen their security procedures, but it would appear 'nobody ever read them'. Hackers published this document they claim they found when hacking Nato's computer system . Then they said they laughed at Nato's 'battleships' in the war against hackers. They released a statement to the authorities telling them to expect more hacking,' they wrote. 'These governments and corporations are our enemy. 'And we will continue to fight them, with all methods we have at our disposal, and that certainly includes breaking into their websites and exposing their lies.' The hacking group is a loosely organized group of hackers sympathetic to WikiLeaks. Along with its splinter group LulzSec, It has claimed responsibility for attacks against corporate and government websites worldwide. Anonymous claims credit for disrupting the websites of Visa and MasterCard in December when the credit card companies stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Hackers from both have attacked websites including those of the CIA in America and SOCA in Britain, and infiltrated networks belonging to Sony. Earlier this week LulzSec hacked into The Sun newspaper website and published a fake news story claiming Rupert Murdoch had died of metal poisoning. On Tuesday U.S. authorities announced 14 arrests in connection with December attacks on Internet payment service PayPal that were claimed by Anonymous. After the international raid two other Americans, four Dutch nationals and one Briton were arrested on suspicion of participating in other attacks against companies and organizations, U.S. authorities said. The crackdown -the biggest reaction so far by U.S. authorities to a string of cyber attack - has so far resulted in more than 60 arrests in Britain, the US, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey. The swoop, which seized computers and . other records, was meant to serve as a deterrent to others who may be . considering joining the cause. Those arrested, if convicted, could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer. The FBI's arrests is providing a treasure trove of information and will lead to further arrests, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters on Thursday. The law enforcement official said: 'This is the good example of a significant event that successfully removed a number of individuals from being part of the problem and will certainly lead to information that will result in locating other subjects.' While attacks by Anonymous and related 'hacktivist' groups have drawn wide attention, other cyber crimes aimed at espionage are a higher priority for the FBI. The latter have included intrusions at Google, Lockheed Martin and the International Monetary Fund. 'We didn't pull resources away from those higher priority cases to work this,' the official said. Yet Anonymous and Lulz Security, issued a defiant statement on Twitter saying they would continue their efforts. In an indication that they would increase their hacking efforts if interfered with, Anonymous Tweeted to the FBI: 'The more you arrest, the louder we'll roar.' James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said U.S. authorities were trying to warn people that they would track down hackers. 'I think they (the FBI) are trying to send a signal that this isn't cost-free in the hopes that it will scare off some of the others. If we're lucky it will work,' Mr Lewis said. The law enforcement official said that people allegedly involved in the cyber attacks might no realize just how serious the crimes were and that prosecutors would likely seek stiff sentences. Those arrested, if convicted, could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer. 'They're probably not the types of people who have been prepared for any time in jail. This is not a joke,' the official said. 'The reality of the fact that this is both a crime and that people will be actually doing time in jail I think really hasn't sunk in to a lot of people who are getting involved in these activities.' Lewis said one possible benefit from the cyber attacks is that it will lead network and website administrators to beef up their security. 'These guys exploit poor configuration, and that's the simplest thing to fix but there's just so much of it out there it will take a while,' Mr Lewis said.","Hacking group publishes Nato documents about Afghanistan and Kosovo .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:57 PM on 21st July 2011 . A British expat was killed by a suspected terrorist car bomb in Yemen yesterday. David Mockett, from Plymouth, Devon, was killed instantly when a bomb planted under the driverâ€™s seat of his sports utility vehicle blew up as he drove through the southern port city of Aden. Mr Mockett, who was aged in his 60s, worked as surveyor for Arabian Marine Surveyors Ltd. Devastation: By-standers look at the burnt-out shell of the car that exploded, killing a British shipping worker . Last night his wife, Cynthia, revealed . her fears the blast was so powerful she will not have a body to bury. She said: â€˜My husband went up in flames. I just wish I had something to . bury - but I donâ€™t think I will.â€™ He . had recently returned from the city of Hodeida on Yemenâ€™s west coast and . his car exploded after he left the hotel where he was staying. 'We tend to think that it was some kind of terrorist attack because he was well known,' a security source said. Officials blame a rise in violence in . southern Yemen on Al Qaeda-linked militants they say are taking . advantage of the countryâ€™s political turmoil. In April 2010 the British ambassador to Yemen narrowly escaped being killed when a car bomb hit his convoy in Sanaâ€™a. And last October a rocket-propelled grenade hit an embassy car in Sanaâ€™a, wounding three people, including a diplomat. Wreck: The burnt-out car was eventually loaded on to a truck and towed away . Unrest: A Yemeni protester holds a gun and shouts slogans demanding the ousting of the Yemeni president . Aden has been relatively quiet in . recent months, even as mass protests demanding the removal of President . Ali Abdullah Saleh drag into their sixth month, erupting into sporadic . bursts of violence. The neighbouring Abyan province has . been plunged into daily bloodshed since Islamist militants seized the . city of Jaar in March and the provincial capital of Zinjibar in May. The army, which says the militants . are part of al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing, launched an offensive to retake . Zinjibar five days ago but has yet to regain the city. A security belt was placed around . Aden in the hope of preventing more militants from . slipping in. Some 54,000 Abyan residents . have sought refuge in Aden. The United States and neighbouring . oil giant Saudi Arabia have grown increasingly worried about the turmoil . in the Arabian Peninsula state - the Arab world's poorest country. However, attacks on foreigners are . rare in Aden, which lies east of a strategic shipping lane that channels . some three million barrels of oil daily. The explosion of the surveyor's car shattered windows in nearby buildings on Aden's Mualla Plaza. 'He started the car and it immediately exploded and he was engulfed in flames,' a witness said. One passer-by was critically injured in the blast which also damaged nearby buildings, a municipal official said. 'It's clear that there was some kind of explosive device placed in his car,' she said. Riyadh and Washington, both targets . of foiled al Qaeda attacks from Yemen, fear rising instability provides . militants with room to operate. In a separate incident yesterday, an . opposition official from the leading Islamist party Islah survived an . attack by gunmen in the capital of Sana'a. The northern capital has witnessed . rising violence in recent days following weeks of relative calm after . Saleh left the country for treatment on injuries he surviving as . assassination attempt in his compound. Islah leader Mohammed al-Yadumi's car . had been fired on by gunmen on Monday but he fled the attack, Yemen's . opposition coalition said. The group blamed forces loyal to Saleh.

Joseph, Schwarzenegger's love child with former housekeeper Mildred Baena, was born just five days after Christopher in 1997. Still, the latest family crisis did not get in the way of Schwarzenegger filing his response to Shriver's divorce petition. In court documents lodged July 20 his lawyer, Bob Kaufman checked the box asking the judge to refuse Shriver spousal support. In her original filing, Shriver asked for spousal support in her petition. The papers also show that Schwarzenegger - like Shriver - is asking for joint custody of the couple's two minor children. Differences aside: The former couple are showing a united front for the sake of their son, pictured in 2006, despite their messy divorce . However, a new report from TMZ claims that The Terminator star never even read the court documents denying Maria spousal support, partially because he was dealing with his son's medical crisis, and partially because he was relying on his lawyer. He plans on filing revised, more respectful court documents, one that won't deny her alimony. Shriver is asking Schwarzenegger to pay for her attorney's fees, according to the papers. But Schwarzenegger's response asks that the judge make each party foot the bill for their respective lawyers. According . to U.S. reports, the couple did not enter into a prenuptial agreement a . the time of the marriage so under California law both parties are . entitled to a 50/50 split of all earnings and property accumulated . during their 25-year marriage.

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 4:48 AM on 23rd July 2011 . The father of the missing Missouri mother of triplets who has been missing since last month has claimed that her estranged husband 'threatened her for a year'. Stan Rawson, the father of 39-year-old Jacque Sue Waller, who was last seen on June 1, made explosive claims against his son-in-law saying he has no doubt he is responsible for her disappearance. Mrs Waller's husband James 'Clay Waller' is the only 'person of interest' named in the case and this week was accused of mocking search volunteers and obstructing the investigation. Explosive claims: Stan and Ruby Rawson said they have 'no doubt' that their son in law was involved in their daughter's disappearance . He was the last person to see his wife when she went to his home to pick up one of their children, Maddox, around 4pm. Her car was then found abandoned three miles from his home and her business cards found eight miles away from there just last week. In an interview with Fox news, Mr Rawson said: 'Heâ€™s not acting at all like someone whose wife came up missing. 'Theyâ€™ve got him. All they need is her body.' Mr Rawson said Waller, a former police officer, used their son Maddox to lure his wife to his home to kill her. Clay Waller told police that he had an argument with his wife after a divorce hearing earlier that day but that she walked away. He has denied any involvement in her disappearance and has accused police - who suspect foul play - of conducting a witch hunt against him. Mrs Waller's mother Ruby Rawson said it is like a 'nightmare that never ends'. Mr Rawson claims his wife kept a diary on her company computer that detailed the threats made by her husband. Jackson Police Chief James Humphreys told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that Mr Waller is 'not cooperating the way we hope he would'. He said authorities suspect foul play and believe it may have been a scene staged to look like an abduction. Speaking for the first time: James 'Clay' Waller said that he wants his estranged wife, who has been missing for seven weeks, to come home safely . Vanished: Jacque Sue Waller disappeared on June 1 shortly after visiting her husband at the home he was temporarily living in . Speaking for the first time since the . investigation began, Mr Waller said today that he just wanted for the mother . of his children to be found alive. â€˜I want her to come home alive,â€™ he said. â€˜I just miss my wife and my kidsâ€¦ weâ€™re just trying to fight to see them.â€™ Authorities have blocked Mr Waller from seeing his five-year-old triplets since Mrs Waller went missing. â€˜I can't change how people feel. I . mean there's a lot of emotions that are running high right now with . this...We're all just sad, just sad on both sides of the fence here,â€™ Mr . Waller told ABC News. Mr Wallerâ€™s lawyer denied the . accusations about his client. â€˜He has cooperated,â€™ Scott Douglas . Reynolds told the Huffington Post. Accused: Waller has not joined in on efforts to find Jacque, one neighbour alleges . Missing: Jacque Waller disappeared seven weeks ago . Jacque Sue Waller was reported . missing June 1 shortly after visiting with her husband at a home in . Jackson, Missouri, where he was temporarily living during the couple's . divorce proceedings. Mrs . Waller, who has five-year-old triplets, had just attended a divorce . hearing when she drove to her husband's home at around 4:00pm to pick up . her son, Maddox. But the child was not at the home when Mrs Waller arrived and family members say they believe her husband, a former police officer, lured her to the home to kill her. Police found Jacque Waller's blue . Honda Pilot abandoned along Interstate 55 in Missouri the morning after . she was reported missing. Her purse, keys and cellphone were not found inside the vehicle. Officers said there has been no activity on her credit cards and phone since her disappearance. Mrs Waller's parents have encouraged rumours that blood was found in the house where Mr Waller was staying. Her father Stan Rawson said reports of blood are true. Claims: James 'Clay' Waller claims he's being falsely accused over his wife's disappearance . Blocked: Authorities have stopped Mr Waller from having contact with his three children . 'I've seen it' he said. 'But that's all I'm going to confirm. There's a ton of evidence... Just suffice to say there is blood evidence. I saw the evidence bags.' Last . week, a woman reported finding Mrs Waller's Blue Cross Blue Shield business . cards along another state highway about eight miles from where her car . was recovered. Mrs Waller worked as a manager for the health insurance company. Mr . Humphreys said on Tuesday that police searched the home where Clay . Waller was temporarily living within 72 hours of the investigation. He said detectives also uncovered . valuable information from the woman's computer that he described only as . 'personal diary type' in nature. Laura . Helbig, a family friend and volunteer, told Fox News on Wednesday that . Mr Waller hasn't participated in the hunt for his wife and said he's . been seen mocking volunteers out on searches. Miss Helbig said Waller would 'blow kisses, laugh, and flip us off' when driving by in his car during searches for Mrs Waller. 'I don't think this is the face or demeanour of a man who thinks his beloved wife needs to be found,' Miss Helbig said.

Friends have defended the millionaire whose girlfriend was found hanging naked and bound from a balcony of his historic California mansion, as he continues to remain silent over her death. Pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai has made no public statement about his girlfriend, Rebecca Nalepa, who died two days after his six-year-old son, Max, was fatally injured when he fell down the stairs. He told investigators he was by the little boy's side in hospital when she died, but now police have revealed they are examining CCTV footage to confirm his story. Staying quiet: Jonah Shacknai, 54, has made no public comment about the death of his girlfriend, Rebecca Nalepa, who was found hanging naked at his mansion . At least 15 detectives continue to investigate the 'very bizarre' death of Miss Nalepa, who was found hanging naked from a second-floor balcony, her . hands and feet bound with orange electrical cord, on July 13. The following Sunday Max Shacknai died . at a San Diego children's hospital, almost a week after he tumbled down . the mansion's stairs while . Miss Nalepa was looking after him. Tempestuous relationship: Dina Shacknai accused her ex-husband of physical and verbal abuse . The 32-year-old was buried in a private ceremony on Saturday. Police do not expect to have toxicology results from her autopsy for several weeks. She was found by Mr Shacknai's brother, Adam, who was staying in the mansion's guesthouse to offer support after Max's accident. The millionaire has told investigators he was holding a desperate vigil by his son's bedside at the time of Miss Nalepa's death, but now police have revealed they intend to examine surveillance footage from Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. A police source told Radar Online: 'Investigators want to confirm details of what Jonah, Adam, and Dina . [Jonah's second wife, and Max's mother], have revealed to them. 'Jonah . maintains that he was at the hospital when Rebecca's body was found. This is a very fluid investigation.' Mr Shacknai, 54, issued an emotional statement after Max died, but has made no public comment about Miss Nalepa's death. He is said to be 'in seclusion' in . Arizona, where his $700m-a-year cosmetics firm is based, while police . continue to search his luxury mansion in the affluent San Diego suburb . of Coronado. Tragic death: Max Shacknai died in a San Diego hospital days after tumbling down the stairs at his father's 27-room mansion while in Miss Nalepa's care . Denise D. Resnik, who has known Mr Shacknai for more than ten years after working with him at an autism charity, told the Los Angeles Times: 'He's a good friend. He's dedicated to his family. It's tragic from every dimension.' Friends are seeking to play down the image of Mr Shacknai as a poor husband and ruthless businessman which has emerged over the last two weeks, particularly after Arizona police revealed he had a violent and stormy relationship with his ex-wife, Max's mother Dina Romano. During his divorce from his first wife, Kimberley James, a psychologist said he was defensive and could have some unresolved anger problems. But he added: 'It was quite apparent to me that his children are most important to him and he loves them dearly.' Marriage plans: Pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai reportedly told friends he 'wanted to spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa . Before their marriage descended into vicious rows, he and Ms Romano couple were admired and respected within the community of Scottsdale, Arizona, for their charity work with special needs children. Mary Clark, executive director of the project, said: 'They're both so passionate about children and just very loving people.' A source told Radar that Mr Shacknai . has been interviewed 'extensively and exhaustively by law enforcement, . about Max's death, and Rebecca's. 'Jonah has been extremely cooperative with authorities.' They . have not ruled whether Miss Nalepa's bizarre hanging was homicide or . suicide, nor have they formally linked her death to Max's accident. Tragic home: The historic 27-room Spreckels mansion in Coronado, an affluent suburb of San Diego, where Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend was found hanging naked . Appalling accident: Max Shacknai fell down these stairs and later died in hospital. Police are now reviewing CCTV footage at the children's facility in San Diego . Her sister, Mary Zahau-Loehner, has vehemently denied that her sister would have killed herself out of grief for the little boy. Miss Nalepa had given up her job as an ophthalmic technician last year to devote herself to Mr Shacknai and his children. She had also been married before, and in May she reverted to her maiden name of Zahou. Despite his two divorces, friends said he as determined to start again and spend 'the rest of his life' with Miss Nalepa. Sources . said: 'It was a very serious relationship. There was a lot of love . there. Jonah had every intention of proposing to Rebecca.'","Police reveal they will examine hospital CCTV footage to check Mr Shacknai's story for night girlfriend died .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:20 PM on 25th July 2011 . Tough decisions: George Osborne admitted that his plans to revive the economy have not made him popular . Chancellor George Osborne insisted his tough deficit reduction plan has been 'vindicated' despite fears that official figures due to be published on Tuesday will show a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Britain has been turned into a 'safe harbour from the storm' he claimed at a London press conference ahead of their publication. The Chancellor admitted the 'very difficult decisions' he has taken over the last year to revive the economy had not made him 'popular politically'. But low interest rates and the UK's credit status meant they were 'justified', he added. 'That has provided the stability that the British economy needs in a very, very unstable global environment.' The Office for National Statistics will tomorrow publish figures on the economy over the three months to June. Previous forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth in GDP were predicted by city economists to drop to 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent. The figure is subject to revision, but a poor reading would heap more pressure on Mr Osborne to come up with an alternative strategy to the Government's deficit reduction plan. Asked if his tough economic policy, along with his involvement in the decision to hire Andy Coulson as Downing Street communications director, made him a 'reckless Chancellor', Mr Osborne replied: 'I think I am taking the right decisions that anyone in my position would have to take. 'I came into this job with Britain facing the largest budget deficit in the G20. There is no way you could massage those figures. 'We have just come out of the worst banking crisis, probably in British history, and we have had the deepest recession since the 1930s. 'We took a series of decisions early on to tackle the budget deficit and to have a credible plan in place. 'If you want evidence of why that was the right thing to do, look at the last couple of weeks. 'There are many European countries that in the last couple of weeks faced enormous instability because of question marks over their ability to pay their debts and deal with their budget deficits. 'But the UK, with a higher budget deficit than those countries, has not had that question mark over it. 'Indeed, our borrowing costs have come down. I think that is a vindication of the decisions we took. We turned Britain into a safe harbour from the storm. That has not been easy.' Spanish visitors: David Cameron made his remarks at a press conference with Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zaptero (left), which was also attended by footballer Cesc Fabregas . Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron today poured cold water on hopes that tax cuts or a fresh round of money-printing may be deployed to stimulate the economy, . Business Secretary Vince Cable has suggested that the Bank of England could stimulate a sluggish economy with a further injection of money through so-called 'quantitative easing', while Chancellor George Osborne has hinted that he would like to cut taxes on business. But Mr Cameron insisted that there was no leeway for either fiscal stimulus through tax cuts or public spending increases, or monetary stimulus in the form of the Bank reducing interest rates or printing money. 'There's no country, really, that can afford another fiscal stimulus. They've all run out of money,' he said. 'There isn't some great monetary stimulus you can give when interest rates are as low as they are. 'The right step for an economy like ours is to get on top of your debt and your deficit and then make it a better place for businesses to grow and expand and employ people.' Speaking at a 10 Downing Street press conference with his Spanish counterpart Jose Luis Zapatero, Mr Cameron acknowledged that 'our path back to growth is a difficult one and has already been a difficult one'. But he insisted: 'I'm confident we are taking the right steps to get on top of our debts and our deficit, to take Britain out of the danger zone in Europe, to get our economy moving.'","Economists predict GDP will show just a 0.1 per cent rise .

Testimony: Ms Diallo told ABC News's Robin Roberts she had made 'mistakes', but that shouldn't stop prosecutors from going ahead . The hotel maid who claims she was sexually assaulted in a New York hotel room by former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn has admitted she has lied about being assaulted in the past. Breaking her silence for the first time, Nafissatou Diallo said she made a 'mistake' when lying about an alleged gang-rape in her home country Guinea to gain asylum to the U.S. - but insisted that didn't mean she wasn't attacked by Strauss-Kahn. 'I have made a mistake,' she said. 'But that doesn't mean this man didn't try to rape me. He tried to rape me.' The maid claims she had no idea who Strauss-Kahn was, and that when she realised he was tipped to be the next French president she was convinced 'they're going to kill me so no-one knows'. The 32-year-old alleges Strauss-Kahn appeared naked in front of her when she opened the door to his suite and he started to act like 'a crazy man',Â  grabbing her breasts and then forcing her to perform a sex act on him. She told Newsweek she has chosen to waive her right to anonymity so that people know the truth about what happened in Strauss-Kahn's luxury suite on May 14, but his lawyers claim she is running a 'media campaign' to convince prosecutors her version of events is true. She has come forward just a week . before a crucial hearing in which prosecutors will reveal whether they . will drop the charges or continue with the case after weeks of . deliberation. The case . appeared to teeter on the verge of collapse on July 1, when the . assistant district attorney admitted there were 'serious credibility . issues' with Ms Diallo, who is said to have lied to prosecutors and on . asylum application forms in the past. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers claim she has gone public in a last-ditch attempt to convince prosecutors she is telling the truth, but she says she simply wants justice. Ms Diallo, who is known as 'Nafi', told ABC News : 'I never want to be in public but I have no choice. Now, I have to be in public. I have to, for myself. I have to tell the truth.' 'I want justice. I want him to go to jail,' she said in the interview on Sunday. 'I want him to know that there is some places you cannot use your money, you cannot use your power when you do something like this.' She said that she hopes God punishes the man, who had been tipped as the next French president. 'We are poor, but we are good,' she said. 'I don't think about money.' Scroll down for video . Accused: Ms Diallo said that she wants former IMF boss Strauss-Kahn to be sent to jail . The hotel maid said that she did not . know her alleged attacker's high profile until she watched the morning . news the day after the incident. 'I . watched Channel 7 and they say this is [the] guy, I donâ€™t know, and he . is going to be the next president of France. And I think they are going . to kill me,' she told Newsweek. Ms Diallo said that she is angry at . claims published in The New York Post that she was working as at least a . part-time prostitute. 'Because of him they call me a prostitute,' said Ms Diallo, who is currently suing the newspaper. The interviews with Newsweek and ABC . News mark the first time the 32-year-old Guinean immigrant has been . publicly identified since she shocked the world with allegations that . Strauss-Kahn emerged naked from the bathroom of his luxury suite at the Sofitel hotel on May . 14 and forced her to perform oral sex. Manhattan District Attorneys are . currently considering whether drop the sexual assault charges against . Strauss-Kahn amid concerns about the hotel maid's credibility. Ms Diallo admitted that she had made 'mistakes' but said that should not stop prosecutors from going forward. 'God is my witness I'm telling the truth. From my heart. God knows that. And he knows that,' she told ABC News. Speaking about the alleged assault, . she said she saw Strauss-Kahn appear naked in front of her when she . opened the door to his suite. He was like 'a crazy man to me,' she said. Emotional: The hotel maid breaks down as she explains why she has decided to come forward . She said: 'I was like, I'm so sorry, I turned my head, he come to me and grabbed my breasts, ""no you don't have to be sorry"".' 'You're beautiful,' she reported Strauss-Kahn as saying, and said he attacked her despite her protestations. 'I said, ""Sir, stop this. I don't want to lose my job"". He said, ""You're not going to lose your job"",' Ms Diallo said. 'I push him. I get up. I wanted to . scare him. I said, ""Look, there is my supervisor right there"",' she told Newsweek. But Strauss-Kahn said no-one was there to hear. She . told ABC: 'I was like stop, stop, stop this, but he keep pushing me, . pushing me to the hallway, keep pushing me back to the hallway, I was so . afraid, I was so scared.' Ms Diallo alleges he went on to pull up her uniform dress, tear down her . pantyhose, grab her indecently, then grip her head and force her to . perform a sex act on him. Strauss-Kahn, 62, has repeatedly denied all the charges against him. In a statement on Sunday, his lawyers called the interview a last-ditch effort by the maid and her lawyers to extract money from him. She is 'the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges against a person from whom she wants money,' lawyers Benjamin Brafman and William Taylor said. 'Her lawyers and public relations . consultants have orchestrated an unprecedented number of media events . and rallies to bring pressure on the prosecutors in this case after she . had to admit her extraordinary efforts to mislead them.' Ms Diallo's lawyers responded, saying Strauss-Kahn's lawyers 'have conducted an . unprecedented smear campaign against the victim of a violent sexual . attack'. Violent: Nafissatou Diallo describes how she alleges Strauss-Kahn grabbed her as he started to act like 'a crazy man' Shocking: Nafissatou Diallo claims Strauss-Kahn appeared naked in front of her and demonstrates how she says he groped her breasts . Her attorney Kenneth Thompson noted that the defence team have said whatever happened in the suite was . not forced. 'We are dealing with a brutal sexual . attack, a mountain of physical evidence, a victim who spoke out . immediately, and numerous corroborating witnesses,' Mr Thompson said. The lawyer told MailOnline she had not been paid for either interview, and had received 'not one dime, not one penny'. It has not yet been determined whether she will speak out further. He said his client had made the decision to come forward herself to clear her name, after the New York Post accused her of being a prostitute. A spokesman for ABC said there were no restrictions on the interview, and when asked whether a licensing fee was paid to secure it told Media Bistro: 'Absolutely not'. The interview comes after Ms Diallo's overall credibility was thrown into question when Manhattan prosecutors revealed that she had told authorities numerous lies, including fabricating a story about being gang-raped in Guinea in order to gain U.S. asylum. She also changed details of her story about what happened following the purported assault. Ms Diallo, who has been kept in hiding with her 15-year-old daughter for weeks since the allegations, said that she wants to return to work in hotel, but would prefer to go to the laundry where she would not have to meet guests rather than continue as a maid.","Hotel maid waives her right to anonymity and says she hopes God punishes the former IMF boss who she accuses of sexual assault .

He has been accused ofÂ  three separate murders and conspiracy to flood the UK with cocaine, but each time Arran Coghlan has been cleared or the charges have been dropped. Now he has walked free again after a case of assaulting two police officers collapsed. Coghlan, 39, who insists he is a law-abiding businessman, was accused of causing actual bodily harm to two officers in Manchester. One suffered a broken noseÂ  and the other needed stitches to his lip after a confrontation in a back street. Coghlan said he thought he was being attacked by two men in dark clothing and hit them in self-defence. He said: â€˜I was approached on a dark back street by two men in dark clothing. They didnâ€™t identify themselves as police and I had no idea who they were. 'I turned around and one was behind me. Considering this as an attack strategy, I hit the guy. The other guy then came in and they both got knocked to the floor. I was acting in self-defence and I would do the same again tomorrow. The greatest crime is the inaction of a capable man.â€™ Coghlan was alleged to have attacked the officers as they were investigating burglaries outside high-rise flats in Stockport,Â  Greater Manchester. But the charges were dropped when the Crown Prosecution Service told Liverpool Crown Court that it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the matter. The judge ordered two not guilty verdictsÂ  to be recorded. Coghlan, who drives a Bentley Turbo, lives in a mansion in leafy Alderley Edge, Cheshire, where he rubs shoulders with Premier League footballers and soap stars. He has always denied allegations he is the godfather to a vast criminal empire and claims he runs a legitimate enterprise offering consultancy services to businesses. The nickname â€˜Teflon Donâ€™ was first given to American mobster John Gotti, after frustrated FBI agents failed to get any of their charges to â€˜stickâ€™. Coghlan says he has been victimised by detectives in a decade-long campaign to put him behind bars. Coghlan was arrested in September last year by officers for the Serious Organised Crime Agency as he stepped off a flight from Amsterdam at Manchester airport. It was alleged he and others were heading a multi-million-pound drug-smuggling ring and he was theÂ  mastermind behind a plot to flood the UK with cocaine. But after spending nine months in prison on remand, charges were dropped at Liverpool Crown Court for lack of evidence. As he was freed last month,Â  Coghlan â€“ who survived an attempt on his life in a Stockport bar on New Yearâ€™s Day 2009 â€“ rubbed his hands, laughed and told the judge: â€˜Iâ€™ve booked a two-week cruise.â€™ Commenting on the dropping of the assault charges, a CPS spokesman said the decision took into account the â€˜significant amount of timeâ€™ Coghlan had spent on remand.","Arran Coghlan, 39, was cleared of assaulting two policemen who were investigating a burglary .

Taiwanese officials said they sent two fighter planes to intercept Sukhoi-27 jets after the Chinese aircraft breached its airspace for first time in 12 years. The Chinese Sukhoi-27s had reportedly crossed a boundary to pursue a U.S. spy plane sent on a surveillance flight over China. Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it sent two aircraft to intercept the Chinese jets, which had briefly crossed a line in the centre of the Tiawan Strait considered an unofficial air boundary between the two states. Accident: The Chinese Sukhoi-27s had strayed into Taiwanese airspace for the first time since 1999 . The Taiwanese United Daily News had reported that the incident - described as an 'accident' by Taiwanese officials - saw the Chinese jets in pursuit of a U.S. U-2 reconnaissance plane. However, both the Taiwanese Defence ministry and the Pentagon declined to confirm the report. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked about the June 29 incident and said the U.S. would maintain flying in international airspace. Mr Mullen said in Washington: 'The Chinese would see us move out of there. ... We're not going to do that, from my perspective. These reconnaissance flights are important. 'We won't be deterred from flying in international airspace.' Mr Mullen's spokesperson later said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not have specific knowledge of the reported incursion and was only speaking generally about the U.S. right to conduct surveillance flights in international airspace in the region. The Pentagon did not immediately confirm or deny details about the incident. Chinese jets regularly attempt to intercept U.S. reconnaissance aircraft to show they are aware of the U.S. presence. Undeterred: U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the U.S. would maintain its surveillance missions in international airspace . In 2001, when a US Navy surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet trying to intercept it over the South China Sea. The US aircraft made an emergency landing on a Chinese island and its crew were briefly detained. Mr Mullen added: 'These are lives that are at stake up there, in addition to creating an incident ... that escalates the tension over there and could put countries in a position to miscalculate.' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will announce on Oct 1 whether the United States will answer a call from Taiwan for more F-16 fighter jets. Taiwan is also still waiting for an upgrade to its existing US-made F-16 fighter jets, six new cargo aircraft and an overhaul to a fleet of Lafayette frigates.",Chinese jets strayed into airspace in pursuit of U.S. surveillance plane .

A former hospital worker is facing jail after embezzling $1.5m from his employer by ordering, stealing and reselling printer toner. Marque Gumbs ordered the office supplies while working at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, but sold the toner on to help fund his luxury lifestyle. The receiving clerk would order unneeded printer toner on the hospital's bill before meeting the supplier on the street, reselling the product and pocketing the cash. Profit: Gumbs ordered printer toner cartridges for the hospital and sold them on himself to fund his luxury lifestyle . While carrying out the scheme, Gumbs, 33, bought a 2011 BMW, a diamond-encrusted Rolex watch and Vuitton bags. He also lived in a luxury Â£2,250-a-month condo in New York's Trump Tower while carrying out the elaborate three-year scam and regularly took holidays to Las Vegas and the Caribbean. Prosecutors said Gumbs ordered over $1.5m of printer toner between September 2007 and August 2010 while employed as a low-level receiving clerk. Ill-gotten gains: Gumbs used the toner profits to rent a luxury condo in New York's Trump Tower . He carried out the scam while earning just $37,800-a-year at the hospital, and would often order toner cartridges which didn't even work on the hospital campus machines. Gumbs faces up to seven-and-a-half years jail after admitting grand larceny yesterday at Manhattan Supreme Court. The former hospital worker had worked at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since 1999, but was fired in November after his arrest. The court heard Gumbs had password-protected access to a computer at the hospital used to order supplies from Office Depot. After . ordering the toner, Gumbs would instruct suppliers to meet him in the . street for delivery before the items reached the normal receiving area. Gumbs . pleaded guilty and accepted a likely jail term of between . two-and-a-half and seven-and-a-half years rather than go to trial and . face a possible 25-year sentence.

Real-life 'Dumb and Dumber' Jeffrey Olson, 22, and Ryan Letchford, 21,  had been at a party on Friday night when they spotted the empty patrol vehicle. The pair decided to climb inside and began to play with the equipment and take pictures of each other pretending to be arrested. Dumb and Dumber: Jeffrey Olson, 22, and Ryan Letchford, 21, were arrested after breaking into a police van, the authorities said . But disaster struck for the pair when they really did end up in handcuffs when they became locked inside. Police arrived at the vehicle in South Jersey, Philadelphia, in the early hours of the morning and arrested the criminals. The two men were charged with attempted theft of a motor vehicle, public drunkenness and criminal mischief, police said. 'It was un-freaking-believable,' Constable Mike Connor, whose van the men are said to have burgled, told the Philadelphia Inquirer. The pair hatched the bizarre plan after getting drunk at a nearby party at a condominium in Radnor. It is understood that a door of the vehicle had been left unlocked and the men entered through that. Once inside the police vehicle they began smoking cigarettes and there was also evidence that they had spat on the ground. They also used their cameras to take pictures of each other pretending that they were being arrested. Letchford and Olson soon realised they were stuck inside and tried to kick through the metal cage that separates the rear of the vehicle from the driver's compartment, police said. A friend who became worried when the pair did not return to the party wondered outside and noticed the pair were inside the van. He wasn't able to open the door, which is understood to have had an automatic locking mechanism, called police at 3:57 a.m. Connor was woken up by the authorities and he attended his van , promptly arresting the two men inside. Police said that inside the van officers found cigarette butts and 'a large amount of saliva'.",Ryan Letchford and Jeffrey Olson took pictures of each other pretending to get arrested .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:00 PM on 22nd July 2011 . One in nine British adults have no qualifications, an analysis of official figures suggests. A new study has revealed wide differences in the educational achievements of adults across the country. In some areas, as many as a third of 16 to 64-year-olds lack any qualifications, while in others the proportion is as low as two per cent. Differences: The figures were said to highlight Britain's educational divide of 'haves and have-nots' The University and College Union (UCU), which conducted the analysis, warned the figures show that Britain is divided into 'the haves and the have nots'. Brent North, London 1.9% . Romsey and So'ton North, Hampshire 2.3% . Wimbledon, London 2.6% . Winchester, Hampshire 2.6% . Leeds North West 2.7% . Cambridge 2.8% . Mole Valley, Surrey 2.8% . Buckingham, Buckinghamshire 3.1% . Macclesfield, Cheshire 3.1% . Hitchin and Harpenden, Hertfordshire 3.3% . The study is based on an analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showing the proportions of adults of working age (16-64) with no qualifications in 2010. The findings show that 11.3% of British adults do not have any qualifications. In England, this figure is 11.1%, in Wales it is 13.3% and in Scotland 12.3%. UCU analysed the qualification rates for 632 parliamentary constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales. It found that in constituencies such as Glasgow North East and Birmingham Hodge Hill more than a third of adults of working age have no qualifications (35.3% and 33.3% respectively). At the other end of the scale, just 1.9% of adults in Brent North lack any qualifications, while in Romsey and Southampton North the figure is 2.3%. The union said that further analysis of 21 cities and their surrounding areas highlighted examples of 'haves and have nots' living side by side. Unqualified: The constituency of Glasgow North East had more than a third of adults without any qualifications . Blackspot: The Birmingham constituency of Hodge Hill also had a third of adults without a qualification . Glasgow North East 35.3% . Birmingham, Hodge Hill 33.3% . Bradford West 29.0% . Glasgow East 29.0% . Derby South 26.1% . Liverpool, Walton 24.6% . Birmingham, Ladywood 24.5% . Glasgow South West 23.9% . Motherwell and Wishaw, Lanarkshire 23.8% . Birmingham, Hall Green 23.7% . West Bromwich East, Staffordshire 23.7% . As an example, those living in the constituency of Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central are nearly twice as likely to have no qualifications (17%) than those in nearby Newcastle-upon-Tyne North (9.7%), the union claimed. And in Bristol East, 13.2% have no qualifications, compared with 6.7% in Bristol West. UCU said that people in areas with the lowest levels of qualifications were likely to suffer most from Government policies which the union says will restrict access to education. These include the Government's plans to . triple tuition fees, and scrapping the education maintenance allowance . (EMA) - a grant handed to the poorest teenagers to help them stay in . education. More qualified: In Brent North, just 1.9 per cent of adults lacked any qualifications . Other end of the scale: Southampton North also has more positive figures, with just 2.3 per cent of adults without qualifications . UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: 'We have two Britains divided between the educational haves and have nots and we have cities and counties where people with access to education are living alongside those with far fewer opportunities.' She added: 'Education is central to our country's future, yet in some places thousands of people still have no qualifications. 'There is a real danger that children growing up in certain areas will have their ambition blunted and never realise their full potential.'","Only 1.9% of the working-age population has no qualifications in Brent North, London ."

An American diving instructor, who had also worked with the U.S. Navy, has been found dead after exploring the USS New York in the Pacific Ocean. Steve Brittain, a dive master who worked at Johan Dive Shop in Subic Bay in the Philippines, died - along with a Hong Kong tourist - when surveying the World War II wreak. Police recovered the body of the American today after the two divers went missing yesterday evening, and the tourist's body was found, inside USS New York, last night, according to police officer Jose Llaves. The body of U.S. diver Steve Brittain is found and rushed to shore, but he was declared dead shortly afterwards . Mr Brittain, a diver who worked at Johan Dive Shop in Subic Bay in the Philippines, died - along with a Hong Kong tourist - while on a ship wreak . Mr Brittain, who was believed to have settled in the Philippines and started a family there, took tourists Tin Shun-chuen and Chow Fung-lung diving at the popular wreck on Sunday, but only Mr Chow emerged from the expedition. He told police he lost track of Mr Brittain and Mr Tin because of poor visibility as they swam through the wreck, forcing him to surface. Nino Palmiano, a staff member for the Boardwalk Dive Shop in Subic whose dive masters took part in the search and rescue effort, said that Mr Brittain was a popular and experienced diving instructor in the area. Divers search an area following the reported disappearance of the two divers in Subic Bay of Zambales province, northwest of Manila, Philippines . Rescuers prepare to search for the American diving instructor and the Hong Kong tourist who failed to surface after exploring the World War II shipwreck . 'I know that he was previously with the U.S. Navy,' Mr Palmiano said. According to the Johan's Beach and Dive Resort website, the dive centre, established by Johan De Sadeleir, reads: 'Johan offers Novice, Recreational, Wreck, Nitrox, Deep and Trimix diving. '[We also offer] instruction with PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors), ANDI (American Nitrox Divers International), CMAS diver(Wold underwater Federation). 'We are [also] PCSSD (Philippine Commission of Sport Scuba Divers) accredited [and a] member Subic Bay dive association.' The relatives of Steve Brittain weep after his body was pulled out of the water . The website continues: 'We dive 30 wrecks and coral sites with our four fast speed boats leaving in front of the resort at least twice a day. 'Wreck sites include World War II wrecks, battle ships, cargo ships, patrol boats, landing ships, antique steam ships, submarines and airplanes. 'Three full time instructors with combined over 45 years of dive instruction worldwide teach in English, French, German, Dutch (Nederlands) and Tagalog.' Romeo Renojo, maritime security chief at the Subic Bay Freeport, said an investigation is under way. He said he has recommended a suspension of dives at the USS New York, one of about eight U.S. and Japanese World War II shipwrecks in Subic Bay. The USS New York was scuttled in 27 metres (90 feet) of water by U.S. forces based at the then U.S. naval base ahead of the Japanese World War II invasion, according to local dive shops. The wreck is home to colourful sea creatures such as barracuda, lionfish, groupers, lobsters, octopus, and rays, according to local divers.",A Hong Kong tourist was also found dead .
