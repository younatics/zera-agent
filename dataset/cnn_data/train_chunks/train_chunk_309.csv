"(CNN) -- Marion Bartoli has retired from tennis with immediate effect, just six weeks after winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon. The Frenchwoman, who beat Germany's Sabine Lisicki to be crowned champion at the All England Club, broke down in tears as she told reporters her body could no longer handle the strain of competing at the top level. The announcement came following the world No. 7's 3-6 6-4 6-1 defeat to Romania's Simona Halep in the second round of the Western and Southern Open. ""This was actually the last match of my career. Sorry,"" the 28-year-old said during an emotional press conference in Cincinnati. ""My body just can't do it anymore. I've already been through a lot of injuries since the beginning of the year. ""I've been on the tour for so long, and I really pushed through and left it all during that Wimbledon. I really felt I gave all the energy I have left in my body. ""I made my dream a reality and it will stay with me forever, but now my body just can't cope with everything. I have pain everywhere after 45 minutes or an hour of play. I've been doing this for so long, and body-wise I just can't do it anymore."" Bartoli had not planned on calling time on her career prior to the match, but she knew once the contest had finished that it was time to hang up her racket. ""You never know before the match that it's going to be your last match,"" she explained, ""but I just felt that way after the match. ""I felt I just couldn't do this anymore. After one set, my whole body was just in pain. ""It's been a tough decision to make. I didn't make this decision easily. I've been a tennis player for a long time, and I had the chance to make my biggest dream a reality. I felt I really, really pushed through the ultimate limits to make it happen. ""But now I just can't do it anymore."" Bartoli turned pro in 2000 and, after battling for 13 years to win one of tennis' four grand slams, she now feels the time has earned the right to focus on other areas of her life. ""As a tennis player you had to be at 100%,"" she added. ""I'm the kind of person, when I'm doing something, I'm doing it 100%. I have to be on the practice court preparing for the next tournament tomorrow. ""There are so many things to do in life rather than playing tennis, so I'm sure I'll find something. I just need a bit of time to settle down. ""There is a lot of excitement as a woman. There is a lot of excitement as a wife. There is a lot of excitement as a mother. There is a lot of excitement to come up."" Bartoli was taught tennis as a child by her father Walter, a doctor who coached her for most of her playing days until they split earlier this year and she began working with former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo. ""I called him, yes. But my dad knows me enough to know it a bit when he saw me leaving home for the States,"" Bartoli said. ""He kind of felt I was tired and I was exhausted, and he was not surprised by the decision. ""He said, 'I kind of felt it somehow. I can see it in your eyes and see your body and I know all the work you've done to make it happen. I'm so proud of you. I will support you in anything you're doing.' "" Bartoli first came to prominence when she reached the 2007 Wimbledon final, losing to Venus Williams. An unorthodox player with a distinctive serving style, she earned more than $11 million on the court -- $2.87 million of that this year -- with eight WTA Tour titles. ""I congratulate Marion on her long, successful career,"" said WTA Tour chief Stacey Allaster. ""She is an inspirational champion and a great ambassador for women's tennis that has dedicated her life to the sport and given so much back to the game."" Courtney Nguyen, a tennis writer with SI.com, said the timing of Bartoli's decision has stunned everyone. ""It is quite shocking, even before this tournament she had been making plans to play in exhibitions in Australia in January, she had been talking about still being motivated and wanting to achieve more goals in tennis,"" Nguyen told CNN. ""I think a lot of people are either second guessing her decision or just saying 'You know what, Marion Bartoli played her tennis career on her own terms, in her own way, this is exactly the way Marion Bartoli would go out.' "" Goran Ivanisevic, who was unable to defend his Wimbledon title in 2002 due to injury, said Bartoli might regret her decision when next year's tournament starts in late June. ""There is nothing like playing at Wimbledon as 'Wimbledon champion.' I couldn't defend."" the Croatian told the website of the senior players' Champions Tour. Guy Forget, who was Bartoli's captain in France's 2004 Fed Cup team, said she may have made a hasty decision. ""Marion is a very smart girl, she is so dedicated about the sport that I'm always very cautious about someone's quote right after a defeat, and that happened right after she lost,"" the former world No. 4 told the Champions Tour website. ""I hope she is going to change her mind. You don't want to have regrets looking back. Being a professional player is such an exceptional job and you don't want to look back in a few months or years later and think, 'Why did I stop?' ""Go to the beach for a few days, go running in the park, just get your head together, spend some time with your friends. And, if you don't want to play the next week, just don't play it -- if you want to miss the U.S. Open, fine. ""But just don't quit, don't take such a radical decision only a few weeks after winning the biggest tournament in the world.""","Marion Bartoli retires from tennis with immediate effect .

"(CNN) -- We've all been there before. Your head hits the pillow after a long day's work, your consciousness pleasantly fading away as the sweet promise of sleep draws closer ... Then it hits you -- an idea for a game-changing invention that will make you a millionaire overnight. Come the following morning however, and the prospect of turning that once-in-a-lifetime idea into a reality seems so implausible that you swiftly forget about the whole thing and carry on with your day. But it needn't be like this. With a bit of careful planning and a dollop of determination, your somnolent stroke of genius could be on the shelves before you know it. CNN spoke to some industry experts to get you on your way. So, should I patent my idea immediately? It depends who you ask. Jay Short, a client adviser from Innovate Design -- a firm that helps inventors get their products into the marketplace -- reckons it's the first thing you should do as soon as you've emerged from your shed. ""Get a skilled intellectual property (IP) professional involved as early as possible,"" he suggests. ""You need to have formalized protection in place before coming close to the market, because there's always a risk that a more nimble operator could rush out a copy of your idea and gain a first-mover advantage."" However, serial inventor Mike Bucci, author of ""An Entrepreneur's Guide to Turning your Idea into your Future,"" argues against over-zealous patenting. ""Most inventors are very afraid that someone will steal their idea, but for the most part companies who knock-off products don't steal ideas, they steal successful merchandise. They let the market work out which inventions are successful and generally don't take the risk with things that haven't been tested."" However, Bucci warns that not rushing into a patent office too early shouldn't be mistaken for having a lax attitude to patents protection in general. ""Get a provisional patent application in fairly early and once you've established the commercial viability of your product, then it's time to seriously secure your IP,"" he says. But how do I know if my product is commercially viable? Well, this is -- quite literally if you're lucky -- the $1 million question. Short recommends testing the water for demand by starting off with a ""small production run and selling through an online port such as your own website or on eBay."" Alan Ward, commercial director at Bang Creations -- a firm that provides product design and innovation expertise -- agrees. He observes that starting small allows you to develop a track record and prove demand to potential investors or large retailers without taking on too much risk. ""A little customer-base and solid feedback is a real sweetener when you're pitching your product,"" he says. In addition, Ward offers a quick, rudimentary formula for establishing a snapshot of your potential market. ""Study your competitors -- how many units are they shifting and to whom? Go online, look at user reviews for similar products -- get a flavor for the levels of enthusiasm around it,"" he suggests. ""Now, let's say you've identified roughly a million people in the country who are in your market, you should be able to identify a market specific, typical or good penetration level as a per cent. For board games for example, a top game could realistically expect to reach 1.5-2% of the target market."" Ward cautions that such market research is more of an art than a science, but is nonetheless crucial to establishing a rough idea of commercial viability. So, when do I ship my production to China? Not so fast! Short points out that although labor in China is generally much cheaper than in the West, those savings could well be offset by hefty transportation fees, especially as the cost of fuel continues to rise. Much also depends on the type of product you're making. ""If it's simple, has a low unit value and requires bulk -- like a new type of door nail -- then it might make sense to export production,"" he says. However, other types of goods -- particularly those with a more bespoke, high-end feel -- can benefit from local manufacturing. ""Apart from the fact that you're saving on transportation costs, it's just much simpler. You're in a better position to manage and respond quickly to problems when they inevitably arise,"" says Short. Ward also notes that some types of product are increasingly enjoying a ""marketing edge"" among conscientious consumers if they are known to be locally manufactured. It all sounds like a lot of hard work. Couldn't I get someone else to do it? Sure, you can license your invention to an established manufacturer or brand, but be prepared for a much smaller bite of the pie. ""A reasonable cut is in the region of 5%,"" says Ward. ""So if your product is on the shelves for $20 and selling to the retailer for $8 you're taking home 40 cents per product sold."" As such, Ward adds, to make a sizeable income you've either got to be selling in big volumes or at a high price point. This is starting to get complicated. Who can I turn to for advice? Bucci is a member of the United Inventors Association of America (UIA), which is itself composed of a multitude of state-level factions, each dedicated to providing support and advice to inventors. ""A lot of first-time inventors have the blinkers on when it comes to things like understanding price -- how much someone will be prepared to pay for their product, and therefore how much they need to manufacture in order to make a profit,"" says Bucci. ""Organizations like the UIA offer expertise based on years of experience and collective knowledge to help inventors get to grips with these issues in a very supportive way."" Ward, somewhat naturally, says that there are also a number of commercial organizations like his own who offer professional assistance in bringing products to market, but he is commendably frank about the risks associated with such services. ""It can be difficult to get an objective opinion from some commercial businesses because they inevitably have an angle,"" he admits. ""They can be very helpful if they genuinely put your needs first, but it is important to identify those that have a vested interest in pushing you to develop a product -- even if it is not likely to generate money."" Ward recommends that budding inventors solicit referrals from trusted sources, check who else the company has worked with and if they have links with other reputable non-commercial organizations, particularly government-sponsored bodies. Last but not least, the one thing all three men agree on is to do your research before spending a penny on anything. ""The best way to be successful as an inventor is always to educate yourself before taking action,"" concludes Bucci. ""I can't promise you'll get rich, but you'll certainly stand a much better chance of not going broke.""","Many of us have had at least one good idea for an invention, but rarely follow it through .

"(RS.com) -- Reclusive British chanteuse Kate Bush revealed on her website Friday that she'll perform live for the first time since 1979, booking a 15-date residency entitled ""Behind the Dawn"" at London's Eventim Apollo Hammersmith this August and September. Big Boi raves about Kate Bush's '50 Words for Snow' ""I am delighted to announce that we will be performing some live shows this coming August and September,"" wrote the singer. ""I hope you will be able to join us and I look forward to seeing you there. We'll keep you updated with further news on the website. Meanwhile, all details of concert dates and tickets are in the note below. Very best wishes, Kate."" Upon posting the tour dates, Bush's website crashed and her name instantly became a trending topic on Twitter, according to the Telegraph. Bush has released 10 albums since she began recording in the late '70s -- most recently 2011's ""50 Words for Snow"" -- but essentially retired from touring after a brief, six-week run in 1979 to support her debut album ""The Kick Inside."" That tour, as Billboard notes, concluded at the Apollo. Kate Bush: First new album in six years . There have been numerous reasons given to explain the singer's absence from the road, including physical exhaustion, a fear of flying and the death of 21-year-old lighting director Bill Duffield at the beginning of the tour. Duffield fell 20 feet to his death while inspecting a darkened venue for Bush, an event that almost caused the singer to cancel the tour. ""It was terrible for her,"" Brian Bath, who played guitar with Bush, told the Guardian. ""Kate knew everyone by name, right down to the cleaner, she was so like that, she'd speak to everyone. It's something you wouldn't forget, but we just carried through it."" In 2011, Bush told Mojo (via the Telegraph), ''I still don't give up hope completely that I'll be able to do some live work, but it's certainly not in the picture at the moment because I just don't quite know how that would work with how my life is now. Maybe I will do some shows some day. I'd like to think so before I get too ancient. I enjoy singing, but with the albums it's the whole process I find so interesting.

"(CNN) -- If it seems to you that there's a food safety crisis every other week, you're actually not paying close enough attention. Since the start of summer 2014 alone, the Food and Drug Administration has announced 37 different recalls, market alerts and safety withdrawals related to food, and the Food Safety and Inspection Service has issued 14. Some recalls result from mislabeling (such as undeclared ingredients like shellfish, milk, nuts, eggs or wheat gluten) or improper processing, while other recalled foods were contaminated with listeria, E. coli, salmonella or botulism. About 48 million people -- 1 in 6 Americans -- contract some form of food poisoning each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths that are, by the federal government's estimations, ""largely preventable."" At any given time the FDA is responsible for watching over some 167,000 domestic food facilities or farms and another 421,000 facilities or farms outside the United States, according to FDA officials. But there are only about 1,100 inspectors to oversee these facilities, officials told CNN in 2012. Tainted food and mislabeled food slip through the cracks all the time, and unwitting consumption can result in conditions ranging from stomach discomfort and fever to death from infection and allergic reactions. It's in a food producer's best interest to get a bad product off store shelves and alert consumers as swiftly as possible -- and it's the duty of the federal government to help minimize the risk to public safety. Often, their best course of collective action is a recall, but what does that actually mean? Who is looking out for your food safety? Prior to the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA could strongly suggest action, but had no authority to issue a mandatory recall of potentially harmful food. (For example, in the summer of 2010, consumers had to rely on suppliers' voluntary removal of nearly 500 million eggs from the marketplace in order to make sure that store supplies were free of salmonella. Still, an estimated 1,600 people nationwide were sickened by the eggs.) Since President Obama signed the law into effect in January 2011, there has only been one attempt by the FDA to enforce the mandatory recall of a food item: pet treats that were found to have been tainted with salmonella and allegedly caused several dogs to become ill. (In the end, the company was given a two-day notice to take corrective action -- which it did -- and enforcement wasn't needed.) But in the interim, hundreds of food items -- including 9 million pounds of adulterated meat, massive quantities of stone fruit and several dozen varieties of peanut butter -- have been voluntarily recalled by their producers. There are a few ways that can be set in motion. A producer may, through its own internal product testing or customer reports, find that there is an issue with its food and alert the FDA or FSIS. In other cases, testing by these agencies' inspectors may reveal an issue, which is communicated to the company. And in others, local and state health services will contact the CDC, which can identify patterns of foodborne illness using the FoodCORE system and in turn alert the FDA and FSIS. Foodborne Illness 101 . If the product is meat, poultry or egg-based, FSIS can form a committee to determine if a recall is needed. If so, agents collaborate with producers to make sure that the product is no longer available to the public, and that consumers have received adequate warning via the media and the FSIS website about what products are affected and what course of action to take. If a risk is posed, but a recall is not needed, FSIS will issue a public health alert. The FDA oversees all food that's not under FSIS jurisdiction and will evaluate each case to determine the threat it poses to public safety. In most cases, the agency will work with the producer to take corrective action at the facility level (cleaning machines and workrooms, safely removing contaminated ingredients and the like) and alert the public if needed. All cases are listed on the FDA website, but more severe ones will be communicated to the media via press release. But if the risk to public safety is found to be particularly high, the Food Safety Modernization Act allows the agency to shut down manufacturing until the threat has been contained. This power was enacted for the first time in November 2012, when a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Bredeney was linked to peanut butter produced by Sunland Inc. The FDA suspended the company's food facility registration, effectively prohibiting it from distributing food. Sunland subsequently declared bankruptcy and shut down production for good. Both FDA and FSIS use a three-tier classification for the threat posed by the food: . ""Class I recall: a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. ""Class II recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. ""Class III recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.""

The account posts the most recent additions to the recall list, and its sister account, @USDAFoodSafety shares a mix of FSIS recall news and food safety tips.

"(CNN) -- Members of North Korea's women's Olympic soccer team walked off the field Wednesday when the flag of South Korea was mistakenly flashed on the big screen before their match against Colombia. North Korea regards its neighbor as a ""puppet regime"" of the West and the relationship between the two nations has become increasingly strained. The London Games organizers issued a hasty apology and eventually the North Korean team returned to beat the Colombian team 2-0. Perhaps the organizers can take comfort in knowing that it's not the first time officials have bungled a flag or an anthem. Here's a recap of some notable gaffes: . The ten strangest Olympic sports . 2012 Hockey: Apartheid song plays for South African players . Last month, British field hockey authorities apologized to South Africa after an apartheid-era national anthem played before an international game. The South African women's hockey team heard its pre-1994 anthem ""Die Stem"" play before a game against Great Britain. The song is a sore spot for many in South Africa, because it represents a checkered part of its history of white minority rule. Great Britain hockey blamed the error on ""a contractor responsible for sports presentation at the event."" Afterwards, South Africa beat Great Britain 3-1 in an upset. 2012 Amir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix: ""Borat"" parody anthem plays . A Kazakhstan sharpshooter Mariya Dmitrienko, who won gold at an international shooting championship, was stunned to hear a parody anthem from the movie ""Borat"" instead of her national anthem. The lyrics blared: ""Kazakhstan's prostitutes cleanest in the region, except of course Turkmenistan's."" During the awkward award ceremony, Dmitrienko managed to remain steady. Kuwait Shooting Federation officials called it an ""unintentional"" mistake. And the head coach of the Kazakh team said they were told their nation's anthem was downloaded from the internet. Euro 2008: Banned Nazi lyrics plays to German national anthem . Banned Nazi lyrics ran as subtitles to the German national anthem before a Euro 2008 soccer match. The lyrics were banned after World War II as it starts with ""Germany, Germany, above everything else in this world."" The subtitles ran live on Swiss TV and on the giant screens around the country, prompting fans to jeer, and toss beer and food at the screens. The snafu was blamed on researchers who copied the lyrics from the internet before the match between Germany and Austria, the Austrian Times reported. Swiss TXT, a company that provided the subtitles, apologized and called it ""an embarrassing mistake,"" reported ESPN. The confusion could've occurred because German's national anthem is the same song, minus the first two stanzas, which were believed to promote Nazi ideals. Germany won the game 1-0. 1992 World Series: Oh Canada? During Game 2 of the World Series between the Atlanta Braves and the Toronto Blue Jays, the Canadian flag was displayed upside-down. The U.S. Marine Corps marched onto the field with an upside-down maple leaf, much to the chagrin of Blue Jays fans and Canadians. The incident sparked so much controversy that then-President George H.W. Bush issued two apologies to the Canadian people, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Marine Corps took full responsibility for the gaffe. The error occurred because the Marines had been provided the Canadian flag at the last-minute, according to the 1992 report. At the end, the Canadian team defeated the American one, becoming the first team from outside the United States to win the World Series. And just this week... Taiwan's flag was removed from London's flag display. The Republic of China, also known as Taiwan, competes in the Olympics as Chinese Taipei and uses a special flag just for the games. It cannot use the Taiwanese flag or play its anthem at Olympic venues, as mandated by a 1981 accord with the International Olympics Committee, stemming from sovereignty disputes with China. But Taiwan's flag hung over Regents Street in London along with 205 other flags of the countries represented in the Olympics. The flag display is run by a neighborhood civic group, not the Olympic committee. Earlier this week, Taiwan's flag was removed, reported the Taipei Times. There was no reason given for its removal. But the Central News Agency reported that Taiwan's Olympic flag will be placed on the street display, instead of its flag. Calls to the Republic of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs were not returned. Olympic mascots: Cute or creepy?

"(CNN) -- Two people accused of killing a man they met through Craigslist pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania. They entered their pleas early Tuesday, according to Trisha Cotner, administrative assistant for the district attorney of Northumberland County District Attorney's Office. Miranda Barbour, 19, and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, are charged in the 2013 death of Troy LaFerrara, 42. He was stabbed and strangled in their car after connecting with the couple through a Craigslist companionship ad, police said. Investigators tracked the couple through phone numbers in LaFerrara's phone. Police said the couple wanted to kill someone together for the thrill. They had been married for only three weeks at the time of the slaying and had moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot. Earlier this year, Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item newspaper of Sunbury, Pennsylvania, that she had killed at least 22 people over six years across the country. She stood by that statement in an interview with the same newspaper a week ago. Sunbury Police Chief Chief Steve Mazzeo said in March he had passed along the information to other jurisdictions.

"(CNN) -- Protesters shut down a San Francisco subway station Monday, angry about a transit police officer shooting a drunk man at a station earlier this month. A group called ""No Justice, No BART"" -- which formed after the 2009 shooting of an unarmed passenger by a Bay Area Rapid Transit Police officer -- organized the spirited, albeit largely peaceful rally centered at the city's Civic Center stop. That officer was eventually found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Oscar Grant's death. The transit system, known in San Francisco as BART, said on its website that the more recent shooting occurred July 3, after police dispatchers got a call about ""a drunk who was unsteady on his feet and in danger of falling off the platform."" Two BART officers arrived on the scene at 9:45 p.m. And a minute later, the man -- later identified as 45-year-old Charles Hill -- was shot after a confrontation with police. The shooting victim was taken by paramedics to a local hospital, and pronounced dead later that night. In a subsequent statement, BART identified Hill as a ""suspect"" who is ""said to have had no known address."" But the scores who attended Monday's ""civil disturbance"" loudly voiced their view that the Hill was a victim, who died without just cause at the hands of a transit police officer. With a slew of reporters, photographers and cameramen in sight, the demonstrators packed a BART train. They reeled off a number of chants including ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Murderers, justice."" The protest prompted the BART system to halt service in and out of its Civic Center stop, the agency announced in an alert. The 16th Street Mission station also closed down, while major delays were reported all around the city. No one has been charged in the shooting, which is the sixth in the system's 40-year history, according to BART. Yet while there has been no admission of police wrongdoing, the San Francisco transit system has charged its ""first-ever Independent Police Auditor,"" according to a statement posted Monday on its website. Mark Smith -- who was hired in part to promote public confidence in BART in the wake of the 2009 shooting -- had been on the job for all of one week when Hill's shooting occurred. ""It is a great relief that the independent auditor is in place to reassure the public that the investigation into the officer-involved shooting is conducted with the highest integrity and greatest level of transparency,"" BART board president Bob Franklin said.","A group called ""No Justice, No BART"" organizes a protest at a BART stop .

"(EW.com) -- Nine years ago, Frankie Valli was rescued from oldies-station oblivion with the smash Broadway musical ""Jersey Boys."" The show chronicles the real-life rise-and-fall-and-rise-again of four crooners from the mobbed-up mean streets of 1960s New Jersey who called themselves the Four Seasons and cranked out a seemingly endless string of hit records, including the love ditty ''Sherry,'' the triumphant ''Walk Like a Man,'' and the bouncy bubblegum bop of ''Big Girls Don't Cry.'' The songs are timeless. But so are a lot of songs from that Motown and Phil Spector era. What made the Four Seasons magical was Valli's voice -- an impossibly high-pitched nasal falsetto that sounded like a prepubescent angel who'd huffed a tank of helium. With ""Jersey Boys' "" receipts still pouring in on the Great White Way, the notion of adapting the musical into a splashy song-and-dance Hollywood biopic must have been too juicy to resist. In fact, the only thing that might seem surprising about the ""Jersey Boys"" movie is the man squinting behind the camera, Clint Eastwood. But the pairing actually makes more sense than you'd think. Anyone who saw Eastwood's 1988 Charlie Parker film, ""Bird,"" knows that the guy's always been a not-so-closeted hepcat with a discerning set of ears. The biggest problem is that the film, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, never makes a convincing case for why Valli the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"" did for Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. Such are the perils of adapting a somewhat one-dimensional stage show. Fortunately, Eastwood is far wiser on the casting front. As Valli, John Lloyd Young is pretty close to perfection. That's no shocker, really, as he won a Tony in 2006 for his portrayal of Valli on the boards. With his slicked-back pompadour and wardrobe of sharkskin suits, Young looks more like the late Bruno Kirby than Valli. But when he opens his mouth, you believe you're listening to the real deal. He finds every ounce of sweat, aftershave, and salad dressing that made up Valli's one-of-a-kind voice. As his fellow Four Seasons, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen and Vincent Piazza are equally spot-on, even if all of their bada-bing lingo occasionally makes them sound like they're competing in a Chazz Palminteri impersonation contest. (Both Lomenda and Bergen starred in the stage version as well.) Eastwood has never been the kind of filmmaker to grab you by the lapels or hot-dog with flashy storytelling tricks. You can walk in halfway through just about any of his movies and know exactly where you are. His laid-back traditionalism has always been part of his appeal, though. And in chronicling the careers of Valli & Co., he charts a predictably linear through-line: the band's hardscrabble Italian-American roots, which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy (Christopher Walken) who takes them under his wing; their first flirtation with fame; the downward slide of excess, money trouble, and infighting; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when they're inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. The movie's decades-spanning scope requires the 34-year-old Young to play Valli from age 16 to 60. As good as he is, he isn't done any favors by Eastwood's makeup team. You'd think that after all the grousing over Leonardo DiCaprio's distracting mugful of old-age putty in ""J. Edgar,"" the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of ""Jersey Boys."" But alas. Still, as flat and pitchy as the film sometimes feels, what saves it are those nostalgic, soaring doo-wop numbers (especially ''Sherry'') and Eastwood's measured doses of directorial playfulness, such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience, as they did on Broadway. This trick doesn't always work, but when it does, and Valli or one of his bandmates turns to the camera, winks, and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what we're actually witnessing on screen, it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity.

"Hollywood, Florida (CNN) -- He's known for his big hair and his big personality and at 81 years old, legendary boxing promoter Don King is still hard at work trying to turn his big dreams into reality. His latest endeavor: a boxing and music event in North Korea. ""This came about by me thinking about Korea and feeling that Korea, that it should be one Korea,"" said King. When asked about the odds of this event actually coming together, King says, ""It's very difficult to believe, I understand that."" Understanding King may help explain why he believes he can make this event happen. The hallways of the Don King Productions office in South Florida are lined with photographs of him posing with world leaders, celebrities and athletes. There are old boxing posters and newspaper articles framed and hanging on the walls. It feels more like a museum than an office building. For decades, King has appeared alongside boxing greats including Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield -- promoting legendary matchups that have catapulted many boxers into lifelong fame. Boxing has always been more than a sport to King, who contemplates the photos. ""Gen. David Petraeus, that was my friend,"" said King, pointing to a photo signed by the former Army commander, now CIA director. ""I went to Iraq with him."" On the other side of the room is a picture of King with a young Michael Jackson, who ""told me that music is the ribbon that ties humanity together,"" King recalled. ""And I added to that boxing is a catalyst that brings humanity together to be tied."" A framed letter from former President George W. Bush hangs on the wall, as does his picture with Bush and one with Bill Clinton. ""I am not a Democrat and I am not a Republican,"" explained King. ""I'm a 'Republicrat' and that means that I'm for the American people first and the party second."" He is a fan of President Barack Obama and believes that Bush paved the way for an Obama presidency: ""George Walker Bush had the most diversified Cabinet in the history of the nation."" Another photo shows King with former Ohio Gov. James Rhodes, who gained fame after sending National Guard troops to Kent State in 1970. Rhodes pardoned King in 1983 for a prior manslaughter conviction. The boxing promoter spent four years in prison for the fatal beating of a man who King says owed him money. King admits this wasn't the only man he killed during his early years, when he was running an illegal gambling operation on the streets of Cleveland. He had no problem describing what happened when an intruder entered his home in 1954: . ""I was shooting him and he's shooting at me,"" recalled King, ""he goes downstairs and into the alley somewhere and falls dead in the alley."" King claimed he fired in self-defense and the case was ruled a justifiable homicide. For both of them, I suffered deep contrition,"" said King, adding, ""How do you expiate for that? You expiate for that by helping others and that's what my life is dedicated to."" That life is reflected in his hallway of photographs chronicling nearly every moment of King's rise to fame. Another photo shows King wearing a prison number, not his, but 46664 -- the prison number of former South African President Nelson Mandela. King said Mandela asked him to wear the black T-shirt with the number printed across the front. ""What I take from him, he says you can do more for world peace,"" King said, recalling the day they met. Mandela spoke to King about bringing people together through sports. That concept of sports diplomacy is what King hopes to achieve on the Korean peninsula. A phone call from South Korea's ambassador to the United States interrupts our guided tour of King's hallway of photos. King heads back into his office, asking the ambassador the progress of the North Korea project. ""You took the statement both to North and South ambassadors?"" King asks on speakerphone. ""I wrote a letter to Kim Jung Un and have we heard anything back from the supreme leader?"" King explains he met with the ambassador and a North Korean representative during a trip to New York and he recently sent his proposal to Kim. He has not heard back from officials in North Korea. Cult of personality surrounds new North Korean leader . Before hanging up the phone, King thanks the ambassador and says, ""I will call you back because I have to move on to the rest of the world, God bless you and God bless Korea."" Not one to sit around and wait for things to happen, after talking to the ambassador, King leaves his office for the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida, where he was promoting a fight. As King strolls through the casino on a Monday afternoon, guests instantly recognize the figure with the wild hair and American flag tie, jacket, scarf and necklace charm. In case the red, white and blue apparel was not enough to show his patriotism, King carries two American flags, one for each hand. King likes his props, especially the flags. For this outing he made sure he also had the Seminole Tribe of Florida flag to carry with him. He also likes the attention he gets from the public, gladly stopping every few feet to pose for pictures, as he makes his way to the event hall, where his boxers are getting ready for a fight. ""Our customers, our guests, they're as interested in being exposed to Don as they are the fight card itself,"" explained Jim Allen, chief executive officer of Hard Rock International's casinos and restaurants. King publicly embraces the caricature of himself that he has spent decades cultivating. He is a public figure whose name alone can evoke adoration or abhorrence. When he's out of the limelight, King is a family man often quiet and deep in his thoughts, according to his son, Karl King. Karl, 55, is one of three children King had with his wife of over 50 years, Henrietta. She passed away in 2010 at age 87. During King's time in prison, it was Henrietta who protected the children and kept the family together. ""We moved out of the city where he was so well known ... to a rural part of Ohio,"" recalled Karl. After his father's prison stint, Karl King said his mother continued to hold the family together while his ""workaholic"" father financially provided for the family during his rise to fame as Don King the promoter. ""I think it's what gives him life,"" explained the younger King. ""The art of closing a deal, the art of waving the flags and being something more than just a boxing promoter who puts on boxing shows."" King's life at 81 seems to continue as it has for decades, with him being at the center of the ring, taking on projects that may seem impossible to others. King knows the odds of the North Korea endeavor are not in his favor. But he says it's not about the fight. ""I'm not a boxing guy,"" King explained. ""I'm a guy that uses boxing as a catalyst to bring people together."" CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report .","Don King, who turned 81 this week, is still promoting boxing matches .

"(CNN) -- To wander the Farnborough airfield during trade show week is to be dwarfed by the big beasts of global aviation, from the epic Dreamliners to the needle-sharp fighter jets, and all for sale. But with even the cheapest models costing many millions of dollars, is there any prospect that owning an aircraft could follow computers and cars in becoming affordable to the masses? The figures indicate otherwise. Private jet sales slowed to a crawl following the global recession, falling 3.4% to 682 in 2012 in the U.S. and rising just 0.9% the following year. Even this minor growth has been concentrated at the top end of the market, with sales contracting toward the lower end. Bombardier airline President Eric Martel was candid about the prospect of an upturn, saying Monday: ""It's no secret the light segment has been difficult over the last couple of years."" An enthusiast could still fulfill their dream through a fixed kit plane, or a discontinued antique. But looking ahead, their best bet might be the emerging field of the car-plane hybrid. This week at the Farnborough International Airshow, Parajet is showcasing the SkyRunner to potential aviation distributors with a price tag of $80,000. The design combines an all-terrain vehicle with a light sport aircraft capable of soaring 15,000 feet at a speed of 55mph, with a flying time of three hours. Powered by an innovative low-carbon petrol engine, the hybrid is presented as ""the next generation of recreational aircraft...designed primarily to make aviation easily accessible and fun."" The vehicle has undergone testing over five years, including a voyage from London to Timbuktu flown by inventor Gilo Cardozo. It builds on the motor design of the company's signature product, a propeller-powered jetpack already established on the market. Parajet manager Tom Prideaux-Brune believes the new concept is ready and is now being fine tuned for specific markets. ""We have built it and proved it works so now we can take it forward to manufacturing. We can launch when we have the distributors."" Classified as a light aircraft, SkyRunner must overcome regulatory hurdles. ""It's about planning and registering it, so that the authorities know who is operating it and has had sufficient training. The Civil Aviation Authority has been very positive."" Once a fantasy only seen in films like ""Back to the Future,"" the 'caroplane' has become an increasingly robust reality in recent years. The Terrafugia also made its air show debut recently and is set for sales next year. New competitors are also emerging. The existing market for private planes is ""not dynamic or growing"", says Charles Alcock, Editor-in-Chief of Aviation International News, suggesting there could be an opportunity for innovators to steal a march, as occurred before the crash. ""A decade earlier we saw new designs that made planes significantly more affordable...very light jets more like sports cars with wings that bought prices down from $75 million to $1 million. It seemed they might take off before the recession."" Alcock highlights that the initial outlay can pale beside other costs such as training, licenses and parking. He adds that regulations could derail the hybrid models: ""You have to go a long way to convince the authorities."" So hardly a cloudless sky. But if the SkyRunner design is not yet cleared for take off, it provides an exciting and plausible glimpse of a future of aircraft ownership we can all aspire to.","Car-plane hybrid looks to make aviation affordable amidst private jet slump .

"(CNN) -- If Lewis Hamilton is to win a fifth Hungarian Grand Prix, he'll need something akin to a miracle. That's because he'll start well adrift of the pack after the back of his Mercedes caught fire in qualifying -- the second consecutive Saturday he's suffered misfortune. It was on his first qualifying lap, too. Hamilton wasn't hurt but with his chassis needing replacing, it means a start from pit lane. His teammate and Championship leader Nico Rosberg had no such issues, recording the fastest time. Last week in qualifying for the German Grand Prix, a brake issue led to a Hamilton crash and meant he began 20th on the grid on race day but he put in a stellar drive to rise to third. Hamilton, who bettered the field in practice Friday and earlier Saturday, was the first to point out that overtaking opportunities aren't as great in Hungary as they were in Germany. ""It's a shame, especially when you do the practice sessions with not too many problems,"" Hamilton said in a television interview aired by Sky. ""I didn't even get a lap this time. Last time I got maybe two laps. ""I can't believe it's happened again. This is not a track you can really overtake on so coming from last to the podium is a lot less likely."" Hamilton's mishap gives Rosberg the chance to extend his 14-point lead over Hamilton in the individual standings. And although the German said he would have preferred to go head-to-head with Hamilton, he felt Sunday's race would now be ""easier."" Unsurprisingly, he doesn't plan on taking many risks at the Hungaroring. ""It makes it easier of course because he is my competitor,"" Rosberg was quoted as saying by Autosport.com. ""It's a free opportunity tomorrow. ""I need to play it safe and avoid any unnecessary things happening, and get as many points as possible. ""I would prefer to be out there battling with Lewis. That would give me the maximum adrenaline rush. It won't be a gloves-off battle with Lewis, but I am still very, very happy."" Rosberg clocked a best time of one minute, 22.715 seconds, bettering reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull by 0.486 seconds, Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who is a distant third in the driver standings.","Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton finishes second last in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship has begun its final voyage. Salvage crews refloated the ship last week so they can move it from its resting place off Giglio Island to the Italian port of Genoa to be dismantled. On Wednesday morning, the rusting hulk set off into open waters under tow. Attached to its sides are the huge steel hollow boxes, or sponsons, that were pumped full of compressed air to give the ship buoyancy. It's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention. The vessel will be towed -- slowly and carefully -- approximately 240 kilometers (150 miles) to Genoa, where it will be broken up. A convoy of 17 boats will travel along with it. The ship is expected to arrive in Genoa on Sunday. It'll take about two years to dismantle the massive cruise liner. Environmental concerns prompted the decision to undertake the expensive and difficult process of refloating the Costa Concordia rather than taking it apart on site. Since the wreck two years ago, 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture, dishes, food, personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed. The Costa Concordia is the largest salvage ever attempted -- and the most expensive, at a cost of $1.5 billion so far. Nine things to know about the plan to salvage the Costa Concordia .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- They answered the call by the thousands, some walking miles in sweltering heat to volunteer to fight an al Qaeda splinter group barreling towards the Iraqi capital. With reports that fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the terror group also known as ISIS, was some 40 miles from the gates of Baghdad, the country's top religious and political leaders appealed for able-bodied men of fighting age to volunteer to defend the country. ""Mosul, Tal Afar, Falluja, wherever, by God's will we will be ready to defend any location,"" said 23-year-old Ahmed, who showed up Thursday at a recruiting station in central Baghdad, one of dozens that have popped up across the country in recent days to handle the influx of volunteers. Ahmed, who gave only his first name, was joined by hundreds of men, mostly Shiites in their 20s, at the Muthanna Airbase, where they waited under a makeshift canopy for their chance to sign up. ""What's happening is sabotage. Those terrorists must be driven out, and by God's will they will be driven out,"" he said. ISIS' lightning advance in Iraq has been aided by support from many Sunnis who say they have been pushed aside and marginalized by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government, a divide that threatens to tear the country apart. ISIS, aided by Sunni fighters, seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and then threatened to march on Baghdad. The militants' rapid advance -- and the total collapse of Iraq's security forces in the face of their assault in Mosul and a number of other smaller cities and towns -- have rocked al-Maliki's government. While the aim of ISIS is to establish an Islamic state that stretches from Iraq to northern Syria, where it has had significant success in battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, it has made al-Maliki's removal from power part of its campaign. Last week, as ISIS fighters neared Samarra, home to a revered Shiite shrine, al-Maliki took to the airwaves to call on volunteers to protect the city north of Baghdad. That was followed by Iraq's top cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appeal to people to join the military to protect Shiite shrines, a call that saw a massive outpouring of Shiite volunteers that raised concerns about the possible widening of the sectarian conflict. During Friday prayers, a sermon delivered by a senior cleric and representative of al-Sistani called for all Muslim sects to stand together in the fight against ISIS. ""Last week, the higher religious authority called upon Iraqis to volunteer to join the armed forces to defend Iraq in these difficult conditions,"" Imam Sayid Ahmed al-Safi said during prayers in the Shiite holy city of Karbala. ""This call was directed to everybody and not to one sect, it aimed to prepare to stand up to ISIS that has got the upper hand and strongest presence in many areas and that has declared that it is targeting other provinces including the holy Najaf and Karbala and other places within its reach like holy places and shrines of holy people and imams of all religions."" Despite the widespread call, the volunteers signing up at the Muthanna Airbase were predominantly Shiite. ""I volunteered to preserve the people, and as a response to request of Ayatollah Sistani,"" Saif Saad, 25, said. ""We are here to serve the people, and get rid of ISIS."" Every so often, an officer ticked off the names of 10 men on a list. Each group headed into a beige, cramped building where they were give a cursory medical screening, including eye and dental exams. ""They will call or text us, and then we will put on uniforms and go to the front line,"" Saad said. The volunteers, who have been told they will receive a salary commiserate with soldiers in the Iraqi military, will get some training. It depends, Gen. Fadhil Abdul Sahib said, on the ""tactical situation."" ""Maybe a few days, maybe a month,"" he said. With his medical exam completed, now Saad must wait. He says he's not worried. ""We are here with ... courage because we are here to drive out terrorism from this country."" CNN's Susan Chun and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Iraq's top religious and political leaders call for volunteers to defend against ISIS .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps nothing illustrates the ambitions of the well-established Gulf carriers -- Emirates, Etihad and Qatar -- and Turkish Airlines so much as the swift expansion of their route networks. Turkish Airlines currently flies to about 253 destinations, and plans to add another 60 to its network in the next five years. Emirates, meanwhile, is rumored to have placed a record-breaking order for Boeing's 777X aircraft. ""These carriers have a good modern fleet and can fly long distances, and because of their geographical position, they can connect anywhere from their hub to almost anywhere else in the world, either non-stop, or one-stop,"" says John Strickland, an independent transport consultant. When it comes to choosing what routes to launch, it happens that the region's major carriers have a carefully calculated strategy that can speak volumes about emerging markets. Slideshow: How drones will change your life . Breaking up America? Traditionally, the United States has been overlooked in favor of the European market by the Gulf carriers and Turkish. All that's changing as Etihad, Emirates, Qatar and Turkish Airlines all either introduced direct routes to the States last year, or else have some in the works for 2014. ""They're really starting to shake up the U.S. market for the first time,"" says Brendan Sobie, a spokesperson for the Center for Aviation. Last year, Dubai launched a direct flight from New York City to Milan -- the first time in the airline's history a flight bypassed the Dubai hub (last year, Delta and Alitalia unsuccessfully sued the Italian government to block the Emirates route). In the next 15 years, the airline plans to double the number of U.S. destinations it flies into. Etihad will fly to four U.S. cities by the end of 2014, while Qatar Airways will be up to six. The expansion has not gone unnoticed by the American aviation industry. The U.S. trade group Airlines for America and the U.S. pilot union, Air Line Pilots Association International, have been the most ardent opponents of the Gulf carriers encroachment into the U.S. market, often joining Delta and United in lobbying Congress for protectionist policies. ""It is interesting to see how the U.S. carriers and politicians are starting to respond,"" says Sobie. Read more: Why the Dubai Airshow is a gamechanger . Tapping Africa . In just a couple of years, Turkish Airlines has become the largest international carrier in Africa, flying into 39 destinations. At first glance, some of the African cities in their network might seem random -- why fly to Somalia? Their business plan underlines investment strategies for Turkey as a whole. According to the Center for Aviation many of the countries they serve, or are planning to serve, have a rapidly growing economy. In 2012, Rwanda's GDP grew by 8%, and Nigeria's by 6.6%. The continent also houses a wealth of natural resources. ""The most important geographic part of the world over the next 100 years will be Africa. In this respect, any destination (we fly to) in Africa will create more effective results than, say, a destination in Europe,"" says Ali Genc, Turkish Airlines' senior vice president of media relations. Quiz time: Test your aviation knowledge . Building BRICs . Turkish Airlines and the Gulf carriers have been increasingly developing their network across Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) -- the nations widely viewed as the most promising developing markets in the 21st century. The importance of developing these routes is not simply to connect these emerging markets with the Middle East, but with each other. ""Carriers like Emirates, Etihad and Qatar can access emerging markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America and connect them in a way that is meaningful to travelers, and that European carriers can't hope to copy,"" says Strickland. Budget carriers like Air Arabia and flydubai have become particularly attractive to cities and towns across Central and Eastern Europe. ""Regionally, we're seeing a lot of interest in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),"" says Sobie. ""Air Arabia and flydubai is a good fit for the medium-haul, thinner routes that are high-yielding and growing, but can't support the widebody aircraft of Emirates,"" he adds.","Emirates, Etihad and Qatar are expanding into the U.S. marketplace .
Some airlines are working hard to block their entrance .

"(CNN) -- A 9-year-old girl accidentally killed a shooting instructor with an Uzi on Monday, authorities in Arizona said, and now the world is asking itself an absolutely absurd question: Should a fourth-grader be legally allowed to shoot an Uzi? The only answer to that question is: Hell fricking NO -- it should be against the law. Understand, I love shooting guns and so do my kids. My favorite gun is a 12-gauge over/under shotgun. Our teenage daughters prefer a .22 because it's easier to aim and control. Other than hooking a large brown trout, there's nothing more thrilling in my book than pulling the trigger on a shotgun and managing to hit a target. Kids and guns: What's your parenting style? But this is not a shotgun. This is a fully automatic machine gun developed by the Israeli army. It is capable of firing 600 to 650 bullets a minute. As this Uzi pumps out 10 bullets a second, the kickback is substantial. It is designed to be fired by a soldier during war, not a fourth-grader on vacation. It's too powerful, it's too big and it's too deadly. Many adult novices can't control that weapon. The Mohave County Sheriff, Jim McCabe, said the full video of the incident was, as one might imagine, ""ghastly."" This, of course, isn't the little girl's fault; was it even her idea to shoot an Uzi in the first place? It's the instructor and the parents who are to blame -- I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you hand an Uzi with the selector on fully automatic mode to a 9-year-old? For anyone who asks ""What were they thinking?"" the answer is: They weren't. That's why the law needs to change -- to protect kids from adult stupidity. This all seems particularly senseless to me because just two weeks ago on our own family vacation, we introduced our own 9-year-old to the joys of target shooting and the responsibility of gun safety. Here's a photo of our son, supervised by instructors and with my father behind him on his first day at the range. Notice what's happening. He's sitting down, so he can absorb any kick. He's got on safety glasses and sound protection. The gun is resting against a table and the strap of the gun has been put around a railing on the table to hold it down. Why do you take these precautions? Because when you introduce kids to the sport of shooting guns, you are taking on a great responsibility. This 9-year-old girl isn't the only child to kill someone with an Uzi. An 8-year-old boy in Massachusetts killed himself a few years ago when he fired an Uzi at a gun show, while supervised by his own father. The gun kicked up on the boy, and he shot himself in the head. The laws didn't change in Massachusetts, and I'm sure the National Rifle Association will see to it that they don't change in Arizona. But they should. Arizona laws require a person to be at least 21 years old to carry a firearm, but the laws do not apply on private property or if the minor is accompanied by a parent or certified instructor. Kids can't drive until they're 16, vote, chew tobacco or smoke until they're 18, or drink until they're 21. No child should have access to firing a fully automatic weapon until the age of 18. And gun ranges should know better than to hand one to a novice shooter passing through on vacation, let alone one as young as 9. The tragedy took place at Bullets and Burgers, where the website states ""At our range, you can shoot FULL auto on our machine guns. Let 'em Rip!"" Just because you can doesn't mean you should.","Mel Robbins: Gun instructor's death raises absurd question: Should kids fire Uzis?
She says of course not! If kids learn about guns, should be in controlled safe environment .
Robbins: What parent would put such a gun in a kid's hands and how could gun range allow it?
She says giving kids under 18 access to a submachine gun should be illegal ."
"(CNN) -- The largest Ebola outbreak in history has struck fear into the hearts of people around the world. While fewer than 3,000 people have been killed by the virus since it was discovered in 1976, the disease's virulence and deadliness, combined with the lack of a cure, inspire dread like almost no other. We asked you what questions you had about Ebola and received more than 1,000 responses via social media. Here are expert answers to some of your most common questions and concerns. What is Ebola? Medecins Sans Frontieres describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" ""It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90% of the people who catch it, causing terror among infected communities,"" MSF says. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. The World Health Organization says there are five different strains of the virus, named after the areas where they originated. Three of these have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Africa. Of Ebola's five subtypes, the Zaire strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly. The WHO said preliminary tests on the Ebola virus in Guinea in March suggested that the outbreak there was this strain, though that has not been confirmed. What are Ebola's symptoms? Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis or even the plague. MSF says some patients may also develop a rash, red eyes, hiccups, chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing. The early symptoms progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that if a patient is going to die from Ebola, he or she usually does so within about 10 days. Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests. How is it treated? What about that experimental drug? There are no specific approved treatments for Ebola. MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers. ""This consists of hydrating the patient, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections,"" it says. Two American missionary workers infected with Ebola were given an experimental drug called ZMapp, which seems to have saved their lives. The drug, developed by a San Diego firm, had never been tried before on humans, but it showed promise in small experiments on monkeys. The Americans who received it have since been declared healthy and discharged from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. ZMapp was also administered to three Liberian health care workers who contracted Ebola. At first, they showed ""very positive signs of recovery,"" according to the Liberian Ministry of Health, but one has since died of the disease. Why haven't other patients been given the experimental drug? An ethics panel convened by the WHO concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one, but that doesn't mean it will happen. Rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult, according to MSF. Experimental drugs are typically not mass-produced, and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce. ZMapp's maker says it has very few doses ready for patient use. What about a vaccine? There is currently no approved vaccination against Ebola. At least one potential Ebola vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers, according to Thomas Geisbert, a leading researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch. And last week, the NIH announced that a safety trial of another Ebola vaccine will start as early as September. In March, the U.S. National Institutes of Health awarded a five-year, $28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight Ebola. Learn more about Ebola vaccines and treatments in development . How does the Ebola virus spread? Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans, like blood, sweat and feces. MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water. ""People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick: because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient,"" she said. Can it live outside a host? MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, chlorine disinfection, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. Can it travel through the air, like a common cold or the flu? ""This is not an airborne transmission,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. ""There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood."" What about planes? Can fellow passengers become infected if someone on the flight has the virus? Could Ebola spread around the world via air travel? While the CDC acknowledges it's possible a person infected with Ebola in West Africa could get on a plane and arrive in another country, the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low. ""It's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers,"" said Stephan Monroe, deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases. ""The Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood, secretions, or other body fluids of ill people, and indirect contact -- for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids."" Travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with Ebola patients. ""It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,"" the International Air Transport Association said in a statement. ""In the rare event that a person infected with the Ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air, WHO advises that the risks to other passengers are low. Nonetheless, WHO does advise public health authorities to carry out contact tracing in such instances."" This means determining who had contact with the affected person. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? Is Ebola going to be our era's plague or Black Death? Is it the most dangerous disease on the planet? Not likely, says Gupta. ""Ebola is not the great plague; there's no question about that,"" he explained. ""The grim reality is that it often kills so quickly that people don't have time to spread it."" ""It's a myth that Ebola is the most dangerous disease that humans have ever encountered,"" he added. ""HIV/AIDS, for example, certainly has killed more people, and up until recently, there was no treatment for that disease either. Rabies, something that you can get from animals as well, if you develop symptoms, you're very unlikely to survive. With Ebola right now, about seven out of 10 people are dying (in Guinea), but not everybody."" Dr. Gupta on more Ebola myths and truths . If you survive Ebola, are you immune, like chickenpox? Doctors believe surviving Ebola leaves you immune to future infection. Scientists have found that people who survive Ebola have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future, and possibly against other strains as well. But, as you can imagine, they haven't tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again. How do people react to Ebola survivors? CNN's Nima Elbagir, who has been reporting on the outbreak in West Africa, says those ""lucky"" enough to survive the disease frequently find that the stigma attached to Ebola means they are ostracized once they recover. ""They find it very difficult to come back to their communities and be accepted, because people just don't believe that they have been cured,"" she explains. ""There's a lot of superstition, a belief that Ebola is almost a 'curse' and that makes it much more difficult to deal with."" Where did Ebola start? The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa, passing on the virus to other animals. 9 things to know about Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Don't ask Justin Bieber about Selena Gomez. It's a touchy subject. In fact, Bieber appeared reluctant to answer any questions from an attorney for a photographer who accuses Bieber of ordering a bodyguard to attack him last summer. Several video clips of the deposition, which a Miami judge ordered in the photographer's lawsuit against Bieber, were posted Monday on the celebrity news website TMZ. The release comes just days after another Miami judge released video of Bieber giving a urine sample in jail after an arrest on a driving under the influence charge in January. In video from the deposition, Bieber primped and winked to the camera at times, but he was a hostile witness for most of the four hours of questioning by Miami lawyer Mark DiCowden, who represents photographer Jeffrey Binion. Bieber's attorney objected when DiCowden asked if he ever dated Gomez. Bieber had a long-term relationship with Gomez, which included many encounters with the paparazzi. ""Sounds like you're trying to harass him,"" his lawyer said. DiCowden followed up by asking Bieber, 20, if he had ""ever discussed his feelings about paparazzi with Gomez?"" ""Don't ask me about her again,"" Bieber answered. He wagged a finger at the lawyer, repeating at least six times, ""Don't ask me about her again."" At times Bieber closed his eyes, appearing to tune out the lawyer. ""I don't have to listen to anything you have to say,"" Bieber told DiCowden. He compared the lawyer to journalist Katie Couric. ""It seems like a '60 Minutes' interview,"" Bieber said. Evidence of Bieber's reluctance also came when he was asked if he knew ""an entertainer by the name of Usher."" ""Yeah, Usher, that sounds familiar,"" Bieber answered. He later acknowledged Usher was a close friend, but he downplayed the singer's role in his career. ""Isn't it true that Usher was instrumental in starting your career?"" DiCowden asked. ""I was found on YouTube,"" Bieber replied. ""I think that I was detrimental to my own career."" After prompting from his attorney, Bieber revised his answer to say ""instrumental"" -- not ""detrimental."" Bieber may have been too quick to respond when DiCowden asked him if he had a perscription for the sedative Xanax. ""No, sir,"" Bieber replied. ""Give me a chance to object, ok,"" his lawyer then whispered to Bieber. A toxicology report released by Miami Beach police said Xanax was present in Bieber's system when he was arrested on a DUI charge in January. Bieber's combativeness extended toward the court reporter who was transcribing his answers. When she remarked she could not hear Bieber's whispered answer to a question, he replied, "" 'Yes' and 'no' are f--king pretty different."" Lawyers for each side did not immediately respond to CNN request for comment. Bieber is likely to get more experience dealing with lawyers' questions in the coming months. He faces the DUI charge that could go to a trial in Miami as well as an assault charge in Toronto. A Los Angeles prosecutor also is close to a decision in a possible vandalism case over an alleged egg attack on the mansion of a Bieber neighbor in Calabasas, California.

"(CNN) -- The longstanding conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas reignited last week after Israel launched airstrikes against what it called terrorist targets in Gaza. Israel explained that the offensive, which it calls ""Operation Pillar of Defense,"" was necessitated by increasing rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe. Among those killed in the Israeli airstrikes Wednesday was Ahmed al-Ja'abari, the chief of Hamas' military wing. Weapons depots and rocket-launching sites were also targeted. ""Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in Gaza have made normal life impossible for over 1 million Israelis,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. ""No government would tolerate a situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant barrage of rockets and missile fire."" Palestinian leaders condemned the attacks and said it is just another example of Israel's aggression toward Gaza. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel has imposed a crippling economic embargo on the territory because it views Hamas as a terrorist organization bent on destroying the state of Israel. FAQ: What is Hamas, and what are its aims? Meanwhile, Hamas' military wing vowed revenge, warning that Israel had opened ""the gates of hell on themselves."" Since then, Israel and Hamas have been trading bombs and rockets, and there is international concern that the situation could escalate into an even bloodier ground war. The Israeli government has called up 75,000 reservists and massed 30,000 troops across the border of the Palestinian territory, according to the Israel Defense Forces. ""If this situation continues and it escalates, it's going to be really serious and tragic -- not just for Israelis and Palestinians, but actually it will cause a huge amount of upheaval right across the region,"" said former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is envoy for the Middle East Quartet working to find a peace agreement. ""And this is a region, as you know, that doesn't require more upheaval right now."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon flew to the region Monday to personally appeal for a cease-fire, joining a chorus of Western and Arab leaders who do not want to see a repeat of 2009, when a three-week ground offensive resulted in the deaths of at least 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. But not all of those leaders view the conflict similarly. Many of the Western nations, including the United States and several European countries, see Hamas as the aggressor. U.S. President Barack Obama, speaking in Thailand on Sunday, said Hamas rocket attacks were the ""precipitating"" event for the fighting and that ""we are actively working with all the parties in the region to see if we can end those missiles being fired without further escalation of violence."" The United States, like Israel, views Hamas as a terrorist organization. More: Obama's telephone diplomacy on Gaza . Many Arab and Muslim nations, on the other hand, see Hamas as the victim of Israeli aggression. Egypt, for example, recalled its ambassador to Israel and delivered a formal protest to the Israeli government. ""No one can remain still and watch this tragedy unfold in this fashion,"" Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil said Friday. ""This is impossible. The whole world must intervene, and Israel must abide by the agreements and stop the aggression."" Kandil visited a Gaza hospital and kissed the lifeless body of a 4-year-old boy said to have been killed by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military told CNN, however, that it did not carry out any strikes at the time of the child's death; it said it had stopped temporarily for Kandil's visit. The death of civilians, especially children, has been a common rallying cry for critics of Israel's offensive. Ten people, including several children, were pulled from the rubble after one airstrike in Gaza, as CNN's Arwa Damon witnessed. Israeli authorities said they go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties in densely populated Gaza, even dropping leaflets and nonlethal bombs to warn people about bombings in advance. But ""the terrorists,"" Netanyahu said, ""are committing a double war crime: They fire at Israeli civilians, and they hide behind Palestinian civilians."" And sometimes, according to a tweet from the Israeli military, ""Hamas fires from civilian areas and hits its own people."" Both Israel and Hamas have taken to Twitter to defend their cause and sway outside opinion. One recent graphic, tweeted from the account of Hamas' military wing, said Israel isn't killing terrorists in Gaza; it's killing children, senior citizens and women. The Israeli military tweeted a graphic that asked, ""What would you do if rockets were striking your country? RT if you agree that #Israel has the right to self-defense."" As the fighting and the finger-pointing carry on, there's no denying that suffering continues on both sides. CNN's Sara Sidner interviewed one woman in Gaza who lost her two children, ages 2 and 4. ""I am in shock, I can't believe it,"" Riba Abu Saithan said, crying. ""My two children, they are priceless to me. My life is now very difficult."" In Ashkelon, a town in southern Israel, everyone is constantly afraid of rocket attacks, its mayor said. ""We can't go on like this,"" Mayor Benny Vaknin told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. ""We have 131,000 people here and 26,000 children. They are constantly under threat."" Many experts expect that both Israel and Hamas will find it in their best interests to eventually stop fighting. Neither side has much to gain in repeating the events of 2009, writes Aaron David Miller, a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Miller, who served as a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican organizations, said: ""War didn't fix the problem then, and it's unlikely to fix it now. Nor do the Israelis -- when the real threat is Iran -- want to get into a major military and political mess over Gaza that would make their relationship with Egypt even more complicated."" More: Why Israel might hesitate to invade . But if war isn't the answer, why do the bombs and rockets continue to fly? Nathan J. Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said each side suspects the other of playing domestic politics. ""Palestinians fear that the Israeli government is making war with an eye to upcoming elections. Israelis suspect that Hamas -- whose full name is the ""Islamic Resistance Movement"" -- is lobbing rockets because it is tired of its rivals' taunting that it is not living up to its middle name,"" said Brown, who has authored six books on Middle East politics. There is some truth to these charges, Brown said, but both sides have other goals in mind. ""The Israelis know that they cannot dislodge Hamas from Gaza without unacceptable cost and endless occupation. But they want to punish the movement so severely that it will be deterred from future violence,"" he said. ""Hamas knows that the damage it inflicts serves no strategic value, but it hopes that its rockets will cause dislocation and even panic in Israel and send an international message that Gaza cannot be ignored."" How Middle East has changed since last Gaza conflict . CNN's Sara Sidner, Arwa Damon, Greg Botelho, Chelsea J. Carter, Kareem Khadder, Frederick Pleitgen, Mohammed Fadel Fahmy, Josh Levs, Saad Abedine, Talal Abu-Rahma, Hala Gorani, John D. Sutter and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","Israel and Hamas have been trading bombs, rockets from afar .

"(CNN) -- ""Faithful unto death."" Those words on the West Point headstone of 1st Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing succinctly enshrine the determination of the man who helped turn the tide at Gettysburg during the Civil War. Despite two severe wounds, Cushing, 22, stayed at his post and directed artillery fire upon hordes of Confederates charging the center of the Union line at Cemetery Ridge -- a doomed assault known as Pickett's Charge. A bullet to the head finally felled the young officer. More than 151 years after his stand, Cushing will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, the White House announced Tuesday. The Medal of Honor is the country's highest military award, given to American soldiers who display conspicuous ""gallantry above and beyond the call of duty."" The recognition for the West Point graduate marks the longest span of time between the event and the bestowal of the award, said the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. ""He does deserve it without a doubt,"" said John Heiser, historian at Gettysburg National Military Park. ""The tragedy is ... that it should have been awarded long, long ago."" The Civil War hero, born in Delafield, Wisconsin, commanded the six-gun Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, at the momentous Pennsylvania battle. Cushing's battery took a pounding from Confederate artillery preceding the attack and he had only two serviceable guns when the charge began on the hot afternoon of July 3, 1863. The estimated 13,000 attackers had what is known as ""The Angle"" as their objective and some were able to briefly breach the stone wall. Artillery shell fragments left Cushing with injuries to his left shoulder and groin. ""Refusing to evacuate to the rear despite his severe wounds, he directed the operation of his lone field piece continuing to fire in the face of the enemy,"" the White House said in a statement. ""With the rebels within 100 yards of his position, Cushing was shot and killed during this heroic stand. His actions made it possible for the Union Army to successfully repulse the Confederate assault."" Heiser said that the battery -- which included 126 officers and enlisted men -- had the misfortune of being in the center of the maelstrom on the third day of the pivotal battle. ""His battery was under fire for an hour and a half,"" Heiser said. ""It was left in shambles and destroyed."" Six men were killed and 32 were wounded. Given the status of his wounds and his battery, Cushing had every reason to withdraw, said Heiser. ""He is going to show those Rebels one way or the other that his battery will be in action to the end,"" said Heiser. ""It is upholding the highest level of what the Army says is honorable service."" Katie Lawhon, management assistant at Gettysburg, said visitors today can see where Cushing's battery served. ""The story of his valor and sacrifice at the center of the Union battle line ... is a very inspiring story to a lot of people who study Gettysburg,"" said Lawhon. Honor for Cushing is a long time coming . Tuesday's announcement culminates years of lobbying for the honor. Cushing was recommended in 2010, but Congress did not give formal approval until late last year. Cushing received a waiver of a requirement that the Medal of Honor must be recommended within two years of the event and presented within three years, Laura Jowdy, archivist with the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, said Wednesday. The recommendation then had to go through the Defense Department and to the White House, where President Barack Obama gave his approval. Margaret E. Zerwekh, 94, of Delafield, has been an integral part of the campaign, writing to Wisconsin congressmen. She's conducted research, and lives in a house on property formerly owned by the Cushing family. ""He saved the Union and he needs to have recognition for it,"" Zerwekh said late Tuesday. ""It is about time."" Heiser said the heroism of Cushing was ""kind of forgotten, shoved to the background."" A first sergeant in the battery years later received the Medal of Honor, while several surviving comrades kept alive Cushing's bravery. The White House did not release a date for the Cushing ceremony. At a ceremony on September 15, Obama will bestow the Medal of Honor to two soldiers who fought in Vietnam. Command Sgt. Major Bennie G. Adkins, who lives in Opelika, Alabama, distinguished himself in combat operations in March 1966 during one of three tours in Southeast Asia. He dragged comrades to safety during a mortar barrage and later fought off an attack. Specialist Four Donald P. Sloat, from Coweta, Oklahoma, was killed while on patrol in January 1970. The 20-year-old machine gunner chose to shield the blast of a grenade with his own body, saving three comrades. Marine who took grenade blast for comrade receives Medal of Honor .

"(CNN) -- When a black man dies at the hands of a white police officer, not often is there video evidence that could end the speculation and show what happened. In the case of John Crawford III, there is video evidence -- and Walmart needs to release the tape to the public immediately. Crawford was 22 years old when he and his girlfriend went to the Walmart last month in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. They planned to pick up the ingredients for s'mores for a family cookout. Crawford had two young children. While browsing, he picked up an unpackaged BB gun from one of the store shelves, and continued shopping. A man named Ronald Ritchie saw him and called 911. A black man was ""walking around with a gun in the store,"" and ""pointing it at people,"" Ritchie told them. A few minutes later, Crawford was dead -- shot on sight by police. His last words? ""It's not real."" The gun was a toy, and it was unloaded. (Absurdly, if Crawford had been carrying a loaded assault weapon in a threatening manner, it would have been legal under Ohio's open carry laws. This is exactly why gun safety advocates like myself have so long criticized these laws for creating a culture of fear.) Was Ritchie more likely to see phantom danger and call the cops because Crawford was a black man? Were those cops more likely to pull the trigger -- by all accounts, without warning Crawford -- because Crawford was black? In other words, is Crawford dead today because he was black in America? The answer is clearly: Yes. But not for the reasons you think -- and that is why it is all the more important that this tape see the light of day. Our modern conception of racism is as a binary condition. You are either racist -- a monster, the epitome of bigotry -- or no racist at all. Night and day. Good and evil. Dare I say, black and white. But that is not what science tells us. Flash faces up on a screen and ask people to identify which ones are dangerous, and people will subtly pick those with darker skin. Ask them to play a video game where they shoot only bad guys wielding weapons, and they are marginally more likely to ""make a mistake"" when the unarmed figure is black. Scientists call it ""implicit bias."" And the shocking thing? It appears not just in those who are openly bigoted, but even among believers in racial equality (including many black people ourselves). In other words, when it comes to racial attitudes, science has proven both right and left wrong. Racism is not a thing of the past; bias still lurks in our minds, despite ourselves. So conservatives are wrong when they insist that race is a non-issue and that everyone should ""move on."" They should really stop accusing anyone who raises the issue of ""just playing the race card."" Science is not on their side. On the other hand, progressives need to do a better job of acknowledging that MLK's message of inclusion has had a huge impact -- at least at a conscious level. We have moved from a society that condoned slavery and segregation for centuries, to a society in which only a very small number of people are consciously hostile. That said: racism is a lingering virus -- alive in all of us, transmitted by a culture that devalues black faces. It is too often lethal to those with dark skin on the wrong end of a gun. I cannot help but think that it could have been me or my two sons shopping for toys. Would my Yale degree stop a bullet? Would the fact that their father is on TV have been enough to save my children? The only way to overcome this virus is to face its existence openly and honestly. That starts with being unafraid to discover what happened to John Crawford. And step one in that mission is for Walmart to bow to the request of the Crawford family, and the thousands who have signed a Color of Change petition, and release the surveillance tape. Crawford's family says the video demonstrates that their son was never a threat, and that he was gunned down in cold blood. Even Ronald Ritchie, the man who called the police, has changed his story -- saying that Crawford never pointed a gun at anyone -- after seeing this tape. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine claims releasing the tape to the public would bias the jury. But he apparently has no problem showing the tape to Ritchie, a witness for the prosecution, to get his facts straight. Nor is he apparently concerned about rampant media speculation that Crawford had a criminal record (the charges were dropped), as if Crawford somehow deserved to be gunned down. Walmart is the largest employer of black people in the country, and black Americans make up a huge portion of their customers. The retail giant has an obligation to make sure that we feel safe in their stores. If DeWine will not release the video, Walmart should. Recently, a young woman in New Jersey crashed her BMW into three cars and assaulted a police officer. Officers did not fire a single shot. She was white. She is alive. John Crawford, Michael Brown and so many others are not. Releasing a tape will not bring John Crawford III or any of the others back. But if it forces us to confront the lingering realities of racial bias, perhaps some good will come of all this.","John Crawford III, who was shopping, was shot by a white police officer in Walmart .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Everything about the rebooted Delta Flight Museum screams, ""AIRPLANES!"" Even outside its entrance, I'm greeted by aviation decorations. Lined up in a row like Roman columns are three struts of Boeing 757 landing gear embedded into the front of the building. Welcome to the Delta Flight Museum, home to some of the airline industry's historic jewels, including a first-of-its-kind aircraft that pioneered the sophisticated planes we fly on today. This could be the best aviation museum you've never heard of. I'm champing at the bit to see a few highlights, including: . • The cockpit from the first Convair 880-22, once the world's fastest airliner . • A nose-to-wing section of the first L-1011 TriStar that served as a Hollywood movie set . • The airline's beloved ""Spirit of Delta,"" a huge 1980s-era Boeing 767 . • Arguably the world's most meticulously restored DC-3, among history's most important airliners . Yep, it's enough to make an aviation geek play hooky and get lost among all the sleek, metallic technology. But this place also appeals to nonaviation aficionados, thanks to its collection of stylish luggage and Delta uniforms. Then there's the museum's JFK airport rescue project. I'll tell you about that in a minute. For years access to the museum was limited to Delta employees and their friends. But last summer the airline closed it for a complete overhaul. In June, it opened to the public for the first time. Appropriately, the museum takes up two hangars on Delta's corporate headquarters, next to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Once you step inside, you're met with an amazing 1940 DC-3 airliner called Ship 41. When sunlight pours through the hangar windows, it bounces off the aluminum surface of this twin-propeller tail-dragger. Beginning in the mid-1930s, more than 14,000 commercial and military versions of the plane came off the Douglas Aircraft production lines, popularizing airline travel across much of America. Each DC-3 seated from 21 to 24 passengers. Astonishingly, hundreds are still flying worldwide today thanks to an airframe that pilots describe as one of the toughest ever. The unbelievable airliner that just won't quit . Restoring this silver-skinned beauty was a triumph for a handful of retired Delta employees, who took it apart and rebuilt it in the 1990s, returning it to nearly as good as new. ""No other DC-3 in the world has been restored with such attention to detail,"" says the museum website. Delta says Ship 41 is the first aircraft to earn an award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Take a video tour inside the meticulously refurbished airliner . Next, take a walk through a darkened, circular portal and emerge into another hangar. Suddenly, you're sharing a room with a quarter-million-pound, five-story-tall Delta Boeing 767-232. It's right there in front of you, fully accessible for avgeeks who can't help caressing its underbelly and nuzzling up to its twin General Electric CF6-80A engines. A few interesting facts about this plane: . • In a gesture of solidarity, Delta employees raised $30 million to purchase it for the airline during tough economic times in 1982. • With a capacity of 204 passengers and six crew members, the plane flew until 2006 before retiring to the museum. • When you get on board, you walk through a first class section that's frozen in time. The armrests include passenger phones and audio controls. The bulkheads are decorated with pinstripes. A video screen is mounted on the wall. The sound system uses speakers mounted in the overhead bins. In the rear, the plane becomes a mini-museum, with displays featuring items like airline uniforms and insignia pins. Just steps away sits the cockpit from the first Convair 880-22, serial number 01. The Convair 880 was an unsung airliner classic, flying for Delta from 1960 to 1973. It was good enough for the king of rock 'n' roll. Elvis bought one in 1975, naming it for his daughter, Lisa Marie, and painting on the letters ""TCB."" Just a little reminder that the plane was ""Takin' care of business."" The museum's Convair 880 cockpit was the nerve center for the very first 880 test plane. Later the aircraft joined the fleet at TWA. ""Some of the other jets we'd compare to pickup trucks, but this was like a sports car -- like a Porsche,"" Capt. Frank Bottoms Sr., a retired Delta Convair 880 pilot, told me. Like a Porsche, the jet was a speed demon, with a cruising speed of 586 mph, according to the museum. In 1959, the 880 was known as the fastest airliner in the world, according to Popular Mechanics. Three years later, Delta set a commercial speed record with an 880, hitting 715 mph, according to the museum. That's fast even by today's standards. As Bottoms flew 880s in the '60s and '70s between Houston, New York, Chicago and Miami, the plane ""was something you were proud to be in,"" he recalled, calling it ""the cream-of-the-crop"" airliner. ""The passengers loved it, and we loved it."" The museum also contains another piece of airline history you can't find anywhere else: a nose-to-wing section of the very first Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, serial number 1001. Oh, if this triple-engined jet could talk! It might tell stories about the test flights it flew for Lockheed in the 1970s. Or it might reveal tales about when it served as a movie set for 1992's ""Passenger 57,"" starring Wesley Snipes, and Bill Murray's ""Quick Change"" from 1990. Pilots loved the L-1011 for its efficiency and reduced engine noise. For a while, it was sometimes called the Whisperliner. Bottoms, who also flew L-1011s, said both planes were so reliable they could almost land themselves under the right conditions. ""They were such stable airplanes -- no wild gyrations of having to move the controls,"" he said. The museum offers several handy touchscreens with all kinds of cool data about the planes. But the best interactive exhibit is an actual flight deck simulator that was used to train Delta 737-200 pilots. If you're over age 16, a rare opportunity to ""fly"" the simulator for 45 minutes will cost you about $400. As you exit through the gift shop, notice another piece of history hanging above the doorway: a sign that reads simply, ""Delta Air Lines."" It doesn't mean much, until you know where it came from. It was a rescue. Delta saved the sign from the now-demolished Worldport, aka Terminal 3, at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Built by Pan Am in 1960, the flying saucer-shaped building became a symbol of the excitement and glamor surrounding the early days of the Jet Age. Delta operated the terminal after Pan Am folded in 1991 until the airport tore it down in 2013 to create an aircraft parking lot. The sign was too important to leave behind. It's ""iconic and seemed to beg to be preserved,"" said Delta's Ashley Black. Workers carefully took it apart and trucked it nearly a thousand miles to Atlanta, where Delta's Technical Ops Center refurbished it to like-new condition, rewiring it with LED lighting. It all adds up to a surprising number of one-of-a-kind exhibits for a small museum tucked between the airline's corporate offices. Even for folks who don't get all hot and bothered about airplanes, it's a spot worth visiting during a long airport layover.","Delta Flight Museum has recently opened near Atlanta's airport .

"(CNN) -- Why would former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez allegedly ""orchestrate the execution"" of Odin Lloyd, leaving him shot seven times and his body near a construction pile in an industrial park? The motive was something trivial, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Investigators believe Hernandez' s simmering anger over two incidents at a nightclub and his apartment led him to allegedly kill Lloyd two nights later, CNN has learned. Hernandez ""drove the victim to the remote spot, and then he orchestrated his execution,"" Assistant District Attorney Bill McCauley said last year. One of the incidents involved Lloyd seeing guns and ammunition stored at Hernandez' so-called flop house, his apartment in Franklin, Massachusetts. The other thing that set off Hernandez was a conversation Lloyd had with two men at a club earlier that night, June 14, 2013, a source tells CNN. The cumulative effect apparently reached a breaking point for reasons that most people would find inconsequential. The source would not say what that was, but compared it to something as insignificant as a spilled drink that allegedly led to the 2012 Boston double murder of Safiro Furtado and Daniel Abreu, a separate case in which Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty. Lloyd's killing did not involve possible knowledge of that double murder as investigators previously considered, the source added. Who was Odin Lloyd? Hernandez's anger was fueled by paranoia brought on, in part, by his alleged drug use including angel dust and marijuana, the source said. The motive was hinted at in court this week, when new details emerged about the events at Rumor nightclub where Hernandez and some friends partied before moving to Hernandez' apartment about 10 miles from his home. Lloyd, a semi-pro football player and Hernandez were dating sisters. Prosecutors say Hernandez appeared upset at the club. They describe him appearing agitated on security video. Witnesses describe him with his arms waving in the air and a parking valet saw the football player put a gun in his waistband when he got into his vehicle, according to authorities. ""An incident had occurred that caused him to arm himself,"" McCauley told a judge. Hernandez' s lawyer told a judge that his client's friends said the incident at the club was not a problem. When Hernandez and Lloyd left, they went to the tight end's apartment accompanied by two women to party, prosecutors say. Whatever happened involving the guns and bullets at the apartment and earlier at the nightclub, Lloyd didn't think it was a big deal, according to friends who saw him the following two days leading up to his death. They said he only talked about having a good time with Hernandez. ""There's certainly a lot of what I would call smoke,"" defense attorney Jamie Sultan said in court. ""There's no doubt about it ... But that's not probable cause that he committed murder. And you can't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that's good enough."" The fallen Patriot's alleged behavior, as described by investigators, appears to follow a bizarre pattern that has resulted in three murder charges, and a lawsuit accusing him of shooting a friend in the face and leaving him for dead. In each case, authorities say, the violence was preceded by something perceived as disrespect or betrayal. In July 2012, Hernandez is charged with fatally shooting two men in a car after one of them, a stranger, bumped into Hernandez on the dance floor at a night club, causing the athlete to spill his drink, according to Boston's district attorney. Hernandez felt he was being ""tested,"" a friend is quoted as telling investigators, prompting Hernandez to follow the men out of the club and kill them in a drive by shooting. That same friend identified in court papers as Alexander Bradley is now suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face and leaving him for dead in an industrial park in south Florida in February 2013. Prosecutors say Hernandez felt 'disrespected' by Bradley because he challenged him after the football player refused to return to a strip club to retrieve Bradley's cellphone. In court, prosecutor McCauley said according to Bradley, trust was a big deal to Hernandez. ""The more he got to know you ... the more suspicious he was,"" McCauley told the judge. ""He was concerned (about) the things that you knew about him ... Odin Lloyd knew such things about the defendant."" Four months later, in June, 2013, Lloyd was picked up in a car said to be driven by Hernandez with two of his associates, taken to an industrial park, shot and killed, according to prosecutors. Those associates, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with first-degree murder and like Hernandez, have pleaded not guilty. His lawyers this week filed a motion asking a court to authorize a subpoena demanding Hernandez's work and medical records from the New England Patriots, including records that ""may bear upon (Hernandez') mental state at the time ... of Lloyd's murder."" Legal experts say the motion indicates the defense may be leaning toward arguing Hernandez suffers from diminished capacity, a legal term for someone who is less responsible for committing a crime because it's harder for them to know the difference between right and wrong.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two blasts went off Wednesday as the governor of Helmand province was headed to Kandahar to take part in the funeral for President Hamid Karzai's half-brother. The remotely-detonated mine explosions in Kandahar's Maivand district wounded two soldiers but the Helmand governor,  Mohammad Gulab Mangal, was unhurt, his office said. Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Kandahar provincial council chief, was killed Tuesday by a guard during a gathering at his house a day earlier. He was laid to rest Wednesday, with the president in attendance, said Hashim Watanwal, a Kandahar lawmaker. Saidkhan Khakrezwal, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, told CNN he and others were with Karzai when a guard named Sardar Mohammad came into the room and asked to talk to him. The guard then ""takes Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand,"" Khakrezwal said. The shooter was shot dead by other guards. Sardar Mohammad was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for Karzai for eight years, Khakrezwal said. He was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them. Karzai suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest, said Mohammad Dawood Farhad, the head of Kandahar Hospital. ""My brother Ahmad Wali Karzai was killed today,"" said the Afghan president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ""The Afghanistan people have suffered a lot. Every Afghan family has suffered. I hope one day these sufferings end."" Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations, had been the subject of WikiLeaks cables leaked last year. Without being prompted, he discussed the accusations with a senior U.S. diplomat, according to one of the cables. He said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing. ""He is willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his innocence,"" the cable said. ""He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation."" A U.S. official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of Kandahar's provincial council, ""he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker."" He said Karzai's ""reputation for shady dealings"" should be considered when he recommends ""costly infrastructure projects. The official said dealing with people like Ahmed Wali Karzai represents a major challenge in Afghanistan: Fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves. Karzai ""appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign, particularly relating to his influence over the police,"" the author of the first cable said. Journalist Reshad Fazel contributed to this report.","NEW: The president is in attendance as his brother is laid to rest .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has condemned working conditions in Qatar as ""unacceptable"" after an Amnesty International report claimed migrant worker abuse was rife in the country which will host the 2022 World Cup. The head of world football's governing body was speaking after a meeting with International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) president Michael Sommer in Zurich, during which the pair agreed ""fair working conditions must be introduced quickly, consistently and on a sustained basis in Qatar."" Blatter met with the Emir of Qatar earlier this month in Doha, holding a news conference afterwards in which he claimed Qatar was addressing criticisms over its treatment of migrant workers. ""Economic and political leaders must contribute to improving the unacceptable situation in Qatar,"" Blatter said in a statement on Thursday. ""I am convinced that Qatar is taking the situation very seriously. These very discussions about Qatar show just what an important role football can play in generating publicity and thus bringing about change."" Blatter has assigned Dr. Theo Zwanziger, a member of the FIFA executive committee which voted in 2010 to award the World Cup to Qatar, to continue talks with the ITUC -- the world's largest trade union federation -- and human rights organizations. ""The aim is to be in a position to report on concrete measures for Qatar at the Executive Committee meeting in March 2014,"" said Zwanziger. ""Large companies must be reminded of their duties in this area. The international community must also accept its responsibility. ""Qatar must guarantee the International Labour Organisation's core labor standards and thus eliminate discrimination and forced labour as well as allow freedom of association for its 1.3 million migrant workers,"" added Sommer. The meeting at FIFA headquarters was mediated by German Football Federation president Wolfgang Niersbach, who said the World Cup coming to Qatar will help improve conditions in the country. ""The awarding of the World Cup and the considerable public exposure gives us the opportunity to point out irregularities and to exact lasting change,"" said Niersbach. ""If we succeed, then a lot will have been achieved."" Following the publication of the Amnesty report, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, which oversees Qatar's World Cup plans, promised to release new ""Workers' Welfare Standards"" regarding recruitment, pay, housing and repatriation policies for foreign workers by the end of this year. The standards, it said, will be ""aligned with Qatari law and international best practice."" It said that it held a ""productive discussion"" with Amnesty International over the weekend about worker treatment, and agreed to continue talks in the run-up to the event. The committee also said all contracts related to its projects will be enshrined in the Qatar 2022 Workers' Charter to protect workers' rights. In response to Amnesty's allegations, the director of the Human Rights Department at Qatar's Foreign Ministry said laws are in place to protect workers from mistreatment . ""In the event that the Ministry of Labor becomes aware that the employer has not adhered to the contract ... then it will take all legal means and measures against the employer,"" the agency wrote to Amnesty.","FIFA president Sepp Blatter calls conditions for migrant workers in Qatar ""unacceptable""

"(CNN) -- Iran won't be attending this week's international peace conference on Syria because it won't embrace the framework laid out in a previous conference, U.N. and Iranian officials said Monday. The last-minute invitation to Iran, a leading Syrian ally, had threatened to derail the talks after the leading Syrian opposition group and the United States spoke out against it. Louay Safi, a spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, called Iran's attendance ""a deal-breaker."" Iran announced Monday afternoon that it would not accept ""any preconditions"" for joining the talks, slated to begin Wednesday in Switzerland. That includes acceptance of the communique issued at the first Geneva conference in 2012, said Mohammad Khazaee, Tehran's U.N. ambassador. ""If the participation of Iran is conditioned to accept Geneva I communique, Iran will not participate in Geneva II conference,"" Khazaee said in a written statement Monday afternoon. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif had made a similar declaration on Iranian state TV earlier Monday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who issued the invitation Sunday, believed he had Iran's assurance that it accepted the original Geneva declaration, his spokesman, Martin Nesirky, told reporters. ""The secretary-general is deeply disappointed by Iranian public statements today that are not at all consistent with that stated commitment,"" Nesirky said.The declaration ""remains the internationally agreed framework for ending the crisis,"" he said -- and without Iran's acceptance, this week's conference ""will proceed without Iran's participation,"" he added. The goal of the talks is to set up a transitional government to help end the violence that has wracked the country. The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011. The Geneva I communique calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war. Monday's news capped a day of what Ban described as ""intensive and urgent"" discussions."" Gruesome Syria photos may prove torture by Assad regime . The opposition coalition initially set a 2 p.m. ET deadline for its conditions to be met. When that time passed, the coalition said it would await Ban's decision before making any moves on its own. Safi told CNN that Ban ""did the right thing"" by withdrawing Iran's invitation. And in Washington, the State Department praised the move. ""We are hopeful that, in the wake of today's announcement, all parties can now return to focus on the task at hand, which is bringing an end to the suffering of the Syrian people and beginning a process toward a long overdue political transition,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Western intelligence officials believe Iran has provided fighters, intelligence and communications to support al-Assad. In addition, fighters from the Iranian-backed Shiite militia Hezbollah have seen combat in Syria on the side of the government. Most outside support for rebel forces has come from the Persian Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. U.S. aid has been limited largely to non-lethal assistance such as communications gear and medical equipment, and American officials have struggled with how to back opposition groups without providing weapons to those linked to Islamic militants. Syrian opposition votes to attend Geneva 2 peace talks . A preliminary international session is scheduled for Wednesday in Montreux, Switzerland, with talks between the Syrian government and opposition delegations slated to begin Friday in Geneva. Al-Assad has called for the conference to include a focus on ""fighting terrorism"" in Syria. Throughout the civil war, Syria has blamed violence on ""terrorists."" ""The obvious matter that we continuously talk about, is that we like Geneva conference to have clear resolution concerning fighting terrorism in Syria, and put pressure on the countries that export terrorism to Syria, by sending terrorists to Syria, sending money to terrorist organizations and sending weapons, especially Saudi and Turkey, and of course the western countries who create political cover for these organizations,"" al-Assad said in an interview with AFP. Saudi Arabia and Turkey have denied similar accusations from Syria in the past. Any political resolution that comes out of the talks ""without considering fighting terrorism will have no value,"" al-Assad added. 'Iran needs to be part of the solution' Damascus softens its stance as talks near . Ban announced the invitation to Iran at a surprise news conference Sunday night. ""As I have said repeatedly, I believe strongly that Iran needs to be part of the solution to the Syrian crisis,"" Ban said, adding that he has spoken ""at length"" with Zarif in recent days. ""He has assured me that, like all the other countries invited to the opening day discussions in Montreux, Iran understands that the basis of the talks is the full implementation of the 30 June 2012 Geneva Communique, including the Action Plan. ""Foreign Minister Zarif and I agree that the goal of the negotiations is to establish, by mutual consent, a transitional governing body with full executive powers. It was on that basis that Foreign Minister Zarif pledged that Iran would play a positive and constructive role in Montreux,"" Ban said. On Monday, two car bombs exploded in northern Syria near a border crossing with Turkey, killing 10 people, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. The Bab al Hawa border crossing has been has been one of the main terminals for sending supplies from Turkey into rebel-held portions of Syria, though it has been closed during periods of violence on the Syrian side of the border. Monday's bombing was the latest attack there. Last February, an explosion rocked a customs gate on the Turkish side, killing at least 13 people, the Turkish government said. Syrian rebels first overran the Syrian border gate at Bab el Hawa in the summer of 2012, flushing out government forces after days of fighting, though different groups have battled for control of the area since. The Syrian side of the border gate currently is held by an Islamist militant group, opposition activists say. Photos: Haunting images of Syria's abandoned homes .

"(CNN) -- Eugenie Bouchard fell at the semifinal hurdle in the first two grand slams of 2014, but it was third time lucky for her at the All England Club. The Canadian made the last four at both the Australian and French Opens this year only to succumb to defeats, yet there was no such repeat at Wimbledon this time around. Bouchard saw off third-seed Simona Halep -- the highest seed left in the tournament -- 7-6 6-2 on Centre Court Thursday to reach her first-ever grand slam final. And the 20-year-old can now become the first Canadian female in history to win a major singles title if she can pull off a victory in Saturday's showpiece. A highly-anticipated semifinal was at first as gripping as expected, with the 13th seed needing a tie-break to edge a neck-and-neck first set. The second, however, was all Bouchard's, as the former Wimbledon junior champion outclassed her opponent -- who needed ankle treatment early in the match -- to book her place in the final. ""This is what I've worked for,"" she said after her comprehensive victory. ""But it's not a surprise to me. I expect good results like this. It's a step in the right direction. I get to play in the final. I still have another match so it's not a full celebration yet."" Waiting for her is Petra Kvitova, who saw off Lucie Safarova 7-6 6-1 in the day's earlier semifinal. The Czech has struggled to build on her first grand slam title since winning at the All England Club in 2011, but is now one match away from repeating that success. Kvitova claimed the women's singles championship at Wimbledon at the age of 21, yet she has previously been unable to advance past the final four of a major in the years that have past. With compatriot Safarova coming into the match having yet to drop a set in the tournament, some fancied her to spring an upset and progress past her first-ever grand slam semifinal to reach Saturday's showpiece match. However, sixth-seed Kvitova broke her opponent at first attempt, before going on to take a tight first set 7-6, winning 8-6 in the tie-break. Seven games later and the 23rd seed had dropped her second set of the tournament, meaning the world number six had booked her place in her second Wimbledon final. Semifinal spots at the French and Australian Opens have had to tide Kvitova over since that 2011 success, but now only Bouchard stands in the way of her securing a second grand slam title. ""I know how it feels to hold the trophy. I really want to win my second title here and I will do everything I can,"" Kvitova told Wimbledon's official website. ""It was a tough match mentally because Lucie is a good friend of mine. I knew she would play her best tennis and she did. I'm just happy I won definitely.""","Eugenie Bouchard beat Simona Halep 7-6 6-2 in Wimbledon women's semifinal .

"(CNN) -- A former Rwandan minister has been jailed for life for genocide and incitement to rape at the United Nations-backed court for Rwanda in Tanzania. Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, who is the only woman to be convicted by the court, was minister for family and women's affairs in the Rwandan government when some 800,000 people, mainly ethnic Tutsis, were killed in 1994. She was accused of direct and public incitement to commit genocide and of being responsible for rape ""as part of a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic and racial grounds,"" the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said. Her son, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, a militia leader who was jointly charged in the case, was also convicted Friday of genocide, crimes against humanity including rape and persecution and war crimes, and sentenced to life in prison. Four local officials who were accused alongside Nyiramasuhuko and her son were all found guilty of genocide and other charges. They were handed prison terms ranging from 25 years to life. Nyiramasuhuko, who was arrested in 1997 in Kenya, and taken to the U.N. court in Tanzania to await trial, was found guilty of seven of the counts she faced, ICTR spokesman Roland Amoussouga told CNN. They included charges of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity including rape and persecution. Two charges were dismissed, one of complicity to commit genocide and a second relating to murder and crimes against humanity. She was also cleared of two charges, one alleging direct and public incitement to commit genocide and another of inhumane acts and crimes against humanity. The court found that Nyiramasuhuko was a member of the Interim Government that issued directives whose intention ""was to encourage the population to hunt down and take action against the 'enemy' and its 'accomplices'; terms which referred to Tutsis in general."" Nyiramasuhuko also participated in many Cabinet meetings at which the massacre of Tutsis was discussed, ""and she took part in the decisions that triggered the onslaught of massacres in Butare prefecture."" Between April and mid-June 1994, hundreds of Tutsis were rounded up by militia members in her home district of Butare and many subjected to assaults and rape, the court said. During this time, Nyiramasuhuko ordered killings and ""aided and abetted rapes"" of vulnerable civilians, some of which were committed by her son, the court said. The six sentenced Friday will remain in detention in Tanzania pending an appeals process. If their convictions are upheld, the head of the tribunal will then decide what state to transfer them to to serve their sentences, said Amoussouga, the ICTR spokesman. The ICTR said it had been a complex and lengthy case, involving 189 witnesses and almost 13,000 pages of documents. While Nyiramasuhuko is the only woman to have been convicted by the ICTR, other women have been jailed for their roles in the genocide by courts elsewhere. A Roman Catholic nun was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a traditional Rwandan court in 2006 for her part in the killings. Two other Catholic nuns were found guilty of genocide charges by a court in Belgium in 2001. The Rwandan genocide was triggered by the April 6, 1994, shooting down of a plane carrying the nation's Hutu president. Ethnic violence erupted and Tutsis were killed systematically by Hutus. The United Nations estimates that some 200,000 people participated in the perpetration of the Rwandan genocide. In all, 800,000 men, women, and children -- mostly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus -- died. CNN's Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","Nyiramasuhuko is the only woman to be convicted by the U.N.-backed court for Rwanda .

"(CNN) -- Ten years before comic book heroes dominated box office real estate, there was a small-screen superhero named Veronica Mars. She didn't have the strength and speed (or technology, for that matter) of the caped fantasies that we now see with regularity at the movies, but she did have capabilities that made her heroic in the eyes of teens and adults who craved a young, female character with intelligence, wit and, most of all, confidence. Created by Rob Thomas, ""Veronica Mars"" was introduced in 2004, starring Kristen Bell (""Frozen"") as Veronica, a high school student living in fictional Neptune, California, who went from popular to outcast after the murder of her very wealthy best friend (played by Amanda Seyfried). Veronica was determined to find out who committed the crime to the point of ostracizing herself, which wasn't hard to do after her father was raked over the coals for pinning the murder on the wrong guy. Fairly typical mystery series stuff, right? Yet the real beauty of the show was never in Veronica's search or the cases she cracked along the way; it was in her total embrace of her outsider status and her refusal to be treated differently because of it. Life could suck, and many unfair things happened to Veronica and her friends, but she always rebounded with spunk and smarts. ""Other girls on television, like Buffy (on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') or 'Alias,' they could literally kick a**,"" creator Thomas recently said. ""I felt like Veronica's superpower could be that she just doesn't give a s*** what people think about her."" That attitude has gone a long, long way. While ""Veronica Mars"" the TV series was a cult hit that wound up canceled after three seasons, those who did watch were so devoted to the character and her multicultural, multiclass beach town that they single-handedly got a film version off the ground via Kickstarter. CNN Money: Will 'Veronica Mars' be a hit? For those who never got into the teen drama, the idea of a fan base strong enough to drum up $2 million in less than 12 hours to resurrect a TV character was nothing short of insane. But that would be underestimating the world Thomas and his crew created. ""Veronica was the best friend I would beg not to go to Europe,"" Bell told Entertainment Weekly in a February issue. The actress, 33, reprises her role in the film version, which sees Veronica returning to Neptune to solve a murder case that involves her ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring). ""I feel so much responsibility to the girls that this show affected,"" Bell went on. ""There is a role model here that I care about. I think when you get that amount of love from a fan base, you would be an a**hole not to give it back."" Those who supported reuniting the ""Veronica Mars"" team on film -- and it does reunite everyone, from main characters to actors who had guest arcs -- are getting that love returned on March 14, when ""Veronica Mars"" the movie will debut in theaters and as Video On Demand. 'Veronica Mars' love triangle resolved? It's still up in the air whether Veronica will have better luck as a big-screen hero than she did on TV, and can draw in a larger audience this time around. Yet even if ""Mars"" doesn't find much life at the theaters, Thomas, Bell and company can rest easy knowing they've already left an indelible mark on pop culture. Here are five ways they did: . 1. It featured a smart, young, kick-a** heroine. When ""Veronica Mars"" debuted, it arrived in a TV landscape populated by soapy teen dramas like ""The O.C."" and ""One Tree Hill,"" and reality series like ""America's Next Top Model."" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" had staked her last vamp the year before, and the best place to find women who weren't presented as being one-dimensionally focused on looks or their romantic lives -- or damaged and in need of being rescued -- was in prime time, with shows like ""Charmed"" (about a trio of sister witches) and ""Alias"" (about a take-no-prisoners international spy). But ""Mars"" was the place to go if you wanted a character who felt like a teen girl you would actually meet in high school, albeit one who had way better one-liners and better time management skills. (This was a character with the caseload of a working private investigator who was still dead serious about her homework.) Fearless, focused and funny, she made individualism look so much better than fitting in. 2. It featured a strictly platonic relationship. The TV trope of an opposite sex friendship is so well-worn that we know as soon as we see a pair of male and female buds that there will be something more eventually. But on ""Veronica Mars,"" the plot refreshingly never went there. One of Veronica's closest friends is a guy named Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III), a companion whose shoulder she can cry on and whom she would readily help out in a jam, but with whom she's an equal, not a romantic interest. For once, the teens who tuned in were shown that yes, a nonsexual friendship between men and women can work. 3. It had a strong father-daughter relationship. After ""Mars"" fans kicked in the funds needed to launch a ""Veronica Mars"" movie, their collective breath was held until stars like Enrico Colantoni were a sure deal. As Keith Mars, Veronica's dad, Colantoni was the older, wiser heart of the series. He wasn't always the best parent but he was a realistic one, and his relationship with Veronica was the foundation of the show. When everything else came crashing down around her, Veronica always had her dad -- the sort of comforting story that you don't see in a lot of teen TV, where the parents are often worse off than their kids. 4. It proved that teen dramas could thoughtfully deal with tough issues. From rape to class tensions, bullying to predatory older men, ""Veronica Mars"" had an endless supply of plot lines that wouldn't be out of place on an after-school special. What saved the series wasn't its commitment to talking about complex problems but the way in which they were talked about. The script brought real issues into a fictional world, and still made them relatable. The topic of race, for example, wasn't danced around; it could crop up in a natural exchange between characters. The subject of classism was virtually the backbone of the entire series, as much of the plot's tension revolved around the wealthy kids who came from a rich ZIP code and the have-nots they shunned. 5. It showed that nothing ever really dies in Hollywood. By industry logic, this show should have fallen to the wayside and enjoyed a life only on fan sites and in DVD sales of its three seasons.

"(CNN) -- Marla Frazee can remember the moment she pulled ""Where the Wild Things Are"" by Maurice Sendak out of the library shelves filled with picture books. Frazee, a two-time Caldecott-Honor winner for ""A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever"" and ""All the World,"" was already 8 years old. But the budding illustrator was completely absorbed by the images she found in picture books. ""Even though I was already a reader, what blew me away were the pictures, and specifically the three pages where Max's bedroom turns into a forest,"" said Frazee. ""I remember sitting back on my heels floored by the magic of that scene. How did he change the original bedroom into a forest in just these three pages? I paged back and forth to see how it happened."" Parents who grew up on the books of Maurice Sendak and the children's book authors and illustrators he influenced mourned his death Tuesday. Sendak, who illustrated nearly 100 books over the course of his career, died from complications after a stroke, according to his publisher, HarperCollins. Children's literature as an art form . Sendak elevated the art of children's literature over the course of his 60-year career, portraying children as imperfect, normal in their range of feelings and worthy of complex and profound illustrations in their stories. ""He opened the door for everyone who has come since in the children's book world to write about the powerful emotional experiences of young children,"" said Leonard Marcus, a historian of children's literature. ""Prior to 'Where the Wild Things Are,' you didn't see young children throwing tantrums in picture books. Informed by psychology, he was showing young children that those powerful unnamable feelings that they had were a natural part of being. He was also showing that to parents around the world, helping them to understand something that was alarming to them."" iReport: RIP Mr. Sendak and a ""Where the Wild Things Are"" tattoo . ""Arthur"" series creator Marc Brown credits Sendak with making him aware of picture books ""as a powerful expression of art and ideas."" ""My first Sendak experience was reading 'Where the Wild Things Are' to my little sister and a giant light bulb went off over my head: This is something I want to do,"" wrote Brown, creator of the Arthur Adventure series and creative producer of the accompanying children's PBS television program. ""The power of his images and the sparse verse that told volumes was very moving."" Inspiring future illustrators to interact with their audiences . ""Where the Wild Things Are"" reminds children's author and illustrator Todd Parr of childhood cuddle time with his grandmother. ""As an artist, it was Max and all the different faces of the monsters that inspired me to want to draw them,"" he said. ""As a storyteller, it taught me how to engage my audience, and make them part of my books -- not just sit there and be quiet."" The books remain popular because Sendak told the truth about children's lives, according to John Sellers, children's reviews editor at Publishers Weekly. ""He never backed away from addressing the darker side of childhood in his stories, and it's because of that respect and honesty that his books are so treasured,"" said Sellers. Philadelphia mother Tara Desmond can remember reading Sendak's books during her elementary school years in the 1980s, and the whimsical world he crafted. ""My parents transformed our cellar into a play space (in the early 1980s) and there were great big aluminum cutouts of the monsters from 'Where the Wild Things Are' on the walls,"" Desmond said. ""We spent a lot of time down there playing, so every time I see those monsters, I have a flashback to seeing them on the way downstairs. Some kids are scared of them, but they always seem like happy hosts to a land of imagination to me."" 'God bless milk and God bless me!' Now Desmond reads ""In the Night Kitchen"" to her 2-year-old daughter. ""Despite the strangeness of naked Mickey tumbling through the sky and into a giant bottle of milk, the colors and pictures and dialogue of that book catapult me back to being captivated by all of it as a kid, and snickering with my brother at the scandalous anatomical detail,"" she said. Recently at breakfast, her daughter quoted the book, saying, ""God bless milk and God bless me!"" Since reading Sendak's most famous work to her children (ages 3 and 5), Shannon Dingle has noticed that they turn any ordinary drive into an adventure with wild things. ""They love acting things out and imagining, and are very big into the wild and jungles,"" said Dingle, of Raleigh, North Carolina. ""If there are trees on either side of the road, they are imagining wild things in the trees even when we're just driving down the road."" Spike Jonze: the connection between Sendak and Yauch . Just as Sendak kindled a spark of creativity in Marla Frazee and Marc Brown all those years ago, it seems that children hearing his stories today are inspired to create. After San Diego mother Sarah Hilliard read ""Pierre: A Cautionary Tale in Five Chapters and a Prologue"" to her 5-year-old son, he recruited his parents to help him make a movie from the book. ""The most remarkable thing for me about my child's connection to Sendak is that the books inspire him to create his own art and to think about art and literature in bigger ways,"" said Hilliard. ""It's not just a story to read; it's the realization of whole other worlds to explore and create. "" What is your favorite Maurice Sendak book?

"(CNN) -- To create the future of Polish cuisine, chef Wojciech Amaro looked to the 16th century for inspiration. During a year-long odyssey to discover the origins of Poland's classic dishes, the 40-year old chef tracked down food historians and visited auction houses across the country to bid on dusty, leather-bound tomes that held the secrets of traditional recipes and long-forgotten ingredients. ""I wanted to find the roots of recipes and what the original idea was behind them,"" he says. ""I realized I could talk for hours about Polish products, but I couldn't think of any (Polish dishes) that would stand at the same level."" The spark for Amaro's desire to improve and update Polish cuisine was a month spent working in the kitchen of El Bulli with Ferran Adria, the culinary wizard who is often called the world's greatest chef. ""He changed my way of thinking,"" says Amaro, who first began his own epicurean education after dropping out of university to work in the kitchens of London restaurants. From Bialystok in the east to Katowice in the south, Amaro racked up 60,000 kilometers on his journey that also led him to the country's best farmers and food producers, many of whom are now suppliers for Amaro's award-winning restaurant in Warsaw. ""Many of them weren't aware of how great their products were. I took their enthusiasm and passion and added it to my cooking. Some of them struggled to keep up the standard that I needed, but they're growing with me,"" he says. Atelier Amaro has been open for less than a year but became the first Polish restaurant to gain a ""Michelin Rising Star"", indicating that Amaro is on the right track in his quest to elevate Polish cuisine to a new international standard. Amaro puts an emphasis on ingredients and reconstructing dishes from their essential elements, putting him in a similar mold as celebrated ""food scientists"" like Adria, Britain's Heston Blumenthal or Rene Redzepi of the Danish restaurant Noma that was recently voted the world's best restaurant for the third straight year. At Atelier Amaro, classic recipes like hare in cream are reimagined -- ""we cook it for 72 hours at 65 degrees, so its more like fois gras or butter and is eaten with a spoon"" -- while the kitchen is also a lab in which to experiment with Polish ingredients hardly used anymore like chokeberries, wild herbs and edible flowers. As Poles becomes more interested in their culinary culture, Amaro believes the time is now right for Poland to takes it place at the table of internationally respected cuisine. ""We've spent 20 years (since communism) catching up in every department of life -- getting good jobs, starting companies, getting mortgages. Now it's a new country and people are starting to say, 'What about Polish products and our traditions?' ""We can't be amazed anymore by pizza or some French dishes. We are ready to search for our products and be proud of them."" Send in your best photos and videos of Poland . Outside of the country attitudes to Polish food have been slowly improving, says restaurateur Jan Woroneicki, the British owner of London's Baltic restaurant and bar. ""Old school perceptions that its all potatoes and cabbage are being revised, but there are still suspicions,"" he says. ""In soups and stews Polish cooking is equal to or greater than other cuisines, and generally quality is improving, but for restaurants it can still be a bit tricky finding quality produce like charcuterie and supply lines are not great."" Even if Polish gastronomy doesn't challenge cuisine like Thai food as an international phenomenon, Amaro hopes his restaurant can do for Polish food what Noma has done for Nordic cuisine. ""Compared to Denmark, Poland is much more diverse, so if we are wise and careful about promoting Polish cuisine... we can be one of the most influential and really big cuisines like French, Italian and Spanish. There's lots of work to be done, but I think its going to happen.""","Restaurant in Warsaw first in Poland to gain Michelin Rising Star .

"(CNN) -- A 28-year-old woman who said an unknown assailant threw a cup of caustic liquid in her face has admitted her injuries were self-inflicted, Vancouver, Washington, police said Thursday. Bethany Storro was being interviewed by detectives, and whether she will be charged will be up to prosecutors, police said. ""She is extremely upset,"" said police Commander Marla Schuman. ""She is very remorseful. In many ways it got bigger than she expected."" Police would not speculate on Storro's motives, only saying the August 30 incident did not occur as she described and that there were discrepancies in her account, including wearing sunglasses in the evening. They also had questions about the liquid's splash patterns on Storro's face. Officers acquired a search warrant and conducted a search Thursday morning. They removed several undisclosed items, but said they did not find a substance that might have caused her injuries. Vancouver had searched for an assailant, described as an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail. Storro was released from an Oregon hospital on September 5 after undergoing surgery for her injuries after the alleged attack. Police spent hundreds of hours on the case and the community came together to offer donations for Storro's treatment. ""It has had an impact on our community,"" said Police Chief Clifford Cook. ""It has brought negative attention on our community that is undeserved."" Storro's family was also being interviewed, police said. They described her as being in a fragile mental state. Storro credited a new pair of sunglasses -- which she said she bought just 20 minutes before the attack -- with saving her eyesight. ""God is watching over me,"" Storro, of Vancouver, told CNN affiliate KATU in Portland, Oregon, at the time. ""I believe in him. That his hands are on me and I can't live the rest of my life like that -- in fear. I can't let what she did to me wreck my life."" Storro told KATU that she had stopped at a Vancouver Starbucks about 7:15 p.m., just after she had gone back to buy a pair of sunglasses that she had seen earlier. The woman walked up to her and said, ""Hey pretty girl, do you want to drink this?"" When Storro declined, the woman threw the contents of the cup in her face and ran off, Storro claimed at the time.","A Washington state woman made up her claim of an attacker throwing acid, police say .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- McDonald's new ad campaign is taking a non-too-subtle jab at Starbucks. McDonald's placed this billboard near Starbucks' corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Residents in Seattle, Washington, the birthplace of Starbucks, can now see approximately 140 McDonald's billboards emblazoned with ""large is the new grande"" or ""four bucks is dumb."" In a statement released Thursday, McDonald's called it ""a light-hearted, fun approach to our brand,"" aimed at promoting the company's McCafe coffee products. However, Starbucks is not finding the ad campaign funny. ""Comparative campaigns are all well and good but only when they're credible and authentic. If the claim is not supportable or the tone is off, you risk losing credibility,"" Deb Trevino, director of global communications for Starbucks, told CNN. A 12-ounce cup of coffee at Starbucks in Seattle costs just $1.40, only a penny more than the average price for a same size cup at McDonald's. Credibility is something that Starbucks claims it is not short on. A portion of coffee sales currently goes towards health care for Starbucks' baristas, while another goes towards helping AIDS victims in Africa, according to the company. ""We will not enter into a tit-for-tat,"" Trevino said. ""Our customers are interested in more than just the coffee, they come for the experience."" For now, McDonald's said it does not plan to take its ""four bucks is dumb"" campaign nationwide.","McDonald's new ad campaign pokes fun at Starbucks .

"Washington (CNN) -- The smell of exhaust from idling cars fills up the Capitol parking lot. Congressional aides have their engines revved -- ready to whisk their bosses to train stations and airports as soon as they cast their last vote. It's a familiar scene when Congress is getting ready to leave town, especially for an extended period. But this time the race for a six-week respite feels different. There is bipartisan consensus that the United States is now at war with ISIS and that Congress should be a part of the decision-making process on how to deal with that, by passing a new authorization for military force. Bill Clinton: U.S. has proven it can't win an Iraq land war without Iraqis . But Congress took off to go campaign full time to try to keep their jobs rather than staying to do their jobs. ""There is broad agreement in the country that this ISIS group is a threat,"" Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pennsylvania, told CNN. ""So why not stay and debate it and not go home if your constituents believe it's a threat?"" we asked. ""I don't disagree,"" Fattah replied. ""I'm prepared to vote yes. So I'm not ducking any vote."" ""It's ridiculous,"" Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colorado, said a few minutes later. ""As if there is not enough to do and it's not just the war issues, it's immigration reform, ENDA (Employment Nondiscrimination Act) -- it's a number of different bills that have been filed that have bipartisan support,"" Polis said. It is true that rank-and-file House members, especially those like Fattah and Polis who are in the minority party, don't have much choice but to follow the schedule leaders lay out. Still, as we weaved through the slew of waiting cars to talk to lawmakers before they left, it was striking -- but not surprising -- the way blame was tossed around. Republicans blamed the Democrat-controlled Senate. ""The problem is that we have a do-nothing Senate,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said. Republicans also blamed the president. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-North Carolina, said he'd be glad to vote for a new use-of-force authorization against ISIS. ""I wish the President would ask for one,"" Hudson said. Obama: ISIS threat against U.S., allies 'doesn't frighten us' Democrats noted that leaving now has become a tradition to help the House, where Republicans are a majority. ""The House of Representatives runs every two years, and for many, many years the House has adjourned for the month of October."" Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said. Some senators were openly appalled that colleagues were heading home. Freshman Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Nebraska, had publicly urged her colleagues to stay, to no avail. ""We need to be here we need to debate this issue,"" Fischer told us. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is on the ballot in November, but hers is a safe seat. Going home to campaign is not her first priority. ""My job is to be in the Capitol working for the people of Maine and the American people and that's where I think we all belong now,"" said Collins, standing in the Capitol parking lot, pointing to the dome. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who won his big primary fight earlier this year and should face an easy reelection in November, had a trademark pithy synopsis. ""We seem to be more worried about who runs the place than how the place runs,"" he said. Ultimately, all the lawmakers who complained and called it important to stay got in their cars and left, too. There's no reason to stay -- there are no more votes until after the election. Fresh act: 87-year-old felon Edwin Edwards wants back in. CNN's Adam P.

"Washington (CNN) -- Three days after embattled Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko announced his resignation, the White House announced President Barack Obama intends to nominate Allison Macfarlane, a professor at George Mason University, to the agency's top post. ""The President has made clear that we need a strong NRC, and he believes Allison Macfarlane is the right person to lead the Commission,"" White House spokesman Clark Stevens said in a statement. ""Dr. Macfarlane is a highly regarded expert who was a member of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, and has spent years analyzing nuclear issues while at George Mason University, Harvard University as well as at MIT,"" Stevens said. She received her doctorate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and served fellowships at Stanford and Harvard universities during her academic career. Much of Macfarlane's university research has included nuclear energy, and specifically the back-end nuclear fuel cycle, or nuclear waste, according to her George Mason biography. Macfarlane's expertise in nuclear waste disposal and her criticism of plans to dispose nuclear waste at the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Repository in Nevada makes her nomination a more popular choice with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The Yucca Mountain site has long been a political lightening rod for the Nevada senator. In her book, ""Uncertainty Underground: Yucca Mountain and the Nation's High-Level Nuclear Waste,"" Macfarlane claims, ""although geologic repositories are the best solution to the nuclear waste problem, there are substantial uncertainties in projecting the performance of a geologic repository far into the future."" After the White House's announcement, Reid gave Macfarlane a ringing endorsement. ""I am confident that like her predecessor, Dr. Allison Macfarlane will make preserving the safety and security of American citizens her top priority."" Reid called Macfarlane ""eminently qualified"" to lead the NRC for the foreseeable future. Thursday's announcement didn't sit well with House Republicans, who said the politics of Yucca Mountain weighed too heavily in the decision. ""Macfarlane's selection reveals that President Obama and Harry Reid have a Yucca Mountain litmus test for any prospective nuclear chief. As we continue overseeing the agency and its leadership, our litmus test will be their adherence to the law -- including the law on Yucca Mountain,"" Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a statement. In his resignation announcement Monday, Jaczko said he intended to stay on until a successor is confirmed by the Senate, a message he echoed during a press conference on Wednesday in North Carolina. The quick move to nominate Jaczko's successor could be a signal the White House hopes to move beyond the controversy that has surrounded his tenure as the agency's chairman. Jaczko, a former top aide to Reid, has been under fire after complaints from Democrats and Republicans on the commission about his management style surfaced last year. Last month, Jaczko denied allegations that he targeted women and created a hostile work environment. The accusations came amid a political fight between Congress and the White House over who should serve on the five-member commission that oversees the nation's nuclear industry regulation. Jaczko served on the panel for almost eight years, including three as chairman. He was nominated for the NRC's top spot by President Obama in 2009. In a statement to CNN, Jaczko said, ""I have known Allison Macfarlane for a long time, and I think she is well-qualified to carry on my strong focus on the vital public health and safety mission of the NRC."" Macfarlane's nomination now heads to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the NRC, in June. If approved by the committee Macfarlane's nomination would then go before the full Senate for confirmation.

"Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says that whether candidates wear a flag lapel pin shouldn't be a political issue. (CNN) -- When is the last time you watched a mindless movie that had no redeeming value for you intellectually, but all it did was make you laugh? That perfectly describes the raging debate among voters and the rabid television and radio talk show hosts who love to yell and scream from the top of their lungs, ""I'm an American, and by golly, you better show as much appreciation for this country as I do!"" But once you finish listening to these high-minded bloviators -- and yes, that includes the voters who have bought into this nonsensical issue -- ask yourself: Does it really have anything to do with anything? I've watched this debate reach the levels of absurdity this year because journalists and commentators have raised the question to Sen. Barack Obama, ""Why don't you wear a flag lapel pin?"" I really got a kick out of that one during the ABC debate last month because not one person on stage -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Obama, along with moderators Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos -- bothered to accessorize their attire with a flag lapel pin. Sen. John McCain has been traveling the globe as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and this former Navy pilot often doesn't wear a flag lapel pin. It has become sort of like bird watching as I've surveyed elected officials on the local and national levels and looked them over like a hen-pecked mother or a foaming-at-the-mouth military drill sergeant, studying their attire and deeming them insufficiently American because of their lack of decency and respect by refusing to adorn themselves appropriately with a lapel pin. So, after listening to radio callers and the folks that e-mail various TV shows, maybe we ought to expand this need to express our Americanism even further. Shouldn't we insist that our politicians all begin to sport red, white and blue socks in order to feel good knowing that they are walking as Americans? How about asking officeholders to sport the American colors as undergarments to show that their undying love for the country is so important, they want the flag pressed against their skin? There have been times when the candidates -- especially McCain, who has beaten back skin cancer -- have worn hats on the campaign trail. I want to know, datgummit, why the people running for the highest office in the land didn't cover their head with an American flag baseball cap to express to the nation their love and affection for the U.S. of A. Since it is clear that our nation is paralyzed and so not able to close our borders, feed the homeless, develop businesses in the inner cities and save people from having their homes taken by foreclosure due to ruthless mortgage companies, all because some folks don't wear a flag lapel pin, we need to lead a national movement to demand that Congress and the states make requiring officeholders to wear a flag lapel pin the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See, if it is so important, then take it all the way. Don't make it optional. Don't leave it up to someone to choose to wear a flag lapel pin. Let's really show those politicians that nothing is more important to us than seeing them with the U.S. flag on our chest. That's what zealots do. They take something so simple, so personal, so voluntary, and absolutely lose their mind, trying to force someone else to do as them, and everyone else be damned. Folks, the first year I ever cast a ballot for political office was in 1988. And in the last 20 years, whether it was mayoral, school board, city council, or a statewide, congressional or presidential campaign, the thought of what was on a politician's lapel never entered into the equation as to whether they are worthy of office. Those who will criticize me will say, ""Well, Roland, if it's no big deal, then why not wear one?"" And the reply is the same: ""If it's no big deal, then why do you make it a big deal?"" Let me tell you something: When I'm on the golf course and I slip my wedding ring into my golf bag, the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin is still my wife. When we shoot hoops and I remove my Texas A&M University ring from my right hand, I still love my school. The fact that I can no longer wear my 1987 class ring from Houston's Jack Yates High School doesn't mean I don't cherish the crimson and gold. And I may not be able to fit into the shirt I pledged in, but I will be a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. until the day I die. I am an unapologetic Christian, but you won't see a cross dangling from my neck or a James Avery charm bracelet on my wrist. Why? Because my love of Jesus Christ is in my heart. This debate is useless, tiresome and distracting. Why? Because if there are members of Congress who wear a flag lapel pin but refuse to shore up our borders, don't do enough to stop the flow of drugs into our neighborhoods, or don't help to eradicate the gaps between the haves and have nots, then are they truly fighting for the concerns of Americans, or playing on the emotions of people by what's on their lapel? We're better than that. We're smarter than that. It's time that we make decisions based on substance, which is what we say we actually care about. But maybe we're just lying to ourselves about that, too. Roland S. Martin is a nationally award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday appointed Reps. James Clyburn, Xavier Becerra and Chris Van Hollen to the special congressional committee on deficit reduction, completing selection of the 12-member bipartisan panel created under last week's debt ceiling agreement. The three choices bring strong party voices from the House to the new ""super committee"" charged with crafting a plan to reduce the country's mounting deficits. They join three Senate Democrats -- Patty Murray, Max Baucus and John Kerry -- previously appointed to the committee, as well as six GOP fiscal conservatives from the House and Senate named by Republican leaders. ""We must achieve a 'grand bargain' that reduces the deficit by addressing our entire budget, while strengthening Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,"" Pelosi said in a statement announcing her choices. ""Our entire caucus will work closely with these three appointees toward this goal, which is the goal of the American people."" Clyburn, of South Carolina, is the No. 3 House Democrat, while Becerra, of California, is vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Van Hollen, of Maryland, is the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Both Clyburn and Van Hollen signaled their commitment to Democratic values Thursday, while Becerra warned against pre-set conditions by negotiators. ""Too often, the human side gets lost in the Washington debates about our nation's debt and deficits. I will seek to keep those interests on the table,"" Clyburn said in a statement that noted a widening gap in America between ""those who enjoy great wealth and those who struggle to get by with little thought of ever getting ahead."" Van Hollen called for the committee to ""put jobs first, sharpen America's competitive edge, ensure health and retirement security, and require shared responsibility from those who have done so well even during these tough economic times,"" but Becerra said that ""working in a bipartisan fashion without damaging pre-conditions will guarantee the greatest chance of success."" In a letter to the committee members, fiscally consevative Democrats in the House urged all the participants to ""put politics aside and work across party lines to develop a fair and feasible path to fixing our long-term debt."" In separate announcements Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner and chose Reps. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Dave Camp of Michigan and Fred Upton of Michigan as the House Republican picks, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell picked Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio. All six Republicans are known for conservative stances on economic issues. Hensarling is the Republican Conference chairman and will be co-chair of the panel with Murray of Washington state, who was appointed Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""The debt crisis is a legitimate threat to our nation's future, and the American people cannot afford to wait any longer,"" Hensarling said in a statement after his appointment. ""Everyone can agree that we must stop spending money we don't have, and the time to act is now."" He added that the committee ""will not be able to solve the crisis in a matter of months, but we can work together to tackle these challenges in order to bring back jobs, hope and opportunity for the American people."" Toomey, despite his credentials of fiscal conservatism, noted Wednesday that he recently voted to eliminate the ethanol tax subsidy and believed there were other subsidies or loopholes that could be ended as part of broad tax reform. Many conservative Republicans oppose any moves that could increase taxes. ""The goal should be to broaden the base and lower rates so that we can create an environment that's more conducive to economic growth,"" he said. The committee will follow up on negotiations that started last year with the bipartisan debt commission appointed by President Barack Obama, then continued in Congress, including work by the so-called Gang of Six senators -- three Democrats and three Republicans. Both the debt commission and the other group recommended comprehensive packages that included tax reform, changes to politically sensitive entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and spending cuts. Obama, in a speech at a hybrid car battery plant in Michigan, called Thursday for the committee to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction that ensures major corporations and wealthy individuals are contributing their fair share to a solution. ""Everybody's got to chip in,"" Obama said. ""That's fair. You learn it in kindergarten."" Former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who co-chaired Obama's debt commission, told CNN on Wednesday that the new special committee has plenty of information to work with and shouldn't need a lot of time for further collecting or analyzing of issues. Committee members ""don't need to sit around here and gather more information,"" Simpson said, adding that the actual negotiating is ""going to be tough."" Among the GOP choices, Camp is the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, while Upton chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Upton has taken some moderate positions in the past, including attempts to decrease tax cuts in the George W. Bush administration that remain contentious today. In a statement Wednesday, Upton said that ""much more needs to be done to bring down health care costs, promote economic growth and begin to tame runaway government."" ""No one believes this is going to be easy,"" he added. On the Senate side, Kyl, the No. 2 Republican behind McConnell, is a staunch advocate for the military, which is targeted for deep spending cuts if the special committee fails to come up with an agreement that passes Congress by the end of the year. Portman is a former White House budget director in the Bush administration with a reputation for working with Democrats. His fellow Ohio senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, said Wednesday that Portman ""has shown a willingness to find common ground by looking at both tax reform and spending cuts in order to reduce the deficit."" Toomey, elected to his first Senate term last year with the support of tea party conservatives, sits on the Senate Budget and Banking Committee. He told reporters Wednesday that he expected the special committee to begin its work soon, and that it would require Republicans working with Democrats to succeed. ""It has to be an exercise in finding common ground between Republicans and Democrats, but it also has to be constructive with respect to reducing our deficit and it has to be pro-growth as well,"" he said. Reid went with veteran legislators including a former Democratic presidential candidate in Kerry, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman and the more moderate Baucus, who chairs the Finance Committee and has fought Republican efforts to privatize Social Security. Reid named Murray, a war critic and champion of benefits for military veterans, the co-chair of the special committee. In a joint statement after their appointments, the three Democratic senators said that Americans want the committee to operate without ""the red-hot partisanship and brinkmanship of the last months."" ""This is not going to be easy. Our challenge is to find common ground without damaging anyone's principles. We believe we can get there. This committee was designed to require bipartisanship, and we are going to work hard with our Republican colleagues to attain it,"" their statement said. The committee will try to work out $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, after an initial round of more than $900 billion in spending cuts in the debt ceiling agreement. It is required to complete its work by November 23. Congress then has until December 23 to vote on the proposal, with no amendments permitted. A simple majority on the panel -- seven of 12 members -- is needed to approve whatever package it comes up with, meaning that it will take a lone member of either party to push something through by voting with the other side. The committee's proposal would then need a simple majority in each chamber of Congress to make it to Obama's desk. If the committee fails to reach agreement or Congress fails to pass whatever package it recommends, a trigger mechanism will enact further across-the-board cuts in government spending, including for the military. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released Wednesday, 63% of respondents say the so-called super committee should recommend increased taxes on higher-income Americans and businesses, with 36% disagreeing. By a 57-40% margin, respondents say the committee's deficit reduction proposal should include major cuts in domestic spending. However, further cuts in defense spending get a mixed review, with 47% favoring them and 53% opposed. Nearly two-thirds of respondents oppose major changes to Social Security and Medicare, while nearly nine in 10 don't want any increase in taxes on middle-class and lower-income Americans. Months of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction have failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between Republicans and Democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise revenue while cutting spending. Obama is pushing for a comprehensive plan that includes spending cuts, increased tax revenue and entitlement reforms, while Republicans seek to shrink government by proposing spending cuts and entitlement reforms without increased revenue. An impasse over the tax revenue issue led to the debt ceiling agreement, which imposed the initial round of spending cuts and set up the special committee to work out further deficit reduction. The agreement also enables the federal debt ceiling to be increased through 2012, allowing the government to borrow what it needs to meet its obligations. The brinkmanship of the negotiations, with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached, was one reason why Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA-plus on Friday. One of the main Republican arguments against tax increases for the wealthy is that they would inhibit job creation. The poll results showed that only a third of respondents agree with that stance, while 62% say taxes on the wealthy should be high so the government can use the money for programs to help lower-income Americans. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from Friday through Sunday, with 1,008 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey was conducted both before and after Friday night's announcement of the S&P downgrade. The poll's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"London (CNN) -- Stars from one of the world's great soccer teams will be encouraging reading as part of a new project to put one million digital books in the hands of African children. Spanish football team FC Barcelona -- home to stars Lionel Messi, Xavi, Eric Abidal and Seydou Keita -- joined forces Thursday with the non-profit organization Worldreader in a campaign to inspire a wave of literacy in sub-Saharan Africa through the use of e-readers. Cristiano Ronaldo: I'm better than Messi . Founded by David Risher, a former executive at Microsoft and Amazon, Worldreader works on the premise that e-readers, like Amazon's Kindle, could help children in developing countries to ""awaken their passion for reading, and improve their lives."" ""Worldreader is committed to putting a digital library in the hands of all children throughout the world's developing countries, and we're thrilled with the support of FC Barcelona to send one million e-books to students in Africa,"" said Risher, Worldreader's CEO. 'Harry Potter' series finally available as e-books . The campaign is appealing for one million donors to each make a $5 contribution to help them reach their target of distributing one million e-books to 10,000 children in Africa. Because students bring home the devices and typically share their use with family members, friends and neighbors, it is expected the initiative will help put e-books in the hands of 50,000 people. The e-readers will be distributed to children in Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, where the non-profit is already operating, and soon in Rwanda, which is to become the next focus for the organization. Football giant Barcelona will lend its weight to the campaign, with its stars sending messages via the e-readers to encourage students to read more and achieve their goals. Worldreader believes technology can provide the best approach to encouraging literacy in parts of the developing world where books are otherwise scarce. Unlike traditional books -- which had to be physically imported, one title at a time -- a single e-Reader could provide a child with a vast array of current, relevant titles at a low distribution cost. The increased access to reading material, it was believed, could broaden the way students think and develop their creativity by allowing them to go beyond the syllabus to follow their reading interests. A year-long pilot of the program to 350 students in six schools in Ghana yielded promising results. Reading test scores for primary students participating in the program increased by 4.8% to 7.6% more than their peers who were not taking part, although benefits for older students were less clear. The e-readers gave students access to a much greater variety of titles: 107, on average, as opposed to the between 3 to 11 books the average student had access to at home without the devices. They swiftly learned how to use the e-readers, despite 43% having never used a computer before. Read also: The Himba, Namibia's iconic red women . ""Worldreader has not only given us unparalleled access to books, the program has motivated my students and instilled a joy for reading that never existed before,"" said Jacqueline Abiso Dzifa, a teacher at Presbyterian Primary in Kade, Ghana, whose students participated in the pilot. The students relished their access to ""a wide variety of classic and cutting-edge literature by renowned authors,"" she said. As e-readers provided a pathway into the digital world, many students also used them to read international news sites that would have been inaccessible previously. Just one of the collateral benefits to the program was that students gained greater exposure to African writers, said Worldreader managing director and co-founder Colin McElwee. The program was working with African publishing houses to digitize their titles and provide students with local, relevant content -- which had positive impacts on local literary cultures. ""We want to digitize the curriculum, there's a whole catalog of books you can digitize,"" he said. ""Once you digitize them, you can't just sell them in Ghana or Kenya -- you have a global market. So this is the first time African culture can be exported seamlessly, globally. That has an enormous impact on the potential of Africa over time.""","Football giant FC Barcelona is supporting a project to distribute 1 million e-books in Africa .

"(CNN) -- After first saying that they could not determine a threshold for the safe amount of certain toxic chemicals in infant formula, Food and Drug Administration officials said Friday that trace amounts are safe. Worries over melamine in infant formula started in China and have spread to the United States. ""Amounts of the industrial chemical melamine or the melamine-like compound called cyanuric acid that are below 1.0 ppm [1,000 parts per billion] do not raise public health concerns,"" said Stephen Sundlof, the FDA's director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. When it became known in September that thousands of babies in China had been sickened by tainted infant formula, the FDA ordered the testing of U.S.-manufactured infant-formula products. Sundlof said Friday that results from 74 of 87 samples of infant formula and other products babies and young children had been completed. The results of the other 13 are pending. That total differed slightly from the one the FDA offered Thursday, when its acting commissioner of public affairs, Judy Leon, told CNN that 77 sample results had been completed and just 10 were outstanding. Among the 74 final test results discussed Friday, the FDA said, two samples of Nestle's Good Start Supreme Infant Formula with Iron tested positive for melamine at levels of 137 and 140 parts per billion, well below the level of concern cited by Sundlof. In addition, three samples of Mead Johnson's infant powder, Enfamil LIPIL with Iron, tested positive for cyanuric acid at an average of 247 parts per billion, also well below the FDA trace level. The FDA's October 3 risk assessment of melamine and its analogues concluded that ""levels of melamine and its analogues below 2.5 ppm in foods other than infant formula do not raise public health concerns."" But the agency said then that it did not have enough data to determine a safe level of melamine and its analogues in infant formula. On Friday, an FDA official said it was still not possible to determine a safe level for infant formula containing both melamine and cyanuric acid compounds, but officials ""believe that at very low levels there should not be any health concerns."" Sundlof said the trace levels of melamine or related compounds detected in the samples are 10,000-fold less than the amount associated with Chinese infant-formula contamination. According to the World Health Organization, contaminated infant formula in China has killed four babies and caused more than 47,000 infants and children to be hospitalized with possible kidney stones. Chinese-made infant formula is not available in the United States, because no Chinese manufacturer meets the requirements to sell infant formula in this country, according to the FDA. It was also the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in pet food that caused thousands of dogs and cats to be sickened last year in the United States. The combination caused crystals to form in the animals' kidneys. According to the FDA's updated Interim Safety Assessment, infants are more vulnerable to the combination than are older children or adults because formula could be the infants' sole source of nutrition. In addition, their kidneys may not have developed sufficiently to ward off the impact of the chemicals.","Melamine, cyanuric acid not of concern in levels below 1,000 parts per billion .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Joe Lieberman is crossing party lines and endorsing Republican Sen. John McCain for president. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, is endorsing Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, for president. ""Being a Republican is important. Being a Democrat is important. But you know what's more important than that? The interest and well-being of the United States of America,"" the Democrat-turned Independent said in announcing his decision Monday morning in New Hampshire. ""Let's put the United States first again, and John McCain is the man as president who will help us do that,"" he said. Lieberman, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in 2000, said the next president needs to ""break through the reflexive partisanship that is poisoning our politics today and stopping us from getting anything done in Washington.""  Watch Lieberman explain his move » . In accepting Lieberman's backing, McCain said, ""It is one of the great honors of my political career to have known him, to have worked with him and to have received his endorsement."" The Connecticut senator decided to endorse McCain because he considers him ""the most capable to be commander in chief on day one of his administration, and the most capable of uniting the country so that we can prevail against Islamic extremism,"" a Lieberman aide said earlier. The Lieberman aide insists the senator does not see this as a ""commentary on or an endorsement of the Republican Party, only the person."" The endorsement could help emphasize McCain's experience on national security issues, demonstrate his ability to work across party lines and perhaps help persuade Independent voters in New Hampshire to support his 2008 presidential bid, as many of them did during his first campaign in 2000. McCain also picked up key endorsements this weekend from two of the most influential papers for voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, The Des Moines Register and The Boston Globe. Lieberman, who broke with the Democratic Party over Iraq, won re-election as an Independent after losing the party's Senate nomination to an anti-war challenger in 2006. He still caucuses with the Democrats, giving them their razor-thin majority in the chamber. Lieberman chairs the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee, and he still attends weekly Democratic strategy meetings. But his adviser said the endorsement appears to be a ""hangover"" from the 2006 race, when top Democrats backed the Democratic nominee, Ned Lamont, rather than support Lieberman's Independent candidacy. ""I have the greatest respect for Joe, but I simply have to disagree with his decision to endorse Senator McCain,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told CNN in a written statement. Lieberman's office called Reid's office Sunday to inform the Democratic leader of his decision to endorse a Republican, a Reid spokesman said. In response to the endorsement, Al From, founder and CEO of the Democratic Leadership Council, said, ""I am very saddened by Senator Lieberman's choice, and profoundly disagree with it. We need to elect a Democratic president in 2008."" Lieberman and McCain co-sponsored the 2002 resolution that authorized the U.S. invasion of Iraq the following March, and Lieberman has remained a supporter of the nearly 5-year-old war in Iraq at a time when Democratic leaders are trying to bring the conflict to an end. He had not planned to endorse anyone until after the primary season, but McCain asked for his endorsement a few days after the two men returned from a Thanksgiving trip to Iraq together, the aide said. A CNN/WMUR poll released last week found McCain tied for second in the New Hampshire, which hosts the first primary of the 2008 presidential race in January. He and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani both rated 19 percent support among New Hampshire Republicans, while Mitt Romney, the former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, led the race with 32 percent. The poll of 354 likely Republican primary voters was conducted from December 6 through December 10. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. E-mail to a friend .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For ""Coco Avant Chanel"" director Anne Fontaine, there was only one actress who could play Coco Chanel in her biopic about the legendary couturier -- French actress Audrey Tautou. In ""Coco Avant Chanel,"" French actress Audrey Tautou plays Coco Chanel, founder of the iconic Parisien haute couture house, Chanel. Already uncannily similar in looks, Tautou's strong  performance breathes life into Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel, the fiery designer who would found iconic Parisian haute couture house, Chanel. From the way she holds her cigarette to Coco's famously sharp gaze, Tautou is a dead-ringer for the young Coco. ""She is perfect for the part,"" Fontaine told CNN. ""She has this determination and authority."" ""Coco"" charts the couturier's early life -- an almost fairytale journey from orphaned cabaret performer in Moulins to the 20th Century's foremost fashion designer. Fontaine, who also wrote the script for ""Coco,"" says the film would have been impossible without Tautou: ""For me, it was the beginning of the story to have a good interpretation of Coco -- if not, I wouldn't have written the script."" But, while Tautou's unmistakable similarity to Coco Chanel made her an obvious choice for the role, the striking actress says she wasn't interested in doing a ""birth to death"" biopic of the designer. ""It seemed to me that the period when Coco was building herself and asserting her personality is the most interesting in her life,"" says Tautou who rose to international prominence in quirky 2001 drama, ""Amelie."" It was Fontaine's vision that finally convinced the 32 year-old actress to take on the role: ""When Anne explained how she intended to treat the subject, I immediately agreed,"" Tautou told CNN. ""She knew she was predestined for this role,"" says Fontaine. ""She has this 'little black bull' side to her, a grace, finesse, and an irrefutable charisma."" ""Coco"" focuses on the years Chanel spent living with wealthy socialite, Etienne Balsan. Balsan, played brilliantly by Benoit Poelvoorde, introduces her to the Parisian high society and fashion -- lavishness the wide-eyed Chanel rapidly acclimatized to. ""Chanel looked at everything. Her culture was not one of knowledge, but a culture of observations,"" says Fontaine. It was during this time Coco's own style and creativity began to blossom -- partly in disgust at the unnecessary extravagance of upper-class style during the gaudy years of the late Belle Epoque in France. Designers of the time projected their image of the ideal woman onto the corsets and elaborate hats they created for them to wear. Coco rejected that ideal, opting to build a style based solely on herself, liberating the female body from the constricting style of the time. ""She's the beginning of the modern woman,"" said Fontaine. Unlike other recent film forays into the fashion world, ""Coco Before Chanel"" is less about the clothes and accessories and more about the intellectual and philosophical evolution of one of fashion's greatest minds. ""Coco"" stops short of telling the story of Chanel's darker years in Nazi-occupied Paris during WW2, when she took up residence at the Ritz Hotel and was criticized for her affair with Hans Gunther von Dincklage, a Nazi officer. It is one of two films about the iconic couturier's early life this year. The other, ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky,"" a lavish, part-fact, part-fiction portrayal of Chanel's brief affair with the avant garde composer directed by Dutch-born Jan Kounen was the closing night film at this year's Cannes Film Festival.  Highlights from the French film talent at this year's Cannes Film Festival » . Fontaine also had to add an element of fiction to her telling of Chanel's early years, taking liberties with the script to get some of Chanel's most iconic designs into the film. The blue-striped mariner's sweater Tautou wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. Fontaine also includes the death of Chanel's great love, the British industrialist Boy Capel (played by Alessandro Nivola), which took place in the years after those shown in the film, because of the huge impact his death had on the designer. ""It was the most important love of her whole life,"" the 49 year-old Luxembourg-born director told CNN. ""When he's dead, when he disappears, something breaks and she only has the work."" That Chanel never married has been attributed to her heartbreak over Capel's tragic death in a car accident. Indeed, Coco herself once said, ""I lost everything with the loss of Capel."" Tautou's portrayal of Chanel's broken heart in the scenes around Capel's death may be her finest. It is almost as if the actress becomes the young Coco Chanel. ""The portrayal was not in the costume, not in the superficial side of the character, but in [my] inner self,"" says Tautou. ""In the last part [of the film], I was completely her."" Fontaine and Tautou both acknowledge the biggest challenge of making ""Coco Before Chanel"" was doing justice to one of the most well-known and influential women of the 20th Century. ""The most difficult thing when you speak about somebody who's so known, so legendary, is to be true to her,"" said Fontaine. ""Coco Avant Chanel"" is in UK cinemas from 31 July 2009.","Biopic charts early years of designer who founded iconic couturier, Chanel .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea conducted a live-fire drill Tuesday near its disputed western sea border with the South, immediately inviting a stern rebuke from its neighbor. ""The South Korean Army, Air Force and Navy is fully prepared for possible North Korean provocation,"" said Kim Min-seok, a South Korean defense ministry spokesman. ""If North Korea launched fire toward the (South Korean maritime border), we will respond with counter fire."" The drill lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, with no shells landing in South Korean waters, the South Korean military said. Pyongyang had notified Seoul that it would be conducting the exercises. But the move follows U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the region and amid a number of other belligerent actions by the Communist nation. Preparations for a nuclear test . Late last week, South Korean officials reported that North Korea had completed the steps needed to conduct a nuclear test, including the sealing of a tunnel at the Punggye-ri site in northeastern North Korea, which analysts say is the final preparation for testing a device. The North Korean analyst website 38 North, part of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, says other activity consistent with final preparations for a test had been observed on satellite imagery. South Korea: North Korea ready for nuclear test . Further sanctions . During his visit to South Korea, Obama warned of further sanctions if North Korea carried out any unsanctioned nuclear test.

"(CNN) -- Two of Syria's neighbors joined growing international calls Monday for Damascus to halt its violent crackdown on anti-government protesters -- calls that came even as the violence itself continued. In Jordan, the state-run Petra News Agency reported that Prime Minister Marouf Al Bakhit had urged his Syrian counterpart, Adel Safar, ""to immediately halt military operations, implement speedy reform and spare the blood of the Syrian people, expressing the kingdom's rejection and regret over the continued killing and escalation in neighboring Syria."" Al Bakhit told Safar in a telephone call that ""such scenes"" must stop, adding that ""hope still exists on the ability of our brothers in Syria to achieve this end."" ""We in Jordan await tangible and urgent measures in the near future,"" he said. Similar sentiments were voiced in Ankara by Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu after his recent visit to Damascus. He told reporters in a televised news conference he had asked that the Syrian military end operations immediately, withdraw from cities and meet the democratic demands of the people. ""Syrian people should know that we are on their side with regard to their legitimate democratic rights,""  he said. ""We hope our voice is heard and these operations are stopped."" In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Turkish President Abdullah Gul met Monday with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and both ""underscored the significance of halting the violence the Syrian administration is resorting to against people,"" Gul's office said in a statement. Last week, King Abdullah called for an end to the bloodshed in Syria and recalled the Saudi ambassador from Damascus. Bahrain and Kuwait also have recalled their ambassadors from Syria and called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to end the crackdowns. The United States has stopped short of explicit calls for al-Assad to step down, but Washington has said Syria would be better off without him. The United States slapped sanctions on Syria's largest mobile phone company and a bank, while calling for an oil and gas embargo. The international entreaties and condemnations came as more than 5,000 Palestinians were reported to have fled a U.N. refugee camp in the port city of Latakia after the camp came under fire from Syrian security forces. Some of the refugees had been asked to leave by the Syrian security forces, and some left on their own because they were afraid for their lives, said Christopher Gunness, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. The agency had had no communication with the refugees, and was not sure where they had gone, he said. ""We are asking the Syrian government for immediate access to the Palestinians, as their well-being is our responsibility,"" Gunness told CNN. ""We need to get in there to assess the situation."" The refugee camp in Latakia normally holds 10,000 people. ""Reports from various sources indicate deaths and casualties among the Palestinian refugee population, although poor communications make it impossible to confirm the exact number of dead and injured,"" the agency said Sunday. It demanded access to the area so that humanitarian workers can take care of the casualties. Also Monday, a day after opposition groups told CNN that Syrian security forces backed by gunships killed at least 25 people in a crackdown on protesters in Latakia, security forces began urging residents to evacuate or risk being arrested or killed, an activist there told CNN. Gunfire and explosions could be heard Monday, said the resident, who lives outside the al-Ramel neighborhood, which has been the focus of the military campaign. Monday was the third consecutive day that the area has had neither power nor water, he said. At one checkpoint, security forces shot at fleeing residents, killing six, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Another man was killed Monday by sniper fire in the Homs province town of Al Houla, which was besieged by tanks on all sides, and pro-regime ""thugs"" entered surrounding villages, it said. Government-run media have denied the claims of civilian casualties. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said Monday that it had learned that in the city of Homs, relatives of a detained man received his body, which had been tortured. There have been at least 10 such deaths since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan on August 1, the agency said. ""The observatory holds the security forces officials who held them responsible for their death under torture and calls for their trial so they can be punished for the crimes they have committed against the Syrian people,"" it said in a statement. It said more than 700 people have been taken into custody in ""random"" arrest campaigns since Ramadan got under way. Violence countrywide took at least 42 lives Sunday, said one anti-government activist group, which collects lists of victims' names. CNN cannot independently verify opposition or government claims, because Syria has restricted international journalists from reporting inside the country. The crackdown in Latakia is the latest in a series of military actions, coinciding with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, that are targeting protesters calling for free elections and the ouster of al-Assad. The Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union also reported deaths in the cities of Howlah and Hama. In all, 2,530 people have died since the uprising began in March, according to the Local Coordinating Committees of Syria.  Most were civilians, while 391 belonged to Syria's security forces, it says. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Arwa Damon, Nada Husseini and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","Jordan's prime minister calls on Damascus ""to immediately halt military operations""

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- The moral conscience of Iran's reform movement passed away  Sunday morning. Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who died at 87, was the Iranian equivalent of South Africa's Desmond Tutu for politics. Over the past 20 years, he distinguished himself by virtue of his persistent, judicious criticism of human rights abuses in the Islamic Republic and his defense of the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran within the framework of an ethical interpretation of Shia Islam. His death comes as a huge blow to the Green Movement, yet his supporters will take comfort that he lived a full life and intervened on all the major political questions plaguing Iranian and Islamic politics. Born into a poor family in 1922 in the small town of Najafabad, Montazeri rose through the ranks of the religious seminaries to the position of a Grand Ayatollah (the most senior clerical position in Shia Islam) primarily because of his exceptional erudition and broad following as a source of religious authority. During the oppressive political climate that enveloped Iran after the 1953 coup d'état, Montazeri emerged as a leading clerical leader, who allied himself with Ayatollah Khomeini to protest the dictatorship of the shah and Iran's close alliance with the United States and Israel. He was frequently imprisoned and tortured -- acts that increased his prestige and credibility as an opposition leader who was willing to speak truth to power. He was one of the key intellectual theoreticians of the concept of the ""rule of the Islamic jurist"" (velayat-e faqih), which formed the foundation of Iran's post-revolutionary constitutional order, thus ensuring clerical domination of Iranian politics. It was a position he would regret later in his life. Buttressed by his impeccable religious, revolutionary and political credentials, Montazeri emerged as one of the leaders of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He was soon designated as the official successor to Ayatollah Khomeini, a position he held until 1989. During this period of increasing internal repression and a wave of political executions, Montazeri began his uncompromising criticism of the Islamic Republic. As a result, he was removed from his position as Khomeini's heir apparent. All formal ties with the ruling regime were severed. Montazeri retired to his home in the religious city of Qum to resume his teaching and study and to reflect upon the relationship between religion, ethics and politics. In this period, Montazeri's religious and political thought underwent a reorientation. Human rights and democracy moved to the center of his religious teaching. On many of Iran's most sensitive and politically charged debates, Montazeri intervened in an unprecedented manner that marked a clear contrast with the ruling ideology of Iranian regime. On the question of Iran's persecuted Baha'i minority, he called for the granting of full citizenship rights and rejected longstanding views on the punishment for apostasy in Islam. In terms of Iran's international relations, he apologized for the seizure of the U.S. embassy in 1979 and called for the establishment of relations with the U.S. based on mutual respect. He even issued a fatwa on nuclear weapons, encouraging Muslims to ""take the lead in banning legally and practically all such weapons for all countries and in soliciting the help of respectable and dependable international organizations in guaranteeing such a ban."" In November 1997, a few months after Muhammad Khatami's presidential victory, Ayatollah Montazeri delivered a harshly worded sermon on the birthday of the first Shia Imam. In this famous speech, which circulated widely and clandestinely in Iran and abroad via audiotape, he criticized the growing authoritarianism of the ruling clerics and encouraged Iran's new reformist president to use his popular mandate to press forward with democratizing the political system. He also directly criticized and questioned the legitimacy of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Retribution was swift: his office and home were attacked by pro-regime thugs and the cleric was placed under house arrest for the next five years. Yet he continued to write and issue bold statements of support to Iran's reform movement, essentially using his religious authority to give moral sanction to democratic forces in Iranian society. In the aftermath of Iran's discredited 2009 presidential elections, Montazeri was one of the most outspoken critics of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ali Khamenei. In the final six months of his life, on a near-weekly basis, Ayatollah Montazeri issued a strong statement of support for the Green Movement and strongly condemned human rights abuses. ""A regime that uses clubs, oppression, aggression,"" he warned, ""against [the people's] rights, injustice, rigged elections, murder, arrests, and medieval or Stalin-era torture, [a regime that] gags and censors the press, obstructs the media, imprisons intellectuals and elected leaders on false allegations or forced confessions... -- [such a regime] is despicable and has no religious merit."" In a widely reported fatwa on July 11, he called Iran's rulers ""usurpers and transgressors"" who have lost all legitimacy to rule. This was a historic statement as it explicitly affirmed that all believing Muslims have a moral obligation to oppose the current rulers in Iran and to seek their replacement, albeit through nonviolent means. ""People must express their opinion about the illegitimacy [of Iran's current rulers] and the lack of their approval of their performance, and seek their dismissal through the best and least harmful way,"" he affirmed. ""It is clear that this [dismissal of the officials] is a societal duty of everyone, and all the people, regardless of their social positions and according to their knowledge and capability, must participate in this endeavor, and cannot shirk their responsibility."" Montazeri was feared by Iran's ruling establishment precisely because he undermined their legitimacy. He will join the pantheon of Iranian leaders before him who similarly struggled against dictatorship. Arguably, his most important legacy bequeathed to Iranian and Islamic politics is that when given a choice, one must always follow the dictates of one's conscience over the temptations of political power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nader Hashemi.","Death of Iranian spiritual leader is a blow to Iran's reform movement, says Nader Hashemi .

"Paris (CNN) -- Newly appointed Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said Thursday that France would not ratify a European pact on budget discipline if it does not include measures to boost growth. Moscovici said an ""ambitious"" strategy for growth was needed, in an interview with CNN affiliate BFM-TV. The fiscal pact was signed by most European leaders late last year, and Germany, the economic powerhouse of the region, has said it is not up for renegotiation. Moscovici said French President Francois Hollande, sworn into office two days ago, was well aware of the gravity of the crisis facing Europe. But the new Socialist government would stick to the campaign promises made by Hollande, he said, including his pledge to incorporate a ""growth dimension"" into the fiscal compact. Holding its first Cabinet meeting Thursday, the government agreed to scrutinize public spending and review all Cabinet ministers' wages, spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said. ""The government is aware of the difficulties we face, in particular in terms of our public accounts,"" she told reporters after the meeting at the Elysee Palace. Prime Minister Jean Marc-Ayrault has asked the French Court of Auditors for a report ""on the state of our public accounts,"" she said. The Cabinet also agreed on a salary cut of 30% for ministers and the president, in line with a campaign promise by Hollande, Vallaud-Belkacem said. The salary reduction would be retroactive to May 15, after the law is passed by the National Assembly in June, she said. The cut means the gross salary of the prime minister and president will drop from 21,300 euros to 14,910 euros ($18,970) a month, a government statement said. A minister will earn a gross wage of 9,940 euros ($12,650) a month, rather than the current 14,200 euros. Hollande stressed the need for the government to be efficient and to set a good example in its own practices, the statement said. The 17 men and 17 women who make up the government posed for a ""family photograph"" before getting down to business, BFM-TV reported. Speaking earlier as he took over as finance minister from Francois Baroin, Moscovici said the government's focus would be on the Greek crisis, the consolidation of the eurozone and a reorientation of European efforts in favor of growth. He added that he is a ""committed European."" ""We are conscious that we can do nothing alone. We must work together with all our partners, and above all with Germany and the European institutions,"" Moscovici said. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius also stressed his commitment to Europe on BFM-TV. ""I feel deeply European, but we need a different Europe, a Europe that is much more concentrated on employment,"" he said. The pact, championed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is designed to increase fiscal discipline and prevent a future crisis by ensuring that governments respect deficit rules and do not overspend. Hollande's first trip as president, made hours after his inauguration Tuesday, was to Berlin, where he met with Merkel to discuss the economy. ""I said that my wish is that growth is not an empty phrase, that it is something which, in reality, is happening,"" Hollande told reporters at a joint news conference with Merkel after the talks. ""Because, without growth, we can't do whatever we want, we won't reach the goals which we want to -- and to reduce the debt and deficit."" He said the best solution would be to ""put everything on the table"" on May 23, when the region's leaders plan to meet next. Speaking earlier this month, Merkel said that she was in favor of growth but that it must be sustainable, rather than programs made on the back of more debt. Increased competitiveness is the key to sustainable growth, she said. Voters in France and Greece, where political turmoil continues after an election failed to produce a government, are the latest in Europe to express their unhappiness about the policy of austerity. As Greek politicians set a new election date Wednesday, Merkel said she regretted the suffering of the Greek people in the face of harsh government budget cuts. ""It's very bitter, obviously,"" she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, ""Sacrifices had to be made. ... I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken."" Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, did offer possible assistance to Greece. ""Europe needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,"" she said. CNN's Alexander Felton, Laura Perez Maestro, Laura Smith-Spark and Rachel Ramsay contributed to this report.","NEW: Hollande and his ministers agree on a 30% pay cut, as promised in campaigning .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Shops and markets were closed and traders stopped trains in parts of India on Thursday in protests against federal reforms to open the nation's $500 billion retail sector to global supermarket chains. In New Delhi, traders marched through the streets, shouting ""no FDI in retail"" slogans, a reference to foreign direct investment. The protests are a backlash against the Indian government's announcement last week allowing foreign retailers to own a 51% stake in joint ventures in India, which is Asia's third-largest economy. Major markets in several Indian cities were closed in the one-day strike, backed by opposition parties and allies of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government who support them. Protesters were also opposing recent fuel price increases and caps on kitchen gas canister supplies. Traders burned an effigy labeled ""FDI in retail"" in the Indian capital after a demonstration joined by communist, right-wing and socialist leaders. Protesters also blocked at least 200 trains across India, some for more than an hour, railway spokesman Anil Kumar Saxena told CNN. Traders say the arrival of companies like Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Tesco in India will destroy their small businesses. But a market analyst differs. ""The market in India is big enough,"" said Ankur Bisen, a retail expert at the consulting firm Technopak. ""It's about a $500 billion market, and this market presents opportunities for organized retail as well as mom-and-pop stores to coexist."" Singh's government, which announced sweeping reforms last week amid massive criticism of its handling of the economy, says foreign retailers will help improve the country's creaky supply chains. In India, business applicants must get permission from states to set up shop. The new policy reinforces that rule. As Singh and Bisen welcome the proposal to allow overseas players in retail, others oppose it. ""These multinationals will ruin millions of small traders,"" said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders, which led demonstrations in New Delhi. India's Hindu nationalist main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party vowed it would press for a rollback of the retail liberalization program. ""This is just the beginning. We will continue our struggle till the decision is reversed,"" Nitin Gadkari, president of the party, told protesters in his address in the capital. The September 14 reform announced by the Indian government also cost the ruling coalition a key political ally. Mamata Banerjee, a maverick politician leading the West Bengal state, announced Tuesday that federal ministers from her Trinamool Congress party would submit their resignations to Singh this week if his government did not scrap the retail policy. On Friday, the Indian Cabinet also announced aviation reforms, a day after increasing prices of heavily subsidized diesel fuel. Singh, whose government is under fire over a raft of corruption scandals, sounded firm on policy decisions. ""I believe that these steps will help strengthen our growth process and generate employment in these difficult times. I urge all segments of public opinion to support the steps we have taken in national interest,"" he said in a statement after the Cabinet announcements.","Traders close shops, stop trains to protest plans to open nation's retail sector to global chains .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, the number of Western visitors to North Korea was well below a thousand a year, with Americans permitted by Pyongyang to visit only during the summer Mass Games. The number of Western visitors has since risen to 5,000 to 6,000 a year, and Americans, who now make up 25% of Western visitors, are allowed to enter year round. In response to the surge of interest, London-based website Uniquely Travel has recently launched a comprehensive North Korea app. Part travel guide, part travel booking advisory, it features more than 350 places of interest. All destinations on the North Korea Travel App are open to visitors and have been geo-tagged by Curtis Melvin, a North Korea satellite imagery expert who the company says was banned from the country after widespread news coverage of his work. The app includes sections detailing the country's history, culture and the ethics of traveling to North Korea, as well as a Tour Guide Tips section offering insights by Koryo Tours manager Simon Cockerell, who has been leading groups into the country for more than 10 years. ""The app appeals to that curiosity a lot of people have about what on Earth it's like to go to a country like North Korea and is designed for armchair travelers as well as people who are actively interested in visiting,"" says project manager Chad O'Carroll. A longtime North Korea watcher and founder and managing editor of NK News, O'Carroll got involved with the project last year when friends set up Uniquely Travel, a site dedicated to easing travel to countries with difficult relationships with Western governments. The North Korea app, developed by Magora Systems, is the first to launch. Guides to Iran and Libya are expected to follow. What can tourists expect when visiting North Korea? More than just monuments . ""Users can compare prices through the app in a similar way to Kayak.com or they can use the unique platform to put together their own itinerary and get companies to compete against each other for a custom (trip),"" says O'Carroll. He's most excited about the work done by Melvin, who's been studying Google Earth images for more than five years to piece together a detailed map of North Korea. ""People think you can only go to Pyongyang and see a bunch of monuments, but that's not the case,"" says O'Carroll. ""It's interesting that they are opening places like Hoeryong, which is near a prison camp. ""With the increase in new destinations, it increases the chance that people will see more of the real North Korea."" The 99-cent app has an offline mode so it can be used in North Korea, where Internet connectivity is difficult and expensive. Though tourists were once forced to hand over their mobile phones for storage when entering the country, widespread reports in early 2013 noted that government officials appear to have relaxed the rules. For O'Carroll, the app is strictly for armchair use -- he too is banned from North Korea, most likely for his work with NK News, a ""privately owned specialist site focused on North Korea."" Based in London, O'Carroll founded NK News in 2010. The greatest interest for the app is expected to come from the United States -- which is why it's been produced in American English. If successful, the app may be translated into Chinese, Japanese and Korean, the other markets with strong interest in North Korea. The project, which started as an idea over a drink in a pub and wasn't expected to cost much money or time, has wound up taking much longer and costing far more than expected, says O'Carroll, noting that the group has spent $20,000 to develop the engine, along with hundreds of hours of writing and editing. ""We just hope a nuclear test -- which is looking increasingly possible at the moment -- doesn't happen to eclipse the launch,"" he says. The North Korea Travel App is now available on iTunes and Google Play stores. O'Carroll says the app's main competition is Bradt, a travel guidebook publishing company that covers non-mainstream destinations such as Sudan, Kazakhstan and Iran. According to Bradt's website, the company will be publishing a guide to North Korea this year. More: World's most exotic luxury ski resort? Hitting the slopes at Masik, North Korea .

"(CNN) -- The hacker group LulzSec has alarmed police in Arizona this week after releasing sensitive information about officers. The group said they posted the information in response to Arizona's controversial immigration law. ""We are releasing hundreds of private intelligence bulletins, training manuals, personal email correspondence, names, phone numbers, addresses and passwords belonging to Arizona law enforcement,"" the group said in a statement. ""We are targeting AZDPS (Arizona Department of Public Safety) specifically because we are against SB 1070 and the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona."" The Arizona Highway Patrol Association said the release of the documents is unsafe for officers. ""Law enforcement officials go to many lengths to protect their identities,"" states Jimmy Chavez, president of the organization ""These individuals maliciously released confidential information knowing the safety of DPS employees, and their families, would be compromised."" The controversial bill, Arizona Senate Bill 1070, passed last year but was quickly challenged in court by the Justice Department. The measure would have required local police, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of anyone they suspected of being undocumented. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit placed an injunction on parts of the measure in April saying that those parts overstepped Arizona's authority. In its lawsuit, the Justice Department challenged only six of the Arizona law's provisions, meaning others went into effect in July. Among the provisions given the go-ahead were a ban on ""sanctuary cities,"" or municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. A provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic and a provision dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also went into effect.

"New Orleans (CNN) -- ""Are African-American women really that different from women of other ethnicities?"" That was the major question I wanted to ask Sophia Nelson, blogger and author of ""Black Women Redefined."" Nelson first told great stories about her numerous firsts, although she made it clear that she doesn't define herself by what she does. Growing up, she wanted to be the first black female Supreme Court justice. She did become the first African-American female to be elected to the student body government at San Diego State University. And she went on to become a lawyer. Nelson has worked in Republican Party politics since her 20s as well. She can also count a U.S. Congress political party nomination among her many accomplishments. And the author, journalist and blogger loves to write. ""Your blog is called Black Woman Redefined. What is that definition?"" I asked. It's not very good at all, she responded. She said too many people want to stereotype black women as angry and strident. But she said having images of Michelle Obama on a world stage is a game changer. She insisted that not everyone has to be like the first lady but that she is a great role model. ""Are black women really any different from any other women?"" I ask. ""No, not at all,"" she said adamantly ""And that is the real redefining thing that I want us to all take away from my book and anything that you see. Black women are women like everybody else."" She discussed having lost a job, bouncing back, not being viewed seriously in the workplace, women being viewed as angry and other issues in her book. She said every woman can relate to these struggles, no matter the ethnicity. She quotes Sojourner Truth's ""Ain't I a Woman?"" speech while acknowledging how there are widely varying roles that women have chosen or served in. After the taped interview, we continued to discuss Nelson's book. There were two single people on my crew and a married couple (my husband and me). She asked my husband about whether men really are intimidated by more accomplished women. He said a secure man would not be. She agreed, saying the research for her book showed that a man was not intimidated by accomplished black women; that men want someone with a great personality, who will treat them with respect and who will leave the baggage behind. Nelson said, ""I consider myself lucky to have achieved a lifelong dream of mine to publish my first book; a serious, generational nonfiction book on the lives of accomplished black women in America living in this new 'Age of Michelle Obama.' Stereotypes still define black women and, for that matter, most women in our culture. But as we all know, stereotypes aren't funny when they follow you everywhere."" We made small talk easily, laughing as though we had known each other for years. It was much later that I learned she was nervous, but felt at home once she sat down. She later wrote, ""It was like I had been waiting to do this my whole life. We often think that successful people have no fears. The truth is, successful people are quite intimate with fear -- they just face their fears and rise instead to meet their dreams.""","Author Sophia Nelson says too many people stereotype black women as angry and strident .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Social networking, Martin Scorsese and cinema classics on demand: this is the enticing mix on offer at new movie Web site The Auteurs. The Auteurs mastermind Efe Cakarel (center) at Cannes with Celluloid Dreams' Hengameh Panahi (left) and Martin Scorsese. The self-styled ""online cinematheque"" allows users to watch art house films from directors like Michael Winterbottom, Francois Ozon and Walter Salles, while Facebook-style profile pages and discussion forums encourage movie debate. With their innovative approach, The Auteurs hope to introduce art house cinema to a whole new audience. Recently, The Auteurs announced a prestigious partnership with another more widely known auteur: Scorsese. The site is collaborating with Scorsese's World Cinema Foundation (WCF) -- an organization dedicated to restoring lost cinema classics from around the world -- to exhibit the refurbished masterpieces online. The first four rescued works from Scorsese's project are currently available to watch for free on The Auteurs Web site. Among them are Korean domestic thriller ""The Housemaid"" (1960) and ""Transes"" (1973), a documentary about pioneering Moroccan band Nass El Ghiwan, famously described by Scorsese as ""the Rolling Stones of North Africa."" Watch a clip from ""The Housemaid"" Watch a clip from ""Transes"" ""It is really exciting and important to have Scorsese preserving the films he is preserving,"" said one of the masterminds behind The Auteurs, Eduardo Costantini, over the phone from New York. ""As he said, it's not only important to preserve, but to show -- and he chose The Auteurs because of our look and feel and our philosophy and concept. We are really proud."" The basic ambition behind The Auteurs is to make high quality cinema accessible to a young, global audience by making it available on demand cheaply. ""If you are not in LA, London, New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, Paris, or Berlin, forget it,"" Efe Cakarel told CNN over the phone from Palo Alto, California. ""Many of these films you cannot get even on DVD if you are living in Warsaw, in Istanbul, in Seoul or Buenos Aires."" The Auteurs is Cakarel's brainchild: an ambitious former Goldman Sachs banker with a head for technology, he came up with the idea back in 2007 in Tokyo when, with some spare time on his hands, he tried to watch Wong Kar-wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" on the Internet. ""It was very simple. I went online and I did not find a place that I could use,"" he says. He started writing his business plan there and then. Cakarel says he knew that if he was going to succeed in his quest to bring quality cinema to the global village he would have to enlist some of the industry's top brass. Enter Argentine millionaire, Eduardo Costantini of Costa Films, the company behind 2007 Berlinale winner ""Elite Troop,"" and Hengameh Panahi of Paris-based distributor Celluloid Dreams which represents films like Jacques Audiard's ""A Prophet,"" which won the Grand Prize at Cannes Film Festival this year. Costantini and Panahi have instilled the site with their film knowledge, and paved the way for the site's other major collaboration with masters of the vintage re-release, the Criterion Collection. Each month, the Criterion Collection curates a free online film festival making available classic films from its large library on The Auteurs. This month, users can watch Michelangelo Antonioni's 1960 classic ""L'Avventura"" or ""Harakiri"" (1962) by Japanese master Masaki Kobayashi. Of course, all this begs the question: is there really a big appetite for auteur-driven feature films outside the lofty but limited cinephile circles -- especially at a time when studio-driven blockbuster fodder like ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""Angels & Demons"" dominate at the box office? ""I want to create an entirely new audience for these films,"" says Cakarel. ""Because the only thing people in much of the world are exposed to is ""Spiderman 3"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in their local multiplex."" The Auteurs is one of a number of Web sites, like jaman.com, making previously hard-to-find films available on the Internet since the YouTube revolution paved the way for new ways of consuming video on the Web. The Auteurs' particular niche is auteur-driven cinema combined with social networking: ""Putting the films online is only part of it. The moment you put the film in the existing conversation between people that know each other, then you create a platform for discovery. According to Cakarel, what sets the site apart from the others is quality: each film is individually encoded (compared to most sites, which batch encode films) for the Web which he says gives a higher quality of sound and vision than anywhere else on the Web. ""Being the best in the world has a huge premium and I know that we can be the best in the world,"" said Cakarel. The site is cleanly designed, easy to navigate and you can pay to watch films like 1998 Dogme 95 classic ""Festen"" by Danish director Thomas Vinterberg and ""The Corporation,"" (2003) an unsettling examination of the pre-eminence of big business. Currently there are 200 films available to watch, some free, but mostly for around $5. Costantini says he hopes to increase the number of films to 1,000. Despite the unabashedly highbrow aims of the site, both Cakarel and Costantini realize they will need to include more commercial fare if they want to increase membership of the site which currently stands at around 80,000. ""It is important we start getting some major films,"" said Costantini. ""Not only treasures that Scorsese restores but also some films that are more commercial."" Cakarel says he would love to host quality studio films like the Coen's ""No Country for Old Men,"" Oscar-winner ""There Will be Blood,"" and Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds."" But there are limits: ""I will never put a mainstream film that is purely for entertainment; that has no soul on the site. ""You will never see 'Knocked Up' or 'Spiderman 3.'""","Scorsese collaborates with Web site The Auteurs to put restored films online free .

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers in Belgium on Thursday approved a ban on the wearing of burqas and other Islamic garb that covers a woman's face but the bill must still be approved by the upper house of parliament before it becomes law. If the Senate approves it, Belgium would become the first country in Europe to ban the burqa. The vote in the Chamber of Deputies was 136 in favor, none opposed and two abstentions, according to Dominiq van Dendossche, a press officer for the Belgian parliament. Senate passage seems likely since the Chamber of Deputies approved it. Human rights group Amnesty International immediately condemned the vote. Members of parliament have said they're motivated both by security and morality in pushing for the ban. ""We think all people in public places must show their face,"" Denis Ducarme, of the liberal Reformist Movement, said earlier this month. ""We must defend our values in the question of the freedom and the dignity of the woman."" Ducarme said it's not true that Islam requires women to wear burqas, which cover the whole body and face, or niqabs, veils that cover most of the face except for a small slit for the eyes. ""The majority of Muslims in Belgium and Europe don't accept the burqa, don't accept the niqab. It's only 10 percent who are radical,"" he said, blaming trends from Pakistan and Afghanistan for encouraging facial covering. He estimated that 300 to 400 women in the country wear the niqab or the burqa. Belgium may have more than half a million Muslims among its population of 10.5 million, researchers estimate. Abdullah Bastin, a Muslim political leader in Belgium, warned earlier this month that the legislation could actually encourage more women to adopt the veil. The bill would impose a fine of 15-25 euros ($20-33) or imprisonment of one to seven days for those who break the law. Belgium is home to about 281,000 Muslims, the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates. That would make the country about 3 percent Muslim. Abdullah Bastin, a Muslim political leader in Belgium, warned earlier this month that the legislation could actually encourage more women to adopt the veil. One town in Belgium banned the burqa six years ago. Jan Creemers, the mayor of the tiny picture-postcard city of Maaseik, said it was no problem to enforce the ban, and that he had the support of the local Moroccan community. Some fines were handed out, and although none was paid, no one wears a veil in Maaseik today, he said. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson and CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","Ban must pass upper house to become law .

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association is heading back to the airwaves with yet another round of ads aimed at fighting gun-control initiatives circulating in Washington. The advocacy group announced earlier this week that its CEO, Wayne LaPierre, would unveil the new ad campaign Saturday night from Salt Lake City during a speech at the Western Hunting and Conservation Expo. In the same statement saying LaPierre would showcase new ads, the NRA said he would also ""confront the real consequences of so-called 'universal background checks.'"" As it turned out, LaPierre did not mention any new advertising in his remarks. But he did -- as he has done passionately in the past -- rail against President Barack Obama and other Democrats and the background checks that he said are ""at the very heart of their anti-gun agenda."" ""This so-called universal background check that you're hearing about all over the media ... is aimed at one thing: It's aimed at registering your guns,"" LaPierre claimed. ""And when another tragic opportunity presents itself, that registry will be used to confiscate your guns."" The ads are the NRA's latest salvo in the gun debate, attempting to influence the public -- and, thus, lawmakers -- to challenge a fresh gun-control push, one that the NRA CEO called ""the single most devastating attack on the Second Amendment that this country has ever seen."" The influential lobbying group has been vocal since Obama called for action in the days after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 students and six adults dead. Afterward, NRA leaders said they would work with local officials to get more qualified armed guards in schools, while sharply resisting proposals to ban assault weapons, limit the size of gun magazines and to expand the system of background checks for firearms purchases. The NRA efforts include advertisements such as the one, broadcast in mid-January, that described Obama as an ""elitist hypocrite"" because his two daughters are protected while at school by armed federal agents and yet he is ""skeptical"" about having armed personnel at all schools. The White House blasted that ad, as did members of both political parties, for injecting the president's children into the debate (and not acknowledging they may face different threats than other American schoolchildren). But NRA President David Keene defended the spot on CNN, saying, ""What we're talking about is folks who have protections for their own children, ... then pooh-pooh the idea that the average American's children should have the same sort of protection."" The gun rights organization also posted a web video that month asserting Obama's attempts to enact gun control laws would result in the ""confiscation"" of people's firearms. More recently, the NRA ran ads in newspapers in five states -- Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina and West Virginia -- with the headline: ""Will Obama's gun control proposals work? His own experts say 'No.'"" Democratic incumbent senators in three of those states are facing tough reelection fights, another is retiring and in the fifth, Maine, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection next year. That ad buy, which also includes regional publications and online commercials, will cost the NRA about $350,000, a source familiar with it told CNN. This follows the spending of about $100,000 to air a web video on various news sites in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, South Dakota and the District of Columbia. The NRA has been successful in the past in thwarting gun-control legislation by building support on the grass-roots level, and that is where the group is focusing much of its efforts now. Still, the organization has a challenge, given the horrific nature of the Newtown massacre -- coming on the heels of several other mass shootings -- and the high priority that Obama is placing on gun control. It also has competition in terms of ads, with groups such as MoveOn.org and Mayors Against Illegal Guns taking to newspapers and the airwaves themselves to push for stricter gun control measures.","NRA promises to release new ads, criticize 'so-called universal background checks'

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ordered a mental evaluation for a Texas actress charged with sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg last month. Shannon Richardson, 35, was ordered to undergo the evaluation within 30 days, according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Texarkana. She is charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The request was made by Richardson's attorney. Richardson is in federal custody. Richardson, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, initially told the FBI that her husband, Nathaniel, had sent the ricin-laced letters, but a polygraph exam found her to be ""deceptive"" on the matter, authorities said.

"(CNN) -- It may be far from home but a South African company is powering its way into the U.S. energy landscape, hoping that its grand plan to introduce a once-shunned technology in the United States will pay off. Sasol, a Johannesburg-based energy giant, announced late last year its intention to spend up to $14 billion on building the first U.S.-based commercial plant to perform the alchemy of turning natural gas into liquid fuels -- hailed as one of the biggest investments from a non-U.S. company in American history. Using a process known as gas-to-liquids (GTL), the company plans to chemically convert gas into transport fuels, lubricants and other chemical products. ""In that technology we take natural gas and we actually break the molecule down and then reform that molecule into other high-value products like diesel,"" says Mike Thomas, Sasol's vice president of U.S. operations, explaining the company's proprietary technology. Gas boom . Sasol's mega-project in Louisiana also includes a separate $5 to $7 billion ethane cracker and derivatives plant. It has picked the United States for its GTL facility because the country has abundant shale gas, released through the controversial drilling process of hydraulic fracturing -- or fracking . Due to the rise in fracking, estimates suggest that the U.S. has more than 100 years' supply of natural gas. Sasol, which has been producing synthetic fuels for decades, says it will not be fracking directly to source natural gas feedstock for its facilities, instead tapping into the U.S. natural gas market through the existing infrastructure. Read this: World's biggest dam to light up Africa? ""The price of the natural gas in the United States is about the lowest in the world and the markets are also in the U.S.,"" says Thomas. ""If you look within the United States, particularly on the U.S. Gulf Coast where we are ... there is no better infrastructure for the petrochemical industry in the United States, and probably in the world."" Old technology, new use? Although GTL is only now gearing toward its commercial U.S. debut, the process on which it's based dates back to the 1920s. Yet, by the 1950s, the conversion technology was largely abandoned. High production costs and the emergence of much cheaper products made from refined crude oil rendered GTL commercially unviable. Meanwhile, the high correlation between natural gas and crude oil markets meant that there wasn't a significant difference between the two prices, therefore no opportunity for companies to exploit margins. As a result, the technology failed to establish a foothold in the market. The only country where it gained wide traction was coal-rich South Africa where international embargoes during the apartheid years made oil hard to come by. Today, only Sasol and Royal Dutch Shell are converting gas into liquid vehicle fuel on a commercial level. Yet experts say the current price difference between natural gas and oil, courtesy of the recent shale gas boom, coupled with the long-term global transport trends favoring low-emissions fuels, have helped turn GTL into a particularly appealing proposition in places like North America -- as it means less reliance on oil from the Middle East. ""We're taking Sasol's technology, which was developed here in South Africa for the past 63 years, and helping the U.S. be more energy independent and have a security of supply,"" says Sasol's chief executive David Constable. Restraints . Sasol, which already operates smaller GTL plants in South Africa and Qatar, expects its Louisiana-based facility to produce at least 96,000 barrels per day, creating 1,200 permanent jobs in the following years. It describes GTL diesel as a cleaner-burning fuel that can be used in existing vehicles and fuel delivery infrastructure without any modifications. Yet despite the renewed interest in GTL, many still see the technology as a precarious business. Analysts say the requirement to invest hefty sums to build plants and manufacture products means that finances for large-scale projects could often be difficult to balance. ""The economics can be a bit shaky,"" says Craig Brown, downstream oil and petrochemicals analyst at PFC Energy. ""The whole process is extremely energy intensive and tends to be more costly than crude distillation,"" he adds. But, more importantly, critics say the biggest danger is that if the cost of gas rises to the price of oil, the technology will lose its commercial appeal. ""With that amount of capital expenditure, they need to have a degree of certainty that the gas prices are going to stay at a certain price for a long period of time to make it an economically viable project long-term,"" says Brown. 'Very viable' Still, Sasol is determined to press ahead with its big plans. The company says its investments are ""well-reviewed"" and thoroughly scrutinized ""to make sure that these are good sound projects"" that will open up new economic opportunities. ""We've looked at it in many different ways,"" says Constable. ""We've proven it here in South Africa, we've proven it up in Qatar,"" he adds. ""It's a sought-after product, it's a sought-after technology -- if you look at those dynamics as macroeconomics over the long term, we see our projects as being very, very viable.""","South African energy giant Sasol building a gas-to-liquids plant in Louisiana .

"(CNN) -- Country music singer Mindy McCready was hiding in the closet with her son when authorities took the 5-year-old boy into custody in Arkansas, officials said early Saturday. Authorities found Zander McCready and his mother in a home in Heber Springs, Arkansas, according to David Rahbany, the chief deputy U.S. Marshal in eastern Arkansas. ""The child appeared to be in good condition when we found him ... he was in the closet with his mother,"" Rahbany said. Local sheriffs and marshals had placed the home -- believed to belong to the singer's boyfriend -- under surveillance for hours before they found the boy late Friday, he said. The boy is in the custody of the Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services, who will make arrangements to take him to his legal guardian in Florida, his maternal grandmother. Until recently, the boy has been living with Mindy McCready's mother and stepfather, Gayle and Michael Inge, who have legal custody. The singer, who has fought a public battle against drug addiction, has visitation rights. McCready took her son from her mother's Florida home late last month and asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety. A Florida judged signed an emergency ""pickup order"" Thursday authorizing law enforcement officers to get the boy. McCready's mother and stepfather said they are relieved. ""We feel sorrow for Zander because he's traumatized, and for Mindy,"" they said. ""We just hope she does the right thing from here on out and that this is a wake-up call for her."" McCready was not charged with a crime Friday, Rahbany said, adding it is unclear whether she faces any future charges. The singer burst on the music scene in 1996 with the debut album ""10,000 Angels"" and the chart-topping country hit ""Guys Do It All the Time."" Her website biography says she had an ""explosive relationship"" with the boy's father, Billy McKnight, who is a country singer. McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew."" CNN's Tom Watkins, Phil Gast, Michael Martinez, Selin Darkalstanian, Dave Alsup and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","The singer is found hiding in a closet with her son .

"(CNN) -- Here we go again. Just as in the 1980's, some conservative moralists and pundits are trying to blame America's current economic insecurity, joblessness and social inequality on the very people most victimized by these socioeconomic trends. Once again, they are telling us that people can make it if they just pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, keep their shoulders to the grindstone and cross their legs until marriage. A paper from the Heritage Foundation last week week recycles the 1992 election slogan that the best antidote to poverty is marriage. This theme was also sounded by Rick Santorum at the Republican National Convention, who claimed that the cure for poverty and economic insecurity is within anyone's grasp: ""Graduate from high school, work hard and get married before you have children,"" he exhorted his listeners to thunderous applause, ""and the chance you will ever be in poverty is just 2%."" Seriously? Have any of these pundits and politicians talked to any people who have lost their jobs in the past 15 years? Graduating from high school is certainly a good idea, but it's no longer much protection against poverty. In fact, 70% of working-age adults who live in poverty do have high school diplomas, and many have even attended college, according to calculations prepared for a forthcoming paper by economist Shawn Fremstad, senior research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Over the past three years, indeed, Americans with some college under their belts have experienced sharper declines in income than any other group. Working hard is also good advice, but a majority of American families have seen their real wages stagnate or decline over the past 30 years, even as they increased their involvement in paid labor. By 2007 -- before the start of the recession -- the average employed 25- to 29-year-old man with a high school degree made almost $4 less per hour (in constant dollars) than his counterpart in 1979. And that's if he could find work in the first place. The likelihood that such a man would experience a job loss, reduction in pay and benefits, or financial emergency he could not meet out of savings has increased threefold since the 1970s. In an era when two incomes are increasingly necessary to raise a family, getting married makes excellent economic sense for a woman who wants to have a child. But first she needs to find a man who can actually make a financial contribution to the marriage -- an increasingly difficult task, especially for working-class African-American women. University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen reports in his forthcoming book, ""The Family: Diversity, Inequality and Social Change,"" that in big cities, there are often fewer than 50 single, employed black men for every 100 unmarried black women in the same age range, because of poor employment opportunities, high incarceration rates and disproportionate mortality rates. White working-class women, with or without high school degrees, also increasingly face a shortage of marriageable men. And they have good reason to approach marriage cautiously, even if they get pregnant, because economic insecurity is strongly associated with marital distress. This is one reason that high school graduates are twice as likely to divorce as more economically secure college graduates. Getting married and then divorcing often leaves a woman worse off than if she had remained single, with or without children, and had focused on improving her own earning power. It is true that single parenthood is associated with poverty, especially in the United States, where single mothers find it hard to work full time or further their education because they lack affordable child care. But nonmarriage is often a result of poverty and economic insecurity rather than a cause. Unemployment, low wages and poverty discourage family formation and erode family stability, making it less likely that individuals will marry in the first place and more likely that their marriages will dissolve. The claim that single motherhood is currently the biggest obstacle to success in America is particularly wrong-headed, because the claim is almost 30 years out of date. Rising rates of unwed motherhood did contribute to increases in the percentage of low-income and poverty-level families in America from 1975 to 1995. But since then, the majority of the increase in family inequality has been because of growing economic insecurity in groups of people who have the same family structure. Almost 36% of American's impoverished children -- 5.9 million kids -- live with married parents. If we include low-income families -- people who are just one missed pay check, one illness or one divorce away from poverty -- the figure rises to nearly 50%. Another claim being recycled in this campaign season-- that our social and economic ills come from people depending too much on government--is equally divorced from reality. One of the biggest myths promulgated over the past two decades has been the insistence that government support systems inevitably perpetuate dependency. But history tells a different story. From the 1950s to the mid-1970s, the United States greatly increased government support systems for workers, expanding Social Security, enlarging the safety net and investing in school construction and infrastructure that created jobs for blue collar workers while improving housing and educational access for the middle class. The result? More Americans were able to work their way into economic security and to invest in education and training that enabled their children to do even better. Over that period, the poverty rate was halved, falling from 22% to 11%. It is not the expansion but the erosion of government support and job creation over the past three decades, in combination with the decline of labor unions and employers' benefits, that largely accounts for the setbacks American families are experiencing and for the decline in social mobility since the 1980s. Investing in living-wage jobs and reducing the inequities between local school districts would give young people more, not less, incentive to postpone childbearing and more possibilities for independence. And here's one more thing to ponder for anyone truly interested in helping young people avoid early parenthood: Since the majority of unwed births, especially among youths, are unintended, government should also provide more widespread access to comprehensive sex education programs and contraception, not throw up barriers to such access. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Coontz.","Stephanie Coontz: Chorus of conservatives says marriage, high school diploma fight poverty .
She says that misleads: 70% in poverty have diploma; there is a scarcity of breadwinning men .
She says divorce often leaves women worse off than if they'd stayed single, pursued college .

"(CNN) -- UPDATE: We all know the old saying about things that seem too good be true ... but sometimes we get pulled in by golden ideas anyway. Such, it seems, is the case with KLM's ""lost and found"" dog, Sherlock. It appears that the Sherlock video is nothing more than a marketing stunt to promote the airline's new lost and found service. ""The dog Sherlock symbolizes the service we are offering to our customers,"" a KLM spokesman said in an e-mail to CNN. ""It shows the effort and dedication of our Lost & Found team."" Whoever that beagle is, we still love him/her. Even if, to quote another old saying, that dog don't hunt. Warning: After seeing this achingly adorable video of KLM's newest employee in action you might be tempted to leave your gadgets behind on your next flight into Amsterdam. Meet Sherlock, the appropriately named beagle tasked by the Royal Dutch Airlines with returning items forgotten on planes by passengers flying into Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. ""We train for muscle strength, endurance and, of course, socialization,"" says Dirk Van Driel, Sherlock's trainer, in a video about the dog, which has been viewed more than 2.7 million times since it was posted to YouTube Tuesday. ""When you see the reactions of the passengers, that really is amazing."" Judging by the collective ""awww"" that rings out through the arrivals hall as Sherlock uses his remarkable sniffing powers to track down the owner of a forgotten iPhone, the dog is a hit. ""He can really do something no one else can"" KLM says Sherlock is part of a new lost and found team put together in response to the high number of queries about forgotten items the airline receives through social media. Should the incredibly eager beagle not be around to help, the airline uses information such as seat numbers, phone numbers and public social media details to reunite passengers with their belongings. ""Personally, I think he's a real asset to the company,"" says Chantel Kremer of KLM's ground crew. ""And he can really do something no one else can."" Prized for their phenomenal sense of smell and ability to categorize scents, beagles are a familiar sight in airports around the world. Perhaps the most famous is the Beagle Brigade -- made up of teams of dogs that inspect luggage for restricted agriculture at U.S. airports.","Beagle ""Sherlock"" returns items forgotten on KLM planes by passengers .

"(CNN) -- During the days leading up to the 20th anniversary of the release of Nirvana's landmark album ""Nevermind"" on Saturday and the grunge album's deluxe reissue the following Tuesday, you're going to hear a lot about how ""Nevermind"" changed everything: . How the band's single, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" was a phenomenal, seemingly overnight success that ushered so-called alternative rock into the mainstream. How ""Nevermind"" killed hair metal and unseated Michael Jackson -- the old guard -- from the top of the Billboard album chart. How the success of ""Nevermind"" ignited a major-label feeding frenzy to find ""the next Nirvana,"" resulting in the signing of previously way-too-weird-for-a-major-label bands such as underground heroes The Jesus Lizard and Japanese noise-rockers the Boredoms. How most of these groups were unceremoniously dropped when they didn't sell boatloads of records, while groups perceived by many to be Nirvana and/or Pearl Jam ripoffs (i.e.: Stone Temple Pilots, Candlebox, Bush) achieved multiplatinum success. How Kurt Cobain gave voice to a disaffected, flannel-clad Generation X. And how Cobain was a musical genius, gone from this Earth too soon. And all of these things are true, aside from the hair-metal myth (glam-metal was already a genre in decline by that point). You'll also be hearing a lot of use of the word ""grunge,"" a label used -- typically to the labeled party's chagrin -- to describe purveyors of the raw fusion of heavy metal and punk rock that emerged from the Pacific Northwest. But what you won't hear quite so much are the specifics of that emergence. In some quarters, it seems 1991, which also saw the release of Pearl Jam's multiplatinum debut album ""Ten"" and Soundgarden's ""Badmotorfinger,"" is being treated as year 0 of grunge, because that's when the music exploded into the mainstream consciousness. In fact, grunge's roots can be traced back to the 1980s, if not further. ""Deep Six,"" the 1986 compilation on Seattle label C/Z Records, is recognized as the first record to document this burgeoning regional sound. It featured a half-dozen local bands: Soundgarden, Green River, the Melvins, Malfunkshun, the U-Men and Skin Yard. None of those groups is a household name, save for Soundgarden, which scored a No. 1 hit with the album ""Superunknown"" in 1994 and just this year embarked on a North American reunion tour after more than a decade apart. But if you want to know how Nirvana and Pearl Jam came to be, these six bands -- whose histories are tightly intertwined -- are a good place to start. Skin Yard's guitarist, Jack Endino, produced Nirvana's the down-tuned and scuzzy debut album, ""Bleach."" Members of Green River, often cited as the first grunge band, went on to form Pearl Jam and quintessential grunge rockers Mudhoney. The Melvins, who have essentially never stopped touring or recording with 20 studio albums to their name, were friends and mentors to Nirvana's Cobain and Krist Novoselic, who hailed from the same rural part of Washington state. As Novoselic once said of the sway Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne held over him: ""Buzz was the preacher, and his gospel was punk rock."" The Melvins sonic influence on Nirvana's first album is unmistakable. But to hear Osborne tell it, his band's importance has too often been diminished. ""All (Nirvana) biographers want to do is pretend that we don't matter,"" the never-shy singer/guitarist said to me at the onset of the first interview I conducted with him for my book. ""They talk us down like none of this makes any difference, but what they have to understand, and what needs to be clearly stated, is that without us, there is no Nirvana. Without us, there is no Nirvana."" So by all means go ahead and purchase the ""Nevermind"" reissue or catch a showing of Cameron Crowe's new ""Pearl Jam Twenty"" documentary, and relive the glories of grunge's most commercial era. But if you want a deeper understanding of where grunge came from, investigate some music by the Melvins (those Nirvana biographers be damned!) or Mudhoney or any number of other grunge bands not fronted by someone with the surname Cobain, Vedder or Cornell. Yes, 1991 was a very good year for grunge, but why not try something of a different vintage?","Grunge's roots can be traced back to the 1980s, if not further .

"(CNN) -- Do you dare to overshare your kids' exploits on social media? From bragging ""mommyjackers"" and smug ""sanctimommies"" to pictures of poop-smeared kids and placenta art, blogger Blair Koenig has seen it all. In fact, she's made a career of cataloging examples from the worst parental offenders on her website STFU, Parents. Koenig has collected examples of the most frequent and flagrant Web etiquette violations into a new book, ""STFU, Parents: The Jaw-Dropping, Self-Indulgent, and Occasionally Rage-Inducing World of Parent Overshare."" Read an e-mail Q&A with Koenig below, edited for clarity and brevity: . CNN: What inspired the website? Koenig: I started the site in March 2009 after noticing a lot of ""kidformation"" in my Facebook newsfeed. Several of my friends were new parents, and my feed was suddenly filled with updates about fluctuating fevers, diaper changes and nap times. I began thinking this was something others might be experiencing when a friend (and mom of two) sent me a few screen shots of her old college friends talking about their ""perfect"" children in their status updates. I had no idea back then just how much parents truly overshare about their kids. The examples that inspired the site now seem very tame. But regardless of what gets posted, the purpose of the blog has always been to highlight modern parenting trends while having a laugh. I'm interested in discussion and etiquette, but I also want it to be entertaining. CNN: Who contributes the photos and notes? Koenig: I've heard from everyone you could possibly imagine being Facebook friends with: friends of friends, co-workers, siblings, old high school acquaintances. For a long time, the majority of submissions came from nonparents, often people who worked with kids, like nannies, baby sitters and teachers. But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying. More often than not, the person does know the ""offending"" parent and has been pushed to the edge. If a submitter says, ""This person never usually overshares,"" I'll take that into consideration and might not run the submission. But most of the time, that's not the case. Once a poop picture oversharer, always a poop picture oversharer. CNN: What are some common types of overshare? Koenig: The aforementioned poop pictures are probably the most common type of submission I receive. I have categories within subcategories because I get so many submissions about poop and potty training. But aside from that, I consider ""overshare"" anything a person probably should have kept to herself. This can include hostile complaints about the UPS man waking the baby (Woe Is Mom), self-righteous updates about being a ""supermom"" (Sanctimommy) and hijacking a friend's status update to talk about your baby in the comments (Mommyjacking). I also get a lot of graphic labor and delivery pictorials. Some people have no filter. CNN: Do parents ever share their own overshares? Koenig: I get e-mails from parents who say they're ""reformed"" and submit old examples of their oversharing ways. I've also heard from parents who say they read the blog because it makes them feel better about their own parenting! CNN: How do you tread the line between being antagonistic to parents and just highlighting when they go too far? Koenig: To me, humor isn't good if it's hateful. The trends I highlight are inherently ridiculous, and I try to emphasize the difference between sharing and oversharing. If you're just posting a cute picture of your kid eating ice cream, it won't get featured on STFU, Parents. CNN: Do you ever get backlash against your posts from parents? Koenig: If there's a backlash, it's not really from parents. It's more general, like people who just disagree with the blog's existence. The mom blogger community has unleashed some fury against me and the site, but even in those cases, I think it was just one segment of that community. I've rarely received hate mail, fortunately, and I get a lot of nice e-mails from parents. One parent did send me a death threat, though. It involved killing me with a piano. CNN: Do you think social media has created a whole new breed of oversharing or just provided more immediate access to it? Koenig: Social media is the gateway drug to oversharing. Give people a Facebook or Twitter account and tell them to post whatever they want, and soon you will see a total devolution of acceptability. After all, you're behind a computer or on your phone, and you're almost tricked into thinking that what you post can simply be erased later. But in reality, once you post something online, it's there forever. CNN: Some of the blog's content has to do with sharing potty training pictures. What's the most disgusting example of oversharing that you've been sent? Koenig: That answer depends on the person, because some people don't find poop disgusting but are completely repulsed by vomit or long strands of green snot. You name it, I've seen it. Bloody noses, diaper blowouts, crowning newborns, and I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I have a whole folder dedicated to ""finger-painting with poop"" submissions. Some people will even make art prints with their placentas to frame and hang in their homes. It's all pretty gross. CNN: What does the book offer that the blog doesn't? Koenig: The book is broken out into 34 short chapters that each represent a different category. It's like a funny field guide to parent overshare, and I think it'll be an essential baby shower gift. It also includes a glossary of words you might encounter in modern parenting culture (like birth art, dipe and Nevaeh), and there are helpful pointers, lists and a quiz to help you determine if you overshare. The blog is great for random doses of laughter, but the book is a cohesive guide that can be used like a ""what not to share"" manual. CNN: Do you think your perspective or tone will change if you choose to become a parent? Koenig: There are two kinds of people on social media: those who post too much information and those who don't. The ones who do aren't in the habit of considering their ""audience"" when they post. They just see social media as a digital scrapbook of their lives. I see it as a way to connect and share relevant information, and I don't think a child's poop texture is of any relevance to people other than a child's parents. I also think there's a difference between crowdsourcing the best type of car seat to buy and crowdsourcing an toddler's mysterious, full-body rash. CNN: Many people baby their pets. Do you have any plans to start a STFU, Pet Owners site? I've been collecting pet examples for over three years, and I can report that ""pet parents"" can be just as bad as human parents. Some people even take pictures of their pet's poop. None of it makes sense to me, and I'm excited to share my confusion with readers. For instance, I recently received a series of submissions about a ""dog mom"" who celebrated her dog's birthday and documented the whole shebang on Facebook, ""tagging"" him in every photo. That kind of stuff deserves to be seen. Follow Blair Koenig on Twitter @stfuparents .","Submitters are often friends of the oversharers, says blogger Blair Koenig .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office is reopening its investigation into the death of movie star Natalie Wood, who drowned in 1981 while boating off Catalina Island near the California coast, authorities said Thursday. Homicide investigators are taking a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who claimed they had ""additional information"" about the drowning, the sheriff's department said in a statement. Authorities didn't provide further details late Thursday and said a news conference on the matter will be held Friday at 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET). Last year, the actress' sister, Lana Wood, and the captain of the yacht on which Wood sailed with her husband, actor Robert Wagner, had asked the sheriff's office to reopen the case. On Thursday, L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Benjamin Grubb couldn't say whether the sister and the yacht captain have prompted the renewed investigation. ""I don't know if that's related, but that's what the press conference is about tomorrow,"" Grubb told CNN. Natalie Wood once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater. On November 29, 1981, she drowned in the Pacific Ocean off the isthmus of Catalina Island. Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht. According to police reports, Wood was found wearing a long nightgown, socks, and a down jacket. The autopsy report shows Wood had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek, and bruises on her arms. ""My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,"" said Lana Wood. Although the county coroner's office ruled that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense. In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and husband on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play. ""I just want the truth to come out, the real story,"" she said last year. Dennis Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour broke his long silence with a detailed account in ""Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,"" a book he wrote with his friend Marti Rulli. It was published in September 2009. Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of the fight with Wagner. Lana Wood and Davern couldn't be reached immediately for comment Thursday. Wagner's publicist Alan Nierob issued a statement saying the actor's family ""fully support the efforts of the LA County Sheriff's Dept. and trust they will evaluate whether any new information relating to the death of Natalie Wood Wagner is valid, and that it comes from a credible source or sources other than those simply trying to profit from the 30 year anniversary of her tragic death."" Nierob said no one from the sheriff's department has contacted Wagner or anyone in his family about the case. In a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request. Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They often sailed their yacht off the coast of California and they invited Wood's ""Brainstorm"" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on a sail on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981. Walken and Wood had been filming ""Brainstorm"" at the time and the Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous over Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple. Walken couldn't be reached immediately for comment Thursday. Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book ""Pieces of My Heart,"" also published in September 2009. He acknowledged that there had been a fight with Wood, writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table. After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN last year. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting. Embarrassed, Davern said he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw both Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. ""They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,"" he said. A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing. Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper. Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off. Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner wrote that he assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own. He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood. The dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found. Wood's first starring role was as a child in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading men -- James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and Warren Beatty in ""Splendor in the Grass."" She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for ""Love With the Proper Stranger"" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in ""West Side Story."" Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two popular series, ""It Takes a Thief"" (1968-70) and ""Hart to Hart"" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the ""Austin Powers"" spy spoofs.

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. The habits of coworkers can be irksome in the tight quarters of the modern office. Being part of a team can be a great learning experience when collaboration and discussion lead to new ideas and career growth. But for some employees, like these professionals we talked to, interactions with co-workers range from merely irritating to being a complete nightmare. (To protect the innocent and the annoyed, some of these workers are only sharing their first names.) Do any of these sound familiar? The scented worker . ""I worked with a guy that smelled like dirty, wet rags. That was pretty annoying,"" recalls Christine Lam, a entrepreneur based in Washington state. The issue impacted Lam's productivity. ""He smelled so terrible, it made my eyes water and it was very difficult to work with him as a result."" Back away from the Blackberry! Many of us are irked by our fellow employees spending way too much time on personal phone calls or texting friends and family. And perhaps no device is more visible at work than the Blackberry. ""I had a co-worker who was on his Blackberry so much he'd mastered blind-typing on it,"" says Andrew Chris, an employee at Olighting.com, an online retailer. Unfortunately, the Blackberry-addicted team member couldn't type, text and talk at the same time. ""Talking to him while he is busy typing was comparable to talking to a container of glue."" Too much face time on Facebook . Krista, a consultant in Colorado, found the allure of the Internet severely curtailed her co-worker's ability to get anything done. Krista's ""no-worker"" was particularly addicted to social networking sites. ""She would spend the majority of the day on her MySpace and Facebook pages, which she took great pains to maintain,"" she notes. In terms of actual work, Krista's teammate wasn't too productive. ""I'd say she worked approximately two hours a day, and most of it had to be corrected or redone."" The bad behavior list . Those may have been some extreme examples, but co-workers can annoy us, rub us the wrong way and make us get our hate on for a number of reasons. If they're not singing, our co-workers are chewing, slurping, sniffling, coughing or belching in a way that's impossible for us to ignore. What are the most common reasons a fellow worker might be annoying? They're annoying you (and all of us) in many ways: . • He or she is a ""Debby Downer,"" or has a consistently negative attitude at work. • They're incredibly nosy or prone to gossip. • They bring aromatic food to their desks for lunch. Tuna fish, broccoli and asparagus are just a few of our favorites. • They use their cubicles as a spaces to take care of personal hygiene. Everyone LOVES a fellow worker who clips his nails at his desk, right? • They leave common areas a mess, and don't clean up after themselves. • They play ""hot potato"" with responsibilities and pass the buck whenever possible. • They're constantly trying to one-up the competition. Resolving conflict . April Callis, a Michigan-based trainer and facilitator, suggests several strategies to solve conflicts with irritating co-workers before they become major issues. Ask for a resolution . ""Greet each complaint or problem with the request for a solution,"" Callis suggests. She believes this approach is less likely to put your co-worker on the defensive, but instead makes them part of the solution. Just the facts, ma'am . Another strategy Callis likes is the ""Dragnet strategy."" ""When gossip, a complaint or negative information is brought forward, play Joe Friday and document the facts."" Callis says that this approach defuses any potential sparks for greater conflict. ""This will take the emotion out of the picture."" Use humor . Any legitimate complaint about a co-worker should be taken seriously. But, minor conflict can often be resolved by using tactful humor so that the parties involved dial the intensity down a notch. Be tactful . Workers should also remember that as irritating as some of these behaviors might be, there may be other factors that are catalysts to making them happen. Excessive time on personal phone calls may be a sign of a personal crisis, while hygiene issues might arise from a medical problem. You or your manager should be fair, caring and empathetic when bringing up any issues with co-workers. They may not be aware that their actions are having an impact. ""I used to work at a company where a managing director was famous for spotting two people having a conflict and taking them to a conference room and introducing them as if they had never met or talked,"" recalls David Dalka, a Chicago-based consultant who specializes in social media change management, business development and web marketing strategy. Dalka believes it was an effective strategy. ""That was the whole point -- to encourage people to talk about little things before they became big things,"" he says. ""The culture was one that encouraged people to reconcile with one another on their own."" Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Since his recent U.S. homecoming, the long-lost son has been baptized, a good Samaritan gave him an airline ticket and now he's counting down the hours until Saturday morning -- when he will see his mother for the first time in 35 years. David Amaya Barrick, 37, made national headlines when he tried to cross the U.S. border illegally from Mexico three weeks ago -- only to remember upon arrest by the U.S. Border Patrol that he was actually a U.S. citizen born in Chicago and maybe, just maybe, his birth certificate and his mother could be found to prove it. The Border Patrol did find both, and now mother Kathy Amaya will travel Saturday from Wisconsin to San Diego, California, to see and embrace her son for the first time since he was 2 years old. The reunion will be made more dramatic by how the son speaks only Spanish and the mother knows only English. David Amaya has been staying in the care of a San Diego church since the Border Patrol released him this month. ""They didn't believe me,"" David Amaya said of the Border Patrol when they arrested him October 30. In fact, they thought he and a Mexican man were both coyotes -- or smugglers -- guiding six Romanian nationals across a putrid flood-control channel along the Mexican border at Imperial Beach, California, said Border Patrol agents. ""They would tell me, no, that I was Mexican,"" David Amaya said. ""I had to tell them the truth or they were going to send me to jail."" It's a family saga that spans 1,800 miles of separation, lasting more than three decades. But in some ways, it's only now that the mother-son relationship is really beginning. At one point, the mother nearly lost all hope of ever seeing her son again, unable to establish contact with him in central Mexico. Conflicting stories from mother and father . It begins about 35 years ago when David Amaya Barrick's father, estranged from his wife, took the boy from Chicago to San Luis Potosi, Mexico, to live with grandparents. His mother wrote letters to the grandparents' home but they were never acknowledged. So the mother, now 60, never knew of her son's whereabouts for certain, she said. His parents later divorced, and his father told him a version of events that conflicts with the mother's account. ""My dad told me that my mom had abandoned me at an orphanage center because she didn't love me,"" David Amaya told CNN. ""He dropped me off with my grandparents and went back to Chicago. He almost never spent time with me."" But his mother said her estranged husband took the boy from the care of her sister on what seemed like a routine outing. The family was living in a neighborhood near Chicago's Midway Airport, and when the boy wasn't returned home promptly, the estranged husband told his wife that he had taken the boy to Mexico for a monthlong visit. But the month became a year, and a year became decades. Kathy Amaya begged her estranged husband to return the son back to the United States, but it didn't happen, she said. Kathy Amaya said her son was taken away when he was about 2 years old, but David Amaya remembers being 3 years old at the time. Perhaps they will better determine the exact time during their long-awaited reunion. The couple divorced in 1986, but didn't settle on child custody in the divorce, Kathy Amaya said. So police were unable to help her, she said. She couldn't find him on social media because she didn't know he was using her maiden name as part of his full name -- a common practice in Latin American countries. Amaya went on to have four other children and moved to Wisconsin, where she now lives in Chippewa Falls working as an assistant housekeeper at a hotel. The ex-husband couldn't reached for comment by CNN. David Amaya was the only child his parents had together, and for now, he is withholding judgment on which parent's account to believe. While Kathy Amaya doesn't maintain contact with her ex-husband, David Amaya has been in touch with his father. The son will make up his mind on his parents' conflicting stories when he's able to talk with them side-by-side, he said. In the meantime, he's enjoying his stay in San Diego so much that he's planning on making his home there -- after reuniting with his mother in San Diego and then returning with her and her fiancÃ© to Wisconsin for a visit there, he said. A drummer who played with a band in Mexico, David Amaya said he likes San Diego's proximity to Mexico and its cultural atmosphere. Moreover, he's taken a liking to a local church pastor, Freddy Rivas, who has helped Amaya with food and shelter since the Border Patrol released him. Amaya was recently baptized at the church. ""We fed him. We give him a warm bath. He hadn't taken a shower in 10 days. He was dirty, and we clothed him,"" Rivas said. 'I know what it feels to miss a mother' Polite and attentive to visiting journalists, David Amaya appreciates how his odyssey from Mexico to the United States had a fortunate conclusion. Bandits earlier robbed him of his money and cell phone, leaving him with just his clothes on his back, he said. He didn't even have any identification when the U.S. Border Patrol arrested him, he said. During his years in San Luis Potosi, David Amaya married and had two children. But he's now divorced, and his two children live with their mother in Mexico City. Two years ago, he moved to Monterrey, Mexico, he said. Once he settles in San Diego, he's thinking of inviting his two children to visit him -- and possibly his ex-wife, ""but I can't force her,"" he said. He will be spending his first Thanksgiving as a repatriated American with his mother in her Wisconsin home, where she lives with two of her children, both in their 20s. His airline ticket to Wisconsin was given as a gift by a stranger, Frank Tsimboukaikis, who heard of David Amaya's story in the media. ""I immigrated here in '77, so I saw my mother 12 times, and anyway she passed away this year, when I was over there"" in Greece, Tsimboukaikis said, choking up. ""So I know what it feels to miss a mother -- and he never enjoyed -- so you know I said with my son, 'let's do it!'"" he said, his sentences broken up by overwhelming emotion. Tsimboukaikis just happened to visit and give Amaya the ticket while CNN was interviewing him.","David Amaya Barrick, 37, will finally see his mother for the first time in about 35 years .

"(CNN) -- A seven-year-old boy who spent a winter's night lost in chilly conditions in the Australian bush says a friendly kangaroo is the reason he survived. South Australian police said Simon Kruger went missing in the Deep Creek Conservation Park, south of Adelaide, after wandering away from a family picnic shortly after 1.15pm Saturday. A search party of about 40, including two rescue helicopters, was mobilized to locate Simon, who was wearing just a fleece top and track pants and was not equipped for a night in the elements. The search party continued their efforts through the night, operating using parachute flares, before a rescue helicopter spotted him about 500 meters from where he had gone missing nearly 24 hours earlier. He was winched to safety shortly after noon Sunday, a police spokesman told CNN, having sustained minor injuries from his night in the wilderness. But what has drawn the most attention about the episode is Simon's account of how he survived. ""Dad, I'm okay - I slept under a tree and there were kangaroos,"" were his first words to his father as he was reunited with his family, The Australian newspaper reported. His father, Etienne, told Australia's 7 News said that his son had been picking flowers for his mother when a kangaroo approached him. ""A kangaroo came closer to him and ate the flowers from him, and the kangaroo fell asleep next to him,"" Etienne Kruger told the network. ""I think God sent a kangaroo to keep him warm."" The boy's mother, Linda Kruger, added: ""I think it was a miracle, when I smell his jacket, it's kangaroo -- bush and kangaroo."" The Krugers had been confident throughout the search that their son would be found safe, with the father telling The Australian that his son was strong and resourceful. He told the Daily Telegraph newspaper Monday that his son was recovering well from his ordeal, and acting ""as if nothing had happened."" ""He's had a nice shower last night and a good sleep,"" he said. ""He's certainly got something to tell at show and tell now.""","Boy, 7, says kangaroo helped him survive a chilly night in the Australian bush .

"London (CNN) -- It's Sunday morning and I'm standing in front of a newsagent's shop, waiting for the stranger who lives above it to let me into his home. I'm one of thousands taking advantage of Open House London's all-access invitation to tour London's most prolific and innovative buildings, including private residences the public would never have access to otherwise, from the Prime Minister's historical abode to the recently renovated townhouse I've come to see. Since its inception in 1992, the concept has spread to 24 cities -- including New York, Tel Aviv and Buenos Aires -- but the London event, which takes place over one weekend each September, remains the largest, with 800 properties participating this year. Though Open House's mission is to foster an appreciation for architecture and urban design, those opening their doors to the public also provides an opportunity for the city's designers and homeowners to show off their work. How the other half lives . There's a queue outside of painter Isabelle Ducimetière's modernist home in wealthy Hampstead village (a short walk from the home of Ernö Goldfinger, the father of modernist architecture in Britain) when I arrive. The grey, angular house, designed by the award-winning Guard Tillman Pollock Architects, is the only one on its block of simple brown Victorians participating in Open House this year. ""I think it's a tribute to architecture,"" she says of her home, which was shortlisted for a Royal Institute of British Architects award in 2012. ""I believe that my house is interesting, and obviously many people do."" Inside is like an industrial gallery space, all cement and glass, with guests leaning in to examine Ducimetière's impressive collection of furniture including vintage chairs by Charles and Ray Eames) and ornaments, like a Vietnamese vase that's over 700 years old. There are as many marveling at the fortress-like wall around the garden as there are around each expensive art piece. Open House is as much a way to experience an inaccessible lifestyle as it is a chance to look at inaccessible architecture. From a family of architects herself, Ducimetière feels as though it's her duty to let others experience her home and its wonders, though it may be a bit pricey to emulate directly. ""Hopefully people enjoy it and find inspiration for their own homes, or open their views on other things related to architecture."" The business of inside access . Letting in the public can also benefit the firms behind these fantastic homes. Matt Keeler, principal architect at KSKa Architects, has been asked to show 18 properties with Open House over the last 11 years, and is always grateful to be recognized. ""For me, it's like being in a Royal Academy exhibition,"" he says. Magic Box, a west London Edwardian he redid in his studio's minimalist style (think wood, geometry, and expansive windows), is run like a realtor's showing. Visitors are asked to remove their shoes at the door, and there are finger sandwiches on offer in the kitchen. Keeler presents a slideshow about the property every thirty minutes. ""We get most of our businesses from Open House London,"" he tells me between presentations. ""Sometimes I have people say 'Matt, we've been following you for three years. Now we've got some money and we'd like you to be our architect.'"" In fact, the owners of this particular home first met Keeler at at Open House four years ago. They were so impressed that when they bought a house in 2012, they turned to him to transform their traditional home into a contemporary retreat. But even if they don't bring new business, Keeler is always receptive to feedback from those outside the design world. ""When you get little old ladies saying 'I didn't really think I liked modern architecture, but this is amazing,' it's great."" What we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Reeva Steenkamp told Oscar Pistorius she was afraid of him and his temper less than three weeks before he shot and killed her, the judge in his murder trial was told Monday. ""I'm scared of you sometimes, of how you snap at me,"" the South African model told Pistorius in a long chat message. ""You have picked on me incessantly,"" she wrote, calling Pistorius ""nasty"" after he apparently accused her of flirting with someone at a party. ""I was not flirting with anyone today and I feel sick that you suggested that,"" she told him via WhatsApp, according to the police officer who downloaded their chats after Pistorius shot and killed her. ""You do everything to throw tantrums,"" she said, concluding the message: ""I'm certainly very unhappy and sad."" Police Capt. Francois Moller, who downloaded the messages from Steenkamp's iPhone, said that 90% of the chats between the two were normal and loving. But there were several that accused Pistorius of jealousy and possessiveness. Less than a week before he killed her, she wrote him another long message after he apparently lost his temper with her as they left a public event together. She reached the exit before he did, she wrote, adding: ""I didn't think you would criticize me for doing that, especially so loudly that others could hear.... I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one after we left."" Pistorius admits that he killed Steenkamp, firing four shots through a closed door in his house in the early hours of February 14, 2013. Three hit her, with the last one probably killing her almost instantly, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy. But Pistorius says he thought she was a nighttime intruder in his pitch-black house and believed he was firing in self-defense. He pleaded not guilty to murder. Read the messages . 'Terrified screaming' Moller's testimony came after a neighbor of Pistorius said on the witness stand that she heard ""terrified, terrified screaming"" the morning the Olympian killed his girlfriend. Questioned by prosecutor Gerrie Nel, Anette Stipp said she awoke early the morning of February 14, 2013, and heard ""terrified, terrified screaming ... It sounds to me as if there's a family murder, why else would she scream like that."" Stipp described hearing a series of three shots, a woman screaming, also a man screaming, and then three more shots before the screaming stopped. Her husband, Dr. Johan Stipp, testified earlier in the trial. The trial was originally scheduled to last until March 20 but will now continue until the middle of May, the South African court hearing the case said Sunday. Trial extended to mid-May . The trial, which entered its fourth week on Monday, will continue until April 4, then break for a one-week recess before resuming from April 14 until May 16, the Pretoria court announced in a written statement. It said ""all parties involved"" had agreed to the dates. The trial began March 3. There has been intense media interest in the case in South Africa and beyond. Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict with the help of two lay people called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. Almost the entire trial has been televised, though individual witnesses can choose not to be shown on television.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Monday he thinks Hillary Clinton will run for president next year and that her decision could be known as soon as December. Kaine, a Democrat who has vowed to endorse Clinton should she run, made the comments in a question and answer session with students at Randolph Macon College in Ashland, Virginia. An audio clip of the event was provided to CNN by a person in the room who wished to remain anonymous. The former governor and chairman of the Democratic National Committee was asked if he would run for president in 2016, but Kaine waved off the question and quickly pivoted to Clinton. ""The answer is no,"" he said. ""I had come out in, I guess in April or May, to strongly support Sen. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, should she run. I have no knowledge about whether she will or won't, but my intuition tells me that she will. But that will probably not be known until, I would say, December."" Clinton has said publicly that she will make her decision about 2016 known sometime after the new year. Kaine was one of President Obama's first supporters when Obama launched his presidential bid in 2007. With his impressive resume and a deep well of respect within Democratic Party ranks, Kaine has been talked about as a potential candidate himself in 2016. But Kaine signed on with the Ready For Hillary super PAC earlier this year and announced that he will get behind Clinton if she seeks the Democratic nomination. He will also host a Washington fund-raiser for the group on Tuesday, Politico reported last week.

"London (CNN) -- Bruce Springsteen had been waiting for this moment for a long time. ""I gotta tell you,"" he said to the 76,000-strong crowd, ""I've been trying to do this for 50 years."" For the finale of his headline slot in London's Hyde Park on Saturday, he'd arranged a very special treat: An onstage collaboration with Beatles legend Paul McCartney. But the rock megastar hadn't banked on the local London council deciding to show him who was boss. At the climax of his three-hour set, Springsteen and McCartney, backed by the E Street Band and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, played a storming rendition of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to a rapturous crowd. Springsteen's delight was palpable: He grinned throughout, his face lit up like a child with a super-sized Christmas gift. The supergroup then segued into a sizzling version of ""Twist and Shout"" -- but as the night peaked against a backdrop of fireworks, a drably dressed man with sensible hair could be seen waving frantically at the back of the stage, indicating the rock legends' time was drawing to a close. Then, at 10:40 p.m. local time, as Springsteen and McCartney were winding up the extended ""Twist and Shout,"" the sound suddenly dampened, and went quiet. At first, the Boss didn't seem to notice. He attempted to address the crowd, apparently unaware that they couldn't hear him. But as it became clear that there was no amplification, he and lead guitarist Stevie Van Zandt played what looked to be a brief a cappella goodnight for the benefit of the front rows, shrugged, and left the stage. Van Zandt tweeted later, ""I'm sorry but I have to be honest I'm pissed ... It didn't ruin the great night. But when I'm jamming with McCartney don't bug me!"" He also implied his fans were denied their final number, saying, ""We would have been off by 11 if we'd done one more."" London's Westminster Council confirmed that concert organizers Hard Rock Calling had cut the power, saying they ""were sticking to their license for the event."" According to the Hard Rock Calling website, Springsteen had been due to finish his set at 10:15 p.m. But Van Zandt tweeted, ""Hard Rock would have let us play all night,"" adding, ""Feel bad for our great fans ... It's some City Council stupid rule."" Audience reaction from CNN reporter on the scene . Conditions for holding concerts in London's biggest central park have been tightened in the past year, the BBC reported, due to a rise in complaints from local residents. The Conservative-run council received 130 complaints about popular music events in the park in 2011. The events, which bring vital funding to the parks management, have been cut in number from 13 to nine and crowd size has been reduced from 80,000 to 65,000 maximum. Campaigners in the well-heeled borough have also sought a reduction in permitted noise levels. A spokesman for concert operator Live Nation said: ""It was unfortunate that the three hour plus performance by Bruce Springsteen was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public's health and safety. Road closures around Hyde Park are put in place at specific times to make sure everyone can exit the area safely."" Properties around Hyde Park are some of the most desirable in London, and popular with bankers, foreign investors and politicians. Springsteen is known for his marathon sets. This night was no different. He'd come on stage at 7:30 p.m. and played without breaks for just over three hours, from a beautiful acoustic ""Thunder Road"" through an extensive list that included ""Badlands,"" ""Because the Night,"" ""Waitin' on a Sunny Day"" and ""The River."" He then hit his high-energy closing set of ""Born in the USA,"" ""Born to Run,"" ""Glory Days"" and ""Dancing in the Dark"" before bringing on the former Beatle for the finale. But that wasn't enough to satisfy his fans, who were left baffled, then angry that their idol's set had been cut short. ""Ashamed to be British right now. Springsteen and McCartney playing 'Twist & Shout' in Hyde Park and council pulled the plug cos of curfew,"" tweeted actor and comedian Stephen Merchant. British journalist Richard James tweeted, ""Springsteen and McCartney: Only in Britain could a local council pull the plug on the greatest artists of the last 50 years giving it all."" Fan Liz Chong demanded the concert organizers apologize for cutting Springsteen and McCartney off mid-song, saying ""Won't come again.""","Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney have sound cut off at London festival .

"(CNN) -- This week there was one particular story from the UK that really seemed to resonate with Americans on the Web. Mind you, it had nothing to do with topless photos of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, for it seems we've finally moved on. Though, I'm not sure why. Seriously, when did we all of a sudden become decent human beings, unmoved by the promise of grainy photos of Catherine's bare chest? When did we decide that we would boldly shun and forget these images and thus no longer encourage the paparazzi to invade the privacy of foreign royalty? Answer: Tuesday. When we learned there might be a bacon shortage. Yes, that's when everyone here on this side of the pond collectively freaked out over the possibility that we might have to one day hit up the buffet and actually eat fresh fruit -- with all that ""nutrition"" and ""flavor."" That was the real tipping point. It's like Abraham Lincoln once said, ""You can take away our dirty Internet smut, but hands off the pork, dude."" Without question, bacon is the most interesting meat in the world, and if it were capable of original thought, we wouldn't even be having an election this November in America. We would simply appoint bacon as our forever leader and live dutifully under its rule. ""Today, for no apparent reason, I instructed U.S. troops to invade Calgary."" ""Hooray! Thanks, bacon!"" So, clearly, this was a big deal -- the kind of news that required every ounce of hyperbole I could muster. And maybe even pants. Maybe. The whole scare actually exploded on social media a couple of days after the National Pig Association of the United Kingdom (Motto: Some swine with your tea?) put out a press release ominously stating, ""A world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable."" They might as well have just printed, ""Jump off a bridge. Take a friend."" The report sort of suggested that European drought conditions were the cause of the upcoming pork shortage -- that unfavorable weather had ruined the corn and soybean crop. Thus, less feed means fewer European pigs. That, or they're all just taking a gap year to go backpacking in Australia. ""Oy, mate, let's grab a pint and be hyper-critical of the American pigs staying in our hostel."" Naturally, it didn't take too long before all hell broke loose on Twitter. The great comedian Loni Love led the way: . ""Everyone complaining about replacement refs..we got bigger problems folks!! A BACON SHORTAGE!! **faints like a vanilla sister**"" Love also once told me in an interview how she hoped Gov. Chris Christie would join the Republican primaries because ""fat presidents would get everything done before lunch."" Bacon. She gets it. But now I'm here to tell everyone in America to calm down.

"(CNN) -- It's meant to be racist, and it's meant to be discriminatory. And the controversial ""Increase Diversity Bake Sale"" hosted by the Berkeley College Republicans is still on, the club's president said, despite ""grossly misguided comments"" and threats aimed at supporters of the University of California, Berkeley, student group. During the sale, scheduled for Tuesday, baked goods will be sold to white men for $2, Asian men for $1.50, Latino men for $1, black men for 75 cents and Native American men for 25 cents. All women will get 25 cents off those prices. The bake sale is meant to draw attention to pending legislation that would allow California universities to consider race, gender, ethnicity and national origin during the admissions process. ""We agree that the event is inherently racist, but that is the point,"" BCR President Shawn Lewis wrote in response to upheaval over the bake sale. ""It is no more racist than giving an individual an advantage in college admissions based solely on their race (or) gender."" Similar events have been held at other colleges across the country, generally organized by college Republican groups. In some cases -- such as at Berkeley -- the plan sparked controversy and protests. Other times, university officials stepped in. At Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, officials shut down one of the bake sales on campus. Officials at The College of William and Mary in Virginia cut off a cookie sale, saying they were ""shocked and appalled."" The University of California, Irvine, shut down a bake sale on campus, saying it was discriminatory. A bake sale at Southern Methodist University in Texas was shut down after 45 minutes because of what officials called an ""unsafe environment,"" according to local reports. Lewis said the bake sale at Berkeley was unanimously agreed upon by the club, whose leadership includes Asian and Hispanic students and whose membership represents a ""wide variety of ethnic backgrounds."" ""More than half of the voices were female,"" he added. Berkeley's student government, the Associated Students of the University of California, held an emergency Senate meeting late Sunday to discuss the issue and passed a resolution that, in part, ""condemns the use of discrimination whether it is in satire or in seriousness by any student group."" ""I completely support the idea of BCR -- or any students on campus -- (having) political discussion,"" ASUC President Vishalli Loomba said. ""I think student members of BCR have a full right to express their feelings, but I don't necessarily think this tactic is constructive. I strongly encourage them to engage in this dialogue in a more constructive manner, such as a forum or a town hall meeting.' But the bake sale is intended to be a direct, ""physical counterpoint"" to an ASUC-sponsored phone bank -- also scheduled for Tuesday -- during which students will be encouraged to call Gov. Jerry Brown's office to support the legislation, Lewis said. The ASUC has endorsed the legislation, SB 185. Lewis said supporters of the bake sale have received threats, including people who said they will ""stop by the table only to knock it over"" or ""buy a cupcake just to throw it at (us)."" ""Some of the threats online have gotten more specific, but we're hoping that's just emotion,"" he said. While the initial feedback to the planned sale was largely in heated opposition, responses have ""plateaued"" and include the support of self-described Democrats, Lewis said. Loomba, the student government president, said she is concerned about students potentially feeling ostracized due to the bake sale. ""I have heard that from numerous students who have said this makes students feel unwelcome on campus,"" she said. ""For that reason alone, we should think about what events we have on campus."" Loomba described the situation as a ""campus climate issue."" ""UC Berkeley stands for a place where everyone -- regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation -- should feel inclusive,"" she said. ""I think they should be able to express their opinion, but keep that value in mind."" As for where the bake sale proceeds will go, Lewis said the College Republicans are considering several charities. But ""because of all this controversy, we don't want to advertise the organization,"" he said. ""We don't want to cause them problems.""","NEW: Other colleges across the country have held similar events .

"Tupelo, Mississippi (CNN) -- A Tupelo, Mississippi, man has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with an investigation into ricin-tainted letters sent to President Barack Obama and others, federal authorities said Saturday. The federal charges against James Everett Dutschke come days after prosecutors dropped charges against Paul Kevin Curtis in the same case amid Curtis' claims he was framed. Dutschke, 41, is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Oxford on Monday before Magistrate Judge S. Allan Alexander, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Mississippi. Dutschke was arrested without incident at his home early Saturday, FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden said. Earlier this week, agents searched Dutschke's residence and former martial arts studio, though it's not clear what they found. 'A train has been lifted off my shoulder,' former suspect says . The arrest of Dutschke is the latest twist in a bizarre case that began earlier this month when federal investigators arrested Curtis, an Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, for allegedly sending letters containing ricin, a deadly toxin, to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County. The letters touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Authorities later said the Boston bombings and the ricin-tainted letters were unrelated. The revelation of the ricin-laden letters recalled the fear that gripped the country in the days following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks when anthrax-laced letters were sent to U.S. senators and journalists. Curtis cleared . The FBI said the recent letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses have been reported. Prosecutors on Tuesday dropped the charges against Curtis after his attorney, Christi McCoy, told authorities that she believed her client was framed, possibly by Dutschke. As Curtis, 45, walked out of jail, FBI agents were searching Dutschke's home and the studio where he practiced martial arts. At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search ""to help clear my name."" ""I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters,"" he said. 'I am KC' The letters read, in part: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" They were signed ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" a source told CNN. Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. Curtis, a self-styled activist known as Kevin Curtis, has used similar signoffs on letters and social media posts, his attorney said. ""I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him,"" attorney McCoy told CNN. Curtis told CNN that he didn't even know what ricin was until he got out of jail and looked it up on the Internet. When police stormed his home and arrested him last week, Curtis said an investigator asked him about ricin, and Curtis said he responded, ""Well, I don't eat rice, and I don't have any rice in the house."" Online feud . Dutschke's attorney, Lori Basham, has said her client used to work for Curtis' brother, but the two have had no contact since 2010. Basham declined to comment on Dutschke's arrest Saturday. The relationship between the two men is at best hazy, with each publicly accusing the other of bad behavior. Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book, but later had a falling out. He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the former taekwondo instructor has denied. Dutschke told reporters this week that he did not know Curtis well. ""He's just a little nutty. I don't have a relationship with him,"" he said. ""I've met him two times in person, and then there was a third time we sent e-mails back and forth."" In the e-mail exchange, according to Dutschke, he accused Curtis of posting a fake membership certificate for MENSA, the high-IQ organization. Curtis acknowledged that he posted a fake certificate, but said he did it to catch Dutschke stalking him online. Ties to letters? Authorities have not said how they linked the letters to Dutschke, who appears to have personal ties to at least two of the three people who were sent letters. In 2007, Dutschke failed in his bid as a Republican to defeat Democratic state representative Steve Holland, whose mother, a judge, received one of the ricin-tainted letters. ""We just want to move on,"" Holland told CNN, adding that he wanted justice for his mother. ""This could have been devastating. Mom could have died had this taken the worst-case scenario."" Dutschke also has said he has met Wicker. Other charges . Dutschke, meanwhile, faces molestation charges in an unrelated case. According to a grand jury indictment handed down this month and obtained by CNN, he is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. The accusations go back as far as 2007, according to the indictment. Dutschke has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media, and he pleaded innocent in court this month. He closed his taekwondo studio after the allegations were made public. Vivian Kuo and Alina Machado reported from Tupelo, Mississippi; Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's John Branch and William Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: James Everett Dutschke faces unrelated child molestation charges .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia man allegedly slapped a toddler at a Walmart store because she wouldn't stop crying, authorities said. Roger Stephens allegedly slapped a stranger's crying toddler in a Walmart store in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Roger Stephens, 61, was arrested Monday and charged with first-degree cruelty to children. An incident report obtained from police in Gwinnett County indicated Stephens did not know the 2-year-old girl he stands accused of hitting. The confrontation happened shortly before noon at the Walmart in Stone Mountain, a suburb of Atlanta. According to the arresting officer, the child's mother said her daughter was crying as they walked down one of the aisles. The mother said a stranger later identified as Stephens approached them and said, ""If you don't shut the baby up, I will shut her up for you.""  Watch what the stranger said » . A few moments later, while the mother and the crying child were in another aisle, Stephens allegedly grabbed the girl and slapped her across the face. Police said he hit her four or five times. ""See, I told you I would shut her up,"" the suspect allegedly told the mother. Authorities described ""slight redness"" to the toddler's face. Before he was arrested, Stephens apologized to the mother for striking the girl, the incident report said. Stephens, a Stone Mountain resident, is being held by the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Department.","Roger Stephens, 61, is charged with first-degree cruelty to children .

"(CNN) -- In cities and towns across America, there's rising demand for affordable housing while the stock of low-cost homes evaporates. A recent Harvard Joint Center for Housing study spells out a critical national shortage -- more than half of low-income tenants today spend more than half of their income on rent. And 21 million people can't find rental homes within their means. The struggle for decent, affordable rental housing is increasingly out of reach not only for the poorest of the poor, but for the middle class as well. Some might ask: Why should the rest of us care? Why not let the market determine what is available and for how much? We should care because the supply of decent and affordable housing is crucial to any local economy. When millions of people spend the bulk of what they earn on rent, it's bad for business. Affordable housing is key to sustaining successful communities. Employers can't readily hire the workers they need if those workers can't find a decent place to live nearby. When a long, expensive commute stands between families and their jobs, schools or doctors, those families become financially unstable and pull down the communities around them. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio recognized the extent of the stunning erosion of the city's affordable housing supply (as did his predecessor Michael Bloomberg) and set a goal of adding 200,000 low-cost homes over the next 10 years. That would mean building or preserving units at a rate of about 55 a day. Meanwhile, the erosion continues: Before de Blasio's first term ends, more than 45,000 existing lower-cost homes will return to market value when restrictions that keep them affordable expire, according to NYU's Furman Center. On May 1, the mayor is set to introduce his plan for how to address the accelerating demand for affordable housing. But that demand won't be met without effective tools that enable the public and private sectors to invest in new housing while preserving existing ones. Constructing affordable housing is not only hard to do, it's just not enough. For every new unit created, at least two are lost. In hot real estate markets such as New York, regulations expire; in cooler markets, affordable units are overcome by age and decay. It is far more costly to create homes than to preserve what's already there. Any real solution, in addition to looking to new construction, must also look to preservation. The Lower East Side neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida, is a fine example of how preservation can work. Four years ago, the apartments at 887 Franklin St. were so derelict and dangerous that government housing officials considered pulling their funding, portending disaster for a neighborhood already reeling under the weight of recession and investment flight. Today, after a $5 million renovation by new owner Ability Housing of Northeast Florida, the 60-unit Oakland Terrace is a clean, well-lit and safe place for families to live, complete with a new playground that residents and their children helped design. The neighborhood now has the potential to become economically stronger. Oakland Terrace was financed through a public-private partnership made possible by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, and improvements to the property were largely paid for through an equity investment provided by a key private sector partner, TD Bank. But for every Oakland Terrace, America faces many more unresolved affordable housing challenges. A $26 billion capital-needs backlog that's associated with our publicly financed affordable housing stock looms. Traditional federal subsidies that enable affordability -- such as Section 8, which authorizes rental housing payment assistance to private landlords on behalf of more than 3 million low-income households -- are being cut back. Federal housing subsidy programs such as HOME were slashed this year. These vital programs need to be preserved and expanded. Other important tools are at the ready, but sadly, they are inactive or underutilized. Back in 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the National Housing Trust Fund, requiring at least 90% of its funds be used to build, preserve or rehabilitate rental housing for low-income households. But this program and others like it have yet to receive the funding that was envisioned by the law. Another valuable initiative is the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program, which enables private developers to work with public housing authorities to preserve affordable housing. But it has only been funded for up to 60,000 housing units. So while RAD offers promise to select cities such as Baltimore, San Francisco and Houston, hundreds more housing authorities from Los Angeles to Little Rock, Arkansas, to Lackawanna, New York, are waiting for Congress to lift the cap so that desperately needed private capital can flow to aging public housing. Expanding LIHTC -- the federal tax credit for low-income housing that was instrumental in the preservation of Oakland Terrace -- is another important step. This Reagan-era policy gives the private sector an incentive to create and invest in affordable housing and helps finance more than 100,000 new rental units every year. These tax credits enable affordable rents for low income and middle class families and is often used to create mixed-income developments. Such housing is a critical resource for working families. To date, LIHTC has financed the development of more than 2.6 million affordable rental homes across the country, leveraging more than $100 billion in private capital in the process. The Bipartisan Policy Center recently called for expanding the tax credit by 50% over current funding levels to help close the gap between the costs of producing or preserving properties and the equity and debt that can be raised from the private sector to support them. This isn't about handouts. It's about using tools we already know are shown to work to preserve and expand our nation's supply of decent homes working people can afford. Only then can employers hire the workers they need and families hold their financial footing. Only then can local communities thrive.","Demand for affordable housing is rising but there's a national shortage .

"(CNN) -- A Russian jetliner crashed on landing in the city of Kazan, killing all 50 aboard, authorities there reported Sunday. Tatarstan Airlines flight 363 carried 44 passengers and a crew of six, Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Irina Rossius said. There were no survivors. The dead included Lt. Gen. Alexander Antonov, the regional chief of Russia's Federal Security Service, and Irek Minnikhanov, the son of Tatarstan regional President Rustam Minnikhanov, Russia's state news service RIA Novosti reported. A British national was also among those killed, the UK foreign ministry said. The Boeing 737 took off from Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport, about 700 kilometers (450 miles) west of Kazan, Rossius said. There was no immediate indication of the cause of the crash, which occurred about 7:25 p.m., the ministry said. Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee has launched an investigation, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing are assisting. Boeing said it ""extends its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished."" The jet was 23 years old and had been in service with at least eight airlines, including Air France, Uganda Airlines and Bulgaria Air, according to aviation industry websites. In a November 2012 flight, it was forced to cut short a flight to Moscow and return to Kazan after losing cabin pressure, according to the website AeroInside. Russia has tried to improve its checkered reputation for air safety in recent years. In 2011, then-President Dmitry Medvedev grounded two classes of Soviet-era aircraft after a pair of crashes that killed more than 90 people, including a charter plane crash that killed an entire professional hockey team. Medvedev said Russia would have to upgrade its aircraft fleet, step up safety standards and radically cut the number of airlines. 4 die in Bahamas plane crash . Plane crashes in Bolivia, killing 8 .

"(CNN) -- A trip to the Winter Olympics in Sochi should be all about superhuman feats of skill or endurance on skis, skates or bobsleighs. But hearing the talk of U.S. security plans in the run-up to the Games in Russia next month, visitors may think they are entering a war zone. Contingency plans for evacuating Americans in case of an attack are well in hand, it would seem. The United States is moving to two warships into the Black Sea. If ordered, helicopters could be launched from there to Sochi, a U.S. official told CNN recently. And if more capacity is needed, C-17 transport aircraft will be on standby in Germany and could be on the scene in about two hours. That's in addition to U.S. precautions on Russian soil, where FBI agents are now arriving in Sochi to work with their Russian counterparts, according to Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. The United States has also discussed at the highest levels the sharing of its high-tech bomb detection technology -- developed to protect service members from deadly homemade bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan -- with Russia. Concern over explosives is heightened because the radical Islamists who have threatened to attack the Sochi Games have a track record with hidden bombs. One was detonated under a stadium grandstand in Grozny in 2004. Look who's watching over you at Sochi . And with the largest delegation of any nation to the Winter Olympics and Paralympics, as well as -- according to McCaul -- 10,000 to 15,000 Americans as spectators, the United States appears to be taking nothing for granted when it comes to security. American athletes, coaches and staff are being warned not to wear their red, white and blue Olympic uniforms outside the ""ring of steel,"" the Russian security cordon surrounding Sochi. They also will be under the watchful eye of U.S. security officials who will attend events with them, according to State Department officials. Travel warning issued . The State Department went so far last week as to issue an updated travel alert for the region, warning Game-goers that bombings and abductions continue in Russia, particularly in the North Caucasus region. It cited media reports about the hunt in Sochi by Russian authorities for ""black widows,"" wives of dead insurgents who act as suicide bombers, even as it said the U.S. government has not corroborated the reports. The reports were just one example of what one senior State Department official has described as an ""uptick in threat reporting"" in the lead-up to the Winter Games. ""Our expectation is that we will see more in the coming weeks,"" the official, speaking on background, told reporters during a briefing on Olympic security measures. But is the U.S. contingency planning in line with the potential threat? Security expert Matthew Clements, editor of IHS Jane's intelligence review in London, thinks not. ""It's normal for countries to outline contingency plans for the removal of their nationals from any country in which there's a risk to them,"" he said. ""At the same time, this is usually only undertaken in very serious situations such as cases of civil war or other kinds of conflict. ""In the event of a terrorist attack on someone in Sochi, even if it was around the city or venues, I don't think the idea of there being a U.S. military evacuation of their citizens from there would be a realistic prospect."" This, says Clements, is because it would cause huge logistical difficulties, would likely be overkill in terms of the situation and ""probably the Russians wouldn't be very happy."" 'We've had conversations' It is unclear whether a military evacuation would entail U.S. forces entering Russian territory, but Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has publicly hinted that there is a plan of some sort. ""We've had conversations with the Russian government on protection of our citizens,"" Hagel said recently. He also has said the United States has offered assistance to Russia, but there has been no request from the Russian government for help. McCaul, speaking on CNN's New Day, also said the notion that Moscow needs foreign help to deal with its own homegrown terrorist threat would likely rile many Russians. ""There's a sense of nationalistic pride in Russia, just as we would have in the United States,"" said McCaul. ""And so, while they've been very productive, cooperating with us on some issues, when it comes to the military, it gets a little sensitive."" But former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, a CNN law enforcement analyst, believes the U.S. precautions make sense. ""You'd hope that the U.S. wouldn't be sitting around waiting for a telegram from Russia going 'hey, come and get your people.' So to me, that's a commonsense approach, and the military should have a very robust plan to come in and do that,"" he said. ""If an attack occurs, you're going to have chaos. You're going to have a large problem to get ships and get helicopters, so merely getting your forces in to get your people out will be quite an event just by itself."" Russian ambassador says he's certain Olympics will be safe . Britain taking 'extra measures' Other nations are well-aware of the security risk attached to any such major event -- but are more coy about their precautions. Darryl Seibel, spokesman for the British Olympic Association, declined to go into detail about the security measures planned for Team GB in Sochi. ""We will take some extra measures for our delegates,"" he told CNN. But, he stressed, ""that is not new -- we have done that for a number of Games. That's been part of our planning from the beginning."" Seibel said the primary responsibility for security always falls to the host country and the organizing committee. It's something of which Britain is very conscious, having hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 2012. As it turned out, the London Olympics went off without incident, but the security measures taken included parking missile batteries on apartment block roofs and a huge warship on the River Thames. The precautions in Sochi are even more extensive, those who've been there say. ""This security operation is the most impressive and well-fortified that we've ever seen in Olympic history,"" McCaul said. Even so, a Quinnipiac poll conducted in the United States last week found that half those surveyed believe a terrorist attack at the Winter Olympics is very or somewhat likely. Allaying fears . But American authorities have sought to allay concerns. ""What I can tell you is there has been an uptick in some of the reporting, but that is not unusual. It's of concern, but not unusual for an event like this,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""The State Department has handled and is handling the issue of travel advisories for U.S. citizens, and we are offering the Russians any assistance that they might require or request in a situation like this."" It's not clear exactly how many people will travel to Sochi for the Games. Scott Blackmun, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said in a statement: ""The safety and security of Team USA is our top priority. ""As is always the case, we are working with the U.S. Department of State, the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe."" Former champion Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps said that the security issues are likely the last thing on the athletes' minds right now. ""As an athlete, we don't notice anything,"" he said. ""You know, we're there to represent our country and we are there to compete at the highest level."" Being in the Olympic Village with athletes from all over the world is incredible, he said, adding ""there's nothing like it.""

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors in California announced a series of actions Friday targeting what they characterized as the ""large, for-profit marijuana industry"" that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago. Four U.S. attorneys -- Benjamin Wanger, Andre Birotte Jr., Laura Duffy and Melinda Haag -- detailed in a joint press release and later press conference in Sacramento some steps that have been taken in conjunction with federal law enforcement and local officials in California. They include letters of warning to landlords and lien holders of places in which marijuana is being sold illegally, ""civil forfeiture lawsuits against properties involved in drug trafficking activity"" and numerous criminal cases. The latter refers to arrests in recent weeks related to cases filed in federal courts in Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno, all part of an effort that Wagner claimed has resulted in the seizure of hundreds of pounds of marijuana, tens of thousands of plants and hundreds of thousands in cash. ""The actions taken today in California ... are consistent with the (Justice) Department's commitment to enforcing existing federal laws, including the Controlled Substances Act, in all states,"" U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole said in a news release. In 1996, California voters approved Proposition 215 to exempt doctors and seriously ill patients from marijuana laws and allow them to grow and use it in treatment. The bill didn't legalize marijuana for all, but it did lead to the emergence of hundreds of dispensaries where people -- legally only those with medical conditions and a doctor's authorization -- could get the drug. Wagner, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California, told reporters Friday that federal authorities ""are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people. We are targeting commercial operations, which profit from growing and distributing ... and often use the trappings of state law for cover, but in fact are abusing state law."" Haag, U.S. attorney for California's northern district, claimed that ""profiteers ... motivated not by compassion, but by money"" had ""hijacked"" the intent of voters to help those suffering from debilitating conditions. And Birotte, from California's central district, said a chief problem lies in operations that make money not by selling marijuana to the sick, but to relatively healthy people. ""Marijuana sales most often to citizens who have obtained sham doctor's recommendations solely for the purpose of recreational use are the basis of a massive, massive commercial industry,"" Birotte said. But Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the advocacy group NORML, which opposes marijuana bans and penalties, told CNN on Friday that targeting those who grow or sell medical marijuana is unsound public policy, especially given what he called widespread public support for the practice. ""What today's actions did, if nothing else, is to reinforce the terrific disconnect between the federal government and not only the general population, but the 16 states and the District of Columbia that have chosen to get away from the prohibition of medical marijuana,"" said St. Pierre. Federal prosecutors on Friday referred to several ""recently unsealed"" criminal cases related to their effort. One alleged that two people in San Fernando Valley used encrypted phones to coordinate sales of marijuana to locales as far away as New York, netting $194,000 each in profits monthly. And six defendants out of San Diego face a 77-count indictment for allegedly running ""a wide-ranging conspiracy that included numerous marijuana sales to underaged persons."" Wagner claimed that people, ""often with criminal records, are coming to California to set up marijuana operations taking advantage of the lax enforcement environment in this state."" He also said that investigators ""learned that huge amounts of marijuana"" are being flown out of California and sold for ""huge amounts of money."" Authorities said that they also sent out ""dozens of letters"" in recent days to those who own and hold liens on properties where commercial marijuana is grown and sold. In some cases, that has included a threat that the properties could be lost and any funds derived from them -- such as via rent payments -- could be lost. Wagner disputed recent reports claiming that letters went to owners of every property that serves as a marijuana dispensary. But he said that all should be ""on notice"" that their property could be seized under federal law. ""Our objective is not to forfeit the properties, but to stop illegal activity,"" said Wagner. ""But if we have to ... we will."" In addition, prosecutors this week filed seven civil forfeiture complaints against landlords they claim knowingly allowed marijuana stores to operate. One such complaint, according to the prosecutors' joint release, alleged that eight of 11 second-floor suites in one Orange County strip mall were used for such a purpose. St. Pierre said one open question is whether what's happened in California signals that federal authorities will proceed to other states with the intent of cracking down on any who grow or sell medical marijuana. He argued that some industry and dispensary model was needed, saying it wasn't realistic to force sick people to grow their own marijuana or to limit the places where they can get it. ""Allowing self-preservation is a truly half-baked loaf, in that it doesn't acknowledge that truly sick, dying people (might be led to) go out and buy illegal marijuana on the street,"" he said. This would be inferior, he claimed, to ""a system that most of us are much more familiar with, where you can go lawfully to a retail outlet and purchase exactly what you can lawfully possess.""

"(CNN) -- Four women were detained by traffic police in two Saudi Arabian cities this week for defying the Kingdom's driving ban, according to all the women stopped. In the Red Sea port city of Jeddah Thursday, two women, Sahar Naseef and Tamador Alyami, were stopped by police after being spotted in a car on one of the city's main thoroughfares. Alyami, who's been an avid supporter of a two-month-old campaign seeking to gain the right to drive for women in Saudi Arabia, told CNN she and Naseef were hoping to get caught. ""We did go driving on a main street where we know there's a lot of traffic police,"" explained Alyami, who was in the passenger seat. ""We're just trying to push and see how far can we go with this,"" said Alyami, ""because two women yesterday were caught by police and detained for 10 hours. Today, in a different city it was totally different. We were caught and stopped for only two hours."" The woman who drove the car, Naseef, told CNN she was so convinced she and Alyami would spend the night in jail, she even packed a toothbrush, some shampoo and an extra set of clothing. For Alyami, an author and columnist who's driven herself around Jeddah five times now, getting behind the wheel is no longer enough in an extraordinary campaign of civil disobedience that has seen dozens of women taking to the streets since October. ""We're asking girls in different regions to go out,"" she said, ""because we're trying to see if police in different regions react differently to cases of women driving."" According to Naseef and Alyami, the traffic police officer who pulled them over was very kind to them and even supportive of their cause. They said he told them that due to protocol, he had to call for backup, and they were soon surrounded by several more police cars. In the end, Naseef had to sign a pledge not to drive again in the presence of a male relative before the women could be released. One day earlier in the country's capital, Riyadh, which is in a far more conservative part of the country, two other women described a far more difficult experience after being caught driving. Azza Al-Shamasi and Bareah Alzubeedy told CNN they were detained at a Riyadh police station for more than 10 hours after being caught and pulled over by traffic police. Al-Shamasi, who was driving, said when they first started driving down one of Riyadh's main streets, many male drivers around them were giving them signs of support. Half an hour later, after a traffic police officer spotted them, they were pulled over. ""We were then surrounded by six cop cars, and the people who stopped us were quite rude,"" said Al-Shamasi. According to Al-Shamasi, despite the fact that her husband came to the police station shortly after she was taken there, it still took at least eight more hours before she was released into his custody. Alzubeedy explained they were not looking to attract the police's attention, just simply doing what they should be able to do. ""Freedom of movement is a right,"" said Alzubeedy, a human rights activist. ""This is a right for women here. There's no law that bars women from driving in Saudi Arabia, and I hope more women will go out and drive."" Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry for comment. The issue of women driving is a particularly sensitive and controversial one in Saudi Arabia, the last country on Earth where females don't have that right. In recent years, though, more women have challenged the government, urging officials to overturn the ban and taking to streets in remarkable displays of civil disobedience. Although women are not allowed to drive in the ultraconservative Kingdom, there is, in fact, no law barring them from doing so. But religious edicts are often interpreted to enforce the prohibition. In May 2011, Manal Al-Sharif was jailed for more than a week after posting a video of herself driving in Saudi Arabia online. She quickly became a hero to many and inspired dozens of women to drive throughout the streets of various cities in June of that year. More recently, in September, a website for the October 26 Women's Driving Campaign launched, and within a few weeks, tens of thousands had signed an online petition calling for an end to the driving ban for women in Saudi Arabia. As October 26 approached, numerous women filmed themselves driving in the conservative Kingdom and uploaded those clips to sites like YouTube. In the weeks leading up to October 26, one Saudi cleric gave an interview in which he warned that Saudi women who drove risked damaging their ovaries. On October 24, the country's Interior Ministry issued a statement telling women to stay off the streets. Despite strong opposition by conservative quarters in the Kingdom, where a puritanical strain of Islam is practiced, October 26 saw dozens of women taking to the streets and driving. The campaign's backers insist the movement is ongoing and has been a success thus far, while its critics say it has failed. In early December, two of Saudi Arabia's best-known female advocates for lifting the ban on women driving were also detained after being caught behind the wheel in the country's capital. Aziza Al-Yousef, who was driving the car, and her passenger, Eman Al-Nafjan, told CNN they were pulled over and spent a few hours at a police station in Riyadh until being released into the custody of their respective husbands.","Two pairs of Saudi female drivers detained: one in Jeddah, the other in Riyadh .

"(CNN)  -- Can you serve coq au vin made with red wine in Dubai anymore? Nobody's completely sure. Confusion reigns in the upscale restaurant kitchens of the Gulf sheikdom after a circular was sent out by Dubai officials earlier this week stating that the use of alcohol in cooking was ""strictly prohibited"" since it violated the Muslim country's strict alcohol rules. Arabian Business, quoting the head of food inspection for Dubai, reported that hotels had one month to stop using alcohol in food preparation or face fines ranging from $545 to $5,445 (AED 2,000 to AED 20,000), even rising to as much as $136,000 (AED 500,000) for serious repeat offenders. But just as the frost was starting to develop on the foie gras (which can come marinated in wine), Dubai authorities did an apparent U-turn, with a senior official saying there had been a ""misunderstanding"" of the rules -- and that there was no ban. Chefs and hotels have now been told that the Dubai municipality will call a meeting soon to clarify the alcohol guidelines, Uwe Micheel, president of the Emirates Culinary Guild and director of kitchens at the Radisson Blu Dubai Creek, told CNN. Micheel told CNN he thought stricter rules will be brought in, but that there will be no ban. ""I expect the change will be that all the dishes prepared with alcohol will have to be on a separate menu,"" the German executive chef said, so that it's easier for Muslims to identify which dishes contain alcohol. He said he also expected stricter guidelines on storage of food prepared with alcohol and perhaps utensils used to eat food prepared with alcohol. At the moment, dishes that contain alcohol can be sold in the city's restaurants if they are clearly marked on the menu. The drink must be stored and the food prepared separately. Alcohol is available to drink at licensed restaurants and bars, which are usually found in international hotels, although Muslims are not legally allowed to drink. Micheel, who oversees 14 restaurants, said the Dubai authorities were generally supportive of the emirate's hospitality industry and were not ""here to make life difficult for us."" But he said he thought more complaints were coming into them from local Muslims. He added that not all Dubai restaurants were complying with the current regulations. Dubai, not that long ago a sleepy pearling village, has unique demographics. A massive 85 percent of the people there come from another country, vastly dwarfing the conservative local Emirati population. And that unusual population divide can cause culture clashes, like the present confusion surrounding a possible alcohol cooking ban or the recent case of the British couple appealing a one-month jail sentence for kissing and drinking in public. Read about how a kiss highlighted Dubai's culture clash . ""For them [Muslims], alcohol is a 100 percent no-no, even if it's boiled,"" Micheel said. ""And that has to be respected. We are living in a Muslim country."" Micheel said he thinks the ban confusion happened because authorities have received ""more complaints"" from locals. Arabian Business quoted the director of the emirate's food control department as saying the reason for the clampdown under the existing 2003 law was that a number of complaints had come from locals. Dubai's foreign population has swelled in recent years as expatriates flocked to the booming emirate, attracted by a high standard of living, jobs, no taxes, and year-round sunshine. The population changes have meant that local Emiratis are vastly outnumbered, raising concerns among them that the lightning-speed modernization threatens their deeply conservative social and religious identity. The two populations couldn't be more different. The tiny local Emirati population dress in floor-length robes, shun alcohol, pray five times a day, and are rooted in conservative Islam. Many of the country's Western expatriates and tourists, however, are drawn to the desert sheikdom-by-the-sea's relaxed beach lifestyle. Expatriates who live in Dubai said authorities are more sensitive to these types of culture clashes than in the past. ""More people are misbehaving,"" said Micheel, who's been working in Dubai for 17 years, arriving when the sheikdom was just a ""small village."" ""There are more than 200 different nationalities living here,"" he said. ""If you do not respect each other's rules and cultures, there will be clashes."" ""In the past, you would not have seen people in very casual summer clothes here,"" he said. ""Now you do. We are guests in this country. We must behave as guests."" Heiki Moeckel, a culture consultant with Abu Dhabi-based Embrace Arabia, a consultancy group that advises both foreign and Emirati clients on how to bridge the cultural divide, told CNN some expatriates need to learn more respect for their host country. ""It's very silly to believe that if you're coming from country x, y and z, you're going to create a copy of that country when you come to the United Arab Emirates,"" she said. ""Why don't you just stay home if you need everything from home?""","Dubai officials calling meeting to clarify regulations .

"(CNN) -- Michael Douglas made news recently by discussing, rather candidly, the possible cause of his throat cancer. Specifically, he told The Guardian that his disease could be caused by oral sex, which could have exposed him to human papillomavirus. Douglas clarified his comments later. But it is inevitable that debate would follow: HPV -- and the vaccine that is meant to prevent infection -- are surprisingly controversial. Human papillomavirus is the main cause of cervical cancer in women. Such cancer still causes the death of 4,000 women each year in the United States. It's estimated that about 15,000 HPV-associated cancers could be prevented each year by the vaccine. HPV is, unfortunately, often transmitted through sexual activity. It's the cause of genital warts, and it's an extremely common sexually transmitted infection. The vaccine is safe. By the summer of 2012, more than 46 million doses of the vaccine had been given in the United States -- almost all to girls because of early awareness of HPV's link to cervical cancer -- and adverse events from vaccines are closely monitored. There isn't even any evidence that the vaccine is dangerous if given to pregnant women, but to be on the safe side, it is still not recommended that pregnant women receive it. Some are concerned that giving the vaccine makes girls more likely to have sex. But in 2012, researchers reported on a group of almost 1,400 girls, 493 of whom had received the vaccine. They followed them for three years after ages 11-12 to see if girls who received the vaccine differed in sexual outcomes from those who did not. There were no differences. Girls who got the vaccine were not more likely to be infected with a sexually transmitted infection, get pregnant or seek contraceptive counseling. As of 2011, only about a third of girls ages 13 to 17 had been vaccinated against HPV. That was not much more of an improvement over the 32% who had been covered in 2010. We need to do a much better job of protecting women from HPV, and cervical cancer associated with HPV. But what about other forms of cancer? Anal sex can also result in the transmission of sexually transmitted infections such as HPV. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry shows that the incidence of rectal cancer has been increasing at a rate of between 2% and 3% per year for decades in people younger than 40 without any similar increase in colon cancer. It is widely believed that STIs, like HPV, are partially responsible for this increase. Moreover, there is growing evidence that the recent increase in cancers of the head and neck are also associated with HPV infection. A recent study of more than 1,300 patients with oral cancer found that more than 55% of them were infected with HPV. It's a bad virus. It's for this reason, among others, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends boys receive the HPV vaccine as well. It seems to cause all kinds of cancer, not just cancer in women. Of course, we can debate how young kids should be before we vaccinate them. Today in the United States, it's recommended that we give the vaccine to girls even as young as 11 and 12. To have effective protection, you need to have all three doses before you might be exposed to HPV. Since you can catch HPV even the first time you have sex -- including oral sex -- we need to give girls the complete series before that happens. Research shows that the average age of first intercourse in the United States is 17 for boys and 17Â½ for girls. But more than 6% of kids in the United States have had sex before the age of 13. I'm sure almost everyone reading this thinks that age is too young, and I don't disagree, but those are the facts. It's important to remember that vaginal intercourse isn't the only type of sex that can result in HPV infection. An additional 7% of girls and 9% of boys have engaged in oral sex without having vaginal intercourse. About half of the almost 19 million new sexually transmitted infections diagnosed each year are in teens and young adults ages 15 to 24. Should older people get the vaccine? The vaccine is only effective if you're not yet infected, and because HPV is so prevalent, you really would need to get the vaccine before you have sex. That's why we focus on the young. Older people have already likely had sex many times and have a high likelihood of already being exposed. I can't speak to Douglas' cancer personally. He's been quite open about his smoking and drinking, both of which are heavily associated with throat cancer, too. It would be impossible for me to declare that his sexual activity, and his potential infection with HPV, is the true cause of his illness. Nevertheless, his case sheds light on an important issue. HPV is a preventable illness. We know how to get ahead of it -- by immunizing our children against it. To protect them, we need to give the vaccine at an age that is uncomfortable for some, but necessary to prevent initial infection in all kids. In the long run, we're trying to prevent cancer. Even, perhaps, the cancer that has caused Douglas so much grief. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron E. Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: In interview, Michael Douglas says throat cancer may be linked to oral sex .
Carroll: Whether or not it was the cause, story points up need for boys also to get HPV vaccine .
He says a slew of cancers affecting men, women are linked to sexually transmitted HPV .

"(Fast Company) -- Demand Media burst onto the public markets last month, quickly earning itself a valuation of $1.5 billion -- and a tidy payday for its chief investors and founders. But it's possible they got into the market just before the getting stopped being good. There's a rising backlash against ""spam"" search results and other low-quality content, and that could spell the death knell for content farms like Demand. The problem: Google used to be an efficient way to find what you needed. Enter a search term, and, presto, the results served up the very thing you were looking for. But increasingly, that's not the case. Investor and business commentator Paul Kedrosky recently vented his outrage at the pile of garbage he found on Google when he went looking for tips on buying a dishwasher. UC Berkeley professor (and tech commentator) Vivek Wadhwa threw up his hands when Google couldn't help his students find the information they were looking for. And at a panel on the future of search earlier this week, Loopt co-founder Sam Altman said: ""Three times in the last month, I searched for things on Google, and the result wasn't on the front page. That's the first time it's ever happened."" A major source of the problem is the entire industry that has emerged to game the Google system, producing content that looks promising within the results, but that when clicked on, serves up a mishmash of text that looks like sneezed-out alphabet soup. The material produced by Demand Media -- and other content farms, like AOL's Seed -- is usually not as egregious as the example above, but it's often not far behind. Demand and AOL both employ humans, but make thousands of assignments a month -- and there are minimum quality requirements. The payment structure at both companies is such that very few freelancers can afford to devote the time necessary to produce the kind of reliable take a reader might be looking for. For example, a Wired story about Demand described the efforts of a videographer to shoot, edit, and post 10 videos on kayaking techniques in under two hours, because he was only getting paid a total of $200. Search engines, whose entire value proposition rests on the quality of the results they produce, are starting to take notice. Blekko, a new engine launched last year to fight this very problem, is already crowdsourcing quality by letting users mark results as spam. Earlier this week, Blekko announced that, based on feedback it received through its spam-watch program, it had decided to ban material from 20 sites produced by content farms, like Demand Media's eHow. The sites ""are literally responsible for millions of pages on the Web that our users say are just not helpful and they'd prefer they were banned permanently,"" Blekko CEO Rich Skrenta said. ""So we're going to do that for them."" Google has also responded. ""In 2010, we launched two major algorithmic changes focused on low-quality sites,"" Matt Cutts, Google's leader for search quality, wrote on The Official Google Blog last month. ""Nonetheless, we hear the feedback from the web loud and clear: People are asking for even stronger action on content farms and sites that consist primarily of spammy or low-quality content. ... We can and should do better."" What Google will actually do remains to be seen. At Farsight 2011 this week, the conference at which Loopt's Altman appeared, Cutts indicated that the search giant is looking for algorithmic ways to improve the quality of search results. ""We care about the long-term loyalty of our users,"" he said. All of which means, if the search business gets serious about weeding out spam and low-quality content, Demand's days could be numbered. Its business model was designed to exploit -- and reap revenue from -- the specific ecosystem into which it was born. But if that ecosystem changes, it's anyone's guess whether Demand will be able to retool and find a new strategy. The ""Risk Factors"" section of its pre-IPO S-1 filing says as much: . ""Internet search engines could decide that content on our owned and operated websites and on our customers' websites, including content that is created by our freelance content creators, is unacceptable,""the filing says. ""Any reduction in the number of users directed to our owned and operated websites and to our customers' websites would negatively affect our ability to earn revenue. If traffic on our owned and operated websites and on our customers' websites declines, we may need to resort to more costly sources to replace lost traffic, and such increased expense could adversely affect our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations."" Fast Company reached out to Demand for comment, but they declined because they are still in the ""quiet period"" required by the SEC, which prohibits companies from talking about themselves in the period surrounding an IPO.

"(CNN) -- Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat associated with major legislative achievements over five terms in the U.S. Senate and the chamber's last surviving World War II veteran, died on Monday of viral pneumonia, his office said. Lautenberg, 89, missed key Senate votes late last year during a weeks-long absence because of a cold that turned into what he called a ""severe case of bronchitis with fluid in the chest."" He also battled stomach cancer in recent years. He announced in a statement in February that he would not seek re-election next year, but he continued to push for stronger gun control laws. After last month's Boston Marathon bombings, Lautenberg said he would reintroduce legislation to require background checks for sales of explosive powder. An influential businessman-turned-legislator, Lautenberg scored big victories in Congress, including a ban on smoking on airplanes, preventing domestic abusers from possessing guns, cracking down on drunken driving, and the ""Toxic Right to Know"" law about the release of pollutants into communities. ""Frank Lautenberg has been one of the most productive senators in the history of this country,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in December 2011 on the occasion of Lautenberg's 9,000th vote, the statement by Lautenberg's office said. On Monday, political colleagues and foes lauded Lautenberg as a passionate advocate for the issues he championed. Lautenberg: The last 'swamp dog' ""He improved the lives of countless Americans with his commitment to our nation's health and safety, from improving our public transportation to protecting citizens from gun violence to ensuring that members of our military and their families get the care they deserve,"" said a statement by President Barack Obama, a former senator. Secretary of State John Kerry, in remarks to reporters, called his longtime fellow Democratic senator ""tenacious as a legislator"" and someone who ""never forgot where he came from."" In particular, Kerry cited Lautenberg's advocacy for environmental issues and his spirited defense of Kerry's military record when it came under attack by Republicans in the 2004 presidential election campaign. ""He was as loyal as he was patriotic,"" Kerry said, also noting how ""during the years when Frank was going through chemotherapy and he was weakened by cancer, he was still down there on the floor of the United States Senate floor fighting on every environmental debate late into the night."" New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie, told a GOP event on Monday that he often disagreed politically with Lautenberg, but he respected the senator's battling spirit. ""We had some good fights over our time -- battles on philosophy and the role of government,"" Christie said. ""I think the best way to describe Frank Lautenberg and the way he would probably want to be described to all of you today is as a fighter. Senator Lautenberg fought for the things he believed in and sometimes he just fought because he liked to."" Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie . According to New Jersey law, Christie can appoint a temporary replacement to serve until a special election in November or fill the rest of Lautenberg's term, which expires next year. With the likelihood that Christie will appoint a Republican, the Democratic majority in the 100-member Senate would decrease to 52, along with two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Possible GOP appointees would include state Sens. Thomas Kean Jr. and Joe Kyrillos, a Christie ally who lost to Democrat Bob Menendez in the Senate race last year; Lt Gov. Kim Guadagno, and Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick. On the Democratic side, Newark Mayor Cory Booker announced in January he intended to run for the Senate next year, which caused a public tiff with Lautenberg, who later decided against seeking re-election. The son of Russian and Polish immigrants, Lautenberg grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, and enlisted in the military at 18, his office said. He was a member of the United States Army Signal Corps from 1942 to 1946, according to his biography. After the military, he graduated from Columbia University with the help of the GI Bill, then joined with two boyhood friends to start payroll processing firm Automatic Data Processing, or ADP, which grew into one of the world's largest computing services companies. Lautenberg was first elected to the Senate in 1982 and won re-election twice. He did not seek re-election in 2000 when his third term expired, but was recruited to run again two years later after Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli quit his re-election bid weeks before the polls opened amid reports of ethical issues. Lautenberg was then re-elected in 2008. Survivors include his wife, Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg; six children; and 13 grandchildren, the office statement said. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived . CNN's Tom Cohen, Peter Hamby, Susan Candiotti, Robert Yoon and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Political colleagues and foes describe Frank Lautenberg as a fighter .

"(CNN) -- ""No turtle, no pay,"" says the boatman as we arrive at the Iztuzu jetty, where visitors are embarking on tours of the lagoon in search of loggerhead turtles. Iztuzu lies on Turkey's Dalyan Delta, an almost-tropical maze of river channels, pools and reed beds that once doubled for east Africa in the 1951 film ""The African Queen,"" starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Its beautiful stretches of unspoiled sand are as much a draw for tourists as, for the past 100,000 years, they have been for turtles. That both tourists and turtles can still enjoy those beaches today is largely thanks the efforts of one remarkable woman: June Haimoff. Royal backing . In the mid-1980s, plans were drawn up for an 1,800-bed hotel that would have wiped out the turtles. But the developers hadn't reckoned on Haimoff. The English ballet dancer, painter and singer fell in love with Iztuzu during a sailing trip in 1975 and moved into a simple wooden hut here eight years later to live among fisherman, who nicknamed her ""Kaptan June."" She also fell in love with the loggerheads, launching a campaign to save the beach that won global support -- including the backing of Prince Philip, the husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth and then president of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The campaign led to the cancellation of the hotel project and what Haimoff praises as an ""intelligent and courageous"" decision by the Turkish government to make Iztuzu a specially protected area. ""I began it alone, but I didn't do it alone,"" she tells me. Now 90, Haimoff no longer lives on the beach, but in nearby Dalyan town, with an extended family of cats and dogs. She continues to campaign on behalf of the beach and its inhabitants through the Kaptan June Sea Turtle Conservation Foundation. ""The battle has not been won,"" she says. Propeller threat . Today, Iztuzu's loggerheads are threatened by their own popularity. More than 600 motor boats now ply the river, ferrying visitors hoping to glimpse them or to view Kaunos, a ruined city built 2,500 years ago by the Lycians, who also built rock tombs in the cliffs overhead. But unless the boats are fitted with propeller guards -- those that are carry the foundation's logo -- the turtles are at risk of injury. Cafe owners often toss leftovers into the water to attract them, but the food scraps can do more harm than good, making the turtles ill or deterring them from heading out to sea where they're at less risk of injury from boats or from hypothermia in winter. Conservationists want to see turtle feeding banned before this year's season starts. ""The Dalyan Delta is not a zoo,"" says Haimoff, who is also campaigning against the construction of a giant metal turtle sculpture within a protected nesting area. A visit to the Sea Turtle Research, Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, where injured turtles are cared for, is enough to convince most visitors. Those hoping for a glimpse of the amphibians in the water are unlikely to be disappointed. Luring loggerheads . Turtles are easy enough to spot if you come to Iztuzu -- or other protected turtle beaches such as Patara or Cirali, on the surrounding coast -- in early summer. About 300 females still bury their eggs in the sand here in May. The female hatchlings that scramble into the Aegean Sea around 80 days later spend 20 years at sea before returning to Iztuzu as mature adults, each up to a meter in length and weighing 135 kilograms, to lay their own eggs. The turtles have become a nice little earner for Dalyan, a fact celebrated in the town's center by a life-size sculpture of a loggerhead. Among those benefiting are the boatmen. It takes about 45 minutes to chug down to Iztuzu from Dalyan aboard one of the boats operated by the Dalyan Boatmens' Cooperative and costs 10 Turkish lire ($4.50). At the Iztuzu jetty, where boatmen offer turtle spotting trips for an extra five lire, we putter over to where a couple of local fishermen are casting lines baited with crabs, hoping to lure a loggerhead. The crabs have vivid red and turquoise claws and are a Dalyan delicacy. Loggerheads like them too, and after 10 minutes we (and five other boatloads of sightseers) are rewarded by a glimpse of a massive, big-eyed turtle taking the bait in its beak. Smartphones flash, and everyone goes home happy -- especially the boatman, who pockets a 100 lire bonus.","Turkey's Dalyan Delta was used as the backdrop for the 1951 film ""The African Queen""

"(CNN) -- Australian motor racing legend Jack Brabham -- a three-time Formula One world champion and the only driver to win the title in a car bearing his name -- has died aged 88. Over the course of a 15-year Formula One career beginning in 1955, Brabham won three drivers' world championships, becoming the first Australian to win the title despite coming late to the sport. The first two titles, in 1959 and 1960, were earned as a driver for the Cooper team. The third and most notable occurred in 1966, when, at 40-years-old, he won racing for Brabham, the successful car manufacturer and racing team he founded. The team won the constructors' championships that season and the following year, with teammate Denny Hulme following in Brabham's footsteps to finish top of the drivers' standings in 1967. ""He lived an incredible life, achieving more than anyone would ever dream of and he will continue to live on through the astounding legacy he leaves behind,"" Brabham's youngest son, David, wrote in a message on the family's website. David, who, like his two brothers, followed his father into a career in motorsport, said the racing legend had passed peacefully at his home on Australia's Gold Coast. He had eaten breakfast with his wife, Lady Margaret. ""It's a very sad day for all of us,"" said David, who spent two seasons in F1 in the 1990s but made a name for himself in sports cars, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2009. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott declared that ""Australia has lost a legend"" as the news of his passing was announced. ""With his pioneering spirit, Sir Jack Brabham personified many great Australian characteristics. He was respected and admired for his spirit and for his great skill as an engineer."" Late bloomer . The son of a Sydney greengrocer, Jack Brabham was an engineer by trade, working as a flight mechanic for the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War, as well as running a small engineering workshop. He moved to Britain to pursue his racing career in the 1950s, and was eventually given his chance behind the wheel by Cooper in 1955, his appearance in the cockpit coinciding with the end of front-engined cars in the sport. Four years later, he won the first of his three drivers' crowns, famously sealing his 1959 victory in the driver's championship by pushing his car to the finishing line after having run out of fuel on the last lap at the inaugural U.S. Grand Prix. He finished the race in fourth place to secure the title. Brabham retired at the end of the 1970 season, the year of his 14th and final grand prix victory, selling his racing team at the same time. In 1979, he became the first driver to be knighted for services to motorsport. Brabham, the team he founded with Australian designer Ron Tauranac, won four Formula One drivers' championships and two constructors' championships during its three decades in operation. Noted figures associated with the team included Hulme, Nelson Piquet, Bernie Ecclestone and McLaren chairman and CEO Ron Dennis. 'Most illustrious' Dennis paid tribute to the man who gave him his first break in a statement on McLaren's website, calling him ""one of the most illustrious names in motor racing history"" and said Brabham's achievement in becoming Formula One champion in a car he built himself ""will surely never be matched.""

"(CNN) -- At least 37 people were killed during a shootout at a meeting to resolve cattle disputes in South Sudan, officials said Saturday, the latest in a spate of violence in the world's newest nation. One U.N. officer was wounded during the meeting at Unity state, which was attended by several staff members of the world body, according to Kouider Zerrouk, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in Juba. Seven U.N. staff members and three local officials traveled to Mayendit County to investigate a wave of violence from cattle raiding on the borders of Unity and Warrap states. During the meeting Wednesday, the county commissioner from neighboring Lake state appeared and interrupted the meeting, yelling angry remarks at his Mayendit county counterpart, the spokesman said. The shooting followed soon after. ""Four pick-up trucks carrying armed men believed to be the SPLA (South Sudan army) and SSPS (South Sudan police service) then appeared and started shooting indiscriminately at the Mayendit county commissioner's compound,"" Zerrouk said. A local official said it was unclear why the Lake state official had an armed convoy. ""We are asking ourselves why the county commissioner would come with such a heavily armed convoy,"" said Gideon Gatpan Thor, the minister of information for Unity state. ""He was uninvited, so we are still asking him to answer these questions. We want to know what his intentions were."" The clashes killed at least 16 people from Unity and 21 from Lake, including six civilians from both states, the minister of information said. The U.N. officer injured in the attack is in stable condition at a hospital in Juba, South Sudan's capital. ""It appears that the U.N. team was not the target of the attack but were at the wrong place at the wrong time and were caught up in the incident,"" the minister of information said. The meeting was initiated after a violent cattle raid four days earlier in Warrap state. The attackers, believed to be from Unity state, stole thousands of cattle and killed 74 people. Most were women and children. The latest clashes come after a particularly violent month of cattle raids in Jonglei state. In late December, officials in the town of Pibor said more than 3,000 were killed in cattle raids after 6,000 armed youths from the Lou Nuer tribe attacked the Murle people. The U.N. said the number is more likely in the hundreds, but it said 120,000 were affected and in need of immediate assistance. Weeks later, the Murle attacked the Lou Nuer people in retaliation and killed more than 100 people in two separate attacks. The main purpose behind the raids is to steal cattle, a livelihood for the people who live in the barren regions, but the violent clashes end with killings and child abductions. The victims are largely defenseless women and children. In a country struggling with violence six months into its independence, and recovering from decades of civil war, weapons have flown freely into the hands of cattle raiders. What used to be rural-style attacks, with sticks and arrows, have been replaced by automatic weapons, killing thousands and displacing even more.","It is the latest violence in the world's newest nation .

"Dubai, Uae (CNN) -- Dubai police have intercepted an illegal shipment of 16,000 pistols from Turkey to Yemen, Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, the Dubai Police commander-in-chief, said Thursday. ""We shall not allow any criminal elements to use our territories to carry out any illicit plot that poses threat to peace and security of any country,"" Tamim said. The weapons were found in a shipping container in Dubai's port. Six people were arrested for their alleged links to the smuggling of the weapons valued at more than $2 million, Tamim said. ""The huge amount of brand-faked hand guns along with additional bullet chambers, manufactured in Turkey, were carefully hidden among wrapped boxes carrying furniture in a container which was temporarily stored in one of Dubai's storehouses,"" a government statement said. Like a number of nations in the Middle East and North Africa, Yemen has experienced growing unrest.  A crackdown on protesters last week left 52 people dead. Protesters have called for the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled Yemen since 1978. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing young population suffering from poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. Saleh has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .","The weapons were found in a shipping container in Dubai's port .

"(CNN) -- Shanghai may be a target for many luxury brands but Chanel, famous for its simple and elegant designs, is keeping its footprint on the city light. Founded by Garbrielle ""Coco"" Chanel in 1909, the fashion house redefined outfits for women with its timeless outfits. Today the French label house is recognized as a pioneer of tailored and ready-to-wear collections. But it has been careful not to overwhelm markets, choosing instead to focus on brand exclusivity. Chanel's president of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said such exclusivity is the best way to ensure customers keep coming back for more. Chanel has opened just three boutiques in Shanghai -- one of the world's most populous cities. Pavlovsky told CNN: ""We try to get the best three boutiques in Shanghai instead of having 10 boutiques."" That, he said, is the ""number one"" priority. ""We try to bring through the boutiques the best value of the brand... our idea is not to open lots of boutiques but be able to give, through the existing one, the best value and the best service to our customers."" China -- with a population of approximately 1.3 billion people -- is a focus for luxury brands due to its expanding middle classes. Its growth comes as consumer spending in Europe and the U.S. dwindles. Pavlovsky said customers in China are ""experts of the fashion world, they know everything, every detail and at the end of the day what they want is the same product that we are selling here in Paris or London."" The company remains privately held and Pavlovsky says the absence of shareholders eases the pressure on Chanel. ""It gives us the possibility to put more focus on the company 20 years from now... and even increase the attractiveness to our consumers,"" he said. CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report.","Founded by Garbrielle ""Coco"" Chanel in 1909, today the French fashion house is a global brand .

"(CNN) -- Ronnie Barnhardt (Seth Rogen) has a dream. It is, he likes to think, an American dream. Seth Rogen goes on patrol as a mall cop in ""Observe and Report."" Only Ronnie's dream involves looming clouds of cancer, screaming children and loaded shotguns. In his dream he vanquishes evil, disperses the dark clouds and accepts the gratitude that is rightly bestowed on the lawman. He believes his destiny is to be a cop. In reality, he's chief security officer at the mall. I know: You already saw this movie: ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop."" Kevin James. Box-office smash. No jokes to speak of. You're only half wrong. There are strong similarities between ""Blart"" and Rogen's film, ""Observe and Report."" Both movies are portraits of chubby guys who don't fit the profile and can't make the grade. Both men are socially inept, they live with their moms and hold a crush on a sales assistant who should be out of their league (here, the fearlessly nasty Anna Faris). They're also delusional enough to equate a badge and a uniform with their own heroic self-image, though in their heart of hearts they know they won't be real men until they're packing a gun. ""Observe and Report"" is the R-rated version of this peculiar suburban fantasy, a much edgier movie that dares to keep its mall cop at arm's length. Just because he's sad and pathetic, that doesn't mean Ronnie isn't a potential psychopath. He's closer to Travis Bickle than to cuddly Kevin James. This may be the first time Rogen has stepped out of his comfort zone as an actor. With his hair cropped to a Marine buzz, and cutting out the winks and the wisecracks (Ronnie has no sense of humor), Rogen refuses to soften us up or apologize for the character's low IQ. The movie is funnier for his control, and also more disturbing. More than once, writer-director Jody Hill teases out the slippy, gray area between a subversive gross-out gag and something unsettlingly misogynist. He wants to push buttons, and he's talented enough to get away with it. At one point he sets up a scene in which Ronnie learns he's flunked his psych test for the police force. While he's still processing this latest rejection, a detective emerges from his hiding place in the closet. ""I thought this was going to be funny,"" he explains sheepishly. ""But it's just sad."" Played that way, the scene is both. Plainly influenced by the observational embarrassments of TV's ""The Office,"" Hill took an equally jaundiced view of the male animal in his first film, ""The Foot Fist Way,"" a low-budget black comedy with Danny McBride as a gung-ho martial arts instructor. (McBride pops up here as a violent crack dealer.) Machismo is about the only source of pride Hill's anti-heroes can afford. The budget for ""Observe and Report"" is probably 20 times what Hill had to spend on his debut, but his characters have stayed on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder; they may fancy themselves above it all, but they know where the bottom is. So it makes a kind of sense that when a flasher starts terrorizing the mall, Ronnie should seize on this as his opportunity to shine. ""That pervert is the best thing that ever happened to me,"" he says. The flasher's eventual full-frontal appearance supplies the movie with a suitably in-your-face climax, as well as extending contemporary film comedy's undeclared mission to domesticate the male organ. Ever since ""Borat"" -- in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Superbad"" -- it seems like there's nothing funnier than a penis on the loose. iReport.com: What do you think of ""Observe and Report""? But it's the naked anger Rogen and Hill reveal that makes ""Observe and Report"" a sticky proposition. It's consistently sharper and wittier than ""Mall Cop,"" but Hill's disconcerting habit of making his biggest laughs stick in your throat could prove a hard sell. It's no ""Paul Blart,"" but is it art? ""Observe and Report"" is rated R and runs 86 minutes.

"(CNN) -- Amazon is rumored to be making a phone. Citing checks of the company's supply chain, an analyst at Citigroup has issued a memo saying the phone may cost less than $200 and likely will be available in the middle of next year, according to multiple news reports in financial publications. ""With the clear success of the Kindle e-Reader over the past 3 years, and Kindle Fire possibly succeeding in the low-priced tablet market, we view this as the next logical step for Amazon,"" the investor's note said, according to a report in Reuters. The blog AllThingsD says it's likely the phone would run Google's Android operating system: . ""(Mark) Mahaney's note doesn't spell out that the phone will use Google's Android operating system, but it suggests that will be the case by positing that Amazon will need to pay Microsoft an 'OS royalty' -- Microsoft has recently been able to extract royalty payments from other Android hardware partners."" Of course, all of this is completely speculative, and based on one report from one analyst. Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Friday morning, and no on knows for sure if the company is working on a phone. But it's interesting to tech journalists and investors in part because Amazon is creeping further from its roots as an e-commerce website and into new areas of technology, including hardware development. The company's Kindle e-reader has been a hit for years, and Amazon this week put its new tablet, the Kindle Fire, on the market for $200. Reviewers say the Kindle Fire isn't amazing -- not as functional as the iPad -- but they're generally impressed with it given its much-lower price. The Apple iPad sells for $500 to $830. The Amazon phone would cost the company $150 to $170 to make, and Amazon -- always one to offer low prices, even when it loses money on a sale -- likely would offer the phone for close to that price, Peter Kafka writes at AllThingsD. Still, all of this buzz about an Amazon phone raises a larger question: . Would you want to buy it? This is completely anecdotal, but when Mike Elgan, a Silicon Valley tech columnist, asked this question of his followers on Google+ he got back plenty of ""no's."" Some of the responses from his followers: . ""I don't even know how well their tablet works, much less an OS for the phone."" ""-1."" ""No."" ""Something that belongs on +The Onion news network :)"" ""Amazon is going in the wrong direction."" Others were more enthusiastic, if the price is right. ""$150 with no contract required would be an awesome deal, especially for the 40% or so of people that don't have a smart phone. my father in law wants an iPhone but not the data plan fee.""","CitiGroup analyst: Amazon is working on a phone .

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Two Britons serving three-month prison terms for having sex on a public beach in Dubai have been released on bail pending their appeal, their lawyer said Tuesday. File image of one of the co-accused -- Vince Acors -- arriving at court in Dubai in September. Michelle Palmer, 36, and Vincent Acors, 34, were sentenced last week after a court found them guilty. Both denied they had intercourse and their lawyer, Hassan Mattar, said they planned to appeal. Mattar said Tuesday the court accepted the appeal and will hold the first hearing November 18 in Dubai. Palmer and Acors were arrested on a public beach shortly after midnight on July 5. Police charged them with illicit relations, public indecency and public intoxication.  Watch how case stirs up Dubai's bar scene » . The Dubai Court of Misdemeanors last Thursday found them guilty and ordered them jailed for three months, after which they would be deported. The court also fined the pair 1,000 dirhams ($367) for the charge of public indecency. During the trial, Mattar argued that the public prosecutor failed to produce corroborative evidence against his clients on the first two charges, though he said both tested positive for liquor. The United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, is home to thousands of expatriates and is among the most moderate Gulf states. Still, the oil-rich kingdom adheres to certain Islamic rules. More than a million British visitors traveled to the UAE in 2006, and more than 100,000 British nationals live there, according to the British Foreign Office. The country is in the midst of a building boom to position itself as one of the world's premier tourist destinations. It is already home to the world's largest mall, the world's largest tower, and -- despite being in the Middle East -- the largest indoor snow park in the world.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A collection of some of Syria's most powerful rebel brigades have rejected a Western-backed opposition group that announced the creation of an interim government in exile this month. The 13 rebel groups, led by the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, also called on supporters of the Syrian opposition to embrace Sharia law ""and make it the sole source of legislation."" The move appeared to sideline the flagging National Syrian Coalition, which recently announced the formation of an interim government in exile led by Ahmad Tomeh, a dentist and dissident from the Syrian city of Deir Ezzor. In a statement released late Tuesday, the 13 rebel groups declared that ""the coalition and the putative government headed by Ahmad Tomeh does not represent or recognize us."" Among the signatory rebel groups were Ahrar al Sham, Al-Tawheed and Suqoor al-Sham, three major fighting factions that control considerable amounts of territory in Syria. Members of the Syrian National Coalition contacted by CNN declined to comment, saying they were still working on an official response to the rebel statement. In a speech Tuesday to the United Nations, President Barack Obama pledged $340 million in additional assistance to Syria, while reiterating his support for what he described as the country's ""moderate opposition."" But moderate opposition groups appear to have suffered a series of setbacks this month as hard-line jihadi groups have pushed to grab more territory and resources. Last week, another al Qaeda-linked group drove rival rebels out of the strategically placed town of Azaz near the Turkish border. The group, whose ranks are bolstered by foreign jihadi militants, later accused the ousted rebels of being traitors for supporting democracy and for meeting previously with U.S. Sen. John McCain. Cash-strapped secular Syrian activists have been warning of the rise of Islamist groups in opposition-controlled parts of Syria. ""If anybody does a humanitarian project that is not under their (the Islamists') agenda, then they feel threatened,"" said one activist who runs humanitarian projects that help feed and house displaced families inside Syria. The activist asked not to be named, for fear of reprisal from Islamist groups. Turkey, an opponent of the Syrian government that has long allowed opposition fighters to travel freely back and forth across its long border with Syria, has recently begun sounding the alarm about extremist groups. ""This is a big security threat to us, and it directly concerns us,"" Turkish President Abdullah Gul told journalists in New York last weekend. ""These people may not have been radicals or terrorists at all in the beginning, but the conditions have brought them to this point,"" Gul said. ""People who would not harm a fly can find themselves in a position where they can mutually resort to atrocity and violence."" It is not clear what effect the Islamist rebel groups' announcement will have on Salim Idriss, the English-speaking former Syrian army general who now heads the Supreme Military Council of the rebel Free Syrian Army. Idriss has enjoyed the support of Western governments and officials such as McCain. He was filmed in April at the Turkish-Syrian border receiving a shipment of nonlethal assistance from U.S. State Department officials. Officials in the Supreme Military Council also declined to comment on the Islamist rebel announcement.","Syrian rebel brigades oppose Western-backed group that announced government in exile .

"(CNN) -- ""I shall never surrender or retreat."" So stated William Barret Travis in an 1836 letter he wrote as Mexican soldiers bore down on his overmatched troops at the Alamo. Now, more than 175 years later, Travis' Texas fighting heirs -- or, at the least, the state's governor -- are drawing their line in the sand for another reason: not to grant benefits to same-sex partners of its troops as they would for opposite-sex spouses. ""As a state agency, Texas Military Forces must adhere with Texas law, and the Texas Constitution, which clearly defines marriage as between one man and one woman,"" said Josh Havens, a spokesman for Gov. Rick Perry's office. Despite its proud and longstanding tradition of independence, the Texas Military Forces is not like other agencies. In fact, given that it includes the Army National Guard and Air National Guard (in addition to the Texas State Guard), in some ways it is more a federal agency than a state one. As such, some argue, its policies should fall in line with those out of Washington. Following a landmark Supreme Court ruling that effectively struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited federal benefits from going to same-sex partner, the door has now been opened to gay and lesbian spouses. Shortly before leaving office earlier this year, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that same-sex partners who sign a military ""Declaration of Domestic Partnership"" form will be eligible for several benefits, including military identification cards as dependents. Those who did would be allowed unescorted onto bases, get access to commissaries, have the right to visit their partners in military hospitals and be eligible for many survivor benefits, including life insurance benefits. Military extends benefits to same-sex partners . The Pentagon estimated at the time that there may be 5,600 troops on active duty seeking such benefits, as well as 8,000 retirees and 3,400 National Guard troops. Tuesday was the first day all partners of same-sex troops could claim such benefits, the Pentagon has said. But in the latter category, Texas isn't readily coming aboard. Texas, like some other states, expressly prohibits same-sex marriage under its law. That state law trumps federal law, argues Perry and others. ""(Texas Military Forces) is a state agency under the authority and direction of the Texas state government,"" wrote the forces' adjutant general, Maj. Gen. John Nichols, in a memo dated August 30. ""... Due to the potential conflict (between state and federal law), we are unable to enroll same-sex families ... at our state-supported facilities until we receive legal clarification."" In a statement Tuesday, the Texas Military Forces insisted that while Nichols is asking the state's attorney general for an advisory opinion, ""the state is not denying any federal benefits to military personnel or same-sex spouses of military personnel."" ""This is a processing issue, not a denial of benefits issue,"" the agency says. ""As such, we fully encourage eligible members to enroll for their federal benefits at one of the 20 nearest federal installations, which are dispersed throughout the state of Texas."" Judge: U.S. can't deny benefits to lesbian war vet's wife . The office of state Attorney General Greg Abbott did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the matter. Yet Stephen Peters, the president of the American Military Partner Association, sees what's happening in Texas as ""truly outrageous,"" claiming that same-sex partners are being denied certain rights and benefits simply because they're based in the Lone Star State. ""Gov. Rick Perry should be ashamed,"" Peters said Tuesday, accusing Texas policymakers of playing ""politics with our military families."" ""Our military families are already dealing with enough problems, and the last thing they need is more discrimination from the state of Texas."" CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Texas Military Forces' chief cites conflict between state, federal on same-sex marriage benefits .

"London (CNN) -- Former Barclays bank chief executive Bob Diamond will voluntarily give up bonuses worth $31 million after he resigned in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal, the bank said Tuesday. Diamond will still receive 12 months salary after his resignation last week, the bank said Tuesday. That's £1.35 million (about $2 million), according to the bank's annual report. It is twice as much as he is entitled to under his contract, which has a six-month notice period, bank chairman Marcus Agius said. Barclays will also pay Diamond's legal bills if he faces criminal investigation, a source close to the bank told CNN Tuesday. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information. Agius, giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee inquiry into the scandal, said Diamond's decision was one which ""the board welcomes and I am glad he has done it."" In a statement, Agius said the board deeply regretted the circumstances that led to Diamond resigning from Barclays. ""Despite having no personal culpability, he recognizes more than anyone the negative attention that they have generated and has taken characteristically strong action to address that,"" Agius said. Barclays' reputation has been hammered by a scandal over the rates at which banks lend each other money. The rate, known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is is set every morning by banks posting the rate at which they are willing to borrow with the British Bankers' Association. The BBA publishes Libor as a result of this. The Libor affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans. Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators last month after admitted some of its trading desks purposely underreported its interest rates. Diamond said he hoped the decision on his pay and bonuses ""will help close this chapter and allow Barclays to move forward and prosper."" Agius' evidence follows that of Bank of England's deputy governor Paul Tucker Monday, in which he denied being pressured by politicians to ensure Libor rates were lowered. He also denied pressuring Barclays to lower its rates. Diamond last week said he was ""sorry, I'm disappointed and I'm angry"" about the rate-fixing. ""This was wrong and I'm not happy about it, but we put all the resources we could to make sure it was dealt with."" He said also ""this doesn't represent the Barclays that I know and I love."" Diamond blamed the wrongdoing on 14 traders out of ""a couple thousand."" A report from the UK's Financial Services Authority concluded the rate-fixing scandal was of the ""utmost seriousness."" Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $800 trillion of securities. E-mails revealed as part of the rate-fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions. During the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, Barclays' high Libor postings came under scrutiny and the bank, concerned about ""unfounded negative perceptions,"" lowered its Libor submissions, according to Barclays notes to the Treasury Committee. A host of other banks, including Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and UBS, are being investigated by regulators. Lawsuits have been filed against the banks in the United States, and are being prepared in the UK.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Just stepping into the stadium you can feel the electric atmosphere. Die-hard rugby fan or not, it is thrilling. Tens of thousands of people who have journeyed into the desert to see history being made are in full voice. Rugby fans get into the party spirit by dressing up - this time as smurfs. Last week's IRB Rugby Sevens World Cup in Dubai lived up to the sport's unpredictable reputation, with surprises and upsets at every turn. The 78,000 people who ignored the global credit crunch to attend were well rewarded, with Wales lifting the Melrose Cup for the first time. They had never reached a final in any Sevens international rugby tournament but the young squad, who have only been together for two years, can now add their names to the list of English, New Zealand and Fijian stars who have won the world cup in the shortened version of the game. But Sevens, which is bidding for inclusion in the 2016 Olympics, is as much about the spectacle as the play. Dubai did not disappoint. Rugby Sevens has seven players per side compared to the standard 15 in traditional rugby, and is played over two halves of seven minutes apiece as opposed to 40 minutes per half in traditional matches. As a result a Sevens tournament can be played in just a few days, while traditional rugby tournaments may last a month. The result is a fast-paced game that witnesses frequent upsets and a sport that prides itself on creating a party atmosphere. In Dubai, fans dressed as Smurfs, British guards, cavemen and Umpa Lumpas -- the little orange men from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Standing by the sidelines wearing my Hong Kong rugby shirt and euphorically cheering on my home team when they scored their only try against England was an amazing experience. ""Sevens rugby is a sport in which any country can become good at, any country can play against the big boys such as New Zealand, England,"" said Hong Kong player John Gbenda-Charles. ""Playing in a Sevens World Cup is a dream come true."" The spectacular opening ceremony came to life with dancers, acrobats, balloons and, yes, camels. The stadium's design -- with its wide walkway between the stands and pitch -- gave the tournament a relaxed feel, allowing people to stand on the sidelines as opposed to being kept at a distance in the stands. Fans were so close they could almost touch the players. The informal atmosphere also led many families to bring along their children to enjoy the event. Every upset at last week's tournament was ferociously cheered. Kenya shocked Fiji -- regularly winners on the Sevens circuit -- in the quarterfinals as the vocal crowd pushed them to hold on. Their own fans danced in T-shirts with the image of U.S. President Barack Obama. The event was broadcast to a record 200 hundred countries, with women's teams included in the world cup for the first time. The women's final featured a showdown between traditional rugby nations New Zealand and Australia. Overtime was needed for Australia to claim victory. It is the sport's reputation for fun, entertainment and growing reach which supporters point to as they aspire for Olympic recognition. Sevens is competing against baseball, softball, golf, karate, squash and roller-sports for one of two new spots at the 2016 games, and IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset believes it has an edge. ""Having the likes of Thailand, Brazil, China and Uganda competing with New Zealand, England, Spain and France in a Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament is a very exciting development for the game,"" Lapasset said, according to a report to the international rugby board (IRB). Zheng Hongjun, coach of the Chinese women's side which won the bowl (a secondary prize in the women's competition), said their victory was a breakthrough for them and the sport. ""It is very important because rugby is not as popular as other sports such as table tennis and Olympic sports,"" Zheng said on the IRB's Web site.","Rugby Sevens is bidding to be included in the 2016 Olympics .
The recent world cup in Dubai proved just how popular the sport is becoming .

"London (CNN) -- Manchester United has launched their listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, with 16.7 million shares, representing 10 per cent of the club, up for sale. Reports say that the shares should start trading somewhere between $16 and $20, with the club hoping to raise more than $300 million in the process. However, the prospectus that accompanies the listing appears to suggest that the money raised will be split between the club and its owners, the Florida based Glazer family. The Glazers have been controversial owners of the club, with fans angry at the family's leveraged buyout in 2005. There are reports that, as of March 31st this year, the complicated financial deals used to buy the club have left the 19-times league champions with around $663 million of debt.

"(CNN) -- The tiny puppy with the white and brown fur doesn't have a name yet, just a number: 917. When he was found, the 8-week-old puppy weighed less than five pounds and had been left in the scorching sun, wearing a chain around his neck that weighed four times as much as he did. He is one of 371 dogs seized by federal and state authorities last month in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Texas in what authorities say was the second largest dogfighting ring in the United States. Normally, dogfighters wait until the canines are at least half a year old before they chain them and expose them to extreme heat or cold as part of a brutal program to transform the dogs into fighters, according to American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals CEO Matt Bershadker. This puppy was one of several ""8- and 10-week-old puppies on heavy, heavy long chains"" found during last month's raids, according to Bershadker. ASPCA investigators were present during the raids. ""What we saw on this property brought even our hardened investigators to their knees, so to speak,"" he said. The dogs were placed in the temporary care of the ASPCA and the Humane Society of the United States. More than 250 of them -- including puppy No. 917 -- were brought to a converted air-conditioned warehouse, where the ASPCA is caring for them. The others are in the care of the Humane Society. This month, CNN was granted exclusive access to the ASPCA's rehabilitation of the former fighting dogs. CNN is not disclosing the location of the rehabilitation center for security reasons. Not only are the dogs getting medical treatment for malnourishment and injuries sustained in fighting, Bershadker said the canines also are getting ""a personal behavior modification enrichment plan to maximize each dog's opportunity to be placed in a home."" The goal is to turn these fighting dogs into animals that can be pets or work as rescue and rehabilitation animals. ""What we will do is go to each dog individually and assess their strengths and their weaknesses,"" said Bershadker. Detroit grapples with stray dog epidemic . Fighting scars . If he hadn't been rescued, 917 and the other puppies would have likely become typical dogs bred to fight. Some of those fights, prosecutors say, brought in as much as $200,000. Getting the animal into top physical condition is often the priority for those who train fighting dogs, and that usually begins with a few months lifting a heavy chain. Next the dog is put in ""the keep,"" an intensive training program before its first fight. When deemed ready, the dogs will be put into the ""fighting pit"" -- either in a test fight or ""the show,"" a fight in front of spectators. ""Those fights can last 30 minutes, an hour, two hours, even three hours,"" Bershadker said ""That's where the physical wounds are sustained."" Although 917 was too young to sustain injuries and scars from a fight, many of the other canines seized in last month's raid show evidence of being in a fighting pit. At the ASPCA shelter, Dr. Sarah Kirk conducts an examination on one of the rescued dog. On the table is a dog so skinny that his ribs and vertebrae are visible through his fur. ""He clearly hasn't been well cared for,"" she said. ""His body condition score is probably 2 out of 9."" The cuts, scars and large tumor on his paw suggest a very hard 10 years for this animal, which likely made more than one appearance in the fighting pit. Since arriving in the shelter, the dog has been dewormed and given medicine for fleas and to manage his pain. The prognosis is good: Kirk said she believes with the proper care this dog will have a good quality of life. Raiding the dogfighting ring . Last month's raid on the dogfighting ring started with a sliver of information. ""In 2010 we got a tip from a drug defendant that there were high-stakes dogfighting going on in Lee County, Alabama,"" said Clark Morris, a federal prosecutor in Alabama. That led to an investigation in Alabama that turned up more evidence of dogfighting in nearby states. Authorities executed 13 warrants in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Texas, which led to 12 arrests. Those arrested have since entered pleas of not guilty to a variety of federal charges, including conspiracy to promote and sponsor dogfights and conducting a gambling business. ""These defendants were gambling anywhere from between $1,500 to $200,000 on one dogfight, according to our investigation,"" said Morris, who is prosecuting the case. If convicted the defendants face up to 15 years in prison. A trial is scheduled for February. The government plans to forfeit the rights to the dogs and Morris hopes that permanent custody will go to the organizations that are currently caring for them. ""As much as I would love to parade these horribly scared dogs through the courtroom at trial I don't think any judge is going to let me, so I am not going to need the physical dogs,"" Morris said. Feds: Busted dogfighters earn spot in 'lowest places in hell' Healing mental wounds . The once empty ASPCA shelter is now lined with rows upon rows of cages that contain a variety of dogs of all ages. A walk past the cages will prompt some dogs to incessantly bark, others to jump up and down. The most dramatic reaction is from a black pit bull mix that appears to panic at the sight of a person. His ears stand straight up and he cowers in the corner of his cage as his body trembles. ""Understand that these dogs have experienced nothing but life at the end of a chain,"" Bershadker explained. ""Even a water bowl is new for them ... they are afraid of everything."" To emphasize his point, a sign that reads ""I'm FEARFUL, please go slowly"" hangs on one dog's cage. Certified dog trainer Cinder Wilkinson-Kenner moves slowly as she works to gain the trust of an older dog that also has been labeled fearful. She is on her knees in a pen reserved for training and she has the dog on a leash. In a friendly yet calm and quiet voice, Wilkinson-Kenner repeats the phrase ""good girl, good girl"" while throwing treats near the animal. After a few minutes she asks the dog, ""Ready to come close?"" and she holds out an open hand with a treat in it. The dog takes the treat and Wilkinson-Kenner gives the dog a break by throwing the next treat away from her to reduce the animal's anxiety from being so close to a human. The ASPCA is doing all it can to rehabilitate these dogs so they can eventually be given to organizations that will either find them a home as a pet, train them as work dogs, or put them in alternative placements such as a sanctuary. Maybe one day, the dogs, like 917, can have real names instead of numbers. ""A lot of people have this misperception of fighting dogs being big brutish pit bulls that are killers,"" said Ehren Melius, the shelter's senior manager, who spends all day with the dogs. ""In reality, some of these guys are traumatized from the experience they've been through from lack of socialization, the torture."" While these dogs may have been saved from a life a torture, the ASPCA estimates there are more than 40,000 dogfighters in the United States who are putting hundreds of thousands of animals through the brutal training to become fighting dogs. ""This may be the second largest dogfighting bust in U.S. history, but it's a drop in the bucket,"" said Bershadker. ""This is going on all over the United States across socioeconomic lines, across racial lines, it is prevalent, it is pervasive, it is deep underground."" CNN's Gary Tuchman and Dominic Swann contributed to this report.","Last month, authorities broke up the nation's second largest dogfighting ring .

"London (CNN) -- A British parliamentary report slammed Barclays bank on Saturday for its ""disgraceful"" actions that led to a rate-rigging scandal. The Treasury Select Committee issued a report after recent hearings over the scandal. Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators after some of its traders purposely manipulated its interest rates as part of Libor, or London Interbank Offered Rate. The scandal also led to the resignation of Bob Diamond, its chief executive. The report said the source of the scandal was a ""deeply flawed culture"" by Barclays and not just actions ""small group of rogue traders."" ""There was something deeply wrong with the culture of Barclays. Such behavior would only be possible if the management of the bank turned a blind eye to the culture of the trading floor,"" the report said. The report regarded Barclays"" ""incentives and control systems"" as ""so defective"" that they served to reward traders themselves, not matter what ""the impact of shareholders and the bank's overall performance"" would be. ""Now exposed, their actions are to the detriment of Barclays' reputation and the reputation of the industry. The standards and culture of Barclays, and banking more widely, are in a poor state. Urgent reform, by both regulators and banks, is needed to prevent such misconduct flourishing."" The issue is important because the scandal centered on the rates at which banks lend each other money. The Libor is hammered out based on input from big banks in London each morning and used to calculate trillions of dollars in consumer and business loans around the world. It affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans. The fines against Barclays came after it admitted some of its trading desks purposely manipulated the rate for personal benefit during the height of the global financial crisis. Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impacts up to $800 trillion of securities. E-mails revealed as part of the rate fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions. Diamond, in a statement Saturday, labeled the ""behavior of a small group of traders related to Libor manipulation"" as ""reprehensible and not in keeping with Barclays' high standards."" But he took ""particular issue with the attacks on Barclays' culture and character"" and disputes the negative image of the bank. He said the bank ""is a tremendous institution with an over 300-year tradition of supporting economic growth and the communities in which we live and work."" ""It should be recorded that broader issues with Libor have been a subject of discussion among regulators for years, and there is little dispute that Barclays was both aggressive in its investigation of this matter and engaged in its cooperation with the appropriate authorities,"" he said. Politicians from both sides of the fence have slammed Barclays, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying the manipulation was ""outrageous."" Further high-profile resignations in the banking sector are possible given the precedent set by Barclays. The bank said it had alerted U.S. and British authorities about suspicious Libor submissions by other banks in late 2008, and was ""disappointed that no effective action was taken."" CNN's Susannah Palk in London and Joe Sterling in Atlanta contributed to this report.","A parliamentary report was issued on Saturday .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India will end a six-day ban on cotton exports that impacted global commerce, the country's trade minister said Sunday. The South Asian nation is the world's second-largest producer of the commodity. Its March 5 ban aimed at boosting domestic supplies in light of a surging export surplus drew criticism from domestic farmers, political leaders and a key Chinese trade lobby. ""Keeping in view the facts, the interests of the farmers, interest of the industry"" and other concerns, India's group of ministers decided to roll back the ban, Trade Minister Anand Sharma said in a statement. The prohibition had drawn flak from businesses in China, which is the biggest buyer of Indian cotton. In a statement Thursday, the China Cotton Association called the ban an ""irresponsible act"" that ended ""a large number of registered contracts"" and ""disturbed international cotton trade order seriously."" As fury grew, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ordered a quick review of the decision. U.S. cotton futures surged last week after India announced the ban, igniting fears of another jump in prices for cotton goods. Officials in India explained they were concerned about a supply crunch in the country. ""This India development really caught the entire cotton industry and traders off guard because it came with no warning,"" Phil Flynn, senior market and commodities analyst with PFG Best, told CNN last week. Last year, when cotton prices hit an all-time high due to a global supply crunch, manufacturers first raised prices, then used less cotton and more blended fabrics such as poly-cotton. Cotton prices cooled off toward the end of last year, Flynn said. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","India will end its export ban after six days, the trade minister says .

"(CNN) -- While a 5-year-old victim of an alleged rape recovers in a New Delhi hospital, India's prime minister admits that his country has ""vast improvements to make"" when it comes to ""the safety, security and status of women in our society,"" and protesters are taking to the streets of the Indian capital. The little girl is stable, conscious and alert, her doctor, D.K. Sharma, said Sunday. The girl's neighbor, who allegedly raped her, was arrested in Bihar state in eastern India, then brought to New Delhi in police custody, city police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. The suspect is expected in court Monday and will not be eligible for bail, Bhagat said. Indian police say the suspect abducted the 5-year-old last Sunday, locked her in his house and brutally raped her repeatedly before she was found semiconscious Wednesday on the ground floor of her building. Opinion: India can learn respect for women . Doctors said they had to remove foreign objects, including candle pieces and a small bottle, from the girl's genitals. The assault came just four months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang raped in a moving bus, triggering seething protests in India. She later died at a Singapore hospital. Criticized for what was seen as a slow response to the savage December attack, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was quick to issue a statement this time, calling the act ""shameful."" Sunday, in a follow-up statement, Singh said, ""The gruesome assault on a little girl a few days back reminds us once again of the need to work collectively to root out this sort of depravity from our society."" Protests have swept through New Delhi since Friday. Many demonstrators are members of a political party of a leading anti-corruption activist, Arvind Kejriwal. Outside the prime minister's residence Sunday, nonviolent demonstrators conducted a sit-in. Video from CNN affiliate CNN-IBN showed police removing the protesters. As the nation's media ran footage of a police officer slapping a female protester outside a hospital Sunday, Singh ordered strict action against the officer and anyone else who roughed up demonstrators.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. President Bush laid the blame for recent fighting in Gaza squarely at the feet of Hamas, accusing militants of waging a campaign of violence against Israel with little regard for its people. President Bush, pictured in December, says Hamas ""has no intention of serving the Palestinian people."" ""Since Hamas' violent takeover in the summer of 2007, living conditions have worsened for Palestinians in Gaza,"" Bush says in prepared remarks released Friday by the White House. ""By spending its resources on rocket launchers instead of roads and schools, Hamas has demonstrated that it has no intention of serving the Palestinian people."" In a radio address to air Saturday, Bush says Hamas committed an act of terrorism when it renewed rocket attacks into Israel last month, provoking this week's airstrikes by Israel. ""In response to these attacks on their people, the leaders of Israel have launched military operations on Hamas positions in Gaza,"" Bush says. ""As a part of their strategy, Hamas terrorists often hide within the civilian population, which puts innocent Palestinians at risk.""  Watch White House reaction to the Gaza crisis » . Palestinian medical sources said Friday that at least 421 people have been killed and 2,200 wounded in Gaza since Israeli air raids began December 27. Israeli police and military officials say four Israelis have died and 57 have been wounded. With Israeli tanks and troops massed along the Gaza border as Saturday morning broke, Bush acknowledged the humanitarian toll that the airstrikes have taken upon Gaza's densely packed population. But Bush does not directly mention the toll that the airstrikes have taken in the address, again blaming conditions in Gaza on Hamas, which has repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel. Bush said his administration will continue to monitor the situation in Gaza closely and will stay in contact with leaders throughout the region. President-elect Barack Obama is said to be monitoring the situation. He has been in contact with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, the nominee for secretary of state. Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, in a statement broadcast Friday on Al Jazeera television network, chided Obama for having a ""double standard."" ""You got involved, and you had a statement regarding the issue of Mumbai, but you did not get involved and say anything about the enemy's crime against Gaza,"" Meshaal said.  Learn more about Meshaal and other key leaders in the conflict » . Asked Sunday whether a land invasion would change how the Obama administration views Israel, Obama's senior adviser yielded to Bush. ""The fact is that there is only one president at a time. There's only one president who can speak for America at a time. And that president now is George Bush,"" David Axelrod said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Bush says in his address that ""America's objectives in the Middle East will remain clear: We seek security and peace for our allies, the free people of Israel. For the Palestinian people, we seek a peaceful and democratic Palestinian state that serves its citizens and respects its neighbors. For all in the region, we seek an end to terror."" The comments reflected the general tone that the U.S. has historically taken toward Hamas, which the United States and the European Union consider a terrorist group. In democratic elections in Palestinian territories backed by the United States in 2006, Hamas won a landslide victory in parliamentary voting. After the elections, the U.S. government asked the Palestinian Authority to return $50 million in donations for infrastructure improvements. The United States cut off direct, nonhumanitarian aid to Gaza but more than doubled humanitarian aid it funnels through non-governmental groups and the United Nations. Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority and a member of Hamas' rival Fatah party, dissolved Gaza's Hamas-led government and declared a state of emergency in 2007. Hamas took control of the territory shortly afterward. Abbas was to travel to New York on Friday to address the United Nations Security Council, his office said. On Wednesday, the council debated a Libyan-sponsored draft resolution favored by Arab countries that calls for Israel to immediately cease military attacks against civilians and asks for the protection of the Palestinian people. The United States indicated that it does not back the resolution, though it does support a cease-fire. Rice said Friday that a ""durable and sustainable"" cease-fire was needed to end the violence in Gaza and in southern Israel. ""We are working toward a cease-fire that would not allow a re-establishment of the status quo,"" she said. ""It is obvious that should take place as soon as possible, but we need a cease-fire that is durable and sustainable.""","President Bush accuses Hamas of building rockets instead of schools, roads .

"(CNN) -- ""This here ain't no protest song or anything like that, cause I don't write no protest songs."" -- Bob Dylan, Gerde's Folk City, New York, April 1962 . Bob Dylan and Joan Baez perform at a civil rights rally in Washington, D.C. in 1963 . It was in typically oblique fashion that Dylan launched ""Blowin' in the Wind"" on the world. A song takes on a life of its own once it has left a musician's private domain and even if he didn't see it as a protest song, it has certainly been interpreted as one by its listeners. It has become one of the most recognized political songs of popular culture and its release on the 1963 album ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" arguably marks the pinnacle of the protest song as a cultural force. Today Dylan really doesn't write protest songs and hardly, it would seem, does anyone else. But is this because there is a dearth of politically-motivated singers, or has the public simply lost its appetite for protest? ""There was a particular genre of songwriting which Dylan represented in the sixties and seventies which doesn't continue in quite the same way,"" says Professor John Street, head of Politics at the University of East Anglia and author of ""Politics and Culture."" ""If the protest song is defined by the lone voice with a guitar, then it probably has declined, even though people like Billy Bragg and so forth strive to keep it alive."" In his brief sojourn as leader of the counterculture's political awakening, Dylan was following in a tradition for protest in folk music that had existed for centuries. Folk practitioners such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger used their music in the 1940s and 1950s to support the burgeoning labor movement and to speak out against Senator Joseph McCarthy's purge against ""Un-American"" behavior. But the roots of protest music can be traced back to as early as the 14th century in England where the ""Cutty Wren"" was taken up as the rallying call for the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The protest song crossed the Atlantic and many were written during the American War of Independence. Nor did the protest song die when Dylan eschewed overtly political song-writing. When Dylan stepped across the electric fence, the protest song made the leap with him. Suddenly, in a world where the counter culture was brushing the brim of mainstream culture, even rock n' roll, which hitherto had limited itself to the subjects of love, sex, cars and dancing, was overflowing with political messages; Jimi Hendrix played a version of the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" which was interpreted by many as an anti-Vietnam statement. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young wrote ""Ohio"" after four students were killed by members of the Ohio National Guard at an anti-war demonstration at Kent State University. In soul music, artists such as James Brown with ""Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud"" and Marvin Gaye with his album ""What's Going On"" became spokespersons for the civil rights movement of the late 1960s. This carried over into the 1980s with hip hop acts such as Public Enemy protesting against the endemic racism and poverty faced by the black community in America. Meanwhile in the UK, the punk movement took on the mantle of political protest from its folk and rock forebears, with groups such as The Clash criticizing racial disharmony in British society. But as the new century approached it seems as though the appetite for using music as a tool for protest diminished. Parallels can be drawn between the political climate of the 1960s and today: a fear of communism has been supplanted by a fear of terrorism and even George W. Bush himself has pointed out similarities between the Vietnam War and the conflict in Iraq. It would seem like a ripe time for the protest song to make a comeback. While the Iraq war has seen some of the 1960s' stalwarts re-emerge, with Neil Young calling for George W Bush to be impeached and Bruce Springsteen releasing an album of thirteen covers of protest songs by Pete Seeger, none of yesterday's stars wield the same influence with today's young as they did when they were at their peek. Some mainstream pop stars have made stabs at political songs. In 2006 Pink released the single ""Dear Mr President,"" an open letter to George W. Bush criticizing some of his policies, on her album ""I'm Not Dead"". But the song was only released as a single in Europe and Australia, leaving her open to criticism that releasing an anti-US foreign policy song in Europe, where opinion had already largely turned against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, was virtually riskless. But it seems musicians are still flexing their muscles in the political sphere, only the protest comes dressed in different clothes, with a new hard-nosed approach that matches the nous of politicians. Rock stars are no longer part of the counter culture. They are immensely wealthy members of the establishment, with the weight of large corporations behind them, and they are using their insider influence to lobby on behalf of their cause. The focus has shifted to fighting global poverty and climate change, with musical events such as Live 8 and Live Earth, and while they may not be singing songs of protest, pop stars are using their presence at these global events to push for change. ""The idea that we should listen to people like Bono and Geldof on Africa is in a part a product of the thought that musicians were not merely crafters of nice tunes but were actually serious commentators on our world,"" says Street. ""The kind of people who might have sat on the outside looking in are now so establishment, they're acting as pressure groups within the system."" In fact, Geldof has pointedly lambasted the protest song, claiming it has little or no power to effect change. He told Rolling Stone magazine that the protest rock served out by the Clash, who headlined the 1978 Rock Against Racism festival at Victoria Park in London was ""a laughable farce"" and that ""the rhetoric of pop revolution was too easy."" It was this same line of thinking that led him to dismiss the idea that African bands should play at Live8 because they were African: they should only appear if they were popular, he argued, as it was the ability to attract large crowds who would rally behind the push to cancel world debt that would persuade public opinion wary G8 leaders to bend from their course. While the Live 8 concerts were met with cynicism by some - ""for many of the people listed in this line-up... it's a chance to get on world-wide television, sell a load of albums and feel very pleased with yourself at the end of the day,"" said Janet Street-Porter in the UK's Independent newspaper - they succeeded in bringing on board the world's media and in exerting pressure which led to the cancelling of debt for the world's poorest countries and $50 billion in aid promised. But according to a report by DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), the G8 have since ""shuffled at half-pace on aid, and fell backwards on trade"". The legacy of Live8 will determine which relationship between music and politics is the most effective.

"(CNN) -- Some of the most controversial parts of Alabama's immigration law could soon be off the table for good, according to a settlement deal filed in federal court Tuesday. State officials agreed to block the enforcement of portions of the law, which was described as one of the nation's toughest measures aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration when it passed in 2011. The proposed deal blocks several parts of the law, including a requirement for public schools to collect information on the immigration status of students; a provision that criminalized the solicitation of work by undocumented immigrants; and a section that prohibited giving a ride to undocumented immigrants. The agreement, which must be approved by the court, also says the law does not authorize police to detain someone for the sole purpose of checking immigration status. Civil rights groups that sued the state over the law, known as HB 56, described the settlement deal as a ""significant victory."" ""We warned the legislature when they were debating HB 56 that if they passed this draconian law, we would sue in court and win,"" said Kristi Graunke, an attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""That we have done. Now it is time for our state lawmakers to repeal the remnants of HB 56 and for our congressional delegation to support meaningful immigration reform that will fix our broken system."" Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said in a written statement that his office had vigorously defended the law in federal and appellate courts. ""The courts have upheld most of the Act but have also made clear that some provisions are invalid. We have a duty to follow the law as set forth by the courts,"" Strange said.

"(CNN) -- Four young boys died Wednesday after the Gaza beach where they were playing was attacked by Israeli forces. A pair of explosions in what had been nine days of relentless bombings between the two countries are to blame. The boys had been told to stay indoors. And as children tend to do, they disobeyed their parents to play on the beach where they had always been safe before. But there is no such thing as safe when enemy fire lands across your border for more than a week. They were too young to know that being a civilian provides no cover from an explosion. That war has no clean lines. This is why, as our hearts weep over the death of these innocent children -- some as young as 9 -- it would be good for us to take this time to reconsider our own fantasies about the supposed clean lines of the military strikes our own country launches. The U.S. may be justified in attacking an enemy (just as Israel is justified in protecting itself and its children) but it doesn't always just hurt its enemies. The United States has killed its share of little boys on the beach as well, so let us look at the photos from Gaza and remember: Sometimes we're Israel. It's an uncomfortable thought. As a public we prefer to talk about military strikes more than we like to see what happens because of them. The hardest part about being an American citizen of the world is banishing our willful blindness. Intuitively we know innocents die by American hands. But to sleep better at night, we choose not to see the ugliness that goes into ""protecting American interests"" or keeping our gas cheap. To hold the President and Congress accountable for the military action they authorize on our behalf requires us to care. And caring that much can be exhausting. I find myself wondering: How many children have we left face down in the sand in my lifetime? In 2002, a U.S. helicopter mistakenly bombed a house full of wedding guests in Afghanistan, killing more than 30, including children. The Guardian reported one little girl, Paliko, was brought to the hospital still wearing her party dress. Her entire family had been killed in the attack. This is what war looks like -- still. The world's weaponry is more sophisticated but the carnage hasn't changed. Just our willingness to see it. There are times in which military strikes cannot be avoided and in those times we should mourn. Homes will be destroyed. Families will lose loved ones. Children will one day go outside to play and they may never come home. It's not just the U.S. and its allies whose military strikes end up hitting children. In Syria two dozen children were killed when bombs fell on their elementary school in April. The U.N. says, in fact, that some 10,000 children have been killed in that country's civil war. Yesterday four young boys, all cousins, none older than 11, went outside to play hide and seek on a beach in Gaza. Now their parents are having funerals. One boy had part of his leg blown off and was severely burned, according to The New York Times. Nearby a smaller one with curly hair laid motionless in the sand. When you look at the pictures from this tragedy -- the beautiful blue water, waves in the distance racing to shore -- one can only imagine what a wonderful day it must've been for them. The smiles. Laughter. And then nothing. This, too, is war. And I must remember not to allow proximity to dictate my reaction to the loss of life, especially life so young. When our newspapers and televisions were flooded with horrific images from the Vietnam War, we responded passionately. We don't show the gruesome images and dead bodies like that anymore, and culturally we have grown apathetic. Politicians mock diplomacy or talk about airstrikes in the same tones in which you ask your spouse to pick up milk from the store. We must remember Paliko, think about the four little boys on the beach, consider the countless other children whose blood still stains our well-meaning but sometimes clumsy hands. The photo of a man carrying a lifeless young body through the sand struck a nerve for many of us around the country. I pray going forward that visceral response continues to be the country's reaction whenever we hear talk of war from our politicians. In war there are no clean lines. There are no safe beaches to play on. There is no safety. In 2012, a U.S. Army sergeant walked more than a mile from his base late one night and killed 16 unarmed Afghans, nine of them children, in their homes. His attorney said the officer suffered a mental breakdown while serving the last of his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He was sentenced to life in prison while the victim's families serve out a different kind of life sentence. This is all part of war. And it's as horrible as it sounds.","LZ Granderson: 4 boys killed while playing on Gaza beach attacked by Israeli forces .

"(CNN) -- China's first aircraft carrier sailed out of the northeastern port of Dalian for sea trials Wednesday morning, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. China has spent nearly a decade refurbishing the 67,000-ton, 300-meter (1,000-foot) ship, begun by the former Soviet Union but never completed. Xinhua quoted military sources as saying the trials would be brief, and the carrier would return to Dalian for further refits. China once renounced aircraft carriers as tools of imperialism, but has been developing a blue-water navy in recent years, along with air power to back it up. China's military modernization a cause for concern? It purchased the rusting, gutted shell of the Varyag, the Soviet-begun carrier now under way, from Ukraine in 1998. Only a handful of other nations operate aircraft carriers -- and only the United States, with 11, has more than two in service.","China has been refurbishing its still-unnamed carrier for years .

"(CNN) -- It's election time in the United States, and what better way to get into the spirit than by taking a politically inspired trip? First on the campaign trail: visiting a battleground state with the motto, ""As Ohio goes, so goes the nation."" Ohio will be the first stop on a November ""U.S. Elections 2012"" tour led by Political Tours, an English tour company. ""We go to Ohio, which is obviously one of the key swing states, and it has taken every president to the White House since Kennedy,"" said Nicholas Wood, the company's owner. ""Demographically, it's a very good way of getting into the issues in the election."" Capitalizing on presidential politics was an easy decision for Wood, a former foreign correspondent, since his company focuses on politics and current affairs around the world. Upcoming tours include trips to Kosovo, Libya and North Korea. ""The world has a stake in the U.S. elections because the U.S. has such a big hold over the rest of us, and so it's the election that everyone looks to,"" Wood said. The ""U.S. Elections 2012"" tour will take travelers to Ohio and Washington to discuss the issues is this year's election. The cost is about $5,000 for an eight-day trip that includes talking to farmers, labor leaders and clergy members. While in Washington, the itinerary includes a trip to CNN's Election Center for an election eve visit with Wolf Blitzer and stops in two D.C. suburbs to talk to voters on Election Day. ""It is not your typical tour,"" said Dorothy Button, an Australian who has signed up for the trip. ""Observing the political process with a tour as Political Tours offer seems to me to be the only way I can get to the heart of the matter and be there at the time of an election where I can be briefed on the events, as they unfold, by those who have answers."" Pick your party . Five thousand dollars is also the price of another election-inspired escape, the ""Pick Your Party"" package offered by the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. The hotel is near the White House and has served as home base for many politicians including presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Theodore Roosevelt. ""Politics is such a huge part of this city that you can't avoid it, so you might as well have fun with it,"" said Keith McClinsey, the hotel's director of sales. The fun at the Mayflower includes a night in the red or blue suite, a moonlight limousine tour of the capital's monuments and a political swag bag. If the $5,000 price tag is too high, the Mayflower is also offering a ""Red, White and You"" package starting at $200 per night. It includes a regular guest room, champagne breakfast, valet parking and a collection of politically inspired DVDs for in-room viewing. All Mayflower guests are offered the ""Elect Your Own Turndown"" service, in which they can decide what snack will be placed in their room each night. ""All the turndown snacks are based on presidential favorite snacks,"" McClinsey said. ""Ronald Reagan was famous for liking jelly beans, so you can pick jelly beans for one night."" Also on the ""ballot"" are chocolate caramels, a favorite of President Barack Obama's. Supporters of candidate Mitt Romney may be disappointed that their candidate's snack isn't an option. McClinsey says the snacks offered include only those of U.S. presidents, but he is quick to add that if Romney is elected, his snack, which will probably include peanut butter, may be added to the list. Commander in sleep . It's not snacks but sleep that the Loews Annapolis Hotel has its focus on in a ""Commander in Sleep"" promotion. The hotel is targeting ""weary contenders on the campaign trail and travelers"" and offering them the opportunity to sleep in. Aside from a late check-out, this package -- starting at $175 a night -- includes breakfast and a guided historic stroll. Guests will be offered either a walking tour of the United States Naval Academy or a walking tour of historic Annapolis, Maryland. Presidential pampering . For those who would rather ride than walk, the Brazilian Court Hotel and Beach Club in Palm Beach, Florida, has a package that includes ""motorcade"" transportation. (It's really a private car service for a full day.) Potential guests may need a donation from a super PAC in order to afford this presidential perk; prices start at $2,159 per night. In addition to the ""motorcade,"" the price includes luxury accommodations, facials at the spa, cocktails or mocktails in the cafe, and chocolate-covered strawberries. And to ""unwind,"" guests will be given their choice of Mitt Romney's ""No Apology"" or Barack Obama's ""Audacity of Hope."" Election fatigue . If your idea of unwinding does not include reading works by politicians, the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Hotel may have the getaway for you. This hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona, is offering an ""Election Fatigue Package."" ""You can elect not to receive the daily newspaper or the TV news stations,"" hotel spokeswoman Valerie Lee explains. In order to make sure their guests get away from the political TV ads, this $399-a-night package includes a pool cabana and access to the spa. Elect to escape . One place where you can turn on the television without having to worry about political ads is at the Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino. The Renaissance, on the Dutch island of Aruba, is inviting the ""election weary to take a post-election break with discounted rates tied directly to presidential polls."" The ""Elect to Escape"" promotion offers discounts on rates, starting at $260 per night, which are directly related to the Gallup Election 2012 tracking polls. ""If President Obama is attracting support from 54% of voters nationwide, resort rooms at the adult-exclusive Marina Hotel can be booked at a 54% discount on that day. If Mitt Romney surges ahead by 60% the following day, the discount will jump to 60%."" Pay attention to the polls to get the most out of this deal. ""Elect to Escape"" rates can be booked through November 5, for stays from November 6 through November 30.The Renaissance Aruba comprises the adult-only Marina Hotel and family-friendly Ocean Suites. Election protection plan . To get to Aruba, travelers might want to enter JetBlue's ""Election Protection 2012"" sweepstakes. To be considered, travelers must go to the airline's website and choose this year's presidential winner or loser. In this case, the winner's candidate must actually lose the election. ""We've all heard the quote from people: 'If my candidate loses, I'm going to leave the country,' "" said Marty St. George, JetBlue's senior vice president of marketing. ""We fly to 21 international destinations, so we thought it could be a fun thing to do."" The airline will choose 1,006 sweepstake winners -- whose candidate lost the election -- to each receive two one-way tickets to the JetBlue international destination of their choice. (They receive two one-way tickets in case they decide to return to the United States.) The winners obviously won't be announced until after the November 6 election. The real winners this election season will be travelers who make the most of an excuse to arrange a relaxing getaway.","Visit the swing state of Ohio and the U.S. capital to learn about election issues .

"(CNN) -- Lying low. Three of the key anti-war members of Congress are considering supporting expanded military action against ISIS -- but the key word there is ""considering."" Rep. Barbara Lee said she ""can't say"" if she'd oppose expanded military operations. The California Democrat was the only member of Congress to vote against giving President George W. Bush -- and subsequent presidents that would follow him -- nearly unlimited authority to wage war just days after the September 11 terror attacks. This time around, she said there's ""no question"" that ISIS needs to be stopped, but she's waiting to hear President Barack Obama's plan, which he's expected to unveil in an address Wednesday night. Analysis: Obama speech a do-over 'no strategy' comment . To get her support, Obama has to outline a plan that is ""strategic, targeted and limited,"" Lee told CNN. Republican Walter Jones of North Carolina, who said he will go to his grave apologizing for his vote for war in 2002, couldn't commit his support -- or opposition -- to an expanded military operation either. ""I've always regretted that vote,"" he told CNN of his vote that authorized U.S. intervention in Iraq. ""I think here we go again."" Jones said it ""depends"" on what the President says. ""I'm opposed to spending money without a debate and a strategy."" Rounding out the vocal antiwar trio, Massachusetts Democrat James McGovern, said he's ""very uneasy"" about the prospect of expanded war but stopped short of opposing it. He said he has ""a million questions"" about potential action in Syria, the role of regional partners and the cost to U.S. coffers. ""I'm going to need more than a presidential speech and more than one briefing ... to make sure we know what we're doing,"" McGovern said. One thing these doves are insistent on, however, is that Congress be held accountable to their constituents and debate and vote on any proposal. They wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner in late August outlining such demands. Despite a resolution passed in July by 370 members -- 180 Republicans and 190 Democrats -- that says the President ""shall not deploy or maintain ... a sustained combat role in Iraq without specific statutory authorization,"" Congressional leaders have not yet determined if they will force Congressional authorization -- less than two months before the midterm elections.

"(CNN) -- A Florida teenager whose videotaped beating in Jerusalem was widely decried was to return home late Wednesday, his body still healing from the pummeling he received at the hands of Israeli police. Tariq Abu Khdeir, 15, was expected to arrive in Tampa on Wednesday night after completing his house arrest in Jerusalem, said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Florida. Khdeir, whose face was unrecognizable after the vicious beating on July 3, still suffers from headaches and bloodshot eyes, Shibly said. ""Hopefully, he's improved some,"" Shibly said. ""We're already in touch with a lot of doctors who are ready to examine him and help him move forward."" A high school sophomore in Tampa, Khdeir was visiting his Palestinian relatives in Jerusalem for the first time in over a decade when he was attacked and detained, family members told CNN after the assault. Amateur video showed Israeli police officers holding down, punching and kicking Khdeir. Khdeir, born in Baltimore, was outside the home of his cousin, who was kidnapped and killed on July 2 in an incident that further stoked tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. Tensions were already high after three Israeli teens were found dead in the West Bank. Shibly said that he did not know the outcome of the Israeli police case against Khdeir but that his house arrest had ended Monday. ""They're very, very excited to be coming back home and letting the healing process begin and getting him ready to get back to school in a few weeks,"" Shibly said of Khdeir's family. Last week, Israeli authorities said they had suspended a police officer accused of beating Khdeir. The Israeli Department for the Investigation of Police said Thursday that after an investigation into the incident, it had found evidence to suspect that one of the officers committed ""serious violent offenses"" while Khdeir was handcuffed. The department's director is considering criminal charges against the officer, who is in a special undercover unit, and he has been summoned for a hearing, the agency said in a statement. The officer's suspension is for 15 days. But the department also said Khdeir was identified by police as wearing a mask, carrying a slingshot and taking an active part in the unrest in Shuafat. Khdeir and his family have denied he did anything wrong. ""I was attacked by police. I woke up in the hospital,"" he said as he walked out of court in Jerusalem recently, sporting two black eyes and a swollen lip. ""I just saw somebody running at me, so I tried to run away,"" he told reporters. His mother has said the family intends to sue Israeli authorities over the matter. ""What happened is very telling of Israel's culture and tolerance for violence against Palestinians under authority,"" Shibly said. ""If only one (police officer) is prosecuted, clearly it says that there's a level of acceptability in Israeli military and police culture towards violence against Palestinians."" He added, ""The main thing is just getting him back home so he can start recovering and getting him back to school and hopefully seeing all the officers involved in the vicious beating are brought to justice so that they cannot harm any other child like that again.""","Tariq Abu Khdeir, 15, was expected to arrive in Tampa on Wednesday night .

"(CNN) -- Road-tripping to a national park makes for an easy -- and spectacular -- summer getaway. While all the U.S. national parks will be open this summer, forced federal spending cuts mean reduced programs and facility access. The National Park Service has cut 5% from its 2013 budget. The parks will be open and ready for summer visitors, according to Park Service spokesman Mike Litterest, but these changes are likely: . Fewer staff and programs . The Park Service will hire approximately 1,000 fewer seasonal employees to provide programs and staffing during the peak summer season. With fewer park employees, visitors may notice delayed road and park openings, reduced hours of operation, fewer program offerings and longer wait times at entrance stations. Shorter seasons . Several parks, especially those that close in the winter, have delayed their reopening due to a lack of crews to clear the roads. Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, for example, opened two weeks late this spring to reduce snow plowing costs, and some secondary roads will reopen only as snow melts. At Acadia National Park in Maine, the winter closure of park facilities was extended by an extra month. Similar delays have happened in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Selected facilities will not open . Portions of a number of parks will not open as a cost saving measure. In Washington state, for example, Mount Rainier National Park will close the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center due to reduced staffing. At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, six interpretive sites in the park will remain closed, including the Declaration House, where Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence. And on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, 14 restrooms along the 444-mile parkway will be closed two days per week, and four will be closed for the entire 2013 season. Closed selected days . A number of national parks will close for one or more days a week. This includes the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site in Missouri and Ohio's James A. Garfield National Historic Site, which will close on Sundays and Mondays, as well as on all federal holidays. Other examples include the Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site in Virginia, which will close on Mondays, and the visitor centers at Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, which will be closed two days a week. Fewer campgrounds . Along the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia and North Carolina, the Otter Creek, Roanoke Mountain and Crabtree Falls campgrounds will remain closed through the summer; an additional four picnic areas and three visitor centers will not open this year. Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee is closing three remote campgrounds and two picnic areas this summer. At Grand Teton National Park, several campsites and restroom facilities will not open this year. Fewer ranger programs . Many national parks are reducing the number and schedule of park ranger programs this summer. At Yosemite National Park in California, all programs at the park's Mariposa Grove are cancelled; the Shark Valley Visitor Center at Florida's Everglades National Park is eliminating 60% of its programs due to staff reductions; and Petersburg National Battlefield in Virginia is cutting its offerings by more than half. Curtailed maintenance operations . Visitors may also be affected by a reduction of routine maintenance. Kentucky's Mammoth Cave National Park will delay hiring a park electrician and seven seasonal guides, resulting in the closure of the most remote sections of the cave. Trails damaged by high water in Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park in Hawaii will remain closed due to lack of staff to repair boundary fences and other areas. And at Glacier National Park in Montana, reduced seasonal hiring at the end of the summer will result in less maintenance, mowing, rock removal, patching, striping and shoulder dressing along the Going to the Sun Road and other main park roads. To find out how your visit might be affected, check the National Park Service website. Adjusted hours, programs and the latest information on changes will be updated for each park throughout the summer.","The National Park Service is hiring 1,000 fewer seasonal employees this summer .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama was about to address the nation on Iraq Thursday night when the briefing was delayed because of a security breach on the North Lawn of the White House. But this wasn't your normal breach, this was one of a pint-sized variety. A toddler forced the President, the press corps and the nation to wait. The little boy managed to squeeze himself between the bars of the White House fence, just before the briefing was expected to start. It forced a temporary lockdown. It didn't take long to resolve the matter and he's now back with his parents. ""We were going to wait until he learned to talk to question him, but in lieu of that he got a timeout and was sent on way with parents,"" according to Edwin Donovan, spokesman for the United States Secret Service.

"(CNN) -- It had always been a day destined for thrills and spills, but Sunday's denouement to the Spanish league season ended in chaos as a vital relegation match between Osasuna and Real Betis at the El Sadar stadium, Pamplona, was halted after a barrier collapsed, injuring almost 60 people. Osasuna fans surged forwards when Oriol Riera scored a 12th minute goal, in a game the home team had to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation. But a metal fence collapsed under the weight of people, sparking scenes of chaos as the match was suspended. Fans were ferried from the scene on stretchers as the authorities assessed the damage, tended to the wounded and made emergency repairs to the broken fence. Ten people were taken to hospital whilst another 48 people were treated for minor injuries at the scene. ""It had been many years since I had been to El Sadar,"" Real Betis coach Gabriel Humberto Calderon said after the game, according to AFP. ""I was surprised by the state of the stadium in 2014 and the politicians need to do something to have a stadium that belongs to 2014 and Osasuna."" The match was restarted 35 minutes later, from the 11th minute. Almost immediately Osasuna went 2-0 up against a Betis side already relegated. But the delay had caused a dilemma. The matches involving teams fighting relegation were due to start and finish at the same time so not to give one team an advantage over the others. Controversially, it was decided to extend half time at the other games so that the second halves across Spain would kick off at the same time. Osasuna went on to win the match 2-1, but it wasn't enough. Granada's 1-0 victory over Valladolid meant that the result in Pamplona was immaterial. ""It is a very sad day personally and professionally for me,"" Osasuna boss Javi Gracia told AFP after the game. ""I am very sorry that the team has been relegated. I am sorry for the situation we have come to and I hope Osasuna will be back in the Primera as soon as possible. ""Despite winning, we didn't have it in our own hands and the results didn't go our way. At this time any analysis of the game and the situation has no meaning for me given the moment in which the team, the club and everyone is experiencing."" Elsewhere, Getafe ensured they will be in Spain's top tier next season after Romanian international Ciprian Marica scored twice to beat Rayo Vallecano 2-1. Almeria's 0-0 draw against Athletic Bilbao was enough to ensure their safety too. But the enduring image from the final day of the Spanish season will be of a catastrophe narrowly avoided.","Spanish league finale overshadowed by stadium collapse .

"(CNN) -- Few paintings have been more viewed, more analyzed, studied and interpreted, than Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa,"" otherwise known as ""La Gioconda."" Despite this, no one has come up with an explanation for that enigmatic smile, or a lot of other details in this painting that, despite all the ink and hot air expended on it, measures a mere 77 by 52 centimeters (about 30 by 21 inches). In the frigid bowels of a derelict building in central Florence, Italy, that covers the ruins of an old Franciscan convent, a group of researchers is trying to nail down some of the elusive details of the woman featured in the iconic painting. It is here that old city records say the woman who posed for the painting, Lisa Gherardini, the second wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, was buried. Read more: Unveiling of alternate 'Mona Lisa' raises questions . Silvano Vinceti is leading a team to exhume and identify Gherardini's remains. Those remains are wrapped in aluminum foil and packed into large Tupperware containers stacked in an old filing cabinet. Vinceti and his colleagues took them out, one by one, and eventually found one packet with what appeared to be skull fragments. ""This is probably it,"" Vinceti tells me excitedly, his eyebrows arching. The remains, he says, will be sent for DNA testing to several universities in Italy and abroad, where they will be checked against the DNA of two confirmed relatives of Gherardini buried elsewhere. I ask Vinceti: Why go to all this trouble to find out if this was the woman who posed for da Vinci more than 500 years ago? ""Once we identify the remains,"" he says, gesticulating dramatically, ""we can reconstruct the face, with a margin of error of 2 to 8 percent. By doing this, we will finally be able to answer the question the art historians can't: Who was the model for Leonardo?"" I've seen this before. Several years ago, I did a report about the reconstruction of the face of the Pharaoh Tutankhamen (aka King Tut) by French and American forensic experts using his mummified remains as a model. After piecing together Gherardini's skull fragments, researchers will be able to reconstruct her face, factoring in that she was probably in her early 20s when she posed for da Vinci. Read more: Scientists unlock secret of Mona Lisa's face . Vinceti has no doubt that da Vinci was commissioned to paint a portrait of Gherardini, but he is not certain whether the painting that now hangs in the Louvre in Paris is of her, or just contains some of her features. For starters, he says, that famous smile is not Gherardini's. Analysis of the ""Mona Lisa"" shows, he says, that ""when Leonardo began painting the model in front of him, he did not draw that metaphysical, ironic, poignant, elusive smile, but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed."" The smile, he believes, was added later, and probably belongs to da Vinci's longtime assistant (and rumored lover) Gian Giacomo Caprotti, whose distinct features appear in other works by da Vinci. Other art historians say the ""Mona Lisa"" is a surreptitious self-portrait. There is something eccentric, or slightly mad, about Vinceti. A former producer for RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, he speaks in the language of veteran television producers the world over -- emphatic, direct and full of expletives. In the past, he's produced documentaries about his attempts to solve old art mysteries and plans to do the same with his current project on the ""Mona Lisa."" His high-profile efforts have been criticized by academics, but Vinceti brushes them off with a dismissive snort. Part of his motivation in this current project is a personal identification with da Vinci, who, Vinceti says, ""never went to university, didn't learn Greek or Latin, and was not considered learned."" It will be several months before DNA tests can be conducted and the reconstruction of Gherardini's face can be completed. And regardless of the results, Vinceti concedes that da Vinci is beyond comprehension: ""This is the magic of a great genius who eludes classification, around whom remains a fog of mystery. I am under no illusion that we will be able to solve the mystery of the 'Mona Lisa.'

"Pittsburgh (CNN) -- An Idaho man who acquaintances say called President Barack Obama ""the anti-Christ"" was charged Thursday with trying to assassinate him in a shooting incident outside the White House, federal authorities said. Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, 21, is accused of firing shots at the White House on Friday, including some that hit the building near the residence area where Obama and his family live, according to a complaint document made public after the suspect's initial court hearing Thursday. One witness described to investigators hearing about ""eight sounds of popping noise"" and seeing ""puffs of air"" from a car on Constitution Avenue near the White House, an FBI agent's sworn statement said. Read the complaint against Ortega-Hernandez (PDF) One bullet hit a window and was stopped by bulletproof glass, and another was found on the White House exterior, the Secret Service said. Investigators found a semi-automatic rifle, several boxes of ammunition and nine spent shell casings in a car owned by Ortega-Hernandez that was parked several blocks away on the lawn of the National Institute of Peace, the agent's affidavit said. Ortega-Hernandez was charged with attempted assassination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Kitchen said Thursday at the suspect's initial court hearing in Pittsburgh. The charge carries a possible maximum penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. At the brief hearing, Ortega-Hernandez spoke once, answering ""yes, ma'am"" when Magistrate Cynthia Eddy asked if he understood what his federal defender had said on his behalf. Eddy agreed with a prosecution request for Ortega-Hernandez to remain in custody. Ortega-Hernandez agreed to be extradited to the District of Columbia, and the federal defender, Christopher Brown, said the defendant reserved his right for a detention and preliminary hearing after the transfer. The government agreed not to formally indict Ortega-Hernandez until after his transfer, Brown said. It was not immediately clear when the transfer would occur, but it was expected in coming days. With long, tangled hair and a beard, Ortega-Hernandez wore a white jumpsuit and was handcuffed with legs chained when entering the courtroom guarded by U.S. marshals. Guards removed the handcuffs for the hearing, but the leg chains remained on as he sat down. The complaint document said that on the night of November 11, two witnesses saw shots fired toward the White House through the window of a car on Constitution Avenue. The car's Idaho plates registered to Ortega-Hernandez. Another witness saw a man run away from the same vehicle a few blocks away, the complaint document said. From the vehicle, police recovered a rifle of the same caliber as recovered shells from the White House grounds, it said. A law enforcement official told CNN on Thursday that a trace of the weapon did not show Ortega-Hernandez as the purchaser. The official, who was not authorized to speak about the ongoing investigation, provided no further information on the weapon's purchase. According to three acquaintances cited in the complaint document, Ortega-Hernandez considered Obama the cause of his problems and referred to him at times as the ""anti-Christ"" and the devil. One witness -- identified only as ""W-4"" -- told investigators that Ortega-Hernandez ""has increasingly become more agitated against the federal government, and is convinced that the federal government is conspiring against him,"" the FBI agent's affidavit said. He ""wanted to 'hurt' President Obama and referred to him as 'the anti-Christ,'"" the witness said. Another witness -- identified as ""W-6"" -- also quoted Ortega-Hernandez calling Obama ""the anti-Christ."" This witness told agents Ortega-Hernandez told him he ""needed to kill him."" A third witness, known as ""W-7,"" told investigators Ortega-Hernandez owned an ""AK-47 like gun."" His ""opinions and comments regarding the government and President Obama have gotten worse"" over the past year, the witness told agents. ""W-7 stated that Ortega-Hernandez believed President Obama is 'the devil,' and that Ortega-Hernandez 'will not stop until it's done.'"" the affidavit said. ""W-7 also reported that Ortega-Hernandez stated President Obama 'needed to be taken care of.'"" Lt. Brad Shields of the Pennsylvania State Police said Ortega-Hernandez was arrested Wednesday in western Pennsylvania under a U.S. Park Police warrant issued Sunday in Washington ""based on a shooting that occurred at the White House on November 11."" According to Shields, a tip came in Wednesday that the man sought by federal authorities in the Washington shooting was at a Hampton Inn in the town of Indiana, Pennsylvania. Ortega-Hernandez had stayed at the hotel with another person for a few days before the Friday shooting incident, Shields said. When Ortega-Hernandez returned to the hotel on Wednesday, staff members recognized him from a photo provided by authorities and notified police, Shields said. Ortega-Hernandez was arrested without any resistance in the hotel lobby, asking why he was being detained, Shields said. A bag of his was checked by sniffer dogs, but no weapons were found, according to Shields. The suspect apparently had returned to the hotel to locate what Shields called ""his friend,"" and Shields said the suspect's companion was not from the area. He provided no further details of the companion's identity or whereabouts. In Idaho Falls, Idaho, police spokeswoman Joelyn Hansen said the man -- identified there as Oscar Ramiro Ortega -- was reported missing October 31. Hansen said Ortega is the same man who the Secret Service is calling Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez. The bullets were found on the south side of the White House, a Secret Service official not authorized to speak on the record told CNN. ""A round was stopped by ballistic glass behind the historic exterior glass,"" a Secret Service statement said. ""One additional round has been found on the exterior of the White House. This damage has not been conclusively connected to Friday's incident, and an assessment of the exterior of the White House is ongoing,"". On Friday about 9 p.m., U.S. Park Police and the Secret Service investigated after hearing shots fired about 700 to 800 yards from the White House, the Secret Service statement said. Within five minutes, officers located a vehicle in the 2300 block of Constitution Avenue, according to the statement. The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Metropolitan Police Department all took part in the search for Ortega-Hernandez, officials said. CNN's Tom Cohen and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: A complaint document says the suspect considered Obama the ""anti-Christ""

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams is almost unstoppable in Miami. She showed that again Saturday. Playing close to her home in Florida, Williams started slowly before picking things up and beating Li Na 75 61 for a record seventh title at the Sony Open. She became just the fourth women's player in the Open Era to claim the same tournament at least seven times, joining retired legends Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Chris Evert. And no one had ever won seven Miami titles, too. ""It was a really important victory, especially playing Li Na, who has been playing so well,"" Williams told the crowd. ""She started out so well. ""I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I just need to hang in here.' Then I heard some fans trying to pull me through. If it hadn't been for you guys I wouldn't be standing here right now."" In a battle of the two top-ranked players in the world, Australian Open champion Li -- she's the No. 2 -- stormed out to a 5-2 lead and even held a set point on her own serve. But Williams recovered and won 11 of the next 12 games to capture her second title of 2014. She's now 11-1 against Li. ""I don't think I was playing badly,"" Li was quoted as saying by the WTA tour's website. ""She just started playing a little bit better after she was 5-2 down. ""I don't think I had the wrong game plan today or played wrong. I think it was still a pretty good match. And I was trying so many things like coming to the net more, so it's not bad, really.""

"(CNN) -- Weeks before his arrest on a charge of attempting to assassinate President Barack Obama, an Idaho man taped a video pitch for Oprah Winfrey -- expressing his contempt for government, offering secrets to solving global problems and proclaiming himself to be ""the modern-day Jesus Christ."" The video, released Friday to CNN by Idaho State University, features a man dressed in all black, with brown hair, a beard and a crucifix hanging around his neck. ""My name is Oscar Ortega from Idaho Falls, Idaho, and I feel like I am the perfect candidate to get cast on your show because not only do I have a solution to make a huge impact on this world with small changes to our daily lives, I also have with me the answer to worldwide peace,"" he states. The previous Friday, a witness in Washington described to investigators hearing about ""eight sounds of popping noise"" and seeing ""puffs of air"" from a car that was registered to Ortega. One bullet hit a window on the White House but was stopped by bulletproof glass, the Secret Service said, while another was found on the White House exterior. The president was in California that day, traveling with first lady Michelle Obama later that night to Hawaii. The suspect, identified in court records as Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez of Idaho Falls, was arrested Wednesday in western Pennsylvania. Many questions remain unanswered about the young man who faces the rare charge of trying to kill the president of the United States. Public and court records shed some light on Ortega's background, as does a story that appeared Friday in the Post Register in Idaho Falls. So, too, does the video shot by Idaho State student Ramon Bailey in September, according to CNN affiliate KIFI. In the video, Ortega alludes to having had ""a taste of gang life ... as a child,"" suggesting he's moved on. He segues to a rant against the U.S. government, which he claims bullies other nations and has ""deceived the American people so that (it) can steal other countries' goods, which is the oil."" ""I have never felt so sure about something in my whole life. I'm willing to defend these words with my heart, my soul, flesh and bones,"" Ortega says. ""Please do not take me as a joke or as a deception. I have never felt so sure that I was sent here from God to lead the world to Zion."" Later, he adds, ""It's not just a coincidence that I look like Jesus. I am the modern-day Jesus Christ that you all have been waiting for"" -- before ""begging"" Winfrey to put him on her show. The ""Oprah"" show went off the air last spring. Still, Winfrey remains involved in the OWN network she helped create, and its website features ""casting calls"" for people who might want to get on air. Ortega left his home in Idaho Falls in a black Honda a month ago, telling his family he was going on vacation for a week, according to the Post Register. The next time his family heard any news of his whereabouts was when investigators in Pennsylvania arrested him. His sister, Yesenia Hernandez, told the Post Register that she noticed that her brother's appearance had recently changed. He used to cut his hair once a week, she told the paper. That's a contrast to the image of a young man with an unruly beard who has appeared on television screens across the country. With long, tangled hair and a beard, Ortega wore a white jumpsuit and was handcuffed, his legs chained, as he entered a courtroom this week guarded by U.S. marshals. ""That's what started making me think there was something wrong,"" his sister told the Idaho newspaper. ""I'd ask, 'Is it for the (mixed-martial arts) fighting?' He said, 'No. I'm just trying something different.' It was weird. Now he looks like, I guess, like a terrorist. It's like he's trying to play out the part."" Ortega's mother, Maria Hernandez, also saw changes in her son but told the Post Register that they were of a more positive nature. Before, he would party a lot, and before his recent departure from Idaho, had been spending more time with his son, whose name is tattooed on his neck, his mother said. Ortega mentions his son in the video. ""A year ago, every Friday and Saturday night, he was out partying with his friends and not coming home at all,"" Maria Hernandez told the newspaper. ""He started staying home on the weekends with his little boy. ""It was not like he was acting violent or getting drunk and all drugged up."" Ortega's relatives did not respond to CNN interview requests this week. Public records show that Ortega had a series of run-ins with the law going back into his teen years. Some charges were for minor infractions, like failure to affix tags to a dog's collar and seat belt violations. He was charged at least twice with battery, but those charges were dismissed. In 2010, in connection with one of those incidents, he was convicted of resisting arrest. Other charges included minor-in-possession of alcohol charges and even more traffic violations. In some cases, he was found guilty and paid fines, and others were dismissed. According to an FBI affidavit, one witness -- identified only as ""W-4"" -- told investigators that Ortega ""has increasingly become more agitated against the federal government, and is convinced that the federal government is conspiring against him."" He ""wanted to 'hurt' President Obama and referred to him as 'the anti-Christ,' "" the witness said. Another witness, identified as ""W-6,"" also quoted Ortega calling Obama ""the anti-Christ.""

"(CNN) -- When Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon, he uttered unforgettable words. But the next visitor to roam the lunar landscape may send back e-mail instead. One of the teams competing in the Google Lunar X Prize is considering this rover concept for the mission. Welcome to a new kind of space race, where the earthly guest will be a machine and the goal is as much exploration as seeking out new business ventures. The quest is part of the Google Lunar X Prize, which will put $20 million into the hands of the first privately funded team that can land a rover on the moon; have it travel on the surface for 500 meters or more; send back data, photos and video; and do it all by December 31, 2012. The prize drops to $15 million after that date and goes away altogether after 2014. One of the main requirements is to have as little government involvement in the project as possible. ""We believe that space should be open to anyone and everyone, especially those people who want to go,"" said Becky Ramsey, the X Prize Foundation's director of communications for space projects. ""The government has accomplished amazing things ... but we think that we can do it less expensively."" The idea grew out of conversations between X Prize Chairman Peter Diamandis and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. ""We thought it would be a good fit,"" said Tiffany Montague, technical program manager at Google and the company's main representative for the Google Lunar X Prize. ""Many of us here are interested in space as a hobby, or we came from space backgrounds."" Google, which is paying the main prize purse -- $30 million total, including bonus prizes -- hopes the competition will result in education, ""interesting new content"" and inspiration, she added. ""What I think this prize is really about is inspiring young minds and inspiring the global population to compete for a dream,"" Montague said. 'Garage bands' of space exploration . There are 13 teams officially competing in the race, but the X Prize Foundation expects that number to grow to about 25. The multinational lineup includes Americans, Italians, Romanians and a ""mystery team,"" which can hide its identity until July 20, 2009, under the rules.  See photos of the teams and their rover concepts » . The competitors include university scientists, business people, engineers, robotics experts and even students. Ramsey said all of the teams are considered serious contenders, but not all of them are expected to be able to complete the task. ""I liken our teams to the garage bands of the space exploration world,"" she said. ""These are the people who have a dream, who have a passion, who have the knowledge and ability and the drive, and they think they can do this. So we're giving them the opportunity."" The teams face a number of daunting tasks, including figuring out how and where to launch, designing a craft that can complete the journey and making sure it can execute a required ""soft landing."" ""The craft has to alight on the moon a little like you'd expect an insect or a bird to land here on Earth, and it means that you can't impact or crash into the surface at high speed,"" said Red Whittaker, chairman and CEO of Astrobotic Technology, one of the teams competing for the prize. Once they land, the rovers must be ready to cope with extreme conditions. Whittaker listed a vacuum environment, radiation, temperature extremes and soft terrain as some of the special challenges of the lunar landscape. Expensive mission . Another big obstacle is the money. Reaching for the moon -- literally -- is an immensely pricey endeavor, and the mission is likely to cost much more than the $20 million first prize, a fact the sponsors freely recognize. ""I think what's important to keep in mind is that this is an incentive prize and is not meant to cover the costs of development,"" Montague said. ""Instead, it is meant to be a catalyst to shake up industry and inspire breakthrough."" To help finance their plans, the teams are seeking out investors, partners and sponsors. Celestis, a company that launches cremated human remains into Earth's orbit, recently announced that it has reached an agreement with two of the teams, Astrobotic and Odyssey Moon, to carry human ashes to the moon. NASA could also be a customer for the teams, whose craft could carry scientific payloads, Ramsey said. The agency believes that there's potential for collaboration, but there's nothing formal in the works, said David Steitz, a spokesman at NASA headquarters in Washington. He added that NASA is giving a thumbs-up to the competition. ""We're excited about anyone who's excited about space. We don't claim to have a monopoly on exploration,"" Steitz said. The business of the moon . Many of the teams regard the race as just the start of a long-term business plan. Astrobotic envisions a dozen lunar missions, scouting sites and offering payload services to businesses and governments, Whittaker said. Odyssey Moon CEO Robert Richards said his team also plans to keep coming back. ""We are absolutely committed to an enduring presence on the moon,"" Richards said.  Watch Richards demonstrate rover designs » . ""If we don't win the prize, we will certainly cheer those who do, and we will continue with our efforts to provide a permanent, established mechanism for humanity to reach the moon in a very frequent and cost-effective way."" But with so much money at stake, would it be possible for anyone to fake the mission in order to win the Google Lunar X Prize? Both Ramsey and Montague insisted that could not happen. ""[The teams] have to file a mission plan with us,"" Ramsey said. ""They have to send back images and video from the moon. I don't think in this day and age that it would be possible to fake this signal coming back.""","Google Lunar X Prize goes to the first team that can land a rover on the moon by 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Neil Patrick Harris won't have to wait for it -- a Tony nomination, that is. Harris, Bryan Cranston, Tony Shalhoub and Tyne Daly are among the familiar names who received nods for the highest honor of the Broadway stage. The nominations for the 2014 Tony Awards were announced Tuesday morning. Harris earned a nomination for his performance in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" which received eight nominations -- second only to ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder,"" which received 10. Among them is a pick for best revival of a musical for the show itself. Neil Patrick Harris, as Hedwig, curses at fan . Cranston was nominated for his performance as President Lyndon Johnson in Robert Schenkkan's ""All the Way."" It was one of just two nominations the play received, but the other was also big: best play. Bryan Cranston, man of the moment . Shalhoub was nominated for ""Act One,"" and Daly was nominated for ""Mothers and Sons."" Not all well-known names came off as well. The musical version of Woody Allen's film ""Bullets Over Broadway"" received six nominations but was ignored for best musical, though Allen himself earned a nomination for best book (script) of the show. The Oscar-winning movie ""Rocky,"" which was also turned into a musical, received four nominations, but its biggest pick was for best actor in a musical, for Andy Karl's performance as Rocky Balboa. The nominees for best musical are ""After Midnight,"" ""Aladdin"" (an adaptation of the 1992 Disney film), ""Beautiful -- The Carole King Musical"" and ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder."" ""Aladdin,"" ""Beautiful"" and ""Gentleman's Guide"" also earned nominations for best book; ""Aladdin"" and ""Gentleman's Guide"" are both up for original score as well. ""Gentleman's Guide"" is a musical version of the 1949 Alec Guinness comedy ""Kind Hearts and Coronets."" Like Guinness, star Jefferson Mays plays multiple roles. He's had experience: Mays won a Tony for playing several roles in the 2003 play ""I Am My Own Wife."" The nominees for best play are James Lapine's ""Act One,"" based on the Moss Hart memoir; Schenkkan's ""All the Way""; Harvey Fierstein's ""Casa Valentina""; Terrence McNally's ""Mothers and Sons""; and John Patrick Shanley's ""Outside Mullingar."" The nominees for best revival of a play are ""The Cripple of Inishmaan,"" ""The Glass Menagerie,"" ""A Raisin in the Sun"" and ""Twelfth Night."" ""Raisin"" and ""Twelfth Night"" were among those on top of the acting nominations, with LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Sophie Okonedo and Anika Noni Rose earning nods for ""Raisin"" and Samuel Barnett, Paul Chahidi, Stephen Fry and Mark Rylance doing so for Shakespeare's comedy. Notable by their absences: Denzel Washington, who plays the lead role in ""Raisin""; Daniel Radcliffe, one of the stars of ""Inishmaan""; Zachary Quinto, whose performance in ""Menagerie"" was overlooked; and pals Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, whose rotating bill of ""Waiting for Godot"" and ""No Man's Land"" was completely ignored. And, The New York Times observed, the biggest box-office hit of the season, the revival of Harold Pinter's ""Betrayal"" starring real-life couple Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz, was also shut out. However, fans of ""Frozen"" can rejoice: That film's great singing star, Idina Menzel, was nominated for lead actress in a musical for ""If/Then."" ""Let It Go""? Hardly.

"Miami (CNN) -- NASA plans a return to yesteryear by developing a space capsule that will carry humans into deep space, it announced Tuesday. ""We are committed to human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit and look forward to developing the next generation of systems to take us there,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. The new spacecraft, to be built by Lockheed Martin, will be known as the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, or MPCV. It will carry four astronauts and be based on designs originally planned for NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, whose development was canceled by President Barack Obama. NASA says astronauts would not fly onboard until at least 2016. NASA has not flown astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit since the Apollo program, in the 1970s. ""We hope to have test flights in this decade. We're not sure when but certainly as early as possible,"" said Douglas Cooke, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems mission. Like the Apollo spacecraft, which landed 12 men on the moon, the MPCV will splash down in the Pacific Ocean upon return to Earth. However, the new craft will be the 21st-century version: Much larger and 10 times safer to launch and land than the space shuttle, NASA says. ""We would have an abort system, all the way from sitting on the pad, to flying up, up and away. The space shuttle has never had that capability,"" Cooke said. This new spacecraft is NASA's first step forward in its next great leap, as the U.S. space shuttle program heads into retirement. Officials say this vehicle will be able to go to the moon or do a deep space mission to Mars. Any deep space mission would be accompanied by a larger compartment for the crew, Cooke said. The MPCV is currently at Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, undergoing testing. NASA is hoping to start flying as soon as possible to close the gap in the U.S. manned space program. With the retirement of the space shuttle, expected in July, the U.S. will have to pay the Russian space agency to take astronauts back and forth from the station until the MPCV is ready. NASA is also hoping that private, commercial companies will soon be able to fly astronauts to the space station in newly developed vehicles. The original Orion spacecraft was part of NASA's Constellation program to take man back to the moon, and later, to Mars. That program was canceled. In 2010, it was resurrected, and downsized to be used as a ""lifeboat,"" in the event of an emergency on the space station. Five billion dollars have already been spent on Orion -- another reason to keep the design. NASA has not yet developed a rocket powerful enough to propel this spacecraft out of Earth's atmosphere. ""As we aggressively continue our work on a heavy-lift-launch vehicle, we are moving forward with an existing contract to keep development of our new crew vehicle on track,"" Bolden said. Obama has committed $3 billion for NASA to develop the heavy-lift-launch vehicle.","New craft won't be ready until 2016 at earliest .
It could go to moon or Mars .

"(CNN) -- A Leonardo da Vinci mural unseen since the 16th century may have been found hidden behind a fresco painted by another artist, art researchers in Florence, Italy said Monday. Da Vinci painted ""The Battle of Anghiari"" on a wall of the Hall of the 500 of the Palazzo Vecchio, the seat of Florence government, in 1503, but the masterpiece was lost during a restoration project 50 years later. The theory is that when artist Giorgio Vasari created his mural ""The Battle of Marciano,"" he erected a brick wall in front of da Vinci's plaster wall, effectively preserving the older masterpiece. ""They told us we were looking on the wrong wall, that it was just a legend,"" Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi said at a news conference Monday, where researchers revealed the discovery of paint apparently matching pigment from Leonardo's ""Mona Lisa."" Da Vinci's work was commissioned to commemorate the Republic of Florence's victory over Milan in the battle on the plain of Anghiari in 1440. While da Vinci was believed to have not been satisfied with the result, in which he used new techniques, art historians said it was a much-studied masterpiece in its day. Museum finds earliest 'Mona Lisa' copy . The research team is led by the National Geographic Society and University of California, San Diego's Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art, Architecture and Archaeology, in partnership with the City of Florence. ""In name of the City of Florence, I ask the Italian government and the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities Lorenzo Ornaghi to authorize us to verify how much of the masterpiece is there and if it's worth it to bring it back to light,"" Mayor Renzi said. Researchers were allowed to drill six holes through the newer mural to reach the second wall. Since they chose sections that had been restored by later artists, the holes did not damage Vasari's original work. Are there more lost Leonardo works? An electron microscope identified chemicals in the paint as similar to black pigment found in brown glazes on da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and ""St. John the Baptist,"" according to Professor Maurizio Seracini, who is working with National Geographic. Scans also shows flakes of red material unlikely to be on a plaster wall and beige material that ""could only have been applied by a paint brush,"" the researchers said. An air gap between the hidden plaster wall and the newer brick wall suggest that Vasari may have tried to preserve da Vinci's mural, they said. ""These data are very encouraging,"" Seracini said. The National Geographic Channel will present ""Finding the Lost da Vinci,"" a documentary on the project, Sunday, March 18. Journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","Researchers think they've found Leonardo's ""The Battle of Anghiari""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Department officials debated how to dispose of more than 1,000 fragments that could have included human remains from the September 11 attack on the Pentagon before they ended up in a Delaware landfill, according to newly released internal documents. The internal discussion about what to do with the ""biological"" material was released Friday as part of an investigation into the workings of the mortuary at Dover Air Force Base. In a 2002 e-mail discussion among Defense Department officials, one official identified in the redacted documents as a colonel suggests scattering the material at sea. ""I do like the idea of spreading the ashes at sea in that it is a neutral arena; it should represent an area readily agreeable to all parties,"" the official wrote. A civilian official suggests that it might be appropriate to witness the scattering at sea and to have a chaplain present. Another official, however, expressed concern that an at-sea disposal might ""send a message to the next of kin that we are disposing human remains, and that is not the case."" That official asked that the powder and ashes be disposed of ""immediately"" and as ""normal waste."" The colonel responded by saying that disposal would be based on that guidance, but reminded the official that the material was not ""normal."" ""My point, as you are aware of, is that Group F is not your normal set of medical waste,"" the colonel said. The material is referred to in the documents as ""Group F"" and ""special."" Officials at the Pentagon explained that this group included material that was biological in nature, but it could not be determined that it was human or whether any terrorist remains were mixed in. ""That was at the heart of the debate first because we did not know whether these were human remains to begin with,"" said Jo Ann Rooney, acting under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness. ""We knew that they were biological, but they were mixed in with pieces from the building, from the airplane."" Even something from someone's lunch would show up as being biological in nature, according to Rooney, who said that the internal debate went on throughout the Defense Department and reached into very senior positions. Dover Port Mortuary has been engulfed in scandal since November, when it was discovered that some remains of deceased U.S. troops were discarded in landfills until 2008.","NEW: Defense official: ""We did not know whether these were human remains to begin with""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is training people to hack into its own computer networks. ""To beat a hacker, you need to think like one,"" said Jay Bavisi, co-founder and president of the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants, or EC-Council. His company was chosen by the Pentagon to oversee training of Department of Defense employees who work in computer security-related jobs and certify them when the training is complete. The Department of Defense does not consider this hacking. ""DoD personnel are not learning to hack. They are learning to defend the network against hackers,"" said spokesman Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh. But the EC-Council calls the program ""Certified Ethical Hacker certification."" The purpose of the training is to teach Defense Department employees to defend their computer network. Almost 45,000 attacks on Defense Department computers were reported in the first half of 2009, according to a government report. The report estimated that for all of 2009, the number of attacks would be up 60 percent from the previous year. Fending off the attacks costs the Pentagon about $100 million. Bavisi said the training focuses on teaching the art of hacking, using the same tools and tricks that traditional hackers use to break into computer networks. The basic concept is Defense Department employees would use the training to hack into the department's computers, Bavisi said. Once the ethical hackers find the vulnerabilities that unethical hackers could use to attack, they increase the security to remove the potential threat. He said they are like bodyguards for the Defense Department network. Their only goal is to defend the network, even if the means of doing so are similar to those used by cyberattackers, Bavisi said. This kind of training has been done before in the Defense Department on an ad hoc basis, said Bavisi. Now every Defense Department agency and unit is required to include hacker training as one option for employees involved in cybersecurity. EC-Council has 450 training partners that will handle standard ""ethical hacking"" training, which has been used by civilian agencies and private businesses for years. If a Defense Department agency wants its employees to focus on a particular type of hacker training, EC-Council will perform customized training. The training requires 40 hours of instruction and 4,500 pages of reading on the latest hacker techniques. Bavisi said that Defense Department employees who complete the training and certification will not be assigned to use their new knowledge to hack into privately owned or civilian computers. But he said that any kind of training, including ethical hacking, could be used for nefarious purposes. ""You can teach me to cut an apple with a knife, and I can turn around and stab you with the knife,"" Bavisi said. EC-Council will be paid a fee per student, between $450 to $2,500 depending on the extent of the training and certification. It won't be clear for months exactly how many students will be trained.","""Certified Ethical Hacker certification"" trains employees to defend computer network .

"Rear Adm. Anne Schuchat, MD, is assistant surgeon general at the U.S. Public Health Service and director at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Edwin Trevathan, MD, MPH, is director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC. This week, the world has come together to focus on a major public health issue that affects thousands of children and their families around the world -- autism. We've all heard the heartfelt and poignant stories of families affected by this disorder. As the nation's health protection agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is made up of dedicated professionals, including many who are parents and grandparents of children affected by autism. The CDC is working on many fronts when it comes to autism. We're currently conducting the largest study to investigate the potential causes of and risk factors for autism. This study, called the SEED study, looks at genetic, environmental and hormonal factors, as well as selected mercury exposures. We work across government and with private organizations and parent groups to plan the autism research agenda for the country. Further, given the importance of early identification and intervention, the CDC's ""Learn the Signs. Act Early"" campaign helps educate parents, health care providers and early educators about early warning signs of autism. And, of course, we strongly support the efforts of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and others to create a sound scientific basis for any promising treatments. One issue that continues to receive attention is whether vaccines somehow play a role in autism. When concerns emerged about the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and about thimerosal in vaccines, top scientists -- with the open-mindedness that characterizes good science -- planned and conducted the highest-quality, large-scale studies. No links to autism have been found. Recently, many parents have raised questions about the timing and number of vaccines. Most vaccines are given at an early age because that's simply when children are most vulnerable to infectious diseases and need the added protection. Although some may call it a ""one size fits all"" approach, the recommended vaccine schedule is flexible, and it does account for instances when a child should not receive a recommended vaccine or when a recommended vaccine should be delayed. Those decisions, however, are best made in consultation with the child's doctor, and parents shouldn't be reluctant to have such discussions. As science advances, we are able to protect children against more diseases than ever. Today, through immunizations given in the first two years of life, we can protect children from 16 diseases, preventing 33,000 deaths and 14 million illnesses per year. People do have questions about why certain ingredients are contained in vaccines. Some ingredients, like aluminum, help make the vaccines effective; others, like preservatives, prevent the growth of harmful germs in multidose vials. Read a fact sheet on vaccine additives . This week marked World Autism Awareness Day and was a reminder to all of us at the CDC that much work lies ahead in unraveling the mysteries around this disorder. As we move forward, we remind ourselves that the best way to find solutions is to work together and make autism prevention a research priority. We have to continue to support scientific investigations that examine a wide range of potential causes and treatments. We need to make early detection and intervention feasible for all children. Finally, above all else, we must advocate for the support that families and people with autism need in order for them to lead the healthiest and most productive lives possible.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Eric Holder was sworn in Tuesday as U.S. attorney general, becoming the first African-American to lead the Department of Justice on a permanent basis. Vice President Joe Biden swears in Eric Holder, left, as attorney general Tuesday at the Justice Department. Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office after reading the Justice Department's mission statement. ""There's no mention of politics in that statement. There's no mention of ideology,"" Biden said. ""And that's as it should be."" Loud cheers and long applause followed Holder's taking of the oath.  Watch Holder take the oath » . ""Nowhere but in this great country could a person like me or the president hope to achieve the positions we are now so fortunate to hold,"" Holder said. By a 75-21 vote, the U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed President Obama's nomination of Holder. Holder, 58, is a former federal prosecutor and served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration. He was briefly acting attorney general in early 2001. Holder takes over a Justice Department battered by a series of controversies during the Bush administration, from questions about how it laid legal groundwork for harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists to the firings of top federal prosecutors in several cities. ""There's a big job to do, and it's going to be Mr. Holder's duty to turn this department around and restore its credibility,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. During confirmation hearings, Republicans questioned his role in former President Bill Clinton's widely criticized last-minute pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich and questioned whether he would be independent of the White House. Holder had a testy exchange with the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican, Arlen Specter, who questioned Holder's ""fitness"" for the office. Holder shot back that Specter was ""getting close to the line in questioning my integrity,"" and Specter ultimately supported the nomination. But Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, cited the pardons and what he called Holder's insufficient support for gun rights in opposing the nomination. ""Mr. Holder is supportive of old ideas for gun control that have never made people safer at the expense of taking away their rights,"" Bunning said. All 21 of the ""no"" votes were Republicans, but more than a dozen GOP senators joined Democrats in confirming Holder. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Missouri, said Holder convinced him he would be ""looking forward to keeping the nation safe."" Bond, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, raised concerns that the administration would seek to prosecute U.S. officials involved in using what the Bush administration called ""alternative"" interrogation techniques, measures that critics said involved the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody. Holder unambiguously called the use of waterboarding against suspected terrorists a form of torture that violated the Geneva Conventions, but he has said that prosecuting intelligence officials who followed Justice Department guidance would be ""difficult."" Bond said that while Holder's answer focused on U.S. officials who were following the administration's legal advice, ""I told him, and I believe he understood, that trying to prosecute these lawyers or political leaders would generate a political firestorm.""","Eric Holder sworn in during Justice Department ceremony .

"London (CNN) -- There are few places in the world where you can see ancient statues, imperial European jewellery, masterpieces by Pieter Bruegel, paintings by Picasso and sculpture by Henry Moore all under one roof. But for a week starting Friday, you can see the finest examples of art from antiquity to the present day displayed at TEFAF, The European Fine Art Fair, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The highlights of this year's fair include a necklace once owned by Emperor Maximilian II's wife, an antique cabinet and mechanical organ playing Beethoven's ""Battle Symphony,"" a painting of the Madonna and Child once owned by Napoleon III and a representation of Marilyn Monroe's mouth in rubies and pearls by Salvador Dali. Now celebrating its 25th year, the fair remains one of the most important events on the annual art calendar. ""It doesn't compare to any of the other fairs"" said dealer Dino Tomasso, who is exhibiting at the fair for the first time this year with a showcase of Renaissance and Neo-Classical sculpture. ""It's talked about all year long, the quality is exceptional [and though] it's not the easiest place to have a fair, people travel from all over the world to come to it,"" he continued. Fabrizio Moretti, a dealer and expert in Italian Old Master paintings who is also on the board of trustees for the fair, said: ""The thing that [the fair organizers] really strive for is the quality, and a new buyer can buy with confidence."" His gallery, Moretti Fine Art, is exhibiting a 1715 terracotta figure of a lion, thought to be the model for a commemorative monument to Queen Anne of England, and a painting by Pascualino Veneto of the Madonna and Child that was once owned by France's Napoleon III. It is this high quality of objects that makes TEFAF such an important event for art lovers, said Titia Vellenga, a spokesperson for the fair. ""What has created the fair's reputation is primarily that from the beginning we had a very strict vetting procedure, which leads to dealers bringing pieces that are really exceptional and this in turn attracts the really serious collectors,"" she said. ""So when you have a spiral like this, it continues to attract really exceptional works of art,"" said Vellenga. Richard Knight, Christie's International Co-Chairman of Old Masters and 19th Century Art, was joint chairman of the fair for two years before moving on to Christie's and was responsible for helping to set up the vetting system. ""One of the things I was responsible for was deciding that we would have no exhibiting dealers on the vetting committee, which now comprises all museum professionals,"" he said. ""This is all designed to give confidence to the clients, who know that what they're going to buy will have been vetted by the most professional people in the market today,"" he continued. This comprehensive vetting system also helps insulate the fair from rumblings in the financial markets. ""One of the lovely things about the standard of the fair is that dealers vet themselves before they even go because they know that a fair that isn't of the highest standard is not frankly in this present market going to suit their best interests,"" said Knight. And exhibiting a broad range of fine arts and antiquities from across the world guarantees an international roster of clients. In 2011 alone, TEFAF drew over 70,000 visitors from 55 countries and the fair organizers are expecting to see more and more Chinese and Brazilian visitors to the fair in future. ""There is quite a positive mood in the art market,"" said Vellenga. ""People are still buying art and they see it as an alternative asset but they really want high quality and that's what they can find at TEFAF,"" she said.","TEFAF celebrates 25 years showcasing the best in fine art and antiquities .

"(CNN) -- Former New England Patriot player Aaron Hernandez was transported from his Massachusetts jail cell to a nearby hospital this weekend, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson. Hernandez spent less than a half hour Saturday afternoon at St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, Hodgson told CNN. Hodgson was unable to disclose why Hernandez was admitted to the hospital because of federal health privacy law, except to say that it was not caused by a fight, security issue or any other problem at the jail. Hernandez has since returned to Bristol County House of Correction, where he awaits a trial on first-degree murder charges in the June 2013 death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors allege Hernandez orchestrated the killing of Lloyd, whose body was found in a remote spot at an industrial park about a mile from the former Patriots player's home. He's also charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the July 2012 deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. The two were shot to death in what prosecutors described as an ambush as they drove on a Boston street following a ""chance encounter"" with Hernandez at a lounge. Hernandez may have been the shooter in that incident, according to court documents. He has pleaded not guilty in all three killings. Hernandez played tight end for the New England Patriots for three seasons after leaving Florida for the 2010 NFL draft. The Patriots dropped Hernandez the day he was arrested in Lloyd's death.

"(CNN) -- Craig Hutto lost his right leg in a shark attack when he was 16 years old. Soon after that he became one of the first people to test out a new prosthetic leg created at Vanderbilt University. Researchers there have developed the first fully robotic artificial leg for above-knee amputees. The ""bionic leg,"" as it is called, uses a variety of sensors and motors that replicate muscle and joint movement in a healthy limb. This mechanism creates a more natural stride and allows users to do things that are not possible with normal prosthesis, such as run or go up and down steps and inclines in a natural way. While we're not quite at the point of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" bionics, exoskeleton technology is starting to show real promise in helping people with disabilities.

"(CNN)  -- In the aftermath of the 42-year rule of Moammar Gadhafi, the world is left wondering whether the bloodiest conflict in the popular unrest that has swept the Arab World will signal the rise of democracy in Libya or a descent into chaos. A group of economists is proposing one solution to help a strong Libya emerge from the smoldering ruins of civil war: Give all Libyans direct annual payments from oil revenue. Call it the 'Alaska solution.' ""In 1982 then-governor Jay Hammond of Alaska said, 'Look, there is no check or balance on our use (of state oil revenue),"" said Todd Moss, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. Hammond started a program to give residents annual checks from the state's petroleum fund. ""That held Hammond and all his successors into account."" Libya is a textbook example, Moss said, of what is known as the ""resource curse"" - countries whose economies depend on oil, gas or other natural resource exports. It's sometimes known as ""the paradox of plenty"" - rather than create an economic boom, export cash from resource-rich nations often flows directly to corrupt leaders while most the population doesn't share in the wealth. How to handle a sudden burst in commodity wealth is an issue that echoes around the globe, from the huge copper and coal mines plumbed in Mongolia, to the offshore gas fields in Ghana and vast tracts of lithium deposits in the Andes Mountains of Bolivia. ""Of course you have corruption, but I think the key thing about understanding how the resource curse works is it impedes economic and political development,"" said Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington. Resource curse in the Arab World . Research shows the more a nation's economy is dependent on export of natural resources, the less that nation's economy is likely to grow, says Ragnar Torvik, an economist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. ""But it's a chicken and the egg question- is it natural resources that cause this low growth, or some bad economic and political conditions as a result of just specializing in natural resources?"" Torvik said. The unrest in the Arab world demonstrates the resource curse at play. ""Why was the population (of Libya) not able to get rid of Gadhafi by their own, as they did in Egypt and Tunisia? One likely part of the answer is that the oil revenues in Libya is much more important than in Tunisia and Egypt, which gives the ruler a much wider menu of political choices to fight the democratic demands from the population,"" Torvik said. ""And why was the response in Saudi Arabia to hand out large sums of cash to the people? Presumably this was not because suddenly that they cared more about the people - the more likely answer is that this was a move to maintain political power and avoid demands for democracy,"" Torvik said. ""So I think indeed the varieties of experience in the Middle East in the last months have much to do with oil revenues."" Major natural resources aren't necessarily a national curse. A recent survey of the 10 most livable cities by the Economist Intelligence Unit is dominated by cities in Canada and Australia - nations that both have booming commodities exports. While sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria and Congo have had moribund economic growth despite resource riches, diamond-rich Botswana is the fastest growing economy in Africa. ""Here in Norway we are one of the largest oil and gas exporters in the world; I can observe that in Nigeria oil has been bad, but in Norway it is good,"" Torvik said. A key difference between nations that do well with natural resources and those that are ""cursed"" depends on the strength of government institutions before nations strike underground wealth, economists say. Botswana is one of the few sub-Saharan nations with a parliamentary system of government. Norway had 200 years of democracy before its off-shore oil industry took off in the 1970s. Instead of giving direct payments to citizens, Norway has plowed all its oil revenues into a public fund for use in education or other public works. ""We use 4% of the fund every year, the ambition is you don't eat the principal but live off the interest,"" Torvik said. Mongolia grapples with 'curse' On the steppes of Mongolia, the land of Genghis Khan has released a horde of coal and copper in recent years, causing an economic explosion in this landlocked nation in Central Asia. But worries are rising with its national coffers, Mongolian Prime Minister Sukhbaatar Batbold said. ""We talk a lot these days, and especially the last couple years, about the resource curse,"" Batbold told CNN. ""We have seen the Norwegian experience of sharing the benefit with the people. We have seen the Chilean stability fund, we have seen Canadian and Alaskan model,"" Batbold said. ""We should not reinvent the wheel, we should better learn and copy from good successes."" For example, Mongolia is using mining revenues to finance child cash benefits. Each Mongolian citizen will receive 536 shares from the privatization of the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine in southern Mongolia. ""Hopefully, the people will appreciate that they are responsible for an investment in their own future and that they will learn how to treat those shares and use them for benefit for themselves and their children in the future, rather than just selling them,"" said Bill Gorman, president of the Mongolian Stock Exchange. Yet the challenges are stark for Mongolia, which has only has 20 years of democracy. The nation ranks 116th out of 187 nations in the 2010 Transparency International corruption perceptions. One-third of Mongolia's 2.8 million people live below the poverty line. Corruption ""is an enormous problem, but one of things we're hoping to do with our partnership with the London Stock Exchange is to make certain the listed companies have proper transparency and management,"" said Gorman of the Mongolian Stock Exchange. Are taxes the solution? Giving direct payments to Libyans, Subramanian and Moss argue, is a way for a new government in Tripoli to foster closer economic ties with its citizens - through taxes. Taxes create an incentive for the government to make broad improvements across the economy to increase government revenues. And, as the Tea Party phenomenon in the U.S. shows, taxes create a populace that is deeply interested in how government spends its cash. ""They are going to watch the government like a hawk,"" Moss said. ""If one year people get a $500 check (from oil revenues) and the next year they get $400, they're going to wonder why."" ""People think (an oil find) is Manna from heaven, so you don't need to tax,"" Subramanian says. ""But that severs that two-way relationship between the governed and those who are governed."" Two practical problems to giving away oil cash: Convincing leaders it's in their best interests, and the modalities of getting that cash to citizens. ""The latter is actually the easiest ... there's been a lot of advances in biometrics, such as iris scanning and fingerprinting, along with e-banking through cell phones,"" Moss said. Trying to talk leaders in resource-rich countries to give it away, however, is another matter. Both Moss and Subramanian have approached leaders in Ghana and Nigeria, respectively, to distribute it - both were rebuffed. Still, a new government in Libya could have a unique ""constitutional moment"" to allow its oil profits to flow directly to the populace, Subramanian said. ""Libya is a country that has had virtually no political development for nearly 50 years,"" he said. Adds Moss: ""When you have a moment of transition, there's a lot of uncertainty - that's a moment you can lock into a certain kind of path you may not find for another generation.""

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Religious groups in India have warned they will oppose any move to legalize homosexuality as the federal government prepares to hold talks on a law that classifies same-sex acts as crimes. An Indian gay activist participates in a gay pride march in Bangalore on Sunday. India's Hindu nationalist main opposition has in the meantime called for a national debate on the legislation that law minister M. Veerappa Moily last week said would come up for a discussion within the government. ""This is a sensitive issue and warrants a debate within the Indian society at large before arriving at any decision,"" said Sidharth Nath Singh, spokesman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. An Indian court is due to give its judgment on a petition filed by a nonprofit group that has challenged the anti-gay provision of the penal code. In a news conference last week, Moily refused to spell out his government's stand on it because it awaits judicial determination. But his comments that the federal home minister was ""contemplating"" a meeting with his Cabinet colleagues on the law drew widespread coverage in the largely conservative country. ""Hope floats at rainbow parades,"" read a caption on a front-page picture from a gay parade in New Delhi in Monday's Times of India newspaper. Participants in that march demanded repeal of Section 377 of the penal code, which criminalizes private consensual sex between adults of the same gender in the country.  Watch a New Delhi  march in support of gay rights » . Religious leaders, however, oppose any suggestion to scrap 377, describing homosexuality as ""unnatural."" ""We are against calling homosexuality a criminal activity, but we are certainly in principle against legalizing it, because that would mean the state endorsing same-sex relationships,"" said Babu Joseph, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India. Homosexuality ""violates fundamental norms of a family,"" he said. In his remarks, Kamal Faruqui of India's Muslim Personal Law Board outlined what he said was Islam's position on same-sex unions. ""Islam is totally against it. Islam does not allow any unnatural act. No Muslim in the world, let alone India, can ever support it,"" Faruqui said.

"New York (CNN) -- Long Island native Louis DiLeo began his music career as a child. As an adult, he spends his days blowing the same sad song: taps. As the sole bugler for the southern region of New York's Military Forces Honor Guard -- part of the state National Guard -- DiLeo travels five days a week from cemetery to cemetery, playing at funerals of military servicemen and women and veterans. He started three years ago and hasn't missed a day since. For DiLeo, playing taps at the funerals of men and women who served the country holds significant meaning. ""It's an honor and a privilege to help bring closure to a family and help honor the veterans who have paid a price for me to be able to enjoy the fruits of this country,"" he said. ""To come out everyday and play taps and say thank you is a very small price."" Taps has been played at military funerals since some time during the Civil War, according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. It was written by Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in July 1862 as a revision to the bugle call signaling ""lights out,"" which Butterfield felt was too formal to note the day's end. By 1891, Army regulations required taps to be played at military funerals. Aware that there was a shortage of buglers because of the large number of funerals a day, DiLeo contacted the military about bugling after he attended his godfather's funeral, where a recording of taps was played. About 1,800 veterans die each day, most of them from World War II, according to the VA. Because the military cannot provide enough buglers to play at such a large number of funerals, Congress passed a law in 2000 to allow a recorded version to be played. DiLeo said he has made it his mission to eliminate the recording -- and honor the families and service of veterans -- by playing taps at as many funerals he can attend. The most he's ever done in one day is 26. ""Every veteran has the right to get military honors, and taps, in my opinion, should be played live as opposed to having a recording,"" DiLeo said. His passion seems to have struck a chord with veterans and other honor guard members. ""Hearing it live sends a more heartfelt symbol that we actually do care about that soldier, that we're actually there for him,"" said Spc. Orville Porter of the New York honor guard. ""With Mr. DiLeo, you hear the feeling, you hear every note. With a recording, it's just very bland."" For a professional trumpet player like DiLeo, taps is technically an easy song to play. ""It's sort of like asking a concert pianist to play 'Chopsticks,' "" he said. ""But at the time it needs to be played, when emotions are running high, it's probably one of the most difficult things to play."" Very often, DiLeo hears sobs or wails from people at the funeral while he's playing; he's even seen widows collapse as he's sounded his first note. To get through it, he tries to only concentrate on the music. ""A lot of times, I have to close my eyes and just pay attention to what I'm doing and just think of it musically, because if I get too emotionally involved in it, I could get to the point where I couldn't play,"" DiLeo said. DiLeo has played his bugle for more than 3,000 veterans and active duty servicemen and women and has no plans to stop. ""Doing this is a great honor, and I plan to do it for as long as I can and for as long as they'll have me.""","Long Island bugler plays taps at as many military funerals as he can attend .

"(CNN) -- New Mexico's Berrendo Middle School reopened its doors two days after a preteen with a sawed-off shotgun opened fire in a crowded gymnasium. Police are still investigating the shooting that left two students seriously injured and the suspected shooter in custody. As students and teachers trickled back to school Thursday, the community turned out to show support. Crowds lined up on the road near the campus, cheering as the school buses appeared. They waved flags, and black and gold streamers. They held up signs with the words ""Love,"" ""Hope,"" ""Faith,"" and ""Courage."" Gov. Susana Martinez greeted the students as well. ""They have a counselor in every single classroom,"" Martinez told CNN affiliate KOAT. ""There are people here supporting them in everything they need."" She said both the children and their teachers needed counseling. For many parents, bringing their kids to school Thursday was not an easy decision. Some said it was happening too soon, but others said their kids needed to return. ""I told her last night she didn't have to go if she didn't feel like she wanted to, and she said, 'well, I can't be scared to go to school,' is what she told me this morning,"" Florence Dosher Nieto told CNN affiliate KRQE. Another parent said she is looking into home schooling. The attack has rattled residents of Roswell, a city about 200 miles southeast of Albuquerque. It is the latest community in the United States to go from a relatively peaceful enclave to a site of a school shooting, joining places like Littleton, Colorado, Paducah, Kentucky, and Newtown, Connecticut. Tuesday's incident is also the second one at a middle school in the last three months. In October, a 12-year-old in Nevada opened fire with a handgun he took from his parents, killing a teacher and wounding two students before he eventually killed himself. Three shells and a plan . Police say the 12-year-old shooting suspect entered his middle school Tuesday morning with a 20-gauge pump shotgun that he had sawed off. He shot three rounds. The first shot hit the ceiling, said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. The second went into the gym floor. The third sped toward the stands where, about 12 to 15 feet away, it hit two students who had been waiting with others for classes to start. ""We did find evidence that the suspect had planned this event,"" Kassetas said. ""I can't discuss the particulars as to why."" He said the victims were targeted at random. Police have carried out three search warrants and interviewed more than 60 people, Kassetas said. The boy faces three counts of aggravated battery, according to New Mexico state juvenile court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KOAT. The suspect's parents, Jim and Jennifer Campbell, and grandparents, Robert and Nancy Bowles, issued a statement Wednesday saying they are ""praying that God will be with everyone who has been affected."" They didn't try to explain the shooter's actions, which left ""his whole family ... heartbroken,"" though they didn't ignore his impact. ""For all of the anguish that many suffered yesterday,"" his parents and grandparents said, ""our family offers our heartfelt condolences and remorse in words that we cannot fully express."" The family singled out the two hospitalized victims. Victims still recovering . The victims were both taken to University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas -- about 175 miles east of the school . A 12-year-old boy is in critical condition with injuries to the side of his face and neck, according to Martinez, the governor. He has undergone at least two surgeries since the incident. The other victim, 13-year-old Kendal Sanders, is in stable condition. Police: Suspect took parents' gun . The suspect is being held at an unspecified location in Albuquerque and has met with his parents, Kassetas said. In their statement, the parents indicated a judge ""ordered ... our son receive an evaluation and mental health treatment and sincerely want him to receive all of the help that he needs."" ""As a family we will cooperate in all ways with law enforcement to piece together how this awful tragedy occurred,"" they said. Kassetas said the shotgun came from the suspect's home. His father had bought the gun -- the only one of several weapons in the house not locked in a safe -- at a Walmart, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. Authorities believe the 12-year-old ""modified the weapon by cutting off the stock,"" Kassetas said. The search warrants executed in connection with the investigation were on the suspect's locker, his duffel bag and his Roswell home. The law enforcement source said the suspect kept a handwritten journal at home describing ""what he was planning, what he wanted to do."" But just before he fired, authorities believe, the suspect gave ""preliminary warnings ... to some select students who he ran into before he entered the gymnasium,"" Kassetas said. 'Hero' teacher . Teacher John Masterson didn't know the shooter had used all his ammunition when he walked to the student and persuaded him to put the gun down, Martinez said. ""Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ... who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him,"" the governor said at a vigil Tuesday evening, ""and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt."" The Berrendo staff directory lists John Masterson as an eighth-grade social studies teacher. Masterson has taught at the school for a decade and coaches track and soccer, according to the Albuquerque Journal. When contacted by the newspaper, he said police had told him not to discuss details of the shooting. ""It was a harrowing experience,"" he told the paper.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- At least 17 children and 14 women had been killed as of midafternoon July 20, in the 24 hours since Israeli forces had launched ground operations in the al-Sheja'iya neighborhood of Gaza City, the United Nations reported. Those numbers will rise: Many bodies are still in the rubble. Ambulances came under attack and couldn't reach the wounded, witnesses said, and survivors fleeing tank shells and airstrikes didn't know how many of their relatives had been killed. At around that time, George Stephanopoulos of ABC's ""This Week"" asked U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for his response to Palestinian statements accusing Israel of committing ""a massacre and a war crime"" in Sheja'iya. ""That's rhetoric that we've heard many, many times,"" he answered. ""What they need to do is stop rocketing Israel and accept a cease-fire."" Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups do indeed need to stop rocketing Israeli population centers. Rockets killed an Israeli Bedouin man and wounded his wife and children on July 19, and badly injured two girls last week. Such strikes using inherently indiscriminate rockets violate the laws of war. But the ""they"" Kerry referred to are the warring parties, not the civilians. The message Israel needs to hear from its most important ally is not that ""War is ugly, and bad things are going to happen,"" as Kerry put it.  A more meaningful assessment is the one Kerry shared, with apparent irony, with an aide when he mistakenly thought he was off-mic on Fox News: ""It's a hell of a pinpoint operation."" The 17 chronically ill, elderly and paralyzed patients in the Wafa Rehabilitation Center, in Sheja'iya, can tell you it's no pinpoint operation, if that is supposed to mean that civilian structures are being spared. Israeli forces hit the hospital at least three times from July 11 to 17, with missiles and tank rounds. Amid these attacks, the Israeli military warned hospital staff to evacuate. But, the hospital director said, ""There is no other hospital in Gaza equipped for our patients."" They finally evacuated under fire on the night of July 17. The electricity was cut off, patients lost their oxygen supply, attacks started a fire on the upper floors, and nurses, coughing in the smoke, carried patients -- none of them mobile -- downstairs and into ambulances. The Israeli military has variously claimed that rockets were stored or launched from areas near the hospital, but not that the hospital was used for enemy military operations harmful to its own forces. The fact that Israel, using accurate guided missiles and direct tank fire, struck the hospital over several days, suggests intentional or reckless attacks on the hospital, which are war crimes. Palestinian fighters are among the dead in Gaza. And not all civilian casualties are the product of violations of the laws of war. Palestinian armed groups also unnecessarily put civilians at risk by deploying near crowded apartments or, as in two known incidents, storing rockets in empty schools. But under the laws of war, civilians who do not join in the fight are always to be protected. It's good that Israeli forces often give warnings, but that doesn't give Israel legal license to attack civilians left behind or to proceed with little concern for their welfare. Nor can it assume that anyone left in a ""warned"" area is a fighter, because there are many reasons, from infirmity to fear to having no place to go, why civilians don't heed warnings to flee. One crucial element in any lawful attack is that it is directed at a reasonably certain military target. But in a number of airstrikes before the ground invasion that Human Rights Watch investigated, we found no evidence of a lawful military objective. There was none evident at the Fun Time Beach cafÃ©, where an Israeli attack on July 11 killed nine civilians, including two boys, who had gathered to watch the World Cup. The four boys killed and three wounded by Israeli strikes near the Deira Hotel, on the Gaza City beachfront, were not lawful military targets. The military said it was targeting a terrorist in the beach cafÃ©, but didn't supply a name or other information to back the claim, or explain why it had to kill that unidentified person when he was surrounded by civilians. And it said it had mistaken the boys wounded in the latter attack for ""fleeing fighters,"" even though anyone would flee a building being attacked. These are not tragic accidents. They fit an apparent pattern of shooting first, determining whether there was a lawful target later. The policy of the United States in response is inadequate. On July 21, Kerry announced that the United States is ""providing $47 million to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza."" These funds are desperately needed. But nothing has been said about curbing the killing of civilians, addressing the years of impunity for such grave violations of the laws of war, much less suspending transfers of military materiel that Israel has been using to commit what we find to be illegal acts. Dismal as Israel's record is in prosecuting war crimes, Hamas has prosecuted no one. West Bank Palestinian leaders have intimated they may seek access to the International Criminal Court, which would then have jurisdiction over indiscriminate rocket attacks from Gaza as well as unlawful Israeli airstrikes, insofar as Israeli and Palestinian authorities refused to prosecute their own. Closing the accountability gap could help deter attacks on civilians, but the United States, which has long blocked international accountability for Israeli violations, steadfastly opposes the Palestinian move. It is long past time to reverse that position. What is Israel's endgame in Gaza?","Human Rights Watch says some Israeli airstrikes had no lawful military objective .

"LONDON, England -- A new tool that allows doctors to use laser surgery in complex operations has been hailed as a breakthrough in minimally invasive laser technology. This fiber optic tool is made from the perfect mirror, making it possible to reflect CO2 lasers for the first time. Originally designed as a military tool for the United States Department of Defense (DOD), the fiber-optic invention is revolutionizing the ways surgeons carry out brain surgeries. The ""Omni directional dielectric mirror"" was created by Professor Yoel Fink, a then-29-year-old student in Material Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1995. ""I was asked to participate in a project funded by the DOD to create the perfect mirror,"" Fink told CNN. ""The perfect mirror reflects light from all angles and does not absorb any of it. It could have been used, for example, to reflect back enemy laser beams,"" he continued . DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a subsection of the DOD, specialize in technologies they believe are about 25 years away from being realized and try to make them happen in five years' time. But they didn't have a long wait before they found their perfect mirror. ""To my own surprise, I found the answer during the very first meeting. I thought everyone would laugh at my suggestion, so I waited until the last two minutes to talk and after I did, the room just fell silent,"" Fink, a former commander in the Israeli army, told CNN. He found that by taking two materials with different optical properties (one being a semi-conducting glass and one being a polymer) and stacking these two up in very tight and ultra thin layers, around 1 micron each (1/1000 of a millimeter), they create an omni-reflector. The most important part of his discovery, however, was that by changing only the thickness and distance of the layers, the ""perfect mirror"" could reflect any type of electromagnetic energy in any wavelength. This meant Fink's invention was useful not only in the military and telecommunications field, but could also be used in minimally invasive laser surgery -- the use of lasers rather than scalpels to operate on everything from tumors, deafness and spine injuries. This type of surgery is known to reduce recovery time, the likelihood of complications and incision size. In many cases, patients also spend less time ""under the knife."" Fink then set about creating a pen-shaped fiber-optic tool that could allow surgeons to easily manipulate the laser and bend it to reach almost any tissue in the body. The results, according to some surgeons who have used it, are astonishing. Dr. Stanley Shapshay, a renowned American Ear Nose and Throat surgeon and former president of the Triological Society told CNN: ""When Yoel first called me to show me his fiber-optic tool made out of this perfect mirror, I was very skeptical as I had seen many unsuccessful trials."" ""But as soon as we did the first tests, I was simply blown away,"" he added. Dr. Shapshay has now performed over 100 operations with the ""perfect mirror laser"" and says he finds it almost easier to use than a scalpel. Dr. Bendok, a senior neurosurgeon at Northwestern University in the United States, along with his partner, otolaryngologist Dr Andrew Fishman, also rave about the benefit of the fiber optic tool in minimally invasive surgery. In a recent case, Dr. Bendok's patient had a tumor at the base of the brain, a tumor that could have been more difficult and dangerous to remove without Fink's device. ""Using the scalpel could have caused a stroke,"" Dr. Fishman told CNN. ""Instead we used CO2 laser to melt the tumor and then shave it off."" The whole operation took less than an hour and the patient recovered in only three days. According to Dr. Shapshay, the perfect mirror is also an important development because, for years, doctors were able to treat patients with lasers in only limited circumstances and with many complications. Until the ""perfect mirror"" came along there were no fibers that could transport the safer CO2 lasers. Surgeons had to shoot the laser beam directly from its large generator and could do so only at a straight angle, rendering it impossible to reach deeper tissues. ""At the time, CO2 lasers were like the perfect weapon for soldiers, but one that also happened to weigh five tons. They were very cumbersome,"" says Dr. Shapshay. The surgeons believe laser technology will now become more widespread with the avenue of this tool that is ""easy and intuitive to use."" Next on Fink's to-do list is to take his fibers worldwide, especially in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. His company, Omni Guide, aims to expand the tool globally: most clinics using it are currently in the United States. ""I hope it can help patients around the world,"" he said.","Perfect Mirror is used to simplify and expand use of minimally invasive laser surgery .

"(CNN) -- In a time of global political combustion, with calls for democracy sparking mass demonstrations, self-immolations and civil wars, the women of the small African country of Togo might be the first to try to bring down a dictator by staging a sex strike. The women, along with many men in Togo, have had enough of one-family rule. President Faure Gnassingbe took the presidency in 2005, shortly after the death of his father, who had held power for 38 years. The country has maintained a thin democratic faÃ§ade, holding regular elections, but between father and son, the family has not relinquished power in four decades. Opposition protests demanding changes to the electoral law ahead of the next elections have resulted in clashes with security forces and mass arrests. So on Saturday, in front of thousands of people at a rally in the capital of Lome, the female members of the opposition group Let's Save Togo announced the deployment of their new weapon. Isabelle Ameganvi, head of the women's wing of the group, called on all Togolese women to ""keep the gate of your 'motherland' locked up"" for a week. If all goes according to plan, this is the week during which Togo's men are having time to think about the motherland and about their yearning for, well, democracy. Organizers of the sex strike say they want to bring about the release of prisoners, and they want to motivate the men to take action against Gnassingbe. Ultimately, they want to see a true democratic change and the president to step down. The idea of using sex for political objectives is not new. Women, who throughout history have found themselves at a disadvantage with men holding most of the power, have long known that men have a special vulnerability when it comes to sex. Withholding sex has been used to achieve political goals before. As with every occasion when women have resorted to this tactic, the decision was reached after profound frustration with other methods. And it is a sign that women's power remains very limited that their best strategy is to pressure men to take action. Some women say this tactic harms women by emphasizing their sexuality rather than their humanity. But Togo's activists say they are using their power wherever they can find it. The idea of a sex strike has a history that goes all the way back to ancient Greece. In the play ""Lysistrata,"" the women of Athens, fed up with the men's endless wars, decide to stop having sex with them until they put an end to the Pelopponesian War. The comedy was performed before Athenian audiences exactly 2,500 years ago. Interestingly, in the play by Aristophanes, the women do more than withhold sex. They also take over the Parthenon, where the city holds the treasury that funds the war, and they fight to hold on. It may take more than sex to persuade men to do the right thing, but ""Lysistrata""-inspired actions have an illustrious and possibly successful track record. In the countless times when women have launched sex strikes, it's impossible to know whether it was the lack of sex that ultimately produced the desired outcomes, because by the time women opted to brandish this weapon, they had tried many other ways. And it is also impossible to know just how thoroughly each strike was implemented. Or how many men resorted to sexual violence to break the strike. Still, there are some interesting examples of women achieving their objectives -- which, incidentally, always seem to benefit society at large, not just women -- after the sex strike was called. Whether one thing produced the other is a subject of debate. The clearest case of success took place in the Colombian town of Barbacoas, where last year women launched their ""crossed legs strike"" to demand construction of a road. They would not have sex, they vowed, until the men managed to get a road built so that it wouldn't take 10 hours to reach the provincial capital just 35 miles away. Moved by the men's unimaginable suffering, the government agreed to build the road. A few years earlier, also in Colombia, the wives and girlfriends of gang members in the embattled city of Pereira said they would keep their legs crossed unless the men stopped the violence that had killed nearly 500 people. The murder rate reportedly dropped by 26.5%. But it wasn't ancient Greece or South America or a recent sex strike in the Philippines that inspired the Togolese pro-democracy activists. It was the amazing story of Liberia that gave them cause for optimism. In 2003, the Liberian people had endured 14 years of a brutal civil war that had torn the country apart. The leaders of the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace organized a series of nonviolent actions, including a sex strike, demanding an end to the war. The group's leader, Leymah Gbowe, later won the Nobel Peace Prize, sharing with Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, another Liberian woman who was about to make history. Again, nobody knows just how important a role the no-sex portion of the protests played. But before the year was over, the parties to the conflict signed a peace deal ending the war and laying the groundwork for democratic elections. When Liberians went to the polls, the majority voted for Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman elected president in Africa's history. Now that is a success story, because once women hold real political power, they no longer need to resort to sex strikes and other indirect means to express their views and obtain results. In the end, it's about giving all citizens, including women, a fair say in the political process. That's the ultimate goal in the struggle for true democracy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Activist women of Togo are withholding sex to get men to take action against dictator .

"(CNN) -- The creators of the ""Call of Duty"" video game franchise on Monday filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who says the 2012 video game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" has damaged his reputation. Noriega, 80, is serving a prison sentence in Panama after being convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering and killing political opponents. Creators of the video game called the lawsuit ""frivolous"" and filed the motion to dismiss it on the ground that Noriega's portrayal in the game is protected by the First Amendment. ""What's astonishing is that Manuel Noriega, a notorious dictator who is in prison for the heinous crimes he committed, is upset about being portrayed as a criminal and enemy of the state in the game Call of Duty. Quite simply, it's absurd,"" said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, attorney for the video game creator, Activision Blizzard Inc. ""This is a notorious dictator who's attacking the freedom of speech rights of an American company,"" Giuliani told CNN. Noriega, 80, filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in July. In it, he argues that his portrayal ""as a kidnapper, murderer and enemy of the state"" in the 2012 video game damaged his reputation. The company used his image and name in order to make money, the lawsuit says; therefore, he's entitled to a share of the profits. Manuel Noriega sues over 'Call of Duty' video game . ""Plaintiff was portrayed as an antagonist as the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes, creating the false impression that defendants are authorized to use plaintiff's image and likeness,"" the lawsuit says. The video game includes historical footage and several real-life characters in Cold War scenarios, including former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. But while North did his own voiceover for the game and acted as an adviser, Noriega said in the July lawsuit that he wasn't consulted -- or compensated -- for the use of his likeness. ""Call of Duty"" video games take storylines from current headlines, and its characters are based on historical figures, from former Cuban leader Fidel Castro to David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director. Giuliani called Noriega's lawsuit ""an assault on a whole art form -- historical fiction."" ""If this were allowed, it would be like (former al Qaeda leader Osama) bin Laden's family suing for 'Zero Dark Thirty,' "" Giuliani said. ""Obviously that shouldn't be allowed."" For almost two decades, Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, the key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas. Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of the Central American nation in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. 12 more real people who appeared in video games . Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He surrendered in January 1990 and was escorted to the United States for civilian trial. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes and served nearly two decades in prison. In 2010, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million) through banks there. He was ordered to pay the money back. In Panama, where he was convicted of killing political opponents, he has been hospitalized several times since he returned in 2011 to serve out his prison sentence. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Stella Chan and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Activision Blizzard has filed a motion to dismiss Manuel Noriega's lawsuit .

"(CNN) -- Federal accident investigators Tuesday pinned blame for a 2013 UPS cargo plane crash in Alabama squarely on the pilots, but some members saved caustic criticism for UPS, saying the company could have taken steps to prevent the deadly crash. ""Yes, the pilots flew the airplane into the ground, there's no question,"" said National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt, a former airline pilot. Though the NTSB did not blame UPS in its formal report, Sumwalt pointedly told cargo company representatives: ""You have got problems. Get them cleaned up."" In a three-hour meeting in Washington, the NTSB cited a litany of errors the pilots made: The captain failed to correctly program an aircraft computer, failed to monitor the plane's altitude, didn't relay important information to his co-pilot, and failed to abort the landing when it became apparent the plane was in trouble. The first officer, meanwhile, failed to communicate altitudes to the pilot as the plane approached Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. In a conversation captured on the plane's cockpit voice recorder, the co-pilot also confessed to being fatigued, evidently after failing to use her off-duty time to get appropriate rest. Both pilots died in the pre-dawn incident August 13, 2013, when the Airbus A300-600 crashed a short distance from the Birmingham runway. But Sumwalt said UPS also failed to take actions that could have prevented the crash. The global delivery company did not update software on a ground proximity warning system, which could have given the crew an earlier indication they were too close to the ground, he said. If UPS officials had an iPhone, ""I guarantee they would keep their software up to date,"" yet they failed to update software on a plane carrying two of its employees, he said. A UPS official called Sumwalt's claim ""the speculative opinion of one member,"" saying the company's software met FAA standards, and that there is no evidence the upgrade would have prevented the accident. ""Based on the rate of descent of this particular aircraft, it would be impossible to determine whether a software upgrade would have made a difference,"" Capt. Houston Mills, UPS director of airline safety, told CNN. He noted that the NTSB does not cite the software in its official finding. Sumwalt said the cargo carrier also did not provide all of the available weather information to the pilots. As a result, the pilots likely expected to see the airport after descending below clouds at 1,000 feet, but didn't clear the clouds until 350 feet. ""Everything UPS does is about efficiency. They have guys running around with clipboards and stopwatches to make sure if an airplane is a minute late, someone will be held accountable for it. But the sad thing here -- this (technology) could have possibly prevented this accident."" ""If you're interested in efficiency, I can guarantee you on August 14 of last year, those packages on the airplanes did not get delivered by 10:30 in the morning,"" Sumwalt said. UPS' Mills acknowleged that known information about the cloud ceiling was not relayed to the pilots. But, he said, the pilots had been given a forecast that included a variable cloud ceiling, giving the pilots enough to plan and execute their approach. NTSB: No distress call prior to UPS cargo plane crash in Alabama . The board said the captain did not have a stabilized approach -- meaning the plane's speed, direction and descent were not within established standards -- in the final minutes. It was the same problem that led to the 2013 crash of an Asiana jetliner in San Francisco. ""An unstabilized approach is a less safe approach,"" said NTSB Acting Chairman Christopher A. Hart. ""When an approach is unstable, there is no shame in playing it safe by going around and trying again."" The U.S. aviation industry has closely watched the UPS crash investigation largely because it highlights different FAA standards for commercial and cargo aircraft. In January of this year, the FAA required additional rest hours for commercial pilots, but it exempted cargo pilots. Cargo pilots say rest rules should be uniform, regardless of the type of aircraft flown. Wednesday, the NTSB concluded the pilots of Flight 1354 had been given an adequate opportunity to rest, even under the rule that applies to commercial pilots. The rule did not make a difference in this case, the board said. UPS pilots complained of fatigue before fatal crash . Asked if the UPS culture encourages pilots to call in fatigued when they are tired, 91% ""strongly disagreed"" or ""somewhat disagreed,"" according to a survey conducted in March by the Independent Pilots Association, a union that represents UPS pilots. ""You probably have some bias in here as it was issued by a (union),"" Sumwalt said. ""But when you have 2,202 people responding to that, they are trying to tell you something."" UPS spokesman Malcolm Berkley said the union was ""politicizing"" the investigation in an effort to change pilot work hours. UPS pilots typically work 70 hours a month -- 30 in the air, Berkley said, less than the 55 hours the typical commercial pilot flies. The safety board approved more than 20 recommendations, including one that board member Mark Rosekind called ""ground-breaking"" that would require warnings about flying fatigued during pre-flight briefings on overnight flights.","In 3-hour meeting, NTSB cites a litany of errors the pilots made .

"(CNN) -- After fighting back persistent rumors of a breakup, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have officially ended their engagement, a rep for actor Hemsworth confirmed.

The ""Wrecking Ball"" singer met Hemsworth on the set of 2010's ""The Last Song,"" and although they had a bumpy relationship pre-engagement, both sounded content. ""She makes me really happy,"" Hemsworth shared with Details magazine in February 2012. Months later, Cyrus was ""looking forward to a life of happiness"" with the ""Hunger Games"" star. But according to People magazine, which first reported the scrapped engagement plans, lately Cyrus has had ""more breakups than bonding moments"" with Hemsworth. While Cyrus has remained tight-lipped about their romance, the writing seemed to be on her Twitter wall. A few hawk-eyed observers caught on this weekend that Cyrus has stopped following Hemsworth on the social media site. It's unclear what the status of their relationship is now that they're no longer engaged, and reps have declined to comment further. What is clear is that both stars have a busy fall ahead.

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. Navy SEAL commando, motivational speaker and frequent guest on national news shows is accused of lying to investigators about the circumstances of a shooting at an Ohio mall, police said Thursday. Christopher Mark Heben's website, sealteamconsulting.com, says he ""emerged as the media's most featured Special Operations subject matter expert "" after U.S. forces killed terrorist Osama bin Laden in 2011. Heben has appeared on numerous news outlets, including CNN, to speak about special operations and other subjects. But it was Haben's story of being wounded by gunfire during a verbal altercation in the parking lot of an Ohio mall on March 28 that catapulted him onto the national stage. Heben is to be arraigned later this month on two misdemeanor counts of falsification and obstructing official business, Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely said. ""We could not corroborate his story,"" McNeely told CNN affiliate WKYC. ""The more we looked into it the more evidence we gathered that he was not telling the truth."" Heben reported being shot during a parking lot altercation. But detectives determined the shooting did not occur at the mall, police said, without elaborating. Calls seeking comment from Heben and his lawyer, Kerry O'Brien, were not returned Thursday. At the time of the shooting, Heben said the suspects fled in a gray sports car, WKYC reported. McNeely said officers checked between six and 12 surveillance cameras in the area and could not confirm his account, WKYC reported. Heben allowed police access to his registered gun and the bullet that struck him didn't match his weapon, McNeely said. Investigators do not have a theory on how Heben was injured, police said. On Heben's Facebook page, which describes him as a former ""U.S. Navy SEAL turned Health Care professional, Veterans Advocate, Voice Actor, Actor, Writer, Singer/Songwriter, Author,"" a photo was posted under his name on the day the charges were announced. The caption on the photo said, ""Reaching a goal is noteworthy. But the real story often lies in the climb!"" Reactions to the post were mixed, mostly supportive of him. One man wrote: ""Before anyone on here judges Chris, let's wait until his attorney gives him the OK to tell everyone what happened. Then make your judgment call. But don't sit on here and tear down a Former US Navy SEAL who fought and signed his life on a blank check to defend the USA. That is just horrible. When the time is right, Chris will tell us."" In another post, a woman wrote: ""what about what the news is reporting, CMH? ... just because someone fights for our freedom doesn't mean they are entitled to file false police reports. If that's even true. I'm just wondering what happened like I'm sure the rest of the people are wondering. No one tarnishes anyone, people tarnish themselves."" The falsification charge is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, police said. Obstructing official business is a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $750 fine. The case is not Haben's first run-in with the law. Heben's physician assistant license was suspended indefinitely by the Ohio Medical Board after he pleaded no contest in July 2008 to three felony counts of forgery. The disposition of the case was not immediately known. The State Medical Board of Ohio accused Heben of ""illicit forging of prescriptions for controlled substance,"" according to an online copy of the board's findings. The board also said he used his ""position as a physician assistant to facilitate the commission of these offenses.""","Christopher Heben is accused of lying to police about shooting .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-two children and six adults died when a bus crashed into the wall of a tunnel in Switzerland, police said. Another 24 children were injured in Tuesday night's wreck, authorities said. Three children are hospitalized in critical condition, Jean-Pierre Deslarzes, medical chief of the Canton Valais rescue organization, told a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Others are expected to be discharged from the hospital in the coming days. The bus was on its way back to Belgium after a ski trip when it slammed into the side of a highway tunnel in Sierre in the Swiss canton of Valais. It was carrying 52 people: two drivers, four other adults and 46 children, aged 11 and 12 years old. Prosecutor Olivier Elsig told reporters at the news conference that the cause of the crash was still under investigation, but initial inquiries indicated the bus, which was new, was not speeding and that the road conditions were good. Police have said the speed limit in the tunnel was 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph). Experts are studying CCTV images and speaking to witnesses and some of those on the bus who were less badly injured to find out what happened, Elsig said, adding that no other vehicle was involved in the crash. An autopsy will be carried out on the bus driver, who is among the dead. Investigators are focusing on three potential causes for the accident, he said -- a technical issue with the bus, a health problem with the driver or human error. Rescuers reported that the children were wearing their seat belts, he said, but the impact of the crash was so great that the belts did not save their lives. Christian Varone, police chief for Valais Canton, said investigators were still working to confirm the identities of the 28 people killed. All but two of those injured had been identified and their families contacted, he said. ""This is a tragic day for Belgium,"" Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said. He said there were 10 people of Dutch nationality among the victims as well as one of German and one of Polish origin. The survivors included 12-year-old twins, a girl and a boy, whose parents are a Spanish Catalan father and a Belgian mother, the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia reported Wednesday, citing family sources. The twins, identified as Alba and Marc, are out of danger and were treated in a hospital about 30 kilometers from the Swiss town of Sion, the newspaper reported. The parents were able to talk to them Wednesday and confirmed that they are safe and healthy. The family has gone to a hotel in Sion, the newspaper reported. The family moved from Spain to Belgium two years ago, the paper said. No problems had been reported with the bus, and it had passed technical checks in October, Di Rupo said. The drivers had respected regulations regarding rest time, he added. Pierre-Martin Moulin, assistant to the chief of police in Valais, earlier said authorities would need time to understand what had led the bus to hit the curb on the right side of the tunnel, then crash headlong into the wall of an emergency stopping point. It was too early to speculate about the cause of the accident, he told CNN from Sion, Switzerland. The tunnel was built recently and had many safety features, he added. The bus was returning from Anniviers in Switzerland when it crashed, said an online statement from the police in Valais. The children on the bus attended two schools in the Belgian towns of Heverlee and Lommel, it said. Deslarzes said the rescue operation had been ""very painful"" for the emergency workers because of the number of children involved. ""It was a difficult night for all the people engaged on the scene,"" Moulin said, expressing his condolences to families. He said the rescuers, who numbered more than 200, had gotten quickly to the crash site but nothing could be done for the many children who were killed. ""To end a ski trip like that. ... There's no words to describe what happened there,"" he said. Belgium has made available two military planes to take parents to see their injured children and to bring them back, Vandeweyer said. The Swiss Assembly held a minute's silence Wednesday morning for the victims. The European Parliament also fell silent to mark the tragedy. Martin Schulz, the assembly's president, paid tribute to the rescue workers and expressed his condolences to the families. The local government in Valais also paid tribute to those killed and their families. ""That a holiday trip can turn into such a tragedy is met by the people of the Canton Valais with deep sympathy and mourning,"" a statement on its website said. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Stefan Simons, Samira Said and Al Goodman contributed to this report.","NEW: The bus was not speeding at the time of the crash, a Swiss prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- With a new school year starting, homework is front and center in many homes. Parents worry if their kids are completing the assigned work while kids wonder why they have to work when really they prefer to play in the sun. There's good news for some families in Quebec. The College de Saint-Ambroise, an elementary school in Quebec, has banned homework for kids in grade one through six for a year. The Canadian media exploded with blogs, tweets and radio talk shows questioning the decision or applauding the action. Attempts to ban homework aren't new. In 2012, President Francoise Hollande of France proposed banning homework for all primary and middle school students, which was roundly ridiculed by The Wall Street Journal. In the same year, a school in Germany decided to actually do away with homework for students in grades five to nine. Oddly, when schools decide to ban homework, it is big news, but we know little about what happens afterward. What we do know is that Finland assigns little homework and its students have some of the highest test scores in the world. Los Angeles Unified School District -- America's second-largest school system -- took a different tact. In 2011, it set a policy that homework could not count for more than 10% of a student's grade. The decision caused such an outrage that a 15-member panel was formed and subsequently changed the policy so that homework accounted for 20% of a student's grade. This kind of intense debate about homework has a long history. For example, in the 1920s, some physicians were concerned about the impact of homework on children's health. They argued that children need between six to seven hours a day of fresh air and sunshine. In the 1930s, editor Edward Bok of the Ladies Home Journal also called for an end to the practice. For the rest of the 20th century, different research reports were used to support or dismiss the practice, yet it persists despite the lack of clarity on its educational value. What is clear is that parents and kids don't live in the world of academic research; they live in the real world where there are piles of homework on the kitchen table. The experience of homework is very different depending on which side of the economic divide you sit. The unequal distribution of educational resources means that some students go home to nannies, well-stocked home libraries, tutors, well-educated parents and high-speed Internet. Others students go home to caring for siblings in crowded apartments and often-absent parents who barely make ends meet. The issue of inequality was a main reason that the French President proposed banning homework. What about parents' educational hopes for their kids? Homework forces families to follow the state's educational agenda. Most parents are willing to turn their kids over to the state for the seven to nine hours of the school day for educational enrichment. But then they want to build a rich family life with their kids, and homework can interfere with that. For example, if parents want their children to be actively engaged with grandparents or church activities in the evening, those things would compete with homework time. Who controls a child's time has tremendous implications for the debate on homework. Should children be in school nine hours only to come home to two hours of homework? Could the intense pressure on children to achieve academically have negative health impacts down the road, in addition to the increased childhood obesity we are seeing? When schools ratchet up the pressure for higher academic achievement, one of the first things to go is recess even as homework is piled on. While scholars debate the value of homework -- and pundits, politicians and educators call for increased educational choices, greater standardization and accountability for schools -- many parents and students feel overwhelmed. The pressure of longer school days and more homework don't help matters. Parents who want to connect personally in meaningful ways with their children after a long day at their job would do well to remember that they have a right to family time uninterrupted by homework. They would do well to listen to what their kids have to say about the impact of homework on their lives. Too much homework may not be a good thing, especially for younger children. For families interested in clearing the kitchen table they can find support and advice from the growing Healthy Homework movement. At the end of the day, it's about how one wants to balance work, family, educational goals and happiness.","An elementary school in Quebec banned homework for kids in grade one through six .

"(CNN) -- Recently, the venerable Mark O'Mara wrote an op-ed on CNN.com calling for a law against bullying. I find myself in an unenviable position, that of respectfully dissenting with a leading legal mind whom I greatly admire. O'Mara writes compellingly in support of anti-bullying legislation. I am anti-anti-bullying legislation. Let me explain. While legislation designed to stamp out bullying may make us feel better inside, such laws by definition encroach upon fundamental freedoms of speech and constitutional requirements that laws not be vague or overly broad. What's more, they may seek to outlaw that which may be beyond the purview of the crimes code: It may be the case that human law is simply no match for the law of nature. Don't get me wrong, O'Mara is right in calling attention to the scourge of bullying. Bullying was bad enough in 1985 when a juvenile delinquent named Duffy was administering atomic noogies from the back of my school bus. Now, with advent of the Internet, bullies can do things that go viral, greatly magnifying the impact of their damage. Dr. Dan Olweus, a leading researcher of bullying, defines bullying as: . 1. Aggressive behavior that involves unwanted, negative actions . 2. A pattern of behavior repeated over time . 3. An imbalance of power or strength . That definition casts a wide net. Similarly, the strictest state anti-bullying statutes incorporate broad definitions of bullying. They also dragoon school personnel into anti-bullying policing and training roles, on top of their regular duties. It's inevitable that heightened ""awareness"" of bullying will result in more incidents being classified as ""bullying."" And when teachers are encouraged to err on the side of safety and report a borderline case of bullying, while facing discipline for failing to report, the effect of the incentive is clear. Overall, we're going to see a broad new swath of behavior falling within the definition of bullying. Simply put: We create more bullies by broadening the definition of bullying. As schools and legislators continue to target bullying by increasingly including speech within the definition, the forces of anti-bullying legislation collide with the legal equivalent of the immovable object: the Constitution -- specifically, the First Amendment. Freedom of speech protects the public expression of ideas, free from governmental interference. A statute is unconstitutionally broad if it chills a substantial amount of protected speech, even pursuant to a law with a legitimate purpose. Vagueness will also invalidate a law. A law is impermissibly vague if the rest of us cannot understand, from the language of the law, what exactly is prohibited speech or behavior. A law is vague if it doesn't lay out specific standards so that administrators who enforce the laws against the rest of us are prevented from doing so in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. Anti-bullying legislation seeks to outlaw people from saying mean things. Meanwhile, a law that criminalized saying ""mean things"" would almost certainly be unconstitutionally vague. Mostâ€”but not allâ€”bullying cases typically involve children and some school nexus. It is true that the Supreme Court has warned that the constitutional rights of students are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults. So schools probably have more authority to regulate student speech than the government would have to regulate adult speech. At the same time, the Supreme Court has also made clear that students do not shed their constitutional freedoms of speech or expression when they set foot on campus. Public schools may regulate student speech that threatens a concrete and ""substantial disruption,"" but even the Supreme Court cases on the subject do not provide much guidance on what exactly constitutes a substantial disruption. The bottom line is that as anti-bullying statutes continue to evolve and attempt to broaden their reach, there is a greater likelihood that they will suppress constitutional though likely cruel student speech. These laws will likely invite costly litigation and give undeserving children the blemish of a juvenile record, only to ultimately be struck down. Anti-bullying legislation certainly has its heart in the right place. However, so, too, would an attempt to outlaw anxiety or meanness. It may be the case that some things are outside the jurisdiction and purview of mankind's puny laws. After all, the very definition of bullying offered by the experts incorporates the concept of an imbalance of power. Yet, imbalance of power is at the core of almost every natural relationship. It's why we eat lobsters and they don't eat us. It's why we have bosses and employees. Power difference fuels capitalism, life ambition and survival itself. That's not to say bullying should be tolerated. It shouldn't. But outlawing bullying is not the answer. It stretches already thinly stretched school resources, and imposes unreasonable duties on school administrators. More importantly, it is constitutionally suspect and victim oriented. Subjective approaches to outlawing speech are likely vague and overly broad. Bullying in some form has been a part of the human experience since time immemorial. That doesn't mean it is socially acceptableâ€”on the contrary, bullies should be shunned. But laws are not always the cure for our every social ill, no matter how good they make us feel inside.","Danny Cevallos: I respectfully dissent with Mark O'Mara on issue of bullying laws .

He says such laws invite costly litigation and give kids blemished juvenile records .

"(CNN) -- At least one person was killed when a National Guard helicopter crashed in waters off San Juan, Puerto Rico, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said Tuesday, citing preliminary information. ""The preliminary information we have ... is that the wreckage of (the) Army National Guard aircraft was found in the water near San Juan,"" spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said in an e-mail. The aircraft was destroyed, she said. The crash occurred late Monday, according to Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Moorlag of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami, Florida. The Coast Guard received the call to help late Monday night with search and rescue efforts, said Ricardo Castrodad, spokesman for the Coast Guard in San Juan. He said three crew members and three passengers -- one guard and two civilians from Puerto Rico -- were on board. The UH 72 Lakota helicopter departed Monday night from San Juan, he said. It was one nautical mile northeast from the Puerto Rican coast. Castrodad did not provide information on casualties but said the search for survivors was ongoing. CNN's Mike Ahlers and Maria P.

"(CNN) -- Amtrak Train 91 was way behind schedule. More than 13 hours behind schedule, thanks to a nearly half-day stranding just 2 miles from a train station. The Miami-bound Silver Star train had departed New York City on Sunday at 11:02 a.m. with 261 passengers aboard, and it was supposed to arrive just after 5 p.m. in the Richmond, Virginia, area. Instead it arrived there on Monday around 6:45 a.m., according to Amtrak's website. ""The dining car developed axle problems that disabled the train 2 miles north of the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond around 5:30 p.m. Sunday,"" said Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods, via e-mail. ""The dining car couldn't be moved or cut out at the scene, because of the axle problems."" ""The train was between stops so safely removing the passengers or arranging alternate transportation was too problematic,"" Woods said. ""The train began a very slow move (at 3:45 a.m.) to a siding in Richmond and arrived to the station just after 6:30 a.m. and a replacement car was added,"" she said. ""The train resumed its trip around 7:12 a.m."" (A siding is a section of track off the main line.) During the delay, passengers were free to move around inside the train, and they had access to food and water, bathrooms, and heating and air conditioning, she said. Passenger Kevin Smith was frustrated at how long it took Amtrak to solve the problem. ""If you are a corporation that alienates its customer base, you ain't going to have customers,"" Smith told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""I think Amtrak could have solved this a lot sooner."" Smith didn't fault the Amtrak employees on board, calling them fellow victims of the delay. ""The employees can't be faulted here. It's obvious there's an equipment problem."" Woods encouraged passengers to call 1-800-USA-RAIL for information about refunds and credits. ""A delay of this magnitude is considered rare and we understand the passengers' frustrations from last night's events,"" she said.","Amtrak's Silver Star train was disabled just 2 miles from a train station .

"Phoenix (CNN) -- Alex Teves treasured Marvel and DC comics with their Spider-Man and Batman icons, and he was at his best in high school when he wrote about the superhero genre in English class. He revered the enduring themes of good versus evil, and he is remembered here, in the place where he grew into a man, as one of the good guys: a boy who inspired an ""Alex Teves Day"" at school, pursued a calling to heal both minds and bodies, and died at age 24 facing evil in the darkness of a crowded Colorado movie theater. ""If you want to describe Alex in one word, he was just good,"" says his father, Tom Teves. ""He wasn't a standout in anything, but he cared about people."" It is the goodness of humanity that Teves wants the world to know and remember: the virtues of his son -- and the 11 others killed at a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" in a cinema in Aurora, Colorado. That desire has taken shape as a crusade. In the midst of mourning his first born, Tom Teves has wrested purpose from his grief -- the Alex Teves Challenge, he calls it. He demands that the media stop naming and showing images of the gunmen in mass murders. Publicity glorifies killers, he says, and the notoriety spurs others to commit the same barbarities just for attention. Columbine. Virginia Tech. Tucson. And now Aurora. Alex Teves had just completed his master's degree in psychological counseling. His father says he would have condemned the practice of focusing on the murderers. Remember the victims, the heroic acts, Tom Teves exhorts. Let good triumph over evil. 'A zest for life' Alex Teves died shielding his girlfriend from the rain of bullets. His last act was more than just heroism. It attested to his nature to help humankind. Opinion: They lost their lives, upheld the code . Fresh out of the University of Denver with his master's degree, he was readying to seek another degree, a bachelor's in physical therapy at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He chose this long path because he wanted to heal the whole person, his family says. Tom Teves is deeply satisfied that the oldest of the couple's three children, all sons, came to know himself so well. ""He told me one day, 'I'm not going to do what you do -- because it's business,'"" says Teves, an executive for a corporate services firm. Alex said he didn't have it in him to order people around. ""And it was my proudest moment. He knew what he wanted to do,"" the father adds. Alex's mother, Caren, recalls his ever-present smile and appetite for life. ""He loved food. He loved to travel. He loved to explore new things. He just had a zest for life. He just wanted to experience everything he could. ""I'm glad he did as much as he could in the time he had here."" He met his girlfriend in graduate school, and Alex planned to marry her once he finished his studies, the mother says. Tales of heroism in Aurora . In the elegantly designed Phoenix community of Ahwatukee, where the boulevards are desert-landscaped with saguaro cacti and palo verde trees, Alex was such an ordinary guy of irrepressible cheer that he was celebrated for it by his classmates at Desert Vista High School, a high-performing public school opened in 1996 that sends graduates to the Ivy League. Every day, he wore a crisp, white T-shirt, blue jeans and loafers to school; he just wasn't into materialism and liked to think of the more important things, his mother said. By his senior year, his AP statistics classmates -- and then the entire class of 2006 -- decided to hold a day in his honor. Everyone came to school dressed like him. And now, says his mother, friends and supporters of those slain in the movie theater massacre held a memorial service in Denver with an Alex Teves dress code, and friends in Hawaii told the family they were planning a similarly attired service. Alex Teves was a cooperative student with a streak for being fun and funny, says high school math instructor Francoise Dastous, who teaches the statistics class. ""He really didn't have a clique per se. He got along well with everybody, and everybody wanted to be friends with him."" Alex once recounted to the class a hiking adventure that went awry, Dastous says. For anyone else, the experience would have been horrific, ""but Alex put a positive spin on it,"" Dastous says. ""He was just really engaging and really fun to listen to."" Six years have passed since the 57-year-old teacher had Alex in class, but the memories are clear. ""He just really kind of stood out from the other kids. He was always smiling."" Alex was an honors student whom other faculty recalled as having a sense of humor, says Anna Battle, principal of the 3,000-student school, one of the largest in Arizona. ""He wasn't Mr. Flamboyant. He wasn't Mr. Social Anybody. He was an even-keeled, pleasant, quality young man who loved superheroes,"" Battle says. ""One English teacher said he was a good writer and wrote exceptionally about superheroes. ""Unfortunately, it sounds like the young man who created this incident (in the Colorado movie theater) had some challenges that Alex may have been able to help,"" Battle adds. The alleged gunman is also 24 and was a neuroscience doctoral student at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. According to a court document filed by his public defense attorneys, he was also a patient of a university psychiatrist. 'My hero every day' Alex Teves will not be forgotten. His father shares one more memory. Alex was injured with a group of kids when their car rolled over in an accident in the desert. He was a student at the University of Arizona at the time. When an ambulance arrived, Alex insisted the other passengers get inside first, his father recalls, even though he needed immediate treatment, too. Once in intensive care, Alex asked his father to visit one of his friends who was hospitalized because that boy's parents had yet to arrive. ""That's the kind of kid he was,"" the father says. ""The world is worse off because he's not in it."" 4 Colorado shooting victims remembered for vitality, selflessness . That the suspect had dyed his hair red to resemble the villain Joker of the Batman series is a cruel turn of fate that enrages the grieving father. Tom Teves doesn't want his son's legacy to be defined by a gunman. When the man first appeared in court last week in Colorado, Teves was there. He calls the suspect ""a coward."" ""He didn't look like much,"" Teves says. ""My son could have wiped the floor with him."" Then the father continues: ""If he would have known my son, he would have helped him."" He returns to his challenge to the media. He blames news outlets, including CNN, for playing a role in perpetuating mass shootings. ""You make him out to be a madman,"" he says of the man suspected of killing his son. ""He knew he was going to be on television. These guys are playing you like fiddles. Either you're not that bright -- I used a better word than I was thinking of -- or you don't care and you're using it to sell advertising, and then you're the worst thing on the face of the earth."" Tom and Caren Teves have been married 28 years. He worked two or three jobs sometimes, so that their kids could benefit from having their mother at home full-time. Now the couple faces raising their 16- and 17-year-old sons without their big brother. ""He was my hero every day,"" Teves says. The father isn't surprised by the way Alex responded when savagery slipped inside the movie theater. ""Alex is in heaven,"" he adds. ""I'm quite sure of it."" His anger subsides. The couple is accompanied by Caren Teves' sister and her husband, whom the Teveses earlier picked up at the Phoenix airport. The in-laws, Joe and Carla Morgan, express outrage that the suspect's photo appears five times on the front page of a national newspaper, overwhelming any photos of Alex and the others who lost their lives. ""Stop showing cowards and start showing heroes,"" Tom Teves says, ""so that another father doesn't feel the hole in his body that I have and I know will never go away."" He puts his hand over his heart. His wife extends her hand and joins his. ""It's got to end,"" he says. ""You do your part, and I promise to do the other."" He says he will spend his days reminding the media of this challenge in his son's name. Remembering Rebecca Wingo, Aurora victim . How to help the victims of the Colorado massacre .

"(CNN) -- A police officer and a bystander died from wounds suffered in a parking lot shootout after a car chase in a Houston metropolitan area Monday morning, police said. Cpl. Jimmie Norman, a 24-year veteran of the Bellaire, Texas, police, died at a hospital, said Chief of Police Byron Holloway. Holloway didn't identify the other man who was killed. He described him as a local businessman who ""was coming to the aid of Officer Norman"" after the chase ended in Houston and the shooting began. The suspect was shot twice by other officers from Bellaire, Holloway said. ""Jimmy had a police mind and a big heart,"" said Holloway, who has been with the small, tight-knit department for 37 years. ""He was always thinking about things that would better the department, better the city, better the working conditions of officers and better the way we could serve the citizens."" Norman, 53, was married and had two adult children, one of whom works with the police department, Holloway said. The pursuit started after a driver refused to stop when a Bellaire police officer tried to pull over his vehicle, Houston police spokesman John Cannon said. The fleeing car collided with a pickup truck, which then joined the chase, Cannon said. Norman, who was a patrol supervisor, and the truck driver followed the suspect into an auto parts business parking lot, he said. The suspect opened fire at Norman and shot and killed the local businessman, who came out to the parking lot. Backup officers arrived and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was struck twice, Cannon said. Norman died later at Ben Taub General Hospital, police said. The suspect is listed in critical condition at a hospital. ""We owe a great debt of thanks to Officer Norman and the thousands like him who ask for not much more than to be a good police officer and to come home safe,"" Bellaire Mayor Phil Nauert said in a written statement.

"(CNN) -- It only took one message to convince Michael Remen. ""The one that stuck in my head the most was the one about Arlington National Cemetery -- all the people that gave their lives just so that we could vote. I'm not a military person or nothing like that but they were right, and it makes sense,"" said Remen, who is a sous-chef in Hilo, Hawaii. ""That's the main reason I'm going to go try (to vote on Tuesday). If I wouldn't have read that, I probably wouldn't"" have decided to vote. The message came from a complete stranger, identified on Facebook as Bernie Sarratea, as part of a CNN Change the List campaign to get people in Hawaii to vote in the upcoming election. The state had the lowest voter turnout rate in 2008, making it the focus of several stories that are part of a new project, which I'm heading up. The goal is to create a conversation that could help bump Hawaii off the bottom of that list. We featured six nonvoters from Hawaii as a way to highlight the diverse reasons people in the Aloha State don't vote. Because of your efforts, three of them decided to vote, two of those for the first time. A fourth plans to vote in the future, but did not register in time for tomorrow's election (that's yet another reason Hawaii should pass a same-day voter registration law). Two say they won't vote in this election, but even they said that they were moved by the pro-voting arguments you sent, and that they may reconsider eventually. ""I've been reading them all. It's amazing,"" said Nani Teruya, who does not plan to vote on Tuesday but seems to revel in the fact that she's become a local celebrity of sorts in Maui because of this online campaign. ""I love it, you know. I really take into consideration what people are saying. But, you know, I still have my reasons."" Change the List: 47 of your pro-voting arguments . Personally, I think convincing three out of six is a great success. I chose these six nonvoters because I couldn't figure out how to convince them to vote in person, on my visit to Hawaii. Their friends hadn't been able to either. Each posed a challenge. It shows the power of the Internet -- a medium that certainly goes a long way to shrink the thousands of miles of ocean between Hawaii and the mainland -- that your messages were able to persuade 50% of the people we featured. Incidentally, a 50% turnout rate is exactly what Hawaii needs to hop off the bottom of the national voter turnout list, if the numbers hold from the 2008 presidential election. And how cool is it that one message from a stranger could convince another person to exercise his right to vote? It reinforces my belief that if everyone asked several friends to vote in this upcoming election, turnout would be much higher and, more importantly, our democracy would be more representative of the people. There's real power in an invitation into the political process, even if it's via Facebook. Here's the tally of who plans to vote and who doesn't. Click the links below to read the messages that people sent to each of the nonvoters. Thanks to all of you who sent in messages. Know that they made a difference in how some people view voting. 1. Paul Hewlett: Not voting, but plans to in the future . Hewlett's wife, Lois, told me in an e-mail that her husband had not registered to vote for this election but now plans to do so in order to vote in 2014. 2. Michael Remen: Voting . The sous-chef on Hawaii's Big Island did not plan to vote when I met him in October because he had such trouble at his polling place during the primary election this year. Here is the text of the Facebook message that convinced him to vote: . ""Send him a free ticket to Arlington Cemetery and (show) him how many reasons there are to vote, since all those there died for that right, here and abroad."" ""I thought that was a really powerful statement,"" Remen said, ""and it made really good sense."" 3. Nani Teruya: Not voting . Teruya doesn't vote because she believes the U.S. illegitimately overthrew the Hawaiian Kingdom and has no right to rule the islands. She said she loved the messages encouraging her to vote -- some asked her to support candidates who value issues that are important to the Native Hawaiian community -- but that she's not ready to vote in this election. ""To tell you the truth, my mind is made up. I'm going to stay the way I am,"" she said. ""I have my reasons. And voting is just not me."" Her phone was ringing off the hook, she said, because of the project. People in Maui are talking about voting now, she said, and she expects that will make a difference at the polls. As for her: ""For this election,"" she said, ""I'm not ready."" 4. Skyler Gayhart: Voting . Gayhart, a high school senior, initially said he didn't feel informed enough to vote. But after reading messages from other young people who said they learned about the political process because they decided to vote, he came to see it as important. ""I thought it was pretty legit,"" he said of the project. ""All my friends have been posting it on my Facebook."" He felt some peer pressure to vote, too. ""I feel like I needed to vote because I'm on the thing. I feel like I'm obligated to vote. I feel good about it. You should. I'm going to be an adult anyway. I think it's a right."" 5.

My parents aren't forcing me, but they said it's a good thing and so I'm going to vote."" He performed a sort of cost-benefit analysis about voting. Once he looked into the process and realized he could vote by mail, it seemed so easy that there was no reason not to bother with it. ""I don't think my vote counts as much, but I am going to vote.

"Paris (CNN) -- This weekend I hosted part of the Global Summit of Women in Paris, set up by a Washington-based organization devoting its time to trying to further women's causes in the world. From politics to business, leaders of countries and industries gathered to share their views on women's empowerment and how to harness their sisters' contribution to society. Providing able and ambitious women with the tools for a successful career isn't just the right thing to do, it's good for business, as some of the biggest economies are finally beginning to grasp. After two decades spent in the financial doldrums, Japan -- one of the most socially conservative societies on the planet -- is now counting on its hidden female potential to help drag the country out of its 20-year slump. In Europe, thanks to the formidable commitment of EU commissioner Viviane Reding, among others, female participation has increased sharply. But to really take hold, moves to mobilize women into the workforce will require more than the usual one-term parliamentary pledge. They need generational commitments, major shifts in the cultural mind-set and years of adaptation. What's more, the prescription should not be the same for all countries. Women in the developing world face a myriad different pressures from those in Europe and the U.S. They also have different priorities. So getting a local perspective is key. While it's generally true that education is key to unlocking potential, girls are already doing better than boys at school in many parts of the globe. But the glass ceiling remains an ever-present stumbling block. Two-time President of Finland Tarja Halonen believes offering practical childcare options (for countries that can afford to do so) is the first step in helping to prevent women feel they have to choose between kids and a career. Having powerful female role models also gives them encouragement to overcome the bias and stigma many working mothers face. President of Malta Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca -- only the second woman to hold the post -- says the stereotypes of women as purely mother and wife material must be smashed while children are in the classroom. She believes the self-belief needed to succeed comes at a tender age. It's fair to say that the choice between having a family and a future in work isn't always a binary one. Indeed, in today's day in age more women than ever before have managed to achieve both. But, as Coleiro Preca points out, not all women have the luxury of choosing between staying home to raise their offspring and going out to work in a job they enjoy. In some nations the lack of access to contraception prevents them from planning when they want to start a family. In others, women who want to take time out to raise their children, find themselves forced by their circumstances to have to take on a job they may not want. ""The reality is if you are poor you don't have a choice,"" she says. ""So we need to think of better ways to serve these women as well."" Coleiro Preca believes that having more women in positions of power politically gives governments the sensitivity and empathy to look out for the marginalized. One area where much has been achieved in a relatively short period of time is in the corporate sector. Quotas forcing boards to bring on more women have done much to smash sexism in the clubby male world of capitalism. Reding has spearheaded EU moves to make company boards 40% female. But legislature for the very top of an organization can paint an artificial picture of the demographic further down the pay scale. Women workers were particularly hardly hit during the rounds of layoffs in 2008, and an alarming number of them remain underemployed four years on -- stuck in jobs that are either part-time or lower paid than before. Women make all sorts of contributions to society in ways that aren't just related to work and money. They play the vital role of raising the next generation. But for those who also covet a rewarding career, we owe it to them to get the balance right. READ MORE: The best country for women entrepreneurs is.....

"(CNN) -- A New Hampshire teen who disappeared nine months ago is back home, the state attorney general's office said Monday. Neither the teen's family nor authorities offered any information about where she was during those months. The disappearance of 15-year-old Abigail Hernandez, who vanished on October 9 as she headed home from her high school in the town of Conway, according to the FBI, triggered nationwide media coverage and concerns by authorities then that she might have been abducted. At a news conference in December, New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jane Young said the teen ""is not out there alone. She has somebody who is either helping her, whether that be a friend or what we fear is a foe."" At that news conference, authorities revealed that Abigail's mother had received a letter that appeared to be from her missing daughter. Although authorities did not reveal the contents of the letter, Young said ""we believe in fact that it was written by Abby and was sent to her mother."" Despite the concerns, her case was classified as a missing persons investigation during the months she was gone. Abigail was safely reunited with her family Sunday evening, according to a press release from the attorney general's office. Citing an ongoing investigation, authorities did not release any information about Abigail's disappearance. Her mother, Zenya Hernandez, told law enforcement officers that ""today we are the happiest people on earth,"" according to the press release.

"Washington (CNN) -- There will be plenty of legacy items by which to judge President Barack Obama. Obamacare, for instance: Whether the new law that seeks health insurance for every American is a prudent piece of policy or an albatross of government overreach is a matter of opinion. How about drawing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? What about his efforts to police suspected terrorists abroad through the use of deadly drone strikes? None of these, in the long run, might be as important as his efforts to help the economy, which, ironically, has felt stronger just as Americans' faith in Obama to steer it has dwindled. According to a Pew Research Center poll from November, just 31% of Americans approve of the way he is handling the economy. By one measure, the Obama economy is almost back to par. If he's lucky, the economy might be able to save his second term. ""It's impossible to tell the future,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton who has written about presidents and their legacies for CNN. ""If the economy moves in a positive direction and in the next two years we are really out of the sluggish economy that he started his presidency with, people will value that."" What sort of value remains to be seen. The short-memory syndrome . Certainly, handing off a good economy would help his long-term legacy. In the short term, there seems to be little appetite among Republicans on Capitol Hill for some of his legislative priorities like raising the minimum wage or passing an immigration reform bill. An emboldened president would enter those negotiations with a stronger hand. He'd also have more power to sway budget negotiations that could affect future spending on social programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Stephen Weatherford, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said Americans have short memories. ""To a kind of ironic extent, if presidents come in facing big problems and they're able to do something to solve those problems, people don't evaluate them based on those problems,"" he said. ""It becomes a kind of, 'What have you done for me lately?' problem,"" said Weatherford, who thinks Obama's domestic legacy will be focused squarely on the health care law. ""I think if the health care law is in place and works, he'll be remembered really favorably,"" said Weatherford, comparing the law to the Great Society social programs enacted by President Lyndon Johnson. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7% in November. It's an imperfect measure for the health of the economy. People long unemployed and who aren't looking for work aren't counted, for example. But that's the lowest unemployment rate since Obama was first elected president, when the rate sat at 6.8%. In hindsight, that 6.8% figure from 2008 seems low, either because Americans at the time were used to much lower jobless rates or because in the time since then we've become used to much higher rates. In 2008, the economic ground was rumbling with talk of the potential for an economic apocalypse. The unemployment rate grew a full percentage point in the 2 1/2 months between his election that year and his inauguration in January 2009, and it peaked a little less than a year into his presidency at 10% in October 2009. Now we call it the Great Recession, something much worse than your father's recession but probably not quite as bad as your grandfather's Great Depression. The U.S. government took an activist approach to saving the economy. It began pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into bailouts of the banking and auto industries in the final days of the Bush administration. The Federal Reserve was just beginning to pump trillions of dollars into the economy through a menu of bond-buying programs and artificially low interest rates. Taking an approach, running with it . Obama took this activist approach and ran with it. He spent a good portion of his new political capital passing a nearly $800 billion stimulus program opposed by all but three Republicans in the Senate. The rollout of the stimulus, by the way, was beset by a flawed website and created a huge political headache as those hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars flooded into the economy -- the effect was not immediately felt by everyone and it was hard to quantify as it was spread across years. Even if the recovery is felt most prominently in the coming years, it could affect perception of those early programs, Zelizer said. ""If the last two years of the Obama presidency are filled with a possibility economy, it's going to change the way we view the stimulus and his other economic programs,"" he said. Temporary increases to food stamps authorized by the stimulus package only ran out at the beginning of November. Temporary increases in unemployment insurance are set to run out at the end of this year. The ultimate effect of billions spent on infrastructure had a short-term effect on jobs, but will also have long-term benefits. Continued growth will come with growing pains. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke or his soon-to-be successor Janet Yellen are expected to taper off the Fed programs that have helped buoy the back end of the economy and kept interest rates down. The Congressional Budget Office guessed that the stimulus kept the unemployment rate 2% lower than it otherwise would have been in 2010. That means the country could have faced 12% unemployment instead of 10% at the height of the Great Recession, but we'll never know for sure. What we do know is that the national debt skyrocketed as the federal government spent furiously to save the economy. The stimulus cost $830 billion, according to the CBO. Deficits have started to shrink as the economy has improved and Republicans in Congress have insisted on spending cuts. But the debt now stands at nearly $17 trillion. America's Debt: CNN Money special section . A Wall Street rally; a widening divide . But while the stock market has rallied during the Obama presidency -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly doubled during his time in office -- the divide between wealthy and struggling Americans has grown exponentially. Potentially rising interest rates and less help for the unemployed and the hungry as those stimulus programs run out could exacerbate the problem, which Obama has made clear will be a focus of his remaining time in office. ""I believe this is the defining challenge of our time: Making sure our economy works for every working American. It's why I ran for President. It was at the center of last year's campaign,"" Obama told a liberal group during a speech in an economically depressed area of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. ""It drives everything I do in this office. And I know I've raised this issue before, and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now."" He later added that he think the government should be spending money to invest in creating opportunities for Americans. ""A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit,"" he said. After his re-election, Obama extended Bush-era tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans, making good on his campaign effort to make them pay a little more in the coming years. The economy for years has been the issue that Americans want politicians to fix. More than health care or the Iraq war, the economy dominated the 2008 election â€” 55% of voters said it was the most important problem facing the country. Four years later, when Obama was re-elected, the economy and unemployment split the top spot. Perhaps one sign of an improved economy is that a different poll, conducted by Gallup in October, found that the economy is no longer the top concern of Americans. Now it is ""government dysfunction."" Two academics wrote recently that Democratic presidents seem to preside over generally better economies than Republicans. But there's no evidence that their policies are the reason. That means it's perhaps not fair to give presidents credit when the economy improves or blame them when it goes bad. ""It's never fair,"" Zelizer said. ""Presidents don't have total control of the economy. They can't even control Congress. But fair or not, that's what happens.""","The Obama legacy likely will include many elements .
One will be the economy .
It might even be THE one in the long-term of history ."
"(CNN) -- Soul singer Solomon Burke has died at the age of 70 in the Netherlands, his Dutch representative said Sunday. Burke died of natural causes after arriving at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, his family said in a statement posted on Burke's website. He was in town to perform for a sold-out show with the Dutch band De Dijk. ""This is a time of great sorrow for our entire family. We truly appreciate all of the support and well wishes from his friends and fans. Although our hearts and lives will never be the same, his love, life and music will continue to live within us forever,"" his family said. Hailed by Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler as ""the greatest soul singer of all time,"" Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. He joined the Atlantic Records stable in 1960, putting him in the company of Ray Charles, Ben E. King and Wilson Pickett. His first hit with them came almost immediately, with ""Cry to Me."" He had top R&B hits in 1965 with ""Got to Get You Off of My Mind,"" and ""Tonight's the Night,"" the rock museum says in Burke's biography. He continued to tour until his death, and was scheduled to perform Tuesday in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.","NEW: His family says Burke died of natural causes .

"(CNN) -- It was a June day in 2000. The Yankees were facing the Braves at Turner Field. I was on hand to profile one of Atlanta's players for Sports Illustrated, but my cell phone rang, and a dreadful request followed. ""Supposedly Derek Jeter and Mariah Carey are dating,"" my editor said. ""Can you go ask him about it?"" Glub. I was 27 years old, relatively new to the baseball beat. There are things I'd have been willing to ask Jeter. Do you like cats? What's your favorite song on the new John Oates CD? Have you ever been to Malta? The one thing I didn't want to ask him about was his all-over-the-gossip-pages relationship with Mariah Carey. Alas, I needed to keep my job. I entered the Yankee clubhouse and immediately spotted Jeter, alone by his locker, changing into his uniform. I introduced myself. He nodded. ""Derek,"" I said, ""I hate asking you this, and I'm really embarrassed, but my editor insisted. He wanted me to approach you about Mariah Carey."" I expected Jeter to tell me to bug off. I expected Jeter to demand my removal from his space. I did not expect what ensued — laughter. ""Listen,"" he said, grinning, ""I understand you're just doing your job. I really do. And I'm not mad or irritated. But I'm not going to comment, because it's no one's business but mine. Just because I play baseball doesn't mean I have to tell everyone everything. My life is my life."" We shook hands, and I walked off — content and relieved, but mostly impressed. Now, 14 years later, with Jeter announcing that the upcoming season will be his last, I remain impressed. Actually, scratch that. Really, when I think of Jeter, the classy Yankee shortstop whose 2019 Hall of Fame induction is a 100% lock, the word that pops into my head is encouraged. Yes, I am encouraged. Derek Jeter, you see, does not have a Twitter account. He does not refer to himself in the third person or have his nickname tattooed across his back. (Come to think of it, he doesn't really have a nickname.) He's never gone out of his way to publicly humiliate an opponent or prop himself up with inane boasts of superiority. If the words ""I'm the man"" ever escaped his lips, they were surely followed by, ""... who ordered the pizza about 20 minutes ago. I decided to pick it up instead. Can I also grab a bottle of water and some napkins?"" Throughout the first 18 seasons of his career, Jeter has often been labeled ""dull"" by the media. His answers to questions are unimaginative and full of cliché baseball nothingness blather. In hindsight, however, such lameness is almost to be admired. We live in an era where too many athletes feel as if they need to draw attention to themselves — for confidence, for commercials. If you're not tweeting trash talk, you're texting trash talk. Or making bold promises. Or demanding money or respect. Jeter has both money and respect, byproducts of a dogged work ethic and a need to play with 100% ferocity, health be damned. His 3,316 hits are the most in Yankee history, and his 256 home runs, 1,261 RBIs, 348 stolen bases and .312 lifetime batting average serve as odes to a continued brilliance. Most important, you never hear a bad word about the man. Back in 1997, Sports Illustrated ran a cover story on the next generation of Major League shortstops. The piece highlighted the skills of Jeter, Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, Toronto's Alex Gonzalez, Florida's Edgar Renteria and the Mets' Rey Ordonez. The men were listed as near-equals, and writer Tom Verducci noted that, ""Not since 1941 have so many young shortstops arrived with this much potential."" Before long, however, things changed. Ordonez never learned to hit. Gonzalez was merely OK. Renteria spent many years in the game as a good but not especially great player. Rodriguez was doomed by accusations of doping. That left Jeter — the most understated of the group, the most professional of the group. He will be remembered by many people for many things. Among Yankee fans, he's grouped with Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio and Mantle as pinstriped royalty. Among Red Sox fans, he's a thorn to the skull. Among Oakland fans, he's a killer of dreams. To me, though, he's a guy who merely wanted to be a guy. That's what makes him exceptional. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Years ago, reporter Jeff Pearlman asked Yankee Derek Jeter about dating Mariah Carey .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan has been thrown into political turmoil after a months-long dispute between two presidential candidates prevented a successor to outgoing President Hamid Karzai being named. The country's presidential election was held on April 5, and was followed by a runoff vote in June after the first result was inconclusive. The two contenders, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, have accused each other of fraud and manipulation. Despite pleas from Karzai and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to come to a resolution, the two opponents remain at an impasse, sparking concerns of bloodshed and instability in the fragile, war-torn country. It has significantly delayed what was to be Afghanistan's first democratic transfer of power. This comes at a time as the Taliban have carried out deadly attacks on high-profile targets and fought heavily for control of the Helmand province. As the U.S.-led war effort against the Taliban winds down, most NATO troops are due to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year. Afghanistan ""urgently needs a new government,"" and the two runoff candidates must form a unity government, Karzai said earlier this week. ""We want a new government and that can be brought to us by Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai."" A crumbling agreement? In July, Abdullah and Ghani came to an agreement, brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, to accept the result of a nationwide audit and form a unity government. The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan conducted the audit, under the supervision of UN specialists and international observers. It completed the audit of about 8 million votes on September 4, but the results have not been released. ""The audit work is completed,"" said Noor Mohammad Noor, a spokesman for the election commission on Wednesday. ""Only some physical work is yet to be done and we are hoping to be able to announce it in the next few days."" Meanwhile, both candidates appear they are backing off their July commitment with statements reported in the media that Abdullah would reject the official results and Ghani indicated he may not be open to power sharing. In a statement this week, Ban urged the candidates to fulfill their end of the agreement ""on a government of national unity in accordance with the commitments they reached on 12 July,"" according to his spokesman. ""The Secretary-General emphasizes that this is a pivotal moment for Afghanistan, and that genuine partnership will be required in tackling Afghanistan's many challenges. Both parties share a real responsibility to guide Afghanistan to a peaceful and more prosperous future. Given the scale of the challenges, this can only be done jointly."" The impasse has also vexed Karzai, whose last day in office was supposed to be three months ago. After 13 years in power, Karzai had said that he hoped to leave office by September 2, but was asked by the UN Special Representative to stay as the vote audit was underway. Abdullah and Ghani at odds . There are concerns that the political deadlock can spiral into a bloody dispute between supporters for the two candidates. On Tuesday, Abdullah's supporters took to the streets to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the death of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who is regarded as a national hero. At the scene, a boy died when members of the crowd fired their guns into the air. In the general election on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, while Ghani got 31.6%. Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power. Although he was once an ally of Karzai, serving in his government as foreign minister, he become an opponent in recent years and even challenged him in the 2009 election. Abdullah dropped out after that election after the first round to protest what he said was large-scale voting fraud. In the June vote, Ghani appeared to pull off a comeback, gaining more votes over Abdullah. Ghani is a former academic and U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He worked as an adviser to Karzai and as finance minister in his Cabinet. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Afghanistan and Madison Park wrote from Hong Kong.","Afghanistan's government is at an impasse as awaiting election audit results .

"London (CNN) -- As UK investigators work to identify the Islamist militant who beheaded American journalist James Foley, the tiniest details in the videotape of the killing could provide the key clue. Although the killer is swathed head to toe in black, with only his eyes visible through a narrow strip, some distinguishing features can be picked out. His skin tone can be discerned from his hands, which are not covered, and he appears to be left-handed. The man's height and build can also be established from the footage, as well as the kind of movements he makes. But the biggest clue may lie in his voice, which experts say has a distinctly English accent. Linguists said that based on his voice, the man appears to be young, most likely under 30. He also appears to have been educated in England from a young age and to be from southern England or London. British police and intelligence services have been tight-lipped about any progress in identifying the man. As they seek to trace him, they will doubtless be looking at those with known connections to jihadist movements or who have been to Syria to fight. However, they will also probably be seeking to match his voice with recordings they hold in an audio bank, said Elizabeth McClelland, a forensic voice and speech analyst who also acts as an expert witness in British courts. Britain and most other countries hold such recordings, some made covertly, of people they suspect of involvement in terrorist activity, she said. ""It's likely that they will screen the voices, the voice data bank that they have, possibly using automatic speaker recognition software, and try to find the closest match to the voice in the video,"" she said. No unique 'voice print' That would probably narrow the possible matches to perhaps 200 or 300, depending on the sort of data bank the intelligence services have, McClelland said. But, she cautioned, despite what is sometimes seen in TV detective shows, the audio should not be seen as some kind of magic bullet. ""There's no such thing as a 'voice print' that's going to have a unique reference to one individual, and therefore they can match it,"" she said. ""Speech is a kind of behavior; it's not a digital printout."" The next step will be for an expert phonetician and linguist to carry out a mixture of phonetic and acoustic analysis, she said. Any conclusions would be based on the expert's knowledge and experience, supported by acoustic measurements. They would focus on elements including pitch, intonation, intensity and patterns in the bands of acoustic energy, known as formants, measured using special software. McClelland added, ""from the voice in the video, there's not a lot you can do until you have something to compare it to, and that's in the hands of the intelligence services."" They might be working across international borders with intelligence agencies in Europe and the United States to do so, she said. Accent 'not purely British' Although the experts who spoke to CNN agree that the man is most likely from southern England or London, they differ on some points, indicating the difficulty of the task faced by intelligence services. John Olsson, a voice recognition expert, said he believed the voice was of someone who had spent most, if not all, of his life in Britain. ""However, there are other elements in the accent which are not purely British."" Something in the intonation and pronunciation, Olsson said, suggests that the man may have some African origin or perhaps second-generation African parentage. ""Alternatively, it's possible he's picked up these influences from people around him, people he's mixed with,"" he said. There's no sign, however, of any influence on his language from the Indian subcontinent, for example the Muslim communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, he said. McClelland tentatively suggested the accent may belong to someone who also speaks Farsi or Dari, used in Iran and Afghanistan. 'Multicultural London English' Another expert, Paul Kerswill, a linguistics expert at the University of York, said the accent sounded English but was one that could be described as ""multicultural London English."" He's probably, although not definitely, a Londoner, he said, and ""he's grown up in a multicultural, multilingual neighborhood with lots of different languages around, and this kind of environment leads to some kind of change in the way English is pronounced."" It's very hard to tell exactly what part of London he might be from, he said, because this kind of English emerges wherever in London you get a high concentration of people speaking different languages, reflecting the various immigrant groups that have come into the country since World War II. Kerswill said it was difficult to tell the ethnicity of a young person who has grown up learning English from other people who learned it as a second language or whose parents are second-language speakers, because in this melting pot everyone starts to sound quite similar, even those whose parents are native speakers. ""It's quite hard to tell the ethnicity of this person from his voice alone,"" he said. ""He's probably not British white. He could be of Pakistani origin; he could be of Somali origin; he could be South American origin or something. It's very, very hard to pinpoint,"" he said. ""Some commentators may say it's not a British English accent. Well, it is a British English accent; it's one that's grown up in this multilingual environment."" Kerswill thinks the man may have arrived in Britain as a child and begun to acquire the language then. However, he doesn't exclude that he may be British-born. Words, phrasing give clues . Besides the militant's voice, other pointers lie in the language used in the message. Olsson points out that the audio sample is small, making it hard to draw definite conclusions from it. Nonetheless, he believes that while the militant is a native British speaker, parts of the text he reads out in the video were written by someone who -- while very proficient in English -- was not. ""Some of the phrasing is not pure native speaker, so he's been assisted with this text. It's not entirely him,"" he said, pointing to examples of non-idiomatic expressions and overly stilted, formal English. He also believes that the fighter is educated to at least high school graduation, if not university, level and probably comes from a professional, middle-class background. McClelland too believes that the voice belongs to an educated speaker. Kerswill, however, suggests that the man's accent points to him man coming from an inner city demographic, where the socioeconomic class and education level are often lower. The text appears to be written in standard English, he said, so there are no clues to be found in the slang a young man might otherwise have used. Intriguingly, Olsson speculates that the way the militant refers to ""the Muslims"" in the video may suggest he could be a convert to Islam. ""I don't think there's a strong Muslim background there, necessarily,"" he said. ""He does talk about 'us' at one point, but he also talks about 'the Muslims,' and so there's a little bit of distance there between him and that group, and I'm thinking that that may well be due to his adoption of the religion, so I'm thinking it's possible he is not originally from a Muslim family.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- U.S. warplanes on Saturday pounded a series of extremist militant targets in what officials say is part of an effort to retake a key piece of infrastructure in northern Iraq -- Mosul Dam. The airstrikes against fighters of the so-called Islamic State come amid growing concern that the dam is not being properly maintained and could rupture, a U.S. official familiar with the details told CNN. Engineering studies have shown that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad, the official said on condition of anonymity. Mosul Dam is Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, and it sits on the Tigris Rivers about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the city of Mosul. ISIS fighters took control of the dam this month following fierce fighting. The United States estimates there may be up to 400 ISIS fighters in and around the dam complex, said the U.S. official. The U.S. military confirmed a mix of fighter jets and drones carried out nine airstrikes near Mosul and the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. The strikes targeted armored vehicles being used by ISIS fighters, it said. U.S. Central Command declined to provide further details, citing security of its personnel. Map: Where is ISIS? There were conflicting reports from Kurdish officials about whether its military force, known as the Peshmerga, had begun a ground operation to retake the dam. Mosul Dam remains in hands of ISIS . A colonel with the Peshmerga told CNN the operation began early Saturday with Kurdish forces advancing toward the dam as the United States carried out airstrikes against ""mobile ISIS positions."" The dam complex has not been hit, the colonel said on condition of anonymity. He is not authorized to speak to the media. While Peshmerga spokesman Hilgurd Hikmat also confirmed the U.S. airstrikes, he said the Kurdish forces are not on the move and have not engaged in battle with ISIS fighters near the dam. Mosul Dam is under ISIS control, but it is still up and running, the colonel said. Engineers and employees remain at work, he said. U.S. intelligence agencies, according to the U.S. official, are also keeping an eye on the Haditha Dam on the Euphrates River in Iraq's western Anbar province, where Iraqi troops have been holding off an ISIS assault for weeks. The dam is the second-largest in the country, and it provides water to western and southern Iraq. A failure of the Haditha Dam also would prove catastrophic. Earlier this year, ISIS fighters opened the gates on the Falluja dam after seizing it in an effort to stop an Iraqi military advance. The water from the dam flooded a number of small villages. Opinion: In Iraq, it's not 'mission creep' U.S. President Barack Obama ordered targeted airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq and prevent a potential genocide of ethnic and religious minority groups by ISIS, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. American airstrikes were carried out near the Yazidi village of Kojo amid reports that ISIS fighters had launched an attack, the U.S. military said. Yazidi men killed, women abducted . ISIS swept into the village on Friday, killing at least 80 men and taking more than 100 women captive, officials told CNN. One Yazidi leader put the death toll much higher. The report of the brutal attack on the village of Kojo came after Obama -- citing the success of targeted American airstrikes -- declared an end to an ISIS siege that had trapped tens of thousands of Yazidis in mountains. Who are the Yazidis? A Yazidi leader, Mirza Dinnayi, told British broadcaster Channel Four News that more than 350 men were killed and 1,000 women and children kidnapped during the attack. Fighters with ISIS attacked Kojo after surrounding it for days, a Kurdish regional government official and a Yazidi religious leader said. The women abducted from the village were being taken to the ISIS-controlled northern cities of Mosul and Tal Afar, the official said. CNN cannot independently confirm the killings and abductions, but the claims are similar to reports provided by survivors of ISIS attacks in Iraq. The Yazidis, one of Iraq's smallest and oldest religious minorities, are among 400,000 people that the United Nations estimates have been driven from their homes since June, when ISIS swept across the border from Syria into Iraq.

"Chances are, someone you know takes a sleeping pill. One in four Americans takes a sleep aid every year, according to the National Sleep Foundation, and the numbers are even higher for women -- one in three uses some sort of sleep medication a few times a week. Many sleeping pills stop working after a few hours, and most should not be combined with other medications. Why do women have such trouble sleeping? The reasons are as numerous as the passel of pills on the market: anxiety, depression, chronic illness, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, everyday exhaustion ... the list goes on and on. No wonder so many sleep aids are available. But sleeping pills, while often quite helpful, are largely misunderstood. Many stop working after a few hours, for instance, and most should never be mixed with other meds. So if you take one of these drugs now -- or plan to in the future -- there are important questions you need to ask. Here, the answers. Q: How do I know if I need a sleeping pill? A: More than a third of Americans experience occasional insomnia, which is defined as a few nights of restlessness, poor sleep, or trouble falling asleep. The general rule of thumb: If insomnia lasts a month and doesn't get better, talk to your doctor, says Frisca L. Yan-Go, M.D., director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Santa Monica-University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital. She may recommend a pill for a short period, but don't be surprised if she suggests some tests or other non drug treatment options first. Health.com: How much sleep do you need? For starters, your doc may have you visit a sleep specialist to rule out sleep apnea, a common breathing disorder that wakes sufferers several times a night, sometimes without them even knowing it. If you have apnea, you may need a sleeping device that gently forces air into your windpipe. If you don't have apnea, some docs recommend cognitive behavioral therapy: You work with a trained therapist to change how you think about sleep and learn sleep-inducing techniques (like how to set up your sleep space and what to do before bedtime). Some studies say CBT is as effective as pills -- if not more -- and has no side effects. Health.com: Health risks of snoring and sleep apnea . ""Often people attribute everything bad that happens to them, including being angry and crabby, to lack of sleep,"" says Donna Arand, Ph.D., clinical director of the Kettering Sleep Disorders Center in Kettering, Ohio. ""It puts such a burden on sleep that not sleeping gets blown out of proportion."" CBT changes that kind of distorted thinking and in some cases is prescribed along with a pill. Q: Should I try over-the-counter drugs before a prescription pill? A: Many sleep experts aren't fans of OTC sleep aids because the meds don't usually help people with significant insomnia. And many -- like Nytol, Simply Sleep, Som­inex, and Unisom -- contain antihistamines (similar to the allergy medicine Benadryl) that can have side effects like dry mouth and eyes and next-day grogginess, Arand says. OTC sleep aids are best for people who have occasional sleep problems. Note: Women who breast-feed should avoid them, as should the elderly, who sometimes are more sensitive to the effects of antihistamines. Q: If I take a prescription pill and still can't fall asleep, can I take another? A: If you're taking a short-acting drug, such as Sonata, Rozerem, or Ambien -- and it's still early in the evening -- you can take another pill. Short-acting medications kick in and then fade out, which is why they are prescribed for people who have trouble falling asleep. Health.com: Is stress causing your insomnia? ""They last about three or four hours, so you could take another pill up until about 3 a.m. because it would metabolize before you wake up,"" says Ana Krieger, M.D., a sleep specialist at New York University. (The timing depends on your sleep schedule, of course, and it's always wise to check with your doctor, she adds.) Longer-acting drugs like the time-released Ambien CR or Lunesta -- for people who have trouble falling and staying asleep -- shouldn't be taken more than once a night. Q: Is it safe for me to take a sleeping pill at 11 p.m. if I had a glass of wine or a cocktail around 6 p.m.? A: It's probably OK, doctors say, but the sleeping pill won't work as well as it should. Here's why: ""Alcohol becomes a stimulant about three to four hours after you drink it, so you're actually working against your sleep medication,"" Arand says. ""It's a terrible combination."" Never drink and then immediately take a sleep aid. Why? Alcohol acts like a sedative at first, so you'd essentially be getting a double dose of sedatives. This can dangerously slow your heart rate and lead to dizziness, fainting, and shallow breathing, which can deprive your body of oxygen and damage brain cells. Worst case: You may even stop breathing altogether. Health.com: 11 kinds of insomnia . Because everyone metabolizes food and alcohol at different rates, there are no safety absolutes when it comes to the minimum number of hours you should wait between consuming alcohol and taking a sleeping pill, experts say. ""But if you're at a dinner party and really want a drink, have the alcohol early,"" Krieger says. ""Then eat dessert without any alcohol and wait as long as possible before taking your sleeping pill."" Q: Can sleeping pills give me nightmares? A: Not usually, Arand says, ""but some sleep meds can suppress dream recall."" When you stop taking them, the dreams (and possibly nightmares) may return. The mechanism isn't fully understood, but once there's a withdrawal -- even just when the dosage wears off during the night -- vivid dreams can occur. Q: Can I safely take sleeping pills for several months? A: There are no known long-term health risks with most sleep aids, but some are more addictive than others. ""The newer medications like Ambien C.R., Sonata, Rozerem, and Lunesta have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration without a limit on how long they can be prescribed,"" Arand says. ""They have a small addiction potential, and some have been shown to be effective up to one year."" The older sleeping pills with secobarbital (Seconal) and pentobarbital (Nembutal) pose a much higher risk of addiction. Tolerance is a common problem with all sleeping pills: After taking them for a while, you need more than the usual dose to help you sleep, which may lead you to think you're addicted. If the drug doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to or if you're taking more than your prescribed dosage, tell your doctor; she can change or adjust your medication. Q: I've been taking sleeping pills for several months. What's the best way to wean myself off? A: With your doctor's help, gradually step down your meds. Generally, you want to reduce drugs by one clinical dose per week: If you're taking 10 milligrams of traditional Ambien a night, start taking 5 mg a night for a week, Arand recommends. Next, cut that pill in half and take that amount for a week. Then, stop taking the drug altogether. Medications in pill (not capsule) form that aren't time-release versions are OK to split. (You can split Ambien, for instance, but not Ambien CR.) Q: I've heard of rebound insomnia. Is it really harder to fall asleep and stay asleep without pills if I've taken them a few times? A: You might have some trouble, Krieger says, though it's less likely with the newer pills -- these include Rozerem, Sonata, and Lunesta. ""Give it a few days to adjust after you stop taking the medication,"" Arand explains. If you still can't sleep, talk to your physician. Rebound insomnia is one of the reasons some experts recommend CBT over sleep medications. Q: If I don't want to use sleeping pills, are natural remedies worth trying? A: Yes, but don't expect miracles. Melatonin, a sleep hormone your body makes naturally, and the herb valer­ian may be helpful (both are available at drugstores), but some experts feel there's a lack of research to back up the effectiveness of these supplements. Plus, they're not regulated like drugs, so you don't always know what you're getting. That said, if you want to try melatonin, take 0.2 to 1 mg about four hours before bedtime: ""It's safe to take every day,"" Krieger says. ""As we age, our bodies secrete less of it, so taking a supplement can be helpful."" Melatonin may be particularly beneficial when you travel several time zones to the east (like Europe) and have trouble falling asleep. As for valerian, there's no recommended dosage, and it's not clear how the herb works. Before using any supplement, check with your doctor; combining them with other medications -- sleeping pills or otherwise -- can be risky.

"(CNN) -- Head football coach Joe Paterno and the university president have lost their jobs, effective immediately, over a child sex abuse scandal at Penn State, university trustees announced Wednesday night. John P. Surma, vice chairman of trustees, said that President Graham Spanier was being replaced and Paterno, the longtime head football coach, would not finish the remainder of the season. Tom Bradley will be Penn State head coach in Joe Paterno's absence. Rod Erickson, executive vice president and provost of the school, will be interim president, school officials said. Spanier has been president of the school since 1995. Earlier, Paterno, 84, issued a statement saying he was ""absolutely devastated by the developments"" involving a former assistant football coach and two university officials and that he would end his 46-year tenure as head football coach at the end of the season. The trustees decided to move that timetable up. ""I grieve for the children and their families, and I pray for their comfort and relief,"" Paterno said. ""With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" Paterno's contract is set to expire at the end of the season. Some had called for him to resign immediately because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant, who said he had seen retired defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, now 67, sexually assaulting a young boy in a shower at the campus football complex. Paterno reported the allegations to his boss. Pennsylvania's attorney general said it appeared Paterno had met his obligations under state law, but critics have said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police. Sandusky, who was arrested Saturday, is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded to help troubled youths, prosecutors said. Two Penn State officials are accused of failing to report the alleged abuse. The U.S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year. ""In addition, in certain cases, the institution must issue a timely warning if a reported crime represents a threat to the campus community,"" it said in a statement. ""If these allegations of sexual abuse are true then this is a horrible tragedy for those young boys. If it turns out that some people at the school knew of the abuse and did nothing or covered it up, that makes it even worse,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement. ""Schools and school officials have a legal and moral responsibility to protect children and young people from violence and abuse."" Athletes, fans and students grappled with implications of the widening scandal. A ""Blue Out"" will be held at Saturday's game against Nebraska. An unofficial Facebook page encouraged fans to wear blue ""to support the victims of child abuse worldwide. The Blue Ribbon Campaign against child abuse began 22 years ago and is recognized across the country. In addition to being the color of our team's home game jerseys, blue represents the color of bruises that have too often been neglected."" Sophomore linebacker Dakota Royer told CNN that Paterno told players of his retirement plans Wednesday morning during a team meeting. Many of the approximately 150 players, coaches and school officials in attendance had tears in their eyes, Royer said. Meanwhile, a tip line has been receiving calls from alleged victims of Sandusky, a source close to the investigation said, and police were attempting to verify the claims. State Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that the alleged failure of Timothy Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, to report abuse claims ""likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years."" Curley and Schultz, who are each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse, were released Monday on $75,000 bail each. Their attorneys have declared that the men are innocent. Curley and Schultz stepped down late Sunday after an emergency meeting of the university's board of trustees. The case has raised questions on how Penn State officials handled allegations. Curley's successor, acting athletics director Mark C. Sherburne, said the school is entrusted with the lives of young people. ""We are outraged that a valued trust has been broken,"" he said on Penn State's sports website Wednesday. ""We can promise you that we are doing everything in our power to restore that broken trust. Everyone within athletics -- coaches, administrators, staff and student-athletes -- are committed to this pledge."" CNN's Jason Carroll, Jason Kessler, Laura Dolan and Kiran Khalid contributed to this report.","Trustees dismiss Spanier, remove Paterno as head coach immediately .

"(CNN) -- Jim Carrey has been making audiences laugh for years, but the star says he's really a ""weird, serious person."" Jim Carrey is a star on the big screen, but he says he would love to do a play on Broadway. He says he's battled depression and loves to do drama as much as the funny stuff. Fans of his lighter side, though, may be glad to see his latest film is a comedy, ""Yes Man,"" which opens in theaters Friday. Carrey spoke with CNN's Larry King about his life on and off the screen. King: How did you get this project? Carrey: I think projects find me. You know, it's really interesting. Everything I've done, from ""The Truman Show,"" the ""Eternal Sunshine"" to ""Yes Man"" and ""Bruce Almighty,"" always come into my life at the perfect time. King: So have you turned down anything you regretted? Carrey: I never regret. ... [But] you know, ""Meet the Parents"" was something that I was developing. King: You turned that down? Carrey: Yes. I actually created the Fockers in a creative meeting. Yes. But, it was perfect that Ben Stiller did it. When I saw it, I went, ""That's the way it's supposed to be done."" King: The premise of ""Yes Man"" is what? Carrey: It's a gentleman by the name of Carl Allen, who has kind of stopped living. He got hurt in a relationship and he just kind of went into his shell, and he decided to say no to life. And he decides that, at a certain point, that he's kind of losing touch with everything. He runs into a guru -- a new-age master played by Terrence Stamp. ...  And he makes a covenant with this man that he will say yes to everything no matter how ridiculous it is. King: Isn't ""no"" the hardest word to say? Carrey: It is hard for me. Especially when you've got money. It's like, you know, there's so many people, man.  Watch Carrey's interview with Larry King » . King: Are you the most comfortable with comedy? Carrey: No, I love it all, honestly. I love -- I love being creative. ... I feel so lucky to be given all of these opportunities, to be able to do a movie like ""Ace Ventura"" and then do ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine,"" and to be able to do the ""Yes Man,"" which is flat-out comedy and that has a little something to think about. King: Ever want to do Broadway? Carrey: Sure, sure. I'll do that. King: Do a play? Carrey: I would love to do it. I hope I could do it. King: How did you and [girlfriend Jenny McCarthy] -- how did that happen? Carrey: It's funny how that happens when you're in a place that's really wonderful. I had already gotten to a place in my life where I felt at peace, and I was invited to David Spade's birthday party. And I went out there that night and I was just in a zone. And I just felt wonderful. It was one of those times when you don't have to be anywhere but where you are. King: And you had no girlfriend? Carrey: I had no girlfriend at the time. I mean, I was just knocking them off one after another. It was just sick. But -- so I went to the party. And I just stood there in the middle of the room and kind of had that feeling like I was everything I felt. And she looked at me, and she said, ""You just looked so peaceful that I had to come and talk to you."" King: What did you think when you saw her? Carrey: I went -- well, I mean, I'd seen her a bunch of times, never in person. But I just thought -- well, she's nothing like the persona, like the ""Singled Out"" person that I met -- or that I knew, that I had seen. Because I don't think I wanted to go out with that person. You know? She was brilliant, but that wasn't the choice I would make. She was completely different than that. She was really sweet. King: And that's magic when it hits? Carrey: Yes. Beautiful. King: You can't predict it? Carrey: No. You're just lucky while it's there, you know. That's all, just lucky. King: Are you going to marry Jenny? Carrey: No. I am married to Jenny. I love Jenny very much, and we have a great relationship. And we've both been married a couple times. ... I like it the way it is, and I think she likes it the way it is. You know? And that's all we need. I really don't, at this point of my life, feel like I need to have the approval of someone in the collar or a judge to tell us that our relationship is sacred. King: Didn't you suffer from depression? Carrey: Yes. King: How did you get through that to this? Carrey: Well, that's another thing. You know at the risk of like opening up the whole Tom Cruise Prozac argument, you know, I don't disagree in many ways. I think Prozac and things like that are very valuable to people for short periods of time. But I believe if you're on them for an extended period of time, you never get to the problem. You never get to see what the problem is, because everything is just kind of OK. And so, you don't deal. And people deal when they get desperate. King: So how did you do it? Carrey: I take supplements. ... It's a wonderful thing. It's amazing. I'm going to talk a lot about it in the near future. King: You're going to write about it?

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An American doctor was killed when gunmen on motorcycles riddled his body with bullets while he was visiting a graveyard in Pakistan, authorities said. Dr. Mehdi Ali Qamar was a cardiologist and resident of Fairfield, Ohio. He arrived in Rabwah town in Punjab three days ago to provide free medical care to heart patients. The doctor was visiting a local graveyard at sunrise Monday when two waiting gunmen shot him and took off, according to Azhar Abbas, a local police official. The motive of the killing is unclear. Qamar died instantly, and pictures of his bloodied body have gone viral on social media. The doctor, who's also a poet and an artist, was visiting the graveyard with his wife and 3-year-old son when the shooting took place. Qamar is a Pakistan native, but has Canadian and U.S. citizenship. He is the second member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community killed in Pakistan this year. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community members have been constantly persecuted in Pakistan since 1974, when a constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim. A decade later, President Muhammad Zia ul Haq's military regime amended Pakistan's penal code. This barred Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims and led to a hate campaign against their community. Khalil Ahmad, 61, was arrested on blasphemy charges and fatally shot this month while in police custody in the Punjab town of Sharqpur. He was shot dead by a man who came in to serve food to prison inmates, according to Saleem Uddin, a spokesman for the Ahmadi community. Qamar's family will travel to Canada to bury his body in Toronto. ""He had no enemies,"" the spokesman said. ""He was a gentle man who enjoyed playing cricket."" ""Our community will continue to provide services to this country, It is this ongoing process of hate and discrimination that needs to be stopped in Pakistan.""

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray will look to clinch the 29th singles title of his career on Sunday when he faces Spain's Tommy Robredo in the final of the inaugural Shenzhen Open in China. Murray, who is bidding to win his first title since lifting the Wimbledon crown almost 15 months ago, was made to work hard by his semifinal opponent Juan Monaco. The Argentine threatened to end the Murray's run after taking the first set before the Scot battled back eventually running out a 2-6 6-3 6-0 winner in one hour 42 minutes. ""It's been a tough year for me,"" Murray said, ATPTour.com reported. ""The first few months coming back from surgery were hard, then I lost a bit of confidence. But I've felt better the past few months and hopefully I can have a strong end to the season."" Robredo, meanwhile, reached his 21st ATP Tour final of his career in easier fashion beating Colombia's Santiago Giraldo 6-1 6-4 in 70 minutes. Victory for Murray on Sunday would not only cap a welcome return to form but also boost his chances of reaching the ATP Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena in November. Murray is currently 11th in the standings and needs to picks up at least three places to guarantee his participation in the lucrative season finale. Kvitova books place in WTA Finals .

"(CNN) -- Russian energy giant Gazprom has accused Ukraine of siphoning off gas intended for European customers as the standoff between them worsens. Gazprom deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev has accused the Ukraine of siphoning gas. Gazprom shut off Ukraine's gas supply on Thursday after saying it owed $2 billion in missed payments. Ukraine denies owing the money and is currently meeting its domestic needs with supplies from storage facilities. Gazprom has reassured Europe that its natural gas supply, which runs through Ukraine, will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev. However, analysts are concerned that if the two sides do not reach a new agreement there will be a supply cut in the next two weeks. Poland reported a drop in its supply on Saturday. Gazprom deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev said the Ukraine had ""declared, rather cynically, that it take gas from the export pipe."" ""Balkan states have already started to suffer from the moves of the Ukrainian side,"" he said. ""In this respect, the Balkan states, if they consider themselves hit in this situation, should use legal means they have in the frames of the Energy Charter in order to prevent the escalation of these events.""  Watch a report on Gazprom's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine » . Meanwhile, Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said Naftogaz Ukrainy, responsible for Ukraine's gas payments, may have paid the amount it owed but it would not arrive until January 11 because of the holiday season. ""This will settle the overdue penalties and part of the debt for gas supplies. The remaining debt for gas will be in this case $614 million. ""The contract for this year hasn't been signed yet. Naftogaz Ukrainy has withdrawn from the talks. The negotiating group is in Kiev and so far hasn't expressed its readiness to arrive in Moscow. Due to the absence of a contract for gas deliveries to Ukraine, gas isn't being supplied,"" Kupriyanov said. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian delegation is in Europe meeting leaders to seek help to end the crisis. Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine.","Russia's energy monopoly Gazprom accused Ukraine of siphoning supplies .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hailed his first one-on-one meeting Tuesday with India's newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""historic opportunity"" for the two nations. A firm but simple handshake had sent a message to the world on Monday that the heads of India and Pakistan were ready to talk. And talk they did on Tuesday, in a meeting at Hyderabad House, a former palace in New Delhi, that lasted almost 50 minutes. Briefing reporters after the encounter, Sharif described the meeting as ""good and constructive"" and ""held in warm and cordial atmosphere."" Sharif said both countries should work to overcome their mutual mistrust, and that regional peace and stability were key to achieving their common goals of development. Sharif said he intended ""pick up the threads"" of the Lahore Declaration, referring to a pledge both countries made in 1999 to cooperate more closely to ease tensions. The Pakistani premier also said that accusations and counter-accusations are not productive -- a comment on the regular political back-and-forth between their two nations. ""We agreed that our meeting should be a historic opportunity for both our countries,"" he said. He added that he was ""very pleased"" to be in New Delhi at Modi's invitation, having flown in for his counterpart's inauguration on Monday. Sharif was part of the biggest gathering of South Asian leaders ever assembled for an Indian prime minister's swearing-in. Emotional response . In a series of tweets posted after Monday's inauguration ceremony, Modi revealed the two had exchanged remarks. Sharif ""shared some very emotional things,"" Modi said, before recounting a rather strange story Sharif told him about how his mother became emotional while watching television images of Modi's own mother offering him sweets. In an interview with Indian television station NDTV, Sharif was reported to have described his attendance at Modi's inauguration as a ""great opportunity, a great moment."" ""He said that this strong mandate frees up leaders on both sides ... to actually turn a new page in the history of India and Pakistan,"" NDTV's Barkha Dutt said. Long dispute . Relations have been strained between the two countries since 1947, the year the Asian subcontinent partitioned into Islamic Pakistan and Hindu-majority India as it gained independence from British rule. In the decades since, they have fought a number of wars and clashed over Kashmir, an 86,000 square-mile region to the north. Efforts to agree a peace deal took a major step back in 2008 when Pakistani militants attacked the Indian city of Mumbai, killing more than 160 people in a series of co-ordinated assaults. In 2011, the two countries agreed to return to the negotiating table and since then relations have continued to thaw. In 2012, former President Asif Ali Zardari became the first Pakistani leader to visit India in seven years. He held talks with then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who emerged from the 30-minute meeting saying both nations were willing to find ""practical and pragmatic"" solutions to their differences. Zardari described the talks as ""fruitful."" Sharif is said to have expressed the same optimism for the countries' relationship in his interview with NDTV on Monday. ""Both governments have a strong mandate. This could help in turning a new page in our relations,"" Sharif told NDTV. ""We should remove fears, mistrust and misgivings about each other. Both countries should rid the region of instability and security that has plagued us for decades.""

"(CNN) -- Costa Rican officials surveyed damage Wednesday after a major earthquake rattled the country's northwest coast. The 7.6-magnitude quake was ""one of the strongest earthquakes"" ever to hit the Central American nation, President Laura Chinchilla said. The president praised residents' response, saying there were no reports of major physical damage from the quake. ""Costa Ricans knew how to react,"" she said. The quake struck Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula Wednesday morning, on the Pacific coast about 87 miles west of the capital, San Jose. It was centered more than 28 miles deep. Schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed Thursday and Friday while engineers inspect buildings for damage, Chinchilla said. Officials gave conflicting reports about whether anyone had been killed. Late Wednesday Chinchilla said there were ""no human losses,"" but earlier emergency officials said at least one person had died from a heart attack suffered during the quake. ""It started out pretty mild, but then it really got going,"" said Bill Root, owner of a hotel in Samara, also near the epicenter. ""It was a very strong earthquake. Everything was falling off the shelves and the ground was rolling."" Costa Rica's National Emergency Commission reported debris on roads, electrical outages and some structural damage in homes, especially on the Nicoya Peninsula, about 14 kilometers (8 miles) from the epicenter. Red Cross ambulances evacuated patients from two damaged hospitals, said Enrique Guevara, a spokesman for the Red Cross in the Americas. Hours after the quake, authorities canceled all tsunami warnings and watches. CNN affiliate Teletica showed people streaming out of buildings when the earthquake hit. Telephone service was knocked out in cities near the epicenter, Teletica reported. The station showed photos submitted by viewers of a partially collapsed bridge over the Rio Sucio and a landslide on a highway. Other photos showed floors littered with merchandise inside stores and homes with minor damages. ""It's unnerving when solid concrete beneath you is shaking from side to side. It was pretty scary,"" said David Boddinger, editor of the English-language Tico Times in San Jose. Seismologists have been predicting a strong quake in that area for years now, and Costa Ricans were wondering if this was the big one, he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Antoinette Campbell and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","NEW: Costa Rica's president says the quake is one of the strongest to hit the country .

"(CNN) -- Neil Patrick Harris isn't a foul-mouthed rocker -- he just plays one on Broadway -- but he's had some people fooled. The 40-year-old actor is starring in the musical ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" as the titular German transgender performer, and he's so immersed in his character when on stage that not even an excited fan can pull him out of it. He proved that at an April 19 performance, when, according to the New York Post's Page Six, one supporter yelled out ""I love you, Neil!"" while the actor was on stage as Hedwig. Since he was in the middle of a show, Harris swiftly responded the way Hedwig would respond: ""I'm doing something up here, motherf****r!"" The Post reports that the audience loved it, but apparently not everyone has. On Twitter, Harris has had to clarify that he wasn't swearing at a fan; he was playing a part. ""Take a breath,"" Harris told an angered observer who chastised the actor for his ""outburst."" ""I'm playing a character. Who is harsh. That's the show. That's Hedwig."" ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is the kind of production that welcomes improv, and audience participation can be used as a springboard for that. When the Harris fan confessed her love for the actor on Saturday, Harris worked it into his act as he's supposed to, his rep tells Gossip Cop. ""When the fan initially yelled, 'I love you, Neil,' Neil (as Hedwig) then responded, 'Who's Neil? I'm not Neil.' He then looked over at Yitzhak (portrayed by Lena Hall) and said, 'Are you Neil? You better not be Neil,' followed by Hedwig then offering the quote in question. It was all done in good fun, and fully in the context of the show.""

"(CNN) -- Back in the pool for the first time since 2012, Michael Phelps was close to his peerless best. The most decorated Olympian of all time raced to a second-place finish in the 100m butterfly final in front of a sell-out crowd at the Skyline Aquatic Center, Arizona. Phelps came up two-tenths of a second short of an instant return to winning ways with a time of 51.93 seconds -- coming in just behind his longtime rival and friend Ryan Lochte. Phelps time ranks as the fourth fastest this year, and -- although two seconds slower than his own 49.82 world record -- the 28-year-old was satisfied. ""I said I wanted to be around 52.0 and I would be completely happy with that,"" Phelps told ESPN, before reiterating that has future was still undecided. ""It's one meet; it's one race. It's a long way whether I decide to continue or not."" A 628-day wait . The 1,200 people in attendance might have been a few less than the 17,000 he entertained at his last race -- the gold medal-winning 4x100 medley relay at the London Olympics -- but the 18-time Olympic gold medalist told reporters he hadn't felt so nervous about a race since he was a 10-year-old. Phelps retired after winning an unprecedented 22nd Olympic medal on 4 August 2012 and embarked on a year of travel and golfing with little mention of a return to swimming. But Phelps sparked speculation about a potential comeback by re-entering the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's testing program last November -- which began a nine-month wait required before a swimmer can again compete. Taking to the pool in competition for the first time in 628 days, he had cruised through his qualifying heat with the fastest time of 52.84 seconds, just ahead of Lochte who went on to win the final in the second fastest time in the world this year. ""I probably wouldn't have gone that time if Phelps wasn't in that pool with me. We push each other all the time,"" said Lochte. ""Down there at the turn I kind of peeked over and I saw him and almost started smiling,"" Lochte said, at which point, Phelps interjected: ""Why? Because you were ahead?"" The future . Phelps is still non-committal on his swimming future, and declared himself happy to have shed his post-retirement weight gain, and post a strong time. ""This was awesome. I'm really excited about how things went. I do know what I need to do if I want to continue and swim faster."" He will also race in today's 50m freestyle in Arizona but, beyond that, he has not yet committed to the U.S. national championships in August or next year's world championships in Kazan, Russia. Inevitably the question of a return to Olympic action arose -- with a potential fifth games in Brazil now just over two years away. But Phelps says he is taking ""one step at a time."" For now, the screaming crowd and Lochte's delighted welcome mark a tentative beginning to the legend's comeback. ""With what he's done for the sport of swimming and him leaving kind of broke my heart a little because I love getting on those blocks and racing him,"" said Lochte. ""Now that he's back I've got a big ol' smile on my face."" And for Phelps, too, the enjoyment is just starting: ""You're going to hear this word come out of my mouth a lot,"" he told reporters, ""but I was having fun.""","Michael Phelps finishes second in his first race since 2012 .

"(CNN) -- He's created some of the world's highest-earning stage shows, so it's only fitting that Andrew Lloyd Webber will be in the limelight on the day of the planet's most expensive horse race. The man behind hits such as ""Cats,"" ""Starlight Express"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"" also has a big interest in the sport of kings, through which he met his third wife Madeleine -- a former equestrian rider who competed alongside Britain's Princess Anne. Married since 1991, they have owned a stud on a 5,000-acre site in Watership Down (setting for the 1970s novel and film of the same name) which has produced a series of winners. The latest is The Fugue -- a filly who has already amassed earnings in excess of $1.5 million and boasts her own Twitter page with more than 1,000 followers. The name is befitting of her owners -- the fugue being the most complex polyphonic musical form, involving imitation -- while the literal translation of ""to chase"" is considerably more apt for the animal. ""I've ridden a lot of good horses in a relatively short period of time and she's right up there with the very best. She's a superstar,"" says jockey William Buick, who rode her for the first time less than two weeks ago. The Fugue will not be lining up in the showpiece $10 million Dubai World Cup, which is run on artificial turf, but will compete earlier Saturday in the Dubai Duty Free Stakes -- which has a relatively paltry $5 million on offer and is held on a traditional surface. It is the richest day of thoroughbred racing on the planet, with $27.25 million up for grabs in total. ""She's a filly whose best form, her only form, is on the turf,"" says trainer John Gosden. ""Had it been the end of the season we might have thought differently. ""But this is her very first race of the year so we felt it best as a filly to run her on the surface she knows and likes best even if the distance is slightly shorter than she might normally run over."" Last year The Fugue won the Irish Champion Stakes Group One race and came second at the prestigious Breeders' Cup in the U.S. She is the bookmakers' favorite this weekend -- though punters at the $1 billion Meydan Racecourse will not be able to bet on the outcome due to Dubai's rules against gambling. ""She's a talented filly and she's won some lovely races but a couple of times she's been unlucky and not had the rub of the green,"" says Gosden, a former economist who -- with Buick -- makes up an unconventional team behind The Fugue. If Madeleine Lloyd Webber -- who met the theater impresario through his horse-loving neighbors in the southern English county of Hampshire -- is the mastermind behind the stud since its inception in 1992, then Gosden is the former ""wayward son"" who has rediscovered his true path in life. ""I met them some years ago training close to where they live,"" he says. ""Obviously for Andrew the horses wouldn't be his primary focus but he and his wife are great horse people."" The son of a famous trainer -- John ""Towser"" Gosden, who won the 1966 Epsom Derby a year before he died -- he initially veered away from following in his footsteps. He studied economics at Cambridge University where he met his lawyer wife Rachel Hood -- now chairwoman of the UK's Racehorse Owners' Association -- and excelled in the discus and javelin rather than pursuing any equine sporting feats. ""I tried to forge my own path away from racing, which was why I went into land management initially,"" Gosden recalls. ""At the time, we were in a massive recession and it was (UK Prime Minister) Edward Heath's three-day week (to conserve the nation's energy supplies), so going abroad made sense."" He went as far as South America, but never lost his passion for horse racing. ""I think it was just instilled in me,"" Gosden says. ""When working in Venezuela I'd still be up at 4:30 in the morning with the horses there before going to work in an architect's office."" Returning to racing as an assistant trainer, he moved to California in the 1970s before attaining an American licence at the end of the decade. His big break came in 1983 with Bates Motel, a horse named after the celebrated establishment in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 movie Psycho, when it won the prestigious Santa Anita Handicap -- California's richest race for older horses. ""It was an apt name,"" recalls Gosden. ""He was quite a character and he had a vicious side to him. But that's not how he got his name -- I believe the owners, the Getty Family, were simply big fans of Alfred Hitchcock's movies. ""For me in America, that was my first big win but it was easier to get started out there than back in the UK. It was a golden era of racing there. Everyone needs a break in life and that was mine."" In 1989 he returned to the UK where he has been based ever since at a series of different stables, with more than 2,000 race wins including the Epsom Derby, the Breeders' Cup Classic, the 1,000 Guineas, the St. Leger twice and the Dubai Sheema Classic, and being crowned British flat racing champion trainer in 2012. More recently, many of those successes have come with Buick on board. Many eyebrows were raised when Gosden hired the then 21-year-old novice to become his stable jockey in 2010. Much of the horse-racing fraternity said he was mad, but the results have proved otherwise. Photos: Bubbles and cuddles as Dubai parties . Buick's passage into racing is not the most oft taken. Born in Norway -- not renowned for being a breeding ground for top jockeys -- he had some pedigree; his Scottish father Walter was an eight-time Scandinavian champion jockey while his Danish mother Maria was a dressage rider and showjumper. ""We have a very close relationship as a family and I was always surrounded by horses,"" he recalls. ""Dad was a very successful jockey while my Mum had a lot of wins as an amateur jockey too while being an equestrian rider."" With limited opportunities in Norway, Buick decided to move to the UK when he was 16 to start an apprenticeship. ""Thankfully, I never really looked back as I got good breaks in life,"" he says. ""You have to have ability but you need those breaks too. I got those -- a good bit of luck really."" The biggest break of all was the tie-up with Gosden, who he admits ""took a punt on me."" That almost immediately paid off at the same Meydan Racecourse where he hopes to shine on Saturday, with victory on Dar Re Mi in the 2010 Sheema Classic -- a similar caliber Group One race to the Dubai Duty Free Stakes. ""This race is not going to be easy by any stretch of the imagination,"" Buick says. ""She's a classy filly and has proved she can take on the best in the world. I'm not going to say she'll win, as so many things can happen, but she's got a great chance."" All eyes will be on the race at Meydan -- the day before Gosden turns 63. The veteran trainer will be hoping The Fugue makes it a birthday to remember.","The Fugue bids to take on the world's best in the richest day of racing on the planet .

"(CNN) -- Payday lenders aren't the most scrupulous of operations. Preying on the desperation of people who don't have enough money to make it to their next payday, these lenders dole out short-term loans with exorbitant interest rates, forcing already cash-strapped customers deeper into debt. And while many have tried to reform the payday lending industry, we're still awaiting the right answer. Ram Palaniappan has a new approach. He wants to solve the problem at its root, by eradicating the payday altogether. According to Palaniappan, the real culprit here is the very concept of the payday. The way he sees it, there's no reason people who already have done their work should have to wait several days, or even weeks, to get the money they've rightfully earned. So, in May, Palaniappan launched ActiveHours. The Palo Alto startup, which recently raised $4.1 million, makes an app that allows hourly workers to immediately access pay they've already earned, without having to wait for their employer's standard pay cycle. What's more, there are no fees. Instead, ActiveHours makes money on tips, asking users to pay what they want. ""We're trying to build something that's completely aligned with the consumer, unlike what people are used to today in typical financial services, where it's, in some ways, adversarial,"" he says. Palaniappan is far from the only entrepreneur who sees opportunity in creating an alternative to the payday loan. LendUp, for instance, has raised $64 million to offer loans with lower interest rates that become cheaper over time. ZestFinance, launched by an ex-Googler, is similar. But even these players still rely on fees, both for profit and protection. In this demographic, after all, there tends to be a high rate of delinquency, so even the most upstanding lenders typically account for those losses upfront. But with its no-fee model, ActiveHours is a radical departure. It's also riskier. The company is betting that when given the choice, its customers -- already struggling financially -- will still pay for the service it provides. ""Some people look at the model and think we're crazy,"" Palaniappan says, ""but we tested it and found the model is sufficient to building a sustainable business."" Unlocking the Money You've Already Earned . This is not Palaniappan's first financial services company. In 2004, he launched RushCard, a startup that allowed people without access to a traditional bank account to get their paychecks loaded onto a prepaid ATM card. The goal was to offer the so-called ""under-banked"" an alternative to going to Western Union or other check cashing businesses, which take a large cut of every transaction. While Palaniappan was working at RushCard, though, he learned that an employee working in the call center had recently taken a payday loan. He immediately wrote her a personal check and told her to pay it off as soon as possible. ""I didn't want anyone who worked for me to have to use payday loans,"" he says. That's when he realized that there should be an easier way for employees to unlock the money they'd already earned. When he left RushCard in 2012 after selling it to a private equity firm, he began experimenting with ways to automate such a service. It's a complex process that requires verifying who an employee is, where he works, how much he's worked, and what his hourly wage is. Then there's the equally difficult process of integrating with banks to deposit and withdraw funds from each user's existing bank account. Palaniappan and several of his RushCard team members spent about a year developing the technology and launched the app publicly in May. Back then, ActiveHours was handling transactions for employees from 100 different employers. Today, it's 250 employers, including the likes of Best Buy, Starbucks, and even major banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America. How It Works . Employees can sign up for Active Hours on their own, providing their bank account number. They use the app to upload a photo of their electronic time sheets (paper time sheets aren't allowed). ActiveHours knows which systems are used by most employers, so it uses a photo of the system to verify the timesheet is real and checks the hours logged against past deposits made into the user's bank account. ActiveHours also uses geolocation to ensure the user was at work when he took the photo. Once a user has been approved, he can see how much money he's already earned and transfer any percentage of it into his bank account. ActiveHours essentially gives the user a cash advance and deposits it into the user's account the next day. When payday rolls around, ActiveHours withdraws the same amount from the user's account. And at the end of it all, users can opt to pay ActiveHours a couple bucks -- or nothing at all. Unusual as that may sound, Palaniappan isn't the only one who believes in the concept. ActiveHours has caught the attention of Ribbit Capital, a financial services investment firm that typically only invests in late stage companies. According to Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital, what Palaniappan and his crew are building is so special, though, the firm was compelled to join ActiveHours' seed round. ""It's a very powerful concept,"" Malka says. ""As we move into this on-demand economy, your payroll should be the same way."" The Threat of Abuse . Still, not everyone is as convinced. According to Adair Morse, assistant professor of finance at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, ActiveHours is a smart idea that's meeting a very real need for low cost alternatives to payday loans. And yet, she says, ActiveHours may be overly vulnerable to abuse. Although people are only borrowing money they've already earned, Morse says it's still possible that when ActiveHours tries to withdraw money from a user's account on payday, the money will already be gone. Then, there's the fact that ActiveHours relies on donations, meaning it's susceptible to what economists call the free rider problem. ""People assume someone else is better able to step up and contribute,"" she says. ""This whole idea of donations sounds great, but we're talking about people who are constrained. They don't have savings. They have debt."" And, if the donation model doesn't work, Morse points out, ActiveHours reserves the right to change its fee structure at any point. But Palaniappan says that, so far, such abuses have not been a major issue. The bigger problem, he says, is convincing people ActiveHours isn't just another payday lender tricking people into a cycle of debt. ""People aren't used to the model, so they think it's too good to be true,"" he says. ""They're judging us with a standard that's completely terrible. What we're doing is not too good to be true. It's what we've been living with that's too bad to be allowed."" Read more from WIRED: . What Exactly Is in McDonald's Famous French Fries?

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Saying ""there is no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons attack in Syria: the Syrian regime,"" Vice President Joe Biden signaled Tuesday that the United States -- with its allies -- was ready to act. ""Those who use chemical weapons against defenseless men, women and children should and must be held accountable,"" Biden said in a speech to the American Legion. The vice president's remarks echo those made by other U.S. officials in recent days, as well as many of the nation's foremost allies. French President Francois Hollande said his administration was ""ready to punish those who made the decision to gas these innocent people,"" adding that ""everything leads us to believe"" that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces are responsible. British Prime Minister David Cameron -- who talked Tuesday with U.S. President Barack Obama -- called lawmakers back from their summer vacations to consider a response to Syria, as the UK military prepares contingency plans. And U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told the BBC on Tuesday that U.S. forces are ""ready to go"" if ordered to strike Syria by President Barack Obama. ""The options are there. The United States Department of Defense is ready to carry out those options,"" Hagel said. Western leaders were reacting to a growing consensus that the Syrian regime was responsible for an August 21 attack that killed more than 1,300 people, most of them dying from exposure to toxic gases, according to rebel officials. The opposition -- which has said it's been targeted by chemical weapons attacks in the past as well -- backed up its latest allegations with gruesome video of rows of dead bodies, including women and children, with no visible wounds. Opinion: For U.S., Syria is truly a problem from hell . Syrian officials, though, have steadfastly denied using chemical weapons in this or other cases. Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said Tuesday that his government would never use such munitions against its own people, daring those who disagree to present evidence publicly. He said rebel forces were to blame for security concerns near the suspected chemical sites, arguing that Western leaders are using the claims as an excuse to go after al-Assad's regime. ""We all hear the drums of war,"" Moallem said. ""They want to attack Syria. I believe to use chemical weapons as a pretext is not a right."" And if foreign powers do strike the Middle Eastern nation, its foreign minister said the government and its forces will fight back. ""Syria is not easy to swallow,"" said Moallem. ""We have the materials to defend ourselves. We will surprise others."" U.N. inspectors in Syria, but what will they find? The United Nations has sent inspectors to Syria to try to get to the bottom of the wildly conflicting accounts of chemical warfare. The opposition says chemical payloads were among the ordnance fired into the rebel stronghold of Ghouta. The government, via state TV reports, claims that its forces came into contact with toxic gas Saturday in Jobar, on the edge of Damascus -- blaming this on ""terrorists,"" the term it commonly uses for rebel fighters. CNN could not independently confirm either account, including videos purported to show the aftermath of each. Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack . On Monday, U.N. inspectors visited the town of Moadamiyet al-Sham, despite a close call with snipers that left one of their vehicles damaged and an explosion nearby. The inspectors had been expected Tuesday to head to Ghouta, but that trip was pushed back a day ""in order to improve preparedness and safety for the team."" Moallem blamed rebel forces for failing to guarantee the U.N. group's safety and denying that its forces have delayed inspections by continually shelling Ghouta. Video posted Tuesday to YouTube purported to show the area being shelled, though CNN could not verify this video's authenticity. Yet Biden reiterated the claim that Syrian forces were shelling the suspected chemical attack site. And U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said it may be too late for a valid inspection of what happened -- saying ""too much time has passed"" and accusing al-Assad's government of using the U.N. investigation ""as a stalling tactic or a charade to hide behind."" The United States, meanwhile, is conducting its own investigation: An intelligence report detailing evidence of the alleged attack could be released as early as Tuesday, a U.S. official told CNN. The report will include forensic evidence and intercepted communications among Syrian military commanders, according to the official. The vice president said that beyond whatever inspectors do or do not find, common sense and the recent past point to one culprit. ""The Syrian regime are the only ones who have the weapons, have used chemical weapons multiple times in the past, have the means of delivering those weapons, have been determined to wipe out exactly the places that were attacked by chemical weapons,"" he said Tuesday. Russia leads international charge against strikes . The calls for a military response were not without opposition. Russia is leading the charge internationally, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov having said there is no proof yet Syria's government is behind last week's chemical attack. His office compares the Western allegations against Syria to claims Iraq was hoarding weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invasion in 2003 -- allegations that fell apart once American troops began searching for them. Intervening in Middle East turmoil: Mission impossible? And Tuesday, Russia's foreign ministry accused Washington of trying to ""create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention."" Moscow bemoaned the U.S. postponement of a meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday in The Hague, where top diplomats from both countries had planned to discuss the war in Syria. And Russia criticized the United States for, in its view, trying to bypass the U.N. Security Council to take action on the reported chemical attack. Should anything be moved through the U.N. council, Russia -- which has a permanent seat on it -- could block it. Still, that's what former British Foreign Secretary David Owen urged world leaders to do before unleashing missiles or warplanes on Syrian targets. Omran al-Zoubi, Syria's information minister, on Tuesday challenged the United States to ""present this proof to the rest of the world"" -- claiming that they are asking for trouble if they do not. ""If they don't have proof or evidence, then how are they going to stand up to the American public opinion and to the world public opinion and explain why they are attacking Syria?"" al-Zoubi told CNN from Damascus. Some worldwide have expressed concern that intervening in Syria may provoke broader conflict in the Middle East or ensnare Western powers in another bloody conflict after years of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cameron said that he understands those concerns, vowing that any action would have to be ""proportionate, ... legal (and) would have to be specifically about deterring the use of chemical weapons."" Still, he said it's critically important that action be taken to show the international taboo against chemical weapons will not be tolerated. ""This is not about wars in the Middle East; this is not even about the Syrian conflict,"" he said. ""It's about use of chemical weapons and making sure, as a world, we deter their use and we deter the appalling scenes we've all seen on our television screens.

"(CNN) -- Who in their right mind would swap the south of France for the Canadian Arctic in the middle of winter? A team of Airbus specialists testing the aircraft manufacturer's latest A350 XWB, that's who. Last week a team of engineers, mechanics and test pilots from the Toulouse-based company performed various extreme-weather trials on a test plane in Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut. The ground and in-air tests included operating the aircraft in temperatures reaching down to -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test. Like all new planes, the new model must be tested in extreme environmental condition, from freezing to intense heat. ""Coming to an extreme place means we can break everything,"" Airbus' head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters. Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways. Metals, such as steel and aluminum, contract at different rates. Lubricants may lose their viscosity, creating friction and wear issues for moving parts. Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle. The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia. Next stop is Qatar for hot-weather testing. How airports beat bad weather . For years Iqaluit, located on Baffin Island, has marketed itself as ""a premier cold-weather test site."" Airbus have tested there since the 1990s, while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing, Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials. But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places. In April 2010 Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner. In a test chamber the aircraft was given a ""cold soak"" and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit (-42.7 degrees Celsius) for hours. Later, it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), also for hours. See: Can airships open up Arctic region? ""These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe (and in all seasons),"" said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in a press statement. But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature. Initially scheduled for five days, Airbus' tests in Iqaluit were cut short, not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius -- too warm for the cold weather testing.

"(CNN) -- Assessment tests seem to be everywhere, measuring everything from intelligence to personality, ability, leadership potential -- you name it, they test it. But, how effective are these tests really at predicting job success? ""It's a bit like rolling a dice, but if done right it's better than nothing,"" says Robert Bacal, author of Performance Management. ""This is an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and not all these tests are equally good. The best way to gauge the result is to watch carefully what happens with your hires."" That's what they've been doing at A.P. Moller - Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, for nearly four decades. The company has been using and developing their own intelligence test, the content of which is considered so valuable a trade secret that it is done only in-house and on paper. Maria Pejter, senior director of group human resources, says the test helps minimize the uncertainty of the recruitment process. One key part of the test is analyzing intellect. ""Internal tests and academia tell us that all things being equal, the more intelligent you are the more likelihood there is that you will perform. In this case, smarter is better,"" she says. With more than 100,000 employees in 130 countries and tens of thousands of applications annually, it's also a purely practical approach - and one she says keeps paying off. ""I can go fishing in our pool of talent, knowing that any of our recruits have the cognitive ability to rise through the ranks."" Maersk's findings are in line with what most experts say -- that intelligence tests are fairly good at predicting people's performance across a range of jobs. But, they also agree that they are not the only answer. Robert P. Gandossy, one of the world's foremost experts on developing talent and leadership, and author of several books on the subject, says IQ tests can be notoriously problematic - especially when identifying leadership ability. ""Would having an IQ score a few points higher predict greater leadership potential? There is no evidence to support that claim,"" he says. Personality profiling can help give you insights into someone's leadership style, how they will interact with others, and where improvement might be needed. Pejter agrees, saying Maersk's success has in part been due to combining their intelligence test with a personality test. ""What we see is that any given personality trait may express itself quite differently. An assertive American and an assertive Japanese may express themselves differently, but their performances are equally valuable. By using a test we can avoid the bias that come with certain judgments and expectations, and because we hire people from all over the world that is important."" Most experts agree a proper combination of tests can supply you a greater understanding of how to motivate employees, fit them in the right jobs, and enhance their performance -- saving potentially millions of dollars in wrong hires and absenteeism. They also agree that the road to successful employee assessment is full of problems and potentially costly pitfalls. To get it right demands serious attention and commitment. John Arnold, chartered occupational psychologist at the Institute of work psychology, University of Sheffield, says not all personality tests are created equal. ""Check whether the test has been shown in other organizations to predict performance -- in the same type of job you are trying to fill."" Then, make sure the test takes into account the skills and personalities the job requires. That means doing a proper job analysis before you begin. ""Don't just base it on the style of people doing it now,"" he says, ""but on what the job truly requires."" ""Remember that jobs have personalities too"", says Robin Wood, president of Predictive Index (PI), Europe, who are behind the personality test Maersk uses. ""The demands of a bookkeeper in Japan would be broadly similar to that of a bookkeeper in Argentina - and the personality you are looking for in that case is someone who is conscientious, detail oriented, trustworthy and likes to work within a strong set of guidelines or and rules."" On the other hand, he adds, the job of a country president has a personality too. ""It needs a person that can take overview, make decisions, manage risk, deal with complexity, motivate and mobilize people to achieve goals."" Make sure you balance any type of assessment against other information like performance, observation, and feedback such as references - because they don't always tell the whole story. ""Within limits, most of us can operate very effectively in ways that are not within our preferred personality,"" says Arnold, noting that an extrovert can be perfectly capable of behaving calmly when appropriate. Also, remember that no test is foolproof. ""Experiments have shown that people can effectively fake personality tests when they want to,"" says Arnold. He says they may guess what an employer wants in order to get the job - a bad idea that can land both employee and employer in a bad situation. Ultimately, most experts agree that careful selection can pay off -- but only if done right. With decades of practical experience behind them, even Maersk knows there are no guarantees when predicting behavior. ""It's a game of probability,"" says Pejter.","Assessment tests are everywhere -- measuring everything from intelligence to leadership potential .
Some companies -- like shipping giant Maersk -- say their tests help deliver a strong workforce .
However, some people still question how well such tests can work ."
"(CNN) -- Prom night sends most teen girls on a dizzying quest for the perfect dress, accessories and hairstyle to make their ensemble complete. On her prom night, Jennifer DeFreece was harried by one simple detail: ""I just wanted eyebrows for my prom pictures."" When she was just a baby, DeFreece was diagnosed with alopecia totalis, an autoimmune disease that results in the total loss of scalp hair. By her 1st birthday, she'd lost all of her hair. ""I was like Charlie Brown,"" says DeFreece, now 33 and living in Northridge, California. Alopecia is nondiscriminatory. It can occur in men and women at any age and is a strictly physical disease, but sufferers say it's also a disease of the spirit, exacting a devastating emotional toll in this world of silky shampoo commercials and Rapunzel fairy tales. For those who experience it, particularly women who often self-identify with the color and style of their locks, it's about learning to manage the disease and not be defined by it. They choose a way to self-present: wig, no wig, clean shaven or a little of each. DeFreece ventured into wearing wigs in kindergarten as the childish innocence of her peers grew more inquisitive and uncensored. She continued to do so throughout junior high. At the time, the wigs available were ""very obvious,"" she says. Before then, being bald never seemed taboo; it was her normal. Then came sleepover age: A girl insisted DeFreece put a housecoat over the pillow where she would rest her head. To that girl, baldness was gross. In those years, DeFreece says she became more shy and hyperaware about what made her different. ""I hated it. I would wish that my hair would grow back,"" DeFreece says. In high school, when she realized people might make fun of her anyway, she took one a giant leap toward self-awareness: She decided to ditch the hairpiece and embrace the beauty of bald. Brave middle schooler tells peers she's bald . ""I thought, 'Let them make fun of somebody with a medical condition, let's see what happens,' "" she says. The response was mature: People backed off and even stood up for her. Learning to value yourself and not your hair . According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, a big part of the coping process is about ""learning to value yourself for who you are, not for how much hair you have or don't have."" Sue McHale is a psychology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University in England, and has extensively researched the psychological toll of the disease, including co-authoring the book, ""Coping with Alopecia."" ""Baldness, for whatever reason, is associated firstly with aging and secondly with illness,"" McHale said in an e-mail. ""So society is automatically shocked or fearful of this."" McHale's co-researcher and husband, Nigel Hunt, has alopecia universalis, the rarest form of the disease, one that results in total loss of body hair. (The most common form of alopecia is alopecia areata, which causes the hair to fall out in patches.) When McHale found there was hardly any psychological research done on the disease, they dug in. ""It opened up a floodgate of responses and many said that they felt no one had been listening to them for years,"" she says. It was no longer just a physical diagnosis. She says their research found that there was a perception from both sexes that it was worse for women; that it seemed more acceptable for men to appear bald. However, both men and women with alopecia aren't opting to go bald -- ""it is forced upon them, so in that way, they respond to it very much in the same way,"" she says. Those who are balding or are born with a hairless pate can experience embarrassment, hopelessness, hastiness for a ""quick fix,"" and, if a wig wearer, the fear that others might find out that their hair actually isn't their own. She found a man who didn't care about hair . For Lauren Crawford, 29, that feeling came to a head on a first date in high school. After a few previous dates didn't handle her diagnosis so well, she decided to lay it all out on the table that very first night, warning him that she had something to confess. ""'If you want to walk out the door, that's OK,'"" she remembers saying. ""Oh thank God,"" her date responded. ""That's it?!"" Crawford, of Macomb, Michigan, has been married to the man to whom she made that first-date confession for five years. Crawford, like DeFreece, received a diagnosis early on in life -- at 3 -- but didn't see more serious aspects of the disease, especially psychologically, until her senior year in high school. ""I didn't think anything of it,"" she says. Seeing a bald woman wasn't out of her realm of experience; her grandmother was going through chemotherapy at the same time. As her hairline changed rapidly in her teen years, she sought solace in scrunchies and scarves. When those no longer did the job, she and her mom went wig shopping. Her friends at the time started to call her ""Baldy"" and tugged at her hair. She admits feeling like she would never get married and never have kids. Now, she has both -- and an unforeseen career as a hairdresser. ""I always had a creative eye for hair; I was always creative in hiding my bald spots,"" says Crawford, who wears a wig every day, calling it ""an accessory."" For other women, Crawford has become an unlikely ally. She recounts how a woman came in heartbroken as the effects of chemotherapy laid her scalp bare. Crawford took her wig off and showed her true self; they wept together and talked through the change. ""It's just hair,"" she remembers saying. 'For me to walk out bald, it's so hard' Vanessa McWilliams, 30, of Calgary is in a more transitional period -- often forgoing the wigs that were her safety blankets for more than 20 years. ""I love who I am, but at the same time, for me to walk out bald, it's so hard because there's so much trauma growing up,"" she says, recalling jabs such as ""baldy"" throughout her teenage years. With the new hairless territory, she says she had to adapt to the occasional awkward moment of a stranger approaching her because they think she's sick. ""You're healthy! There's nothing wrong with you, but society still has to look at you. It's so hard to hear there's nothing wrong with you. The mentality of it is still a mental battle. It's really tricky,"" she says. Unlike DeFreece and Crawford, who were too young at the time of their diagnosis to comprehend the condition, McWilliams didn't receive her diagnosis until adolescence. ""From the date that I found my first bald spot (at age 9) until I was 17, I had a really big hatred for the word 'alopecia' and everything that it put me through,"" she says. McWilliams now operates Confident Curls, a mobile wig boutique specifically geared toward women who are coping with hair loss. Her epiphany: She's lived with this every single day and knows first-hand what people in the same situation need. ""I wish at 9 years old I had known that it was OK. It's so simple. ... Everyone is dealt something they have to struggle with,"" McWilliams says. ""Now, I know it isn't the worst thing that could happen to me."" But there's always work to do. DeFreece calls those less-than-pretty-feeling days, as all people have, ""an alopecia day."" There are also upsides: ""People will always remember you, and you can use that as an advantage,"" she says. She has met a network of women through organizations such as the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (DeFreece attends its annual conference every year) and social media, which has helped her adjust. When they get together, their lack of hair isn't the glaring beacon it is to others. ""I'm not just Jennifer the bald girl. I'm Jennifer the marketing major. I'm Jennifer from California,"" DeFreece says.","Alopecia physically affects the hair follicles, but the emotional toll is often overlooked .
Many women with alopecia opt to wear wigs, hats or scarves on a daily basis .
When and how to share an alopecia diagnosis with loved ones can be stressful ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama is already making presidential history by naming -- or at least his transition team is leaking to the press -- his Cabinet picks faster than nearly all of his predecessors. ""If we do not act swiftly and boldly, most experts believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year,"" Obama said Monday. With an economic crisis spiraling out of control and a lame duck in the oval office, presidential scholars say the next commander in chief simply had no choice. ""This is really unprecedented. But it's an unprecedented situation,"" said Larry Sabato, a presidential scholar at the University of Virginia. ""Obama is doing what the public and the markets demand be done -- and that is to show that the next president is really in charge before he even takes the oath of office."" The conventional wisdom by observers was that the Obama transition team's vigorous vetting requirements would slow down the selection process, or scare away talent altogether. After all, in addition to the already invasive FBI background check, the Obama team is requiring prospective candidates to complete a seven-page questionnaire that requires the disclosure of nearly every last private detail.  Watch: Obama Cabinet vetting process underway » . In addition to the obvious questions involving past criminal history, candidates are asked about personal diaries, past blog posts and the financial entanglements of extended family members. ""This questionnaire they've been giving to people who are thinking about signing up for a government job is extremely invasive,"" said David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst and adviser to four past presidents. ""I've never seen anything like this at the presidential level before -- the FBI asks these kind of questions, but to have the presidential transition team asking these questions requires ... great volumes of records that have to be checked out."" The most recent victim of the process appears to be Chicago businesswoman Penny Pritzker, the longtime Obama supporter and major Democratic fundraiser who was said to be the president-elect's top choice for commerce secretary. Pritzker publicly took herself out of the running on Thursday, issuing a statement saying she had submitted no information to begin the vetting process and citing ""obligations here in Chicago that make it difficult for me to serve at this time."" Sources close to the Obama transition say Pritzker's decision is not surprising given the nature of the vetting process, one they themselves have described as stressful. Nonetheless, potential Cabinet and high-level White House posts are filling up fast.  Watch: Obama announces his economic team » . Sources close to the Obama transition team say New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson accepted Obama's offer to be commerce secretary; Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano has also been tapped and agreed to become the nation's next homeland security secretary. ""Nobody believes that these individuals, Larry Summers for example, has produced every e-mail that might be embarrassing to the president-elect or the new administration. There simply wasn't enough time,"" Sabato said. In recent times, only President George H.W. Bush moved more quickly, but that was to name confidant James Baker to secretary of state just days after the election. Both Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton waited until December for their first picks. But two of Clinton's choices for attorney general -- Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood -- were scuttled over revelations they had hired undocumented workers. The embarrassing debacle came at the worst time for the new president, already facing criticisms over his shaky and seemingly disorganized transition. ""You'd rather have a smooth transition than a bumpy one,"" said Paul Begala, a former top aide to President Clinton and an analyst for CNN. ""But a bumpy start does not necessarily presage a bad presidency."" The Obama team, observers said, started early to avoid getting blindsided by unexpected problems. ""There's no question that plenty of work was done in anticipation of victory,"" said Kenneth Gross, a vetting attorney for political appointees. It's a delicate balancing act. But vetting experts said the early rollout of Obama's economic team Monday could calm markets -- as long as there aren't any surprises. After the announcement Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 397 points, or 4.9 percent, after having been up 552 points earlier in the afternoon. The market also rallied Friday when news leaked that Obama would name his economic team. The two-session gain of 891.10 points was the biggest two-session gain ever, according to Dow Jones. ""I think calling it a high wire act is a good term because this is high stakes,"" Gross said. ""These are high-profile positions and the last thing you want is something to blow up in your face."" Obama is not out of the woods yet. There are confirmation hearings coming. And one prominent Republican is promising an old-fashioned Capitol Hill grilling, saying in times of crisis, the public deserves nothing less.

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's ""first video diary,"" apparently recorded last October, surfaced on YouTube this week, but her lawyer says she did not put it there. Anthony, acquitted last summer of murder charges in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but convicted of four counts of lying to authorities investigating the child's disappearance, appeared optimistic about her future as she talked to a computer. ""Just a little surreal how much things have changed since July and how many things haven't changed,"" she said. ""But the good thing is that things are starting to look up and things are starting to change in a good way. I just hope they stay, that things stay good and that they only get better."" She's living at an undisclosed location in Florida while she serves a one-year probation sentence for her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges. ""Casey has maintained notes and memoirs for her personal counseling,"" Anthony attorney Cheney Mason told CNN on Thursday. ""She did not upload or release this to YouTube. She doesn't know how the video got on YouTube. She did not authorize it, and therefore it had to be obtained illegally."" Anthony never mentions Caylee in the four-minute black-and-white video, but she does talk about a dog ""I've adopted and I love."" She sat alone, staring at the computer, which she said she's ""just starting to figure out,"" as she recorded what she called ""my first video diary."" She promised it would be ""the first of many."" She wore dark-rimmed glasses, and her naturally brunette hair was colored blond. ""I hate being on camera, but I don't know, I need to conquer that fear at some point, and this is a good start,"" she said. ""So, here's something. It's the end of the first but just the beginning."" She paid for the computer, but the camera was a gift, she said. ""I'm extremely excited, extremely excited that I'll be able to Skype and obviously keep a video log, take some pictures,"" Anthony said. Anthony, 25, spent nearly three years in jail waiting for her murder trial. She was freed on July 17, 2011. ""It's been a long time since I've been able to call something mine,"" she said. ""And now that I have something even, you know, it's silly saying that I have a computer and a camera and a phone."" She appeared to say the name of the person who gave her a phone, although the audio was edited from the version of the video posted online. ""These are things that are mine that I don't have to, I don't know, that I don't have to give back,"" she said. ""It's kind of nice, finally, being able to say that I have some belongings that are mine, that I'll be able to take with me after I leave here next year. It's kind of funny to think about."" She speculated that she could be freed from her probation conditions, which require her to report weekly and remain in an undisclosed area, as early as February or as late as August. Anthony said the computer and camera have ""been such a blessing in so many ways."" ""Now I always have someone to talk to when I'm by myself, so I'm not bothering the poor dog that I've adopted and I love, and he's as much my dog as any of the other pets I've ever had,"" she said.","Anthony's lawyer: ""She did not upload or release this to YouTube""

"Washington (CNN) -- If you bought gas, you paid a tax. If you drove on a toll road, you paid a fee. And if you got a speeding ticket, you paid a penalty. No matter what, government still gets your money. But the differences between the three can mean the difference between broad public support and strong public opposition. In the election year battle over which candidate can best stabilize the economy, the issue of taxes is all about messaging. ""Taxes are harder to be perceived in a popular way even though taxes are largely doing the same thing [as fees and penalties],"" said George Yin, a University of Virginia law professor and former counsel for the Senate Finance Committee. President Barack Obama recently announced that he wants to extend the Bush tax cuts only for those families making less than $250,000. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney says that in doing so, Obama will raise taxes on small businesses and stifle economic growth. Both political parties have tiptoed around the issue of extending payroll tax cuts that expire at the end of the year. Should they be allowed to expire, someone making around $100,000 would pay about $183 more a month in taxes. It's the word ""taxes"" that strikes some voters as cringe-worthy. Obama was aware of that when he originally denied the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act was a tax. Republicans who were opposed to ""Obamacare"" quickly pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court called the individual mandate a tax. ""It was not at all surprising that politicians would present it that way. Even when the president was pressed a number of times he said, 'No, no, no, it's a fee. It's not a tax,'"" Yin said. In an era when local governments and states are loathe to utter the ""t-word"" but need to raise revenue, careful phrasing can make all the difference. ""If you think you need to raise revenue, you've got to find a different way to call them other than calling them taxes,"" said former Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minnesota, who now serves as a guest scholar on economic studies at the Brookings Institute. With 31 states facing budget shortfalls for next year, according to a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, efforts to raise money from fees rather than taxes can be an attractive option. Take Texas, for example. The Lone Star State looked to fees to shore up needed budget dollars for the almost $27 billion, 27% budget shortfall, says Democratic State Rep. Mike Villarreal, who also serves on the House Ways and Means and Appropriations committees. Villarreal says political pressure, in part from special interest groups keeping score of raised taxes, has created a climate in Texas where politicians are afraid to talk about it. ""Right now with a governor who says he will veto any legislation that is a tax, it leaves little room for any legislator, even if they think it's the right thing to do, to go ahead and file a tax bill,"" he said. Texas enacted $58.9 million in new fees and penalties while only raising $10.2 million in new taxes for 2012. The list of targeted fees and penalties collects $1.3 million from bingo operators, $1 million from processing child support payments, and $4.4 million for failure to remit taxes or fees. The Texas governor's office says that since fees are targeted, they lessen the burden on the larger tax base. ""Fees aren't necessarily across the board,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry's spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said, adding that the more money the government is able to keep in Texans' pockets, the better off Texas is economically. ""I think that the majority of Texas voters agree that they want to keep taxes low,"" Nashed said. Why all the political theater over taxes versus fees? Yin says it's because public support for fees and penalties is higher than it is for taxes. That's because people want to know where their money is going. They also don't trust politicians. ""The fee or the penalty relates to a specific activity,"" Yin said, where as taxes go into the larger treasury to be used at the government's discretion. For instance, when paying a toll on a toll road, the driver gets to travel on a better or more convenient route because their money goes back into the road's upkeep, political experts say. When you get a speeding ticket, the penalty is tied to the action. But with the gas tax, money is raised on every gallon purchased. That money is called a tax and not a fee since it is often poured back into transportation infrastructure. ""Fees tend to be a little more opaque to the voter,"" and therefore are an easier sell, said Eileen Norcross, a senior research fellow at George Mason's Mercatus Center, a think tank dedicated to market-oriented ideas . It's not all that different than shopping for groceries. ""We all understand that when we buy something, we have to pay for something. As long as the charge is reasonable, people are very accepting of that, I think. That's the way society works,"" Yin said. The polls agree. It's not that Americans won't pay or dislike paying taxes. Rather, they distrust government to spend their money wisely, Frenzel said. A CNN analysis of Gallup and ABC/Washington Post polls show that in the last quarter century, Americans believe 10 more cents of every dollar they pay to the government in taxes is wasted -- up from $0.43 in 1985 to $0.53 in 2010. ""If you ask the question as many pollsters have over time, 'what bothers you more whether it's how much I pay or how my tax dollars are spent,' the answer is how my tax dollars are spent,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who compiles and analyzes polling data. But the distrust doesn't end there. Since then, voters have consistently said they don't trust presidential pledges on taxes. ""Not only don't they trust the government to spend money wisely, they have that horrible feeling about the word tax that makes it anathema to everything else,"" Frenzel said. President George H. W. Bush is famous for promising in his 1988 presidential bid, ""Read my lips; no new taxes."" But polls showed that in 1992 when he ran, and subsequently lost his re-election campaign, polls showed voters didn't believe him.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The regime of ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi and the rebel government -- the National Transitional Council -- have both committed war crimes during the conflict in Libya and someone needs to take control to stop abuses from continuing, Amnesty International said in a report released Tuesday. The 112-page report detailed many examples of abuses by the Gadhafi loyalists, which included ""mass killing of prisoners, torture, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary arrests."" The report also spotlighted what Amnesty called a problem with the National Transitional Council in controlling divergent groups of anti-Gadhafi fighters. A researcher on Libya for Amnesty International, Diana Eltahawy, told CNN she had overheard screams of pain and the sounds of whipping on a recent visit to a Libyan detention center. ""It is the responsibility of the National (Transitional) Council to investigate these crimes,"" she said. ""We have called on them as Amnesty International to put the judicial processes in place and to make sure that they get a grip on the various armed groups that are currently conducting arrests outside the framework of the law."" The report said rebel fighters have conducted revenge attacks on prisoners and, at one point, conducted house-to-house raids killing people they thought were Gadhafi mercenaries. ""The NTC is facing a difficult task of reining in opposition fighters and vigilante groups responsible for serious human rights abuses, including possible war crimes; but has shown unwillingness to hold them accountable,"" the report says. ""So far, NTC officials have not provided details of any measures taken to address such concerns."" Gadhafi officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. The NTC released a statement about the report Tuesday. ""The Amnesty report is overwhelmingly filled with the horrific abuses and killings by the Gaddafi regime, however there are a small number of incidents involving those opposed to Gaddafi, the NTC strongly condemns any abuses perpetrated by either side,"" the statement said. ""The NTC is firmly committed to upholding human rights and the rule of law, both international and local, the violation of rights no longer has a place in Libya."" Amnesty said it was up to the NTC to fix these issues. ""It is a war crime for any party to a conflict to kill prisoners,"" Amnesty said. ""The onus now is on the NTC to do things differently, end abuses and initiate the human rights reforms that are urgently needed."" Eltahawy said an Amnesty International team had visited about eight detention centers in western Libya, including in Tripoli and Zawiya, where about 2,300 prisoners were held. ""Many of them told us that they were beaten, some were tortured,"" Eltahawy said. ""In fact, when I was in one of these detention centers I could overhear prisoners screaming in pain and I could overhear the sounds of whipping -- and this was when an Amnesty International delegate is inside the facility. You can imagine what takes place outside this oversight."" The Amnesty report comes a day after the country's interim leader gave a speech from Tripoli and promised to rebuild Libya's institutions and justice system. ""We aim to establish a state of law, a state of welfare, a state where Islamic Sharia law is the main source of legislation,"" said Mustafa Abdel Jalil, chairman of the NTC. ""This matter requires several things, primarily unity of classes and non division and the soul rejection of hatred and envy -- not taking law into your own hands."" Jalil was justice minister under Gadhafi before defecting to join the opposition in February. The head of the NTC spoke the same day Gadhafi purportedly vowed to ""kill until victory"" in a message read by an anchor at the Syria-based television station Al-Rai. Al-Rai, a privately owned station that has, in recent weeks, taken over for Libyan state media in fulfilling a role as Gadhafi's mouthpiece, had previously reported that it would air a message from the former leader. Because of security concerns, the station decided to delay the broadcast of the video, the anchor said. Instead, he read a statement that Al-Rai attributed to Gadhafi. ""Libyan people have no option but to defeat the coup attempt against the revolution. We cannot surrender our land to the French people so that they may enjoy it. And we cannot become subjects after we were rulers in local committees and local meetings,"" the statement said. ""We cannot surrender Libya to imperialism once again like the agents/spies want us to now. So we have no option but to kill until victory and to destroy this attempted overthrow."" CNN's Ben Wedeman, Salma Abdelaziz, Jill Dougherty, Ingrid Formanek, Kareem Khadder, Ian Lee, Raja Razek and Phil Black contributed to this report.","NEW: Amnesty International staffer tells of hearing screams and whipping of prisoners .

"(CNN) -- Alanna Gerwitz-Stern hadn't worked out a day in her life. She never watched what she ate, either. But after having her first son, Jacob, in December 2009, she couldn't seem to shake the baby weight. Stern had gained more than 100 pounds during the pregnancy, reaching 230 pounds at 5 feet 6 inches tall. She hid under sweatpants, sweaters and athletic gear. ""I was embarrassed to even go to the gym,"" says Stern, 33. ""I was so incredibly out of shape, and the people I was working out beside were so incredibly fit. I felt like a real eyesore when I would walk down the street."" Despite her best efforts to drop the extra weight, she had only managed to lose 10 pounds by the following May. ""I just felt really down on myself,"" Stern says. ""I felt like there was so much more I was capable of, and I didn't want to be one of those women who just accept their weight and that that's their fate as a young mom. I felt like there was a better me."" Frustrated, Stern remembered hearing about a new gym called Core Concepts near her home in Toronto, Ontario. Core Concepts owner Joshua Lipsey says the idea behind his workouts is that your core -- made up of your abs, obliques, back and glutes -- is your origin of movement. A strong core improves posture and balance and decreases risk of injury. Lipsey's workouts consist of body weight exercises, including beggar's planks, split and bicycle crunches, back extensions and wide-stance plie squats. The core is a major ""problem area"" for many people, Lipsey says. It's the spot men and women tend to notice extra pounds first. But because the core includes several large muscles, working it burns calories fast. As such, attacking the core can lead to quick weight loss results, Lipsey says. After researching Lipsey's concept, Stern decided to walk in and introduce herself. That day, she signed up for classes and started to shed the extra pounds. Lipsey had Stern visualize in front of the mirror, and she began to see the body she wanted. She says that built the motivation she needed to meet her weight loss goals. ""We envisioned what my waist, stomach and arms were going to look like, and we just stayed on that path until we were happy with the result,"" Stern says. ""Josh never let me lose sight of how to get there."" Stern describes Lipsey's concept as unconventional. ""It's not a spin class, it's not a running class, it's not a Pilates class,"" she says. ""He took my fitness to a completely different level, and he really challenged me."" Lipsey and Stern both emphasize that to see results, you have to change your whole lifestyle. ""If you think the hour that you go to the gym is what counts, it's really not,"" Lipsey said. ""It's doing other things -- going for a walk with your dog, not hopping on the escalator at the mall -- there's all these little things."" upwave: Try it now! One-minute workout challenge . After about eight months of eating clean -- increasing fruit and vegetable intake while decreasing meat consumption -- and attending core and plyometric classes for an hour a day, six days a week, Stern lost 106 pounds, which was even more than she had gained while pregnant. But shortly after reaching her goal weight, Stern went ""from one extreme to another."" She got pregnant with twins. This time, however, she was determined to stay on track. She continued to work out until Lily and Levi, now 18 months old, were born. Stern gained just 48 pounds during her second pregnancy. She lost 38 of those pounds within two weeks after giving birth and the last 10 pounds by the end of the year. ""The last 10 pounds were hard, like they usually are for people, but she stuck with it and refused to fail,"" Lipsey says. Aside from feeling physically better than ever, Stern also feels less shy and doesn't avoid going out anymore. She put in the time and effort, and her body responded. ""It was amazing to watch myself accomplish that because the amount of determination it takes to get to that level really is mental just as much as it is physical,"" Stern says. ""There's a lot of mental grit you need to have."" Having three children poses a challenge for keeping the weight off, but Stern says the time put in is worth it. ""It's one hour a day that I can take to do something good for me,"" she says. ""I come back to my family reinvigorated and ready for whatever challenges in life lie my way."" With less free time to attend classes at set times, Stern has kept up through Lipsey's mobile app, Gym Tuck, which launched last November. The flexibility of the app has allowed Stern to stay committed to her exercise plan even with three children and a busy schedule after returning to work. While she tries to fit in cardio using a jogging stroller, the app allows her to keep her workouts well-rounded. Now a size 4 and down to 120 pounds, Stern hopes to inspire other mothers trying to stay healthy through multiple pregnancies. ""I feel very, very lucky that I've been able to go through this transformation,"" she says. ""I wouldn't change anything -- not even the part about being overweight and going through that -- because it got me to where I am today. I really am my best self.""","Alanna Gerwitz-Stern gained more than 100 pounds while pregnant .

"(CNN) -- Kenya's Dennis Kimetto became the first man to run the marathon in under two hours three minutes as he set a new world record in Berlin Sunday. The 30-year-old Kimetto trimmed 26 seconds off the previous best by compatriot Wilson Kipsang, set last year in Berlin, with a time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds. Kimetto, who is from the Rift Valley region, the traditional breeding ground for many distance running greats, battled fellow Kenyan Emmanuel Mutai in the closing stages, eventually shrugging him off with four kilometers remaining. Mutai finished second, his time of two hours three minutes 13 seconds also inside the old record. But to pre-race favorite Kimetto went the glory and he realized early in the race that the record was within his grasp. ""As the race went on, I saw I could do it, I'm delighted to have won,"" Kimetto told reporters after his victory. He is among a group of young Kenyans who are dominating the road race scene, pushing the record ever nearer the magical two hour mark. Kimetto's previous best was a course record two hours three minutes 45 seconds, set in winning the 2013 Chicago Marathon, again relegating Mutai to second place. In the women's race, Tirfi Tsegaye of Ethiopia took the victory with a fast winning time of two hours 20 minutes 18 seconds, nine seconds ahead of compatriot Feyse Tadese. Shalane Flanagan of the United States was third in a personal best of two hours 21 minutes 14 seconds.","Dennis Kimetto breaks world marathon record in Berlin .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- All that glitters is not gold, and not all designer jewelry is made from precious metals and gemstones. A few years ago, Linda Lwanga's love of traditional African designs led her to her ancestral home in Uganda's capital of Kampala, giving up her career in electrical engineering in the UK. Once in the country, the British-born designer started Zanaa, a luxury label producing high-end jewelry and accessories made from a variety of materials, including ankole cow horns. Used for centuries for their milk and meat, ankole cows are indigenous to east Africa. Yet once they are slaughtered their striking long horns are usually discarded -- and this, Lwanga thought, represented a sustainable business opportunity. ""If it weren't for making something out of cow horn it would have been disposed of,"" says Lwanga. ""Typically in Africa we tend to burn a lot -- our garbage, our waste is burnt and it's not environmentally friendly at all so I just thought of collecting it and transforming it into something beautiful."" Read this: Fishing boats reborn as furniture . From horn bangles and chic rings to eye-catching necklaces and earrings, Zanaa's growing jewelry line is sold to high-end buyers in the United States and Europe. Lwanga says that all the products are handmade by a small dedicated team of local artisans. ""Zanaa means illuminate the source, the source being Africa, where we have an abundance of beautiful materials, an abundance of amazing craftsmanship,"" says Lwanga. ""We are losing a lot of our heritage, our culture and our artisans, in a sense, are kind of losing hope,"" she adds. ""So we are trying to get that artisanal craftmanship and keep it."" Alongside the cow horn, Lwanga sources other traditional materials for her designs, such as imported leather from Ethiopia and beads from South Africa. Yet doing business from Kampala has not been without problems. ""I would say timeliness is the biggest challenge,"" says Lwanga. ""Trying to get your products to market in a short space of time and be competitive."" Regional trade . Uganda, often described as the ""pearl of Africa,"" is one of the continent's most beautiful nations. The landlocked country, however, is also one of Africa's poorest -- according to a 2009 report by the World Bank, 38% of the population lives below the poverty line. The country is part of COMESA, a trading bloc of 19 nations in east and southern Africa. Its free trade arrangements are designed to allow regional trade to flow easily between the member countries. Read this: Weapons of mass creation . Uganda's trade within COMESA is worth $1.2 billion annually, according to the country's ministry of trade. But transporting goods is one of the key problems due to crumbling roads and expensive air travel. For Zanaa, accessing information and understanding how the trade bloc can benefit young entrepreneurs has been problematic. ""I had to go directly to the ministry of trade to find out about the tariffs for example, how to import,"" explains Lwanga, who already trades with many of the countries in the COMESA trading bloc. ""So it was more proactive, actually going out to seek that information."" Putting businesses on the map . Uganda's ministry of trade says it knows the system is far from perfect but insists much is being done to improve the availability of information to businesses in the country. ""We have promoted the district commercial offices because some of these small and medium-sized enterprises are out in the rural areas,"" says Amelia Kyambadde, minister of trade, industry and cooperatives. ""So they are able to access them and give them information about the market standards and the necessary facilitation that they need."" Read this: Artist gives trash a second chance . Although still a work in progress, Lwanga says she sees the potential for her future if Uganda's regional trading relations continue to grow, especially when it comes to distributing her products. ""It will impact the business greatly,"" she says. ""If we can get import and export of the products smoothly and in a timely manner, an affordable manner and understanding what tax breaks we can get from doing business in such a way that will be fantastic,"" adds Lwanga. ""It will enable us to be put on the map.""","Zanaa is a Uganda-based company making jewelry from ankole cow horns .

"(CNN) -- It's been a long time. A very long time. But I cannot forget my first school lunch. Call it free or call it charity, but it was a good meal that provided me, and so many others, with sustenance that made our school days more delightful. Our meals honored the traditions of the time -- red beans and rice with smoked sausage, bread and perhaps dessert. And of course every Friday we had fish sticks, potato salad or French fries. We've come a long way since then. Today, most public school children get perfectly balanced meals. School chefs use food selected to provide maximum nutrition, food that will enhance a student's well-being and learning abilities. Their standards come from federal nutrition experts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture who survey what important foods are missing from children's diets. More than 90% of the nation's schools follow these criteria. Come September, guidelines for healthier snacks will be added. Still, for all our efforts, the White House reports that, because of a poor diet, one-third of our children are on the path to diabetes. Regulations implementing the nutritional guidelines must be legislated by Congress. As it considers the Agriculture Appropriations Bill, Congress -- especially House Republicans -- will have to decide if it represents the interests of our children or of special food lobbyists. For example, the Maryland-based School Nutrition Association has sought, and received, congressional support to grant a one-year waiver from the standards to schools that can demonstrate six months of financial loss. The group represents 55,000 school lunch workers and nutritionists. But The Washington Post quoted a health professional who said the group reflects its funders, who are mostly frozen food and agribusiness interests. Getting our children healthy lunches has had bipartisan origins. The healthy school lunch program was put forth during the George W. Bush years, and strengthened with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act Michelle Obama saw successfully to adoption in 2010. Implementing USDA healthy lunch standards has met with some schools' resistance, according to the Government Accountability Office and the School Nutrition Association. But why? After all, a USDA study found only 0.15% of the schools surveyed said they were having difficulty complying with the healthy foods standards. And the same study found that upward of 90% of the schools involved are successfully meeting the guidelines. That finding confirms another study done in 2012 by the Kids' Safe and Healthful Foods Project, ""a collaboration between The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that provides nonpartisan analysis and evidence-based recommendations"" on food standards. It found 94% of school districts were on board to meeting the healthy food guidelines. Jessica Donze Black, a nutritionist and director with Pew, told the press, ""We are disappointed (with this waiver) that would weaken national nutrition standards for foods served in schools."" Indeed, more than 100 child nutrition experts at national, state and local levels released a petition to Congress on May 19, requesting lawmakers fight, and end, the waiver to opt out of all the breakfast and lunch standards for schoolchildren. We are beginning to reverse childhood obesity; it has fallen among preschoolers. But childhood obesity doubled during the past 30 years. Our progress is tiny but encouraging. The proposed waiver appears to be an attempt to buy time so the frozen food industry and agribusinesses can worm their foods into the schools. The provision is opposed by hundreds of nonpartisan, nonprofit nutrition organizations and supported by just a handful of powerful junk food interests. Congress appears willing to gamble with our children's health at the same time Olivier De Schutter, a U.N. health expert, declares that ""unhealthy diets are greater threat to health than tobacco."" Ironically, De Schutter calls for global regulation of salty, sugary foods, just when some members of Congress seem ready to abandon our own standards. Providing our children with healthy food will reduce future health care costs. So why is this too being turned into a partisan dodge? Republicans in Congress have limited a pilot program that will test efficient ways to deliver foods during the summer only to children in rural low-income households. (This is not to be confused with the Summer Food Service Program, which will continue to deliver meals to urban and rural children alike.) The excuse given by a House Agriculture spokeswoman is that rural children are scattered over wider areas and so ""have some unique challenges."" As if urban children going hungry don't face ""unique challenges."" The House version of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill also seeks to add starchy, white potatoes to the list of ""qualified vegetables"" under the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, supplemental feeding program for pregnant women and young children. This move comes after heavy lobbying by the white potato industry, which wants the prestige of qualifying for WIC and the marketing advantage that comes with it. Congress should say no to the special interests, stop turning the well-being of our children into a partisan tool and focus on our children's health and their future.

"(CNN) -- Tony Stewart, who hasn't raced since his car struck and killed a fellow driver during a dirt track race earlier this month, will return to NASCAR racing at Atlanta, his team announced on its Twitter feed. Stewart opted out of three races after his car hit Kevin Ward Jr., who was walking on the track during an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in New York. ""NASCAR has remained in constant contact with his race team, and we will stay very close to this situation as Stewart returns to competition,"" said NASACR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell. The race in Atlanta is scheduled for Sunday, with first practice and qualifying set for Friday. New York authorities continue to investigate the Ward incident, according to media reports. Spectator video from that night at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park race shows two cars coming out of a turn, with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks determinedly on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. Stewart withdrew from the NASCAR race in Watkins Glen the next day. He also missed races in Michigan and Tennessee. Authorities announced two days later that 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, had died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Ontario County Sheriff Philip C. Povero said at the time that there was no evidence that a crime had been committed. Stewart has only released a statement shortly after Ward's death. ""There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,"" Stewart said August 10. ""It's a very emotional time for all involved. ... My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy."" Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. He began racing when he was 4, running go-kart events. When he was 12, he moved to the faster sprint cars. His father blames Stewart for hitting his son. ""Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,"" the father said, according to Syracuse.com. Ward Sr. said the race was the only time he had ever seen his son get out of the car while it was still on the track. NASCAR has instituted a rule that requires its drivers to stay in the car until safety personnel arrive. CNN's Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.","Racer was driving in a dirt-track race when he hit a competitor who was walking .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- President Hu Jintao of China arrived in Hong Kong on Friday ahead the 15th anniversary of the territory's handover from Britain, an event likely to bring into focus the city's complex feelings about Beijing's influence. Hong Kong has prospered since its last British governor, Chris Patten, bade the territory a tearful farewell on July 1, 1997. It has benefited from its position as a financial and commercial gateway to China, riding the mainland's spectacular economic boom of the past two decades. But the economic rewards have been mixed with unease about Beijing's intentions for Hong Kong in the longer term, with concerns about possible threats to freedom of speech and the rule of law. Some Hong Kongers have also expressed reservations about the effect that mainland Chinese people are having on property prices and public services in the city. Nonetheless, Hong Kong has its own borders and immigration control, even with China. It has its own currency, its own police force and system of law courts. It has freedom of expression and demonstration to a degree unheard of anywhere on the mainland. This nuanced situation is expected to be reflected during Hu's three-day visit. He stepped off an Air China plane Friday onto a red carpet to be welcomed by a people wearing red caps and waving Chinese flags. The outgoing Hong Kong chief executive, Donald Tsang, greeted Hu at Hong Kong Airport, the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Also present were other senior officials from the territory, notably the Beijing-backed chief executive-elect of Hong Kong, Leung Chun-ying. Leung, who has long-standing ties to the mainland, is set to take office on Sunday in Hu's presence. The Chinese president is scheduled to attend a string of other events over the next three days, including a flag-raising ceremony, a firework display and a parachute jump by members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Protesters have said they will follow Hu throughout his visit in order to bring attention to human rights abuses in China. They are planning a big demonstration on Sunday afternoon. One particularly sensitive issue for the protesters is the death this month of Li Wangyang, a high-profile dissident who had spent more than 20 years in jail following his support of the Tiananmen Square student protests in 1989. Li was found hanging in his hospital room in Shaoyang, Hunan Province, on June 6. The local authorities said he had committed suicide, a claim that friends of the deaf and blind labor rights activist have contested. Hong Kong government officials have also questioned whether Li could have committed suicide. The Chinese authorities are now investigating his death. The weather is also threatening to disrupt Hu's visit. Tropical Storm Doksuri was heading across the South China Sea on Friday toward the the Chinese coast near Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. The storm is expected to hit land overnight. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Tim Schwarz and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","Hong Kong has prospered since Britain handed it over to China in 1997 .

"(CNN) -- Just hours after the U.S. consulate came under attack in Libya, resulting in the death of the U.S. ambassador and three of his colleagues, YouTube blocked access to an anti-Islam video that sparked protests in Egypt and Libya. The video, which was made in America and crudely characterized the Prophet Mohammed, understandably offended many Muslims. It would appear that the decision by Google -- which owns YouTube -- was based not on an order by either government but on its own concerns. ""We work hard to create a community everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different opinions,"" YouTube said in a statement. ""This can be a challenge because what's OK in one country can be offensive elsewhere. This video â€” which is widely available on the web â€” is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries. Our hearts are with the families of the people murdered in yesterday's attack in Libya."" Although the video remains accessible for the rest of the world, users in Egypt and Libya will, upon attempting to access it, encounter a message that it is not available in their jurisdiction. This is the same mechanism used when a copyright holder restricts content to a certain country. Anti-Islam filmmaker questioned . Although restricting the video in the two countries might seem tempting in the wake of the horrific violence that occurred in Libya, it is in the best interest of neither the company nor, arguably, the citizens of those countries for Google to be the arbiter of acceptability. When it comes to copyrighted content, YouTube is required to abide by the law, specifically the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, which allows a copyright holder to report content posted by other users as belonging to them (it also allows for a rebuttal). YouTube has also taken down content under informal pressure from governments, such as in 2010, when it removed clips reportedly linked to al Qaeda after a speech in which British Security Minister Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones stated that such videos ""incite cold-blooded murder and as such are contrary to the public good."" When it comes to that type of content or the content in the video in question, the fact of the matter is that there are few regulations by which YouTube must abide. In the United States, the content of the video would be deemed protected under the First Amendment. As an American company, YouTube itself also has a right to speech, which includes the right to make its own policies regarding what types of speech it deems appropriate to host. Those policies have come under fire before. In 2007, a Turkish court ordered YouTube to be blocked in the country after the company refused to take down videos deemed insulting to the country's founder; the ban was reversed two years later. YouTube faced a similar ban in Pakistan in 2010 after refusing to take down cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. But while some governments think YouTube is too lax, some of its users have felt it is too restrictive. Egyptian human rights activist Wael Abbas found his account deactivated in 2007 after posting violent content depicting police brutality in his country. Eventually, his account was restored and YouTube shifted its policies in response to his and other users' complaints, allowing content containing violence to be posted under an exception for videos that are ""educational"" or ""documentary"" in nature. This policy later enabled activists in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria and elsewhere to post documentation of regime violence. In the current case, YouTube has stated that the video does not violate its terms of service. So if the video does not violate the company's rules and YouTube didn't receive an order from the two countries' governments (as far as we know), then the only explanation is that YouTube is determining on its own what serves the best interest of Libyans and Egyptians. This is, indeed, a rare move from the company and may eventually backfire. News: Protests calm, but tensions still high . Take another case from this year. When Pakistan blocked Twitter after the company refused to take down offensive content, citizens were outraged, fearing it as a precursor to censorship during the election period. Had Twitter simply taken down the content, the story would have slipped by without notice; instead, the outrage of citizens forced the government to reverse its decision in less than a day. Google should take the lead from Twitter, a smaller and younger company that, when faced with similar concerns, has stood strong, issuing a policy stating that content would be ""withheld"" in a certain country only in the face of a valid legal order and that the ban would be communicated transparently to all users. Instead, by placing itself in the role of arbiter, Google is now vulnerable to demands from a variety of parties and will have to explain why it sees censorship as the right solution in some cases but not in others. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jillian C. York.","An anti-Islam video sparked protests in Libya and Egypt; in Libya, violence erupted .

[is] not eligible for this category."" The Academy explained that, in some cases, there are exceptions to the rule. A grateful Moore, who stands about 5'6"", made light of the situation in his acceptance speech, joking, ""I was beginning to think there might be a height requirement for this award."" George Strait to record five new albums . Jason Aldean stands tall with his second win in a row for Male Vocalist of the Year, while Vocal Group of the Year went to first-time winners, The Band Perry. Predictable victories included Florida Georgia Line for Vocal Duo of the Year and critic darling Kacey Musgraves for Album of the Year. Jessi Alexander, Connie Harrington and Jimmy Yeary -- the songwriters behind Lee Brice's ""I Drive Your Truck"" -- took home Song of the Year honors.

"(CNN) -- Unable either to win the war in Ukraine by proxy or to retreat from the conflict because of the enormous blow a defeat would deliver to his regime's legitimacy, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be sending in regular troops to attack Ukraine. The action is south of rebel-held Donetsk, which, until Russia's heightened involvement this week, was on the verge of being retaken by the Ukrainian army. It is likely that in response to Russia's escalation, the United States and European Union will contemplate more sanctions. The problem is that all the relatively ""painless"" economic measures have already been taken. So both the U.S. and Europe are now left looking at actions that will hurt their own industries and financial institutions. Take the previous round of sanctions, which targeted only select Russian banks. This time, it may well have to be the entire Russian financial system: That is, U.S. and EU banks will have to sever relations with any bank that does business with their Russian counterparts. Another example: Previously, only future investments in technology and transfers to the Russian energy sector were banned. Now, the West may have to block the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and equipment already in the ""pipeline"" to Russia as a result of the pre-existing contracts between the Russian oil giant Rosneft and its Western counterparts. Moscow will undoubtedly fight in international courts to overrule such bans and will also likely retaliate by curtailing gas deliveries to Europe, just in time for winter. Never mind that energy exports are the backbone of the Russian treasury. As Putin has shown with the food import embargo, the regime is ready to harm its own people if necessary. Which brings us to the key problem with economic sanctions: They rarely work in the short, or even medium term. When a regime's popularity or even legitimacy depends on staying the course (as it certainly does in the case of Ukraine) and with the patriotic hysteria and paranoia whipped up by state-controlled television, Moscow is likely to persist for a significant amount of time before sanctions show any effect. Western leaders should therefore not oversell the sanctions' effectiveness. There is, however, something the West can do to change Putin's mind much quicker, namely help Ukraine to win a just war against a foreign aggressor. Sending guns and bullets is not necessary -- Ukraine has enough. What Kiev needs is radar jamming and detection equipment to protect its planes from Russia's anti-aircraft systems (the same kind that shot down the Malaysian Airliner) as well as purely defensive weapons such as anti-tank missiles and some intelligence sharing by the West, including satellite data. But perhaps just as important, as any weaker nation facing a much bigger aggressor can attest, the Ukrainians need moral support. And nothing will boost it more than effective gestures of battlefield solidarity. Of course, as noted earlier, retreat is not an option for Putin. This is only true, however, as long as Russian troops do not begin to sustain significant casualties. The memory of the Soviet war in Afghanistan is still very much alive in the minds of the fathers and mothers of today's soldiers. And, unlike the 1980s, Moscow may not be able to engineer secret burials of zinc coffins welded shut, or force the relatives of the deceased to keep quiet. A video appeal by Russian mothers asking Putin to bring their sons back from the battlefield in Ukraine went viral just this week. One hopes, of course, that Russian soldiers will not have to die en masse for their commander in chief to adjust his policy. Providing military-to-military assistance to Ukraine seems to be the only way the West can help stop this war relatively quickly. The alternative is the taking of ever more Ukrainian and Russian lives -- with no end in sight.","Leon Aron: Unable to win by proxy or to retreat in Ukraine, it appears Putin sent troops .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Joel Osteen strides into the former Compaq Center. Some 20,000 people are standing and singing. Purple lights softly pulse across the ceiling, and mist floats around two giant screens flashing words to the songs. It's not a pulpit but a podium. It's not an altar but a stage. There is no cross. Instead a huge globe spins, and two massive bubbling creeks flank the stage. A lighting system softens distant corners of the massive arena and spreads colored light and smoke in strategic spots. Somehow, the space that will hold 40,000-plus on Sunday morning doesn't feel like a sports arena. In the control room, producers watch multiple camera angles and feeds. Smiling broadly, Osteen bounds up the few stairs to the stage, closes his eyes, lifts his hands and leads a prayer. ""God, I'm going to start this week off in faith. Expecting your goodness. Expecting to have a blessed and a prosperous week. Amen. Well, God bless you. Give him your very best today."" Welcome to Sunday morning at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. It's reportedly the nation's largest congregation and probably one of the most diverse places in America. One third of these churchgoers are Hispanic, one-third African-American and a quarter white. There are dozens of nationalities. Osteen will give this sermon twice. He later said he knows immediately which segments to edit together into a sermon that will air on television to millions three weeks later. Between services, he is signing his most recent book in the lobby, just past the bookstore that is one of the highest-grossing Christian bookstores in America. His wife, Victoria, is co-pastor of the church and a best-selling author in her own right. In fact, the Osteens are not paid to be pastors at Lakewood, according to the church, but they live off the considerable proceeds of their books. Joel Osteen's advance for ""It's Your Time,"" his third book, an instant best-seller, was $12 million, according to the church. Settled into the pastor's suite after two Sunday services and book signings, Osteen explains why he is telling people it's the time to ""thrive."" ""I tell them that this is not the time to get discouraged or put your life on hold and really to be talked into having a down year,"" Osteen said. ""I really believe that fear is contagious, that worry and anxiety ... if you let that get into you long enough, it almost paralyzes you."" ""So if you get talked into saying, 'Well, I'm just going to survive this year and make it and not get laid off,' I believe you draw more negativity in, versus if you get up and say, 'OK, yes, we're not in denial the economy is terrible, stuff's not going great, but I believe that God calls me to be at the right place at the right time' and you know put your faith out there -- don't have a survival mentality, believe that you can thrive."" That message is resonating. His publisher, Simon & Schuster, said some 850,000 copies of ""It's Your Time"" are already in print. Osteen shrugs off criticism from mainstream Protestants, evangelicals and others who call Lakewood Christianity lite, more showbiz than theology -- a religious Disneyland, where after the ""ride,"" the doors open into the gift shop to buy books DVDs, calendars and all things Osteen. ""I'm not a debater,"" he said, shrugging. He said he's been called to deliver God's message to as many people as possible, and God gave him a unique set of gifts to do so. One of those gifts is the ability to market brand Osteen across multiple media: podcasts, Twitter, books, DVDs, CDs and television. He produced his father's telecasts for years and stepped into the spotlight after his death. Osteen's expertise behind the camera has taken his father's church to a stratospheric level. Osteen's supporters and associates suggest mainstream Christian mistrust of his success may be as much jealousy as theology. ""Have you been to church in America recently?"" one aide said. ""They put on a funeral. If you put on a funeral every week, eventually people stop coming."" Osteen's is the largest, but according to Hartford Seminary, there are 1,350 megachurches in the country, and they are spreading, while more traditional Christian churches struggle to fill the pews. ""What megachurches represent for good or bad is the world that we live in,"" said Scott Thumma, a sociology of religion professor at the Hartfold Seminary in Connecticut. ""I don't think it is the only form of religion that is going to survive into the future; I think there is also a very strong place for small intimate worship settings, like house churches and small cell churches. But the megachurch is appealing and attracting people for a reason; it parallels the experience that we have with rock concerts and sports arenas and the mall."" Joel and Victoria Osteen appear profoundly, unfailingly positive. On the screen that recent Sunday are these words -- God plans to prosper you and not harm you. ""I don't believe it's just money -- money is a part of it -- but prosper is to give you a good life, meaning good relationships, and give you health,"" Osteen said, explaining the ""prosper"" phrase comes from the Book of Jeremiah. It's to ""give you a good job and money to pay your bills and do other things, but you know I encourage people to have a prosperous mindset."" Osteen said. Osteen is often characterized, and criticized, for being a ""prosperity preacher."" ""I don't like to be called a prosperity minister because I think in most people's minds that don't know me they think, 'Well, all he talks about is money,' "" Osteen said, ""Which I don't, I talk about being blessed in so many different ways."" Yet he does offer advice about finances and he has some experience. Osteen said Lakewood still has $40 million to pay off on $100 million he borrowed to convert Compaq Center from a basketball arena into a church. In ""It's Your Time,"" he writes, ""If you have a burden of heavy debt, you need to announce to that debt, 'It is finished.' Look at that house payment. 'It is finished.' Look at that college loan. 'It is finished.' Look at those unpaid bills. 'It is finished.' "" Can God really wipe out your debts? ""It starts ... with the vision that you have to believe that God can help you to get out of debt to fulfill your dreams,"" Osteen said. ""I don't think anything is going to happen if you don't believe, so I think that's where you start."" And what of the Bible verse that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven? Or that Jesus preached his followers to give up all their belongings and follow him? ""Years back at least, you know you had to be poor and to show you were holy,"" Osteen said. ""You're supposed to sacrifice everything, and I'm all for sacrifice and I believe in that, but I also believe that God wants us to be leaders. He's put gifts and talents in every person, that they're supposed to come out to the full.""

"(CNN) -- Sixteen Emmy Awards. That's how many trophies the cast and crew of ""Breaking Bad"" have hauled home after five seasons of groundbreaking TV, with six of those honors being earned at Monday's 66th Primetime Emmy Awards. The three-hour ceremony, hosted by ""Late Night's"" Seth Meyers, nearly doubled as one long standing ovation for the AMC series, which ended its run in September 2013. Emmy Awards: 'Breaking Bad' goes out on top . But as creator Vince Gilligan and stars Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn and Aaron Paul laid ""Breaking Bad"" to rest with gleaming Emmys in their hands, elsewhere in the world the series is just getting started. In September, Latin America will get its own, Spanish-language version of ""Breaking Bad"" called ""Metastasis."" The premise is the same -- a science teacher decides to cash in on his specialized knowledge by entering the drug trade, to devastating consequences -- but the setting is Bogota, Colombia. Instead of watching the evolution of a man named Walter White (played by Cranston in ""Breaking Bad""), potential fans will follow Walter Blanco, as played by Colombian actor Diego Trujillo. Walter Blanco has wife a named Cielo -- the Colombian equivalent of Anna Gunn's Skyler -- and a partner-in-crime named Jose Miguel Rosas, the equivalent of Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman. The series debuted in the States on the Spanish language network UniMas in June, and has also made its way to Mexico. But ""in Colombia, not many people know about 'Breaking Bad,'"" Trujillo explained in an interview from Bogota. ""There's not a great cable culture here, people watch open television on the basic channels that we have. 'Metastasis' is going to be a great surprise."" While adapting shows to another language is commonplace -- Trujillo previously worked on Latin American versions of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Desperate Housewives,"" and the U.S. turned Colombian series ""Betty La Fea"" into ""Ugly Betty"" -- producing ""Metastasis"" was no easy task. The cast had to film the entirety of ""Breaking Bad"" nearly shot for shot in just six months, and they didn't know how the story was going to end because the final season of ""Breaking Bad"" was still in development at the time. Despite those challenges, the story doesn't get lost in translation. Well-crafted symbolism, such as the noteworthy pink teddy bear that falls from a plane, appears in ""Metastasis,"" as do other scenes well-known to ""Breaking Bad"" viewers. ""The themes that it touches are very universal,"" Urbina said. ""To me, the show is a moral question about how far you would go while exploring the complex character like that of Walter."" One of Walter's scenes that strikes a chord with Trujillo takes place near the end of the series, when the ""Metastasis"" protagonist comes back to see his wife Cielo and say goodbye to her and their baby girl. ""That's Walter and that's what all the characters are,"" Trujillo said. ""Every scene is full of contradiction, it's full of humanity."" While both Trujillo and Urbina were certainly influenced by Cranston and Paul's portrayals of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, they made an effort to break away from the original and make the characters, and the show, their own. ""When you start working with a different language, with a different director, a different cast, and our own traditions, at the end you really do your own version,"" Trujillo said. ""Characters come alive by themselves. You forget very soon what you saw, and the reference you have of the other actor."" When Urbina first began filming, he was too attached to Paul's portrayal of Jesse, with the memory of ""Breaking Bad"" scenes ingrained in his mind. Yet by making a conscious effort to start from scratch, he said he reimagined his Jose Miguel Rosas. ""I think the biggest difference between Jesse and Jose is they are both very insecure people, but I think Jesse's character shows that through aggression and violence, while Jose, I tried to make him a little more vulnerable,"" Urbina said. ""I think you are able to relate more to him and feel what he is feeling. He's not a character afraid of showing his sadness, his emotion."" There are other factors that distinguish ""Metastasis"" from ""Breaking Bad."" The setting of Bogota moves the story into the urban environment of a big city, as opposed to Albuquerque's suburban landscape. The city also lacks deserts, or the border and immigration issues prevalent in Albuquerque. With its high elevation, Bogota is cold year-round, so the pool in Walter's backyard is replaced by a fountain, which Cielo falls into as she's having a dream. The RV where Walter and Jesse make their great escape in the ""Breaking Bad"" pilot is also replaced by a rickety school bus turned into a lab for ""Metastasis."" Although they're sharing similar material, there's no competition for the actors. Quite the opposite, actually: Urbina and Trujillo were both rooting for ""Breaking Bad"" to win at the Emmys on Monday. ""Cranston's performance is absolutely wonderful. He deserves all the awards, as well as the rest of (the cast),"" Trujillo said. ""I think they are just great actors, and they did a great, great job."" So far, Urbina and Trujillo haven't been doing too badly with the roles themselves. The actors said Vince Gilligan admires ""Metastasis,"" and they've received positive feedback from fans near and far. ""I have gotten an amazing response from people all over, people in Mexico and the States,"" Urbina said. ""There was this one guy in Mexico that wrote to me, and it was very touching because he identified with the character. He went down on drugs and he lost his girlfriend and he was reaching out, not for help, but to connect and to grieve. So I think it has touched people in a very powerful way."" There is only more to come, as the much anticipated season finale airs on UniMas in mid-September, and ""Metastasis"" comes to Latin American audiences with Fox Live on September 1. ""The story is really well-adapted to our conditions here,"" Trujillo said. ""People are going to believe it, believe the people. It's an amazing story, and I'm sure it's going to be really well received."" Primetime Emmy Awards 2014: The winners list .","The Emmy-winning ""Breaking Bad"" has a Spanish-language adaptation .

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- As the old adage goes, ""If you want it done right, do it yourself"" -- and for social activist Rakesh Rajani, those words have become an ethos to live by. Growing up in a low-income family in Tanzania, Rajani quickly learned first hand about the hardships faced by many living in East Africa. At just four years old, he started working in his parents' shop. Later, when he wanted to go to school, Rajani watched his mother fight tooth and nail to find the funds to send him. These definitive childhood moments would set the young man on a path of social justice culminating with his movement, ""Twaweza."" Meaning ""we can make it happen"" in Swahili, Rajani established the non-profit organization in 2009 with the goal of empowering people through information and building an ""ecosystem of change"" for themselves. Here he sits down with CNN's African Voices to reveal how he is trying to spark a social movement to make a difference for millions of people. Dream big. He tells CNN: ""My dream is that when people wake up in the morning, whether you are a fisherman in my home town of Wanza on the lake there, or whether you are a farmer in Subawanga or in Gulu, or you are a pastoralist in northern Kenya, you wake and you know that your life matters, and that you can do something about it."" Take responsibility. ""We are forced to have thoughts for ourselves, we are forced to question, we are forced to analyze what is going on, and in the end what we are also beginning to realize is that we can complain all we want and nothing much will happen or we can take responsibility in making things happen, of co-shaping life, and I think that's what's happening,"" says Rajani. Don't sit back, be part of the solution. ""The concept behind Twaweza very much is this, from the ground up, that the citizens are part of the solution. They are part of the solution in terms of solving things themselves, every day; it's not every problem that you need to wait for the president or the minister to solve ... It's not just about complaining, it's not just about pointing fingers, it's about fixing things, it's about coming up with solutions."" Spark an education revolution. The self-described ""broker of ideas"" says: ""Africa is rising, but Africa is rising for who? Who is benefiting who is not and unfortunately while there are many wonderful things and many economies are growing at rates that are enviable to the West, the reality is that Africa is not rising for many people particularly young people. And that also if we are going to fully benefit from the potential we have in Africa it will need skilled people."" Partner with politicians to achieve goals. Rajani believes that people need to focus the minds of politicians by highlighting the issues that need to be amended. To wit, a key aim for Twaweza is to seek a greater transparency and accountability in government. ""I could see a whole new modeling practice where a government says, 'in order for us to succeed we need your help, we need your collaboration, we need your ideas, we need your critique.' That new model of government, I think, is the future."" He adds: ""The old idea that government knows everything and shuts everybody out is now so, so old thinking, it doesn't work that way."" Bridge the gap between rich and poor. Education in East Africa has been a vital development over the last decade. And while figures of youth attendance has improved, on-the-ground surveys conducted by the non-profit have found quality of education to be lacking. Rajani says transparency of fund allocation is the reason for this. ""The lack of transparency is a real problem and all these things are making sure we earmark budgets properly, making sure that the system that we use to get the money there is simple and efficient, and making sure that everybody, parents and teachers, know what is going on. It's a big part of what we do at Twaweza.""","Tanzanian-born social activist Rakesh Rajani calls himself ""a broker of ideas""

"(CNN) -- African football has been warned it ""cannot be the breeding ground for hooliganism,"" after a Cameroonian player was killed during a league match on Saturday. Albert Ebosse, 24, died after allegedly being struck by a missile thrown from the crowd. Ebosse, who was the Algerian league's top scorer last season with 17 goals, was hit on the head by what appeared to be a piece of concrete. ""My thoughts go out to the family and friends of this young man who enjoyed his job peacefully and went further to pursue his passion for football abroad,"" said Issa Hayatou, the Cameroonian president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), in a statement Sunday. ""African football cannot be the breeding ground for hooliganism whatsoever. We expect exemplary sanctions to be taken against this grave act of violence. ""Violence has no place in African football in particular and sports in general. We remain resolute and state in the strongest terms our determination to eradicate all forms of violence and unsportsmanlike conduct in stadiums on the continent."" Ebosse played for Algerian club JS Kabylie and had scored in his team's 2-1 home defeat to USM Alger in the city of Tizi Ouzou, east of the capital Algiers. But as the players returned to the dressing room objects were thrown, apparently by an angry home crowd. Ebosse died shortly afterward. In a statement, his club JS Kabylie said Ebosse had ""succumbed to a head injury."" World Cup . The tragedy is one of the darkest moments for Algerian football in recent years, yet follows on from arguably the game's high water mark a few months ago. The Algeria national team reached the second round of the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil this summer before narrowly succumbing to eventual winners Germany. But Ebosse's death, seemingly at the hands of supporters from his own team, has cast a shadow over the game. Algeria's interior ministry has launched an investigation into the incident. Path to Europe . Ebosse's fledgling career was on a path that many talented and ambitious African soccer player follow. After excelling in the Cameroon league he arrived in Algeria, via a spell in Malaysia, in the hope of one day making the short trip across the Mediterranean to play in Europe, emulating the likes of the country's most famous player Samuel Eto'o. North African clubs have dominated the continent's competitions in recent years. Their leagues, from Morocco in the west to Egypt in the east, are generally well funded, well organized and well supported compared to the rest of Africa. But the tragedy has shone a spotlight on fan violence in Algeria, a problem that many in the country believe has not been adequately tackled. ""At the moment all memories of the World Cup are forgotten,"" said Maher Mezahi, an Algerian soccer journalist based in the north of the country. ""Two weeks ago everyone was singing the praises of Algerian football. On the ground Algerian football needs to come a long way. He tore things up, scored 17 goals. All Algerian journalist couldn't say a bad word against him. He was softly spoken, polite, principled. It's a tragedy."" Last season Ebosse was on the receiving end of monkey chants from one set of opposition supporters. He responded by scoring, and then dancing in front of the supporters who had racially abused him. ""I think if I'm injured, black or white will not come out of my body,"" he told the Algerian media after the match, according to Mezahi. ""Red will.""","CAF warns on hooliganism following death of Cameroon player .

"(CNN) -- The United States leads the world in the rate of incarcerating its own citizens. We imprison more of our own people than any other country on earth, including China which has four times our population, or in human history. And now, a new Pew report announces that we are keeping even nonviolent inmates behind bars for increasingly longer terms. This comes at a time when soaring costs of prisons are wreaking havoc on federal, state and local budgets, as schools, libraries, parks and social programs are slashed. When I graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1983, my state spent more on higher education than prisons, a lot more. That equation is now reversed. Money that could have gone into reducing skyrocketing tuition and cuts to education has instead gone to prisons and inmates. Over the past 23 years, California constructed roughly one new prison per year, at a cost of $100 million each, while it built only one new public college during the same period. Nationwide, spending on prisons has risen six times faster than spending on higher education. As I protest education cuts, I'm so often told, ""We just don't have the money."" It's a lie. We do have the money. We just choose to spend it on prisons. Why is this not a front and center issue in the presidential campaign? Largely casualties of our misguided ""war on drugs,"" and vigorously promoted at the federal level by the ""drug czar"" and a $15 billion annual budget, the number of incarcerated Americans has quadrupled since 1980. More than two million of our people are now locked up, with another nearly five million under an increasingly restrictive system of correctional control in lieu of or after incarceration. Criminalizing human behavior like never before, our judges are required by law to mete out increasingly punitive, long sentences, even for children. Even after inmates are released, they remain under the heavy-handed and pricey control of the criminal justice system for years or for life, often legally barred from voting, receiving public housing, food stamps or student loans. Forced to ""check the box"" on job applications that they are convicted criminals, even those who have had simple convictions like marijuana possession are often legally discriminated against by employers. An unemployed young man recently wrote to me about being shut out of his dream job, nursing, because of a decade-old marijuana offense. In fact, no one at all will hire him. As he languishes on a friend's couch, he is hopeless, depressed and suicidal. In the United States, one man out of eighteen is incarcerated or on probation or parole, and more are locked up every day. We are the last developed country on the planet to lock up juveniles, overwhelmingly boys, for life-without-parole sentences for crimes committed when they were minors. (Though the Supreme Court banned mandatory life-without-parole sentences for minors in June, judges may still impose the sentence as a discretionary matter.) Here's one stark way to understand our new normal of mass incarceration: If we wanted to return to 1970s level of incarceration, we'd have to release four out of five people behind bars today. Nonviolent offenders are 60% of our prison population. Releasing half of them would free up nearly $17 billion per year for schools or other worthy programs, with no appreciable effect on the crime rate. In fact, many studies conclude that mass incarceration is crimogenic, i.e., locking up people for minor offenses increases crime because they become hardened behind bars. Since few prisons offer therapy or vocational programs and children left behind in fatherless homes are more likely to grow up to become offenders themselves, the problem just gets worse. But we cannot keep going down the road of locking up more people for longer amounts of time. According to Pew, prisoners released in 2009 served an average of nine additional months in custody, or 36% longer, than offenders released in 1990. Annually we now spend $68 billion and growing on local, state and federal corrections. The American public strongly supports reducing time served for nonviolent offenders. But candidates appear afraid to touch this touchy third rail issue, for fear they appear less than ""tough on crime."" Why does the right not consider our multibillion-dollar prison system to be the type of bloated government program ripe for cost-cutting? Why is the left so rarely concerned about the warehoused young lives and the destruction of inner city families from our culture of mass incarceration? Why do both sides accept the framing of this question, so often parroted: In these tough economic times, should we cut more social services or raise taxes? It's a false dichotomy. The third alternative is to stop warehousing our own people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Bloom.","The number of incarcerated Americans has quadrupled since 1980 .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- Imagine collecting thousands of empty plastic bottles, lashing them together to make a boat and sailing the thing from California to Australia, a journey of 11,000 miles (17,700 km) through treacherous seas. This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles. You'd have to be crazy, or trying to make a point. David de Rothschild is trying to make a point. De Rothschild hopes his one-of-a-kind vessel, now being built on a San Francisco pier, will boost recycling of plastic bottles, which he says are a symbol of global waste. Except for the masts, which are metal, everything on the 60-foot catamaran is made from recycled plastic. ""It's all sail power,"" he said. ""The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere, or into our oceans for that matter, so everything on the boat will be composted. Everything will be recycled. Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish."" De Rothschild's vessel, scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April, is called the Plastiki. Its name is an homage of sorts to Thor Heyerdahl, the fabled Norwegian explorer who in 1947 sailed 4,300 miles across the Pacific on the Kon-Tiki, a raft made from balsa wood. De Rothschild is something of an adventurer himself. The scion of a wealthy British banking family, he is one of only several dozen people to traverse both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps. In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology, an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues.  Watch how the boat is constructed » . Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage. The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii, Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney, a trip estimated to take more than 100 days. The plastic sailboat is taking shape in an old pier building not far from this city's famous Fisherman's Wharf. Here, thousands of two-liter soda bottles are being stripped of their labels, washed, filled with dry-ice powder and then resealed. The dry ice sublimates into carbon dioxide gas and pressurizes the bottle, making it rigid. The vessel's twin hulls will be filled with 12,000 to 16,000 bottles. Skin-like panels made from recycled PET, a woven plastic fabric, will cover the hulls and a watertight cabin, which sleeps four. ""This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles,"" said de Rothschild of the PET fabric. ""We actually wrap the PET fabric over the PET foam and then basically put it under a vacuum, heat it, press it and create these long PET panels. So that means the boat is, technically, one giant bottle."" Two wind turbines and an array of solar panels will charge a bank of 12-volt batteries, which will power several onboard laptop computers, a GPS and SAT phone. Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said. He declined to reveal how much it's costing him to build the boat. ""We could potentially put together a boat that costs a fraction of what normal conventional boats are made of,"" he said. ""The idea is to take the Plastiki, break it down [after the voyage], and put it back into the system. So, it may come out being a jacket, a bag, more bottles. It's infinitely recyclable."" The ultimate goal of the Plastiki voyage is not just to encourage people to embrace clean, renewable energy but also to see consumer waste as a potential resource. That's what this is all about -- showcasing cradle-to-cradle products rather than cradle-to-grave,"" de Rothschild said. Whether the Plastiki will successfully complete its unique journey remains to be seen. But to conservationists concerned about the amount of energy required to manufacture and distribute plastic bottles, its symbolic message is a welcome one. ""Anything that gets in the news and makes people stop and think about plastic can be very helpful,"" said Betty McLaughlin, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute. ""But it strikes me as a long way to go. I flew from Los Angeles to Australia once, and it took forever. This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous.""","An adventurer is building a sailboat out of thousands of recycled plastic soda bottles .
