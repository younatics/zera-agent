"By . Ruth Styles . When Cay Garcia, a fifty-something from Cape Town, was offered a well-paid job working for a princess from Saudi Arabia's ruling dynasty, she jumped at the chance. But less than four months after she arrived in the Saudi capital Riyadh, she was hustled on to a plane and thrown out of the country - all because she stood up to her abusive employer. Now back in South Africa, she has written a book laying bare her experiences at the hands of the Saudi royals - and sheds light on a side of Riyadh life that is rarely seen by outsiders. Scroll down for video . Poorly treated: Cay saw the princess' Filipino servants being cruelly treated and subjected to vicious beatings . In charge: King Abdullah is the current ruler of Saudi Arabia and ascended to the Saudi throne in 2005 . 'Life in Riyadh for a . woman is harsh,' she explains. 'A single woman cannot . even go for a coffee on her own - it's deemed immoral. 'You are allowed . to walk around a mall but walking around one's neighbourhood for . exercise is heavily frowned upon.' Difficult though living up to Saudi Arabia's strict moral code proved - a code enforced by religious police known as the Mutawa - her difficulties were nothing compared to what she would experience within the palace itself. There, as the head of a team of five staff members including two Malawians and two Filipinos, she was forced to watch as the princess, who Cay has decided not to identify, doled out harsh punishments that included beatings and having their rooms turned upside down, in addition to dealing with the capricious moods of the princess herself. 'In the beginning the princess seemed to be on . her best behaviour although the abuse escalated over time,' she remembers. 'It was difficult, at times, not to . retaliate when the princess, who was half my age, was screaming at me and telling me what . an imbecile I was because she didn't approve of the shoes I was wearing.' Although Cay herself was never physically harmed by the princess, the other maids - the Filipinos in particular - regularly found themselves at the sharp end of the royal's terrifying temper. Worse still, thanks to the iqama identity card system which means foreigners cannot leave the country without permission from their employers, both Filipinos remain trapped in Saudi Arabia more than two years after their contracts ended. 'The Filipinos aren't held in high regard . by Saudis in general,' admits Cay. 'I have the utmost respect for these people  - not . only for their work ethics and for being on call 24/7 without a single day off but also for having the capacity to take the abuse meted out in their . stride.' Abusive: Princess Buniah al-Saud was arrested in Florida in 2001 and accused of beating her servant . Difficult: Life for women isn't always easy in Saudi who are forbidden to drive among other things . One of the worst incidents witnessed by Cay involved the princess telling one maid to fetch a bucket of ice, tip it over her head and stand outside her room, dripping and cold, for the entire night. 'Apart from . the stories the staff shared with me and the severe bruising I saw following beatings from the princess, this was probably the worst thing I witnessed,' adds Cay. 'The abuse . is very real and it happens behind closed doors. The public personas of the . royals compared to what they are like when no one is looking are worlds apart.' As for the exit visas, Cay says they are a part of life in Saudi Arabia and all expats working there, including those from the UK, have to have them. 'You . get issued a identity card called an iqama soon after your arrival that . is carried with you at all times,' she explains. 'Everything you do, from buying . laptops to your marital status and renting an apartment is documented on . this card. Even traffic offences for men. Work place: Riyadh has several royal palaces but the biggest and most important belongs to King Abdullah . 'No one ""escapes"" from Saudi Arabia as you can only leave . once your employer grants you an exit visa and hands your passport . back which gets taken away when you arrive. 'There . are thousands of expats working in Saudi and the iqama is a form of control.There's no point being outraged by them - it's something you have to accept.' One thing Garcia couldn't accept, however, was the complete control exercised by her boss over every aspect of her life - including being told details of private conversations between her and her doctor. Days after telling her doctor of her unhappiness in Saudi Arabia, Cay was confronted by her employer - furious at what she saw as a betrayal. 'It was a lesson in not . trusting anyone in Saudi,' says Cay, who describes the incident as the 'beginning of the end' of her time in the princess' employ. 'I trusted that I would be protected by patient confidentiality but it doesn't seem to exist over there.' Restrictive: Saudi women are not allowed to do anything without a male relative's consent . Eventually, and after several more confrontations, Cay's contract was terminated by mutual agreement and she was given an exit visa - a courtesy still yet to be extended to the other domestic staff in the princess' employ. Both relieved and upset, she had less than 24 hours to pack her things and say goodbye to the friends she had made among the expat community. Harder still was saying goodbye to the colony of stray cats she had befriended, in particular because she had had no time to make arrangements for them. 'I hated the total lack of empathy when it comes to . animals,' she adds. 'I am a passionate animal lover and found it really traumatising to see . the thousands of stray, starving cats that gather around the dustbins in . Riyadh. 'Cats are seen as pests in Saudi Arabia. A common practice is to round . up as many cats as possible and then release them in the desert where . they die horrible deaths.' Yet despite her experiences, she says she would return to the region - and even Saudi Arabia itself, although not to the capital, Riyadh. Striking: The soaring beauty of the Riyadh skyline conceals some very murky secrets . Memoir: Cay has written a book about her experiences called Behind Palace Walls . 'I wouldn't go back to Riyadh but some of Saudi's coastal cities are much more relaxed,' she reveals. 'Riyadh is the most conservative city in the whole of the Middle East. Only black abayas are permitted in Riyadh whereas in the smaller cities, . pastel colours are allowed. The Mutawa are also . much more active in Riyadh.' And what of the princess herself? Although Cay says she would never return to work for her, she does have some kind words for her former employer. 'From . what the princess told me, there were many incidents, perceived or . real, where she was hurt in her life. 'The princess also suffers from depression and is bi-polar, neither of which help matters, but, . although it wasn't often seen, she has a nurturing side. 'She loves children as well and I think that part of the reason for her behaviour might be frustration at not being married and having babies of her own.' She adds: 'My experience with the princess hasn't put me off the idea of working for a royal, although if I did take another contract, I'd prefer them to be older. 'I . do feel very privileged to have seen a . part of the world that is shut off to the rest of society and to have experienced first hand how things are done within the royal House of Saud.' Even, it seems, if she didn't appreciate all of them. Cay's memoir, Behind Palace Walls: Life in the Service of a Saudi Princess, is published by Tafelberg Publishers Ltd and costs £10.95 .","Cay Garcia, from Cape Town, worked as a butler for a Saudi princess .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Lucy Osborne . A woman murdered her two-year-old son after social services allowed unqualified workers and students to conduct key reviews into his safety. A serious case review into two-year-old Keanu Williams’s death found authorities failed at ‘fundamental levels of care’, missing ‘horrifying’ cruelty. Last night Peter Hay, the acting strategic director for children, young people and families at  Birmingham City Council, admitted the city’s children could still be at risk. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brutal: Rebecca Shuttleworth was found guilty of murdering her two-year-old child Keanu Williams, who had more than 30 separate visible bruises and burns to his tiny body, yet was 'invisible' to the authorities . June 2010: Keanu taken to A&E with a cut above the left eye but Rebecca Shuttleworth’s explanation that it was an accident was accepted by hospital staff. September 2010:  Shuttleworth takes son to hospital with head injuries claiming he fell onto a metal bench in the park. She also said Keanu had been kicked in the chest by a child on a swing. The doctor considered it to be non-accidental injury initially, and then, changed his mind it after consultation with the supervising registrar. November 2010:  Keanu was seen at the A&E department at the hospital with a head injury, swelling and hair loss. Keanu was referred to a paediatrician due to concerns about frequent falls. Keanu was described as a ‘well cared for child’. A history of 'frequent falls' was noted. Keanu was discharged. December 2010: Three days after the last incident Keanu was in hospital with bruising to his forehead, arms,back, feet, eyes and burns to the right foot.  According to Rebecca Shuttleworth it was a ‘hot radiator’ at her partner’s flat which had burnt Keanu’s foot while sleeping. The radiator and site was examined by a police officer and a social worker who found ‘there were no concerns’. He said: ‘We can’t guarantee the safety of children because we don’t have enough staff. 'The position facing the city’s children remains frail. ‘We do not have enough social workers able to do enough great social work and that means  we are not able to adequately guarantee the standard of the safeguarding work.’ The little boy was found at the Birmingham home of his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth in January 2011 with 37 injuries, including a  fractured skull and a ‘fist-sized’ tear in his stomach. He had been to A&E and his GP with signs of abuse – including head injury, hair loss, swelling and cuts – on at least 12 occasions. Nursery staff were made aware of signs of neglect and abuse. But agencies took his mother’s claims that they were simply bumps and bruises ‘at face value’. Review author Jane Held said they were too often ‘unwilling to challenge’ or show ‘professional curiosity’. She added: ‘No one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother’s needs rather than the child’s.’ At least three untrained workers – including a student who was on work placement – were put in charge of vital reviews of Keanu’s situation. They included an assessment of Shuttleworth’s fitness to be a mother, carried out while she was pregnant in 2008 and living in Torbay, Devon. The killer, who is serving a minimum term of 18 years for murder, told the review’s authors even she expected social services to take her child away. Keanu Williams, pictured, died on January 9, 2011, after being admitted to hospital with multiple injuries . A section on the 25-year-old’s background states: ‘She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born.’ Friends said she would leave Keanu with anyone she could find and left him in wet nappies for up to six hours. Labour-run Birmingham City Council has been rated ‘inadequate’ since 2009 after deaths of children known to care workers, such as Khyra Ishaq, 7, who starved to death in 2008. The new case echoes that of Coventry four-year-old Daniel Pelka, who was tortured to death by his mother despite warnings from care workers. The report on Keanu’s death found agencies were guilty of a ‘loss of focus’ after an important assessment shortly before his first birthday. It stated that: ‘Professionals in the  various agencies involved . . . did not meet the standards of basic good practice when they should have reported their concerns, shared and analysed information and followed established procedures.’ The 182-page report said Keanu’s death could not have been predicted, but agencies could have seen that he was ‘likely to suffer significant harm’. Ten employees, including council staff, were sacked or have resigned  as a result, and a further five were subject to disciplinary hearings. Shocking: A a body map details the harrowing injuries sustained by Keanu Williams . Catalogue of injuries: Rebecca Shuttleworth was convicted of murdering her two-year-old son after subjecting him to savage and sustained abuse, the injuries resulting from which where detailed at Birmingham Crown Court . Sustained abuse: Keanu was taken to hospital with burns and blisters on his foot, but his mother said it was from a radiator he slept near, which was accepted by police and health workers . Convicted: Shuttleworth's partner Luke Southerton was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter but convicted of child cruelty . Mr Hay, who is tasked with improving Birmingham children’s services, also said the city is ‘still a risky place for children’. He said of the case: ‘We have failed to meet the basic expectation that our children are safe. For this we are unequivocally sorry. ‘We accept too that given our record in failing to improve children’s services, our apology may ring hollow. ‘We want today’s report to be a point of real change in children’s services.’ The Government has threatened further action unless it sees rapid improvements in care. Edward Timpson, the minister for children and families, said: ‘This is an awful case and the serious case review shows that improvements are urgently needed. 'Birmingham’s problems are complex and we’re  taking action to secure properly embedded and sustained improvement to children’s social care.’ He added: ‘Special performance measures are in place and I have issued the council with a final warning – Ofsted will return to Birmingham this autumn to determine what progress has been made.’ Crime scene: Police and forensic officers the area around the flat in Birmingham where Keanu Williams was found dead . Hellish: Pictured is the bed where Keanu Williams, who was discovered by paramedics with 37 separate injuries on his body, would sleep . Denial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton, pictured together in the dock of Birmingham Crown Court, both denied murder. She was found guilty, he was cleared . Edward Timpson . The Government has threatened Birmingham's under-fire childcare agencies with further action unless it sees rapid improvements in services. Commenting on the findings of the report into Keanu Williams's murder, Edward Timpson, the minister for children and families, said: 'This is an awful case and the serious case review (SCR) shows that improvements are urgently needed.' Birmingham City Council's child safeguarding procedures, which were judged inadequate in June 2010, are due to be reviewed by Ofsted next month. The city's children's services department was also served with an improvement notice by the Government in September 2010 after a serious of high-profile child deaths, including the starvation of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq in 2008. Mr Timpson said: 'Birmingham's problems are complex and we're taking action to secure properly embedded and sustained improvement to children's social care. 'Special performance measures are in place and I have issued the council with a final warning - Ofsted will return to Birmingham this autumn to determine what progress has been made. 'There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow. 'The increasing number of SCRs being published nationally is beginning to give us a deeper and clearer understanding of what goes wrong, and why, when child protection services fail.'","Rebecca Shuttleworth murdered son Keanu Williams and was jailed for life .

"By . Ben Hatch . My wife and I are happily snuggled on the sofa watching television, large glasses of red wine in hand. The children — Phoebe, nine, and Charlie, six — are finally tucked up in bed. It’s a typical evening in the Hatch household, except for one thing — there have been no fights over what to watch, despite the fact that I’m immersed in a documentary about the Nazis on the Yesterday channel, a programme which would usually send my wife Dinah mad with boredom. The sound of Stukas dive-bombing echoes in my ears without her usual refrain: ‘It’s black and white and you know who won the war. Why is this interesting?’ Then, over the roar of battle, Janet . Street-Porter’s unmistakeable voice rings out, opining on David . Dimbleby’s tattoo. It is unnerving, but not as unnerving as seeing . ghostly goose-stepping Germans behind Street-Porter’s bright red hair . when I take off my special spectacles. The future? Ben Hatch sits with his wife Dinah in front of the new split- screen Samsung TV . We are trialling the revolutionary new £6,999 Samsung S9C OLED TV, which can show two programmes at once. It promises to defuse the classic marital arguments over whether to watch Downton Abbey or the football. The so-called smart TV is the biggest I’ve ever seen, with a beautifully curved 55in screen. It can also dim or brighten its screen automatically according to the room ambience. You can change channels by talking to it or scroll through them with a flick of your hand. It can recommend programmes, allow you to email, tweet, store photos and music and probably put your kids to bed for you, too. Now, I love telly, even our knackered £100 Tesco one. So does my wife. It’s our hobby. We even have a saying: a couple that watches telly together, stays together. If the arguments over what to watch don’t split us up, of course. As we’ve grown older (we’re both 42), it seems what’s good for the goggle-eyed goose is rarely good for the gander. So it is little wonder that, waiting for the arrival of our super-telly, our excitement grew. At last, no more wasteful hours listening to my wife sob, ‘Look at that dear little baby!’ on One Born Every Minute, or sensing her schadenfreude at a collapsed Victoria sponge on The Great British Bake Off. Instead, I’d be able to watch  my programmes — shows that tap into the fact that men are still,  on the whole, genetically wired  as caveman. Instead of standing guard over lit fires with a wooden club in our mammoth pelts, we now monitor wider threats to our tribe by watching programmes about asteroids plummeting through space towards us. Or we learn how to hone our physiques — vital for our family’s safety — by watching sportsmen. Yet first, my wife must set up the telly, wisely asking me to leave the room ‘as you’ll only end up shouting at it’. Technology: The television blurs the two programmes together. Viewers wear 3D glasses - with in-built earphones - that separate the images so two can watch different shows at the same time . Two hours later, she was shouting at it. Specifically, she was shouting: ‘It’s one step removed in complexity from a particle accelerator and yet it’s come with less instructions than I got with Phoebe’s Hello Kitty watch!’ A mysterious ‘input source’ needed to be located. Four hours on, my wife had found her own input source — two glasses of Merlot. Thanks to this calming influence, and no thanks to me (‘Don’t get involved now after I have been working on this for hours’), we were sourced and our Smart Hub was sorted. On screen, the two programmes blur together. Then, if you put on the 3D glasses with inbuilt earphones, the images separate, so that I can see one show and Dinah can see another. Plugged in like this, we look like characters from a less suspenseful version of The Matrix Reloaded. Or ‘total nerds’ as our children call us. So, the verdict? Well, the voice recognition was hopeless. We’d issue seemingly idiot-proof commands — ‘Beeeebeeeceeee 2’ — and a robotic Americanised voice would intone: ‘Hang in there a little longer please,’ or: ‘I couldn’t find the content  you requested.’ I choose El Alamein: The Soldier’s . Story on the Yesterday channel, while Dinah opts for a re‑run of ITV’s . This Morning. It is utterly blissful. I could enjoy watching TV with my . beloved wife without having to watch any of her unbeloved dross. But . after a while I feel lonely sitting there with earphones on. Dinah is . shouting: ‘You idiot!’ at her programme. ‘Who’s an idiot?’ I ask. Unsure: Despite enjoying looking like characters from The Matrix - the couple both felt a bit lonely, and left out, watching their own programmes . ‘Stop bellowing,’ she bellows back, thanks to the earphones. Feeling left out, I switch a button on my glasses to allow me to watch her choice of TV, making the occasional snidey remark about how that woman looked a bit like Goose from the movie Top Gun — which, thanks to an attached microphone you can turn on when you want, she can hear in her headset. I am being an idiot and she is putting up with me. Things are back to normal. Later that night in bed, vowing to return immediately to our £100 Tesco telly, we repeat our Homer Simpson-like mantra: couples that watch telly together, stay together. While I think my husband usually has impeccable taste — he married me, for one thing — I must take issue with his TV programmes of choice, which revolve around two themes: sport and war. I haven’t seen a period drama since 1998 because Ben hates them, and I have to put up with him complaining relentlessly through the reality shows which I love (Gypsy Weddings/Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners/Embarrassing Bodies). I was delighted to be treated to some frothy nonsense for once, courtesy of our shiny new TV, and cheerfully tucked into a re-run of This Morning. (The last time I saw Phillip Schofield on TV he was sporting a scarily spiky hair style and presenting Going Live!) At first, both of us revelled in our new-found TV independence. I looked over at Ben on the sofa, his face deadly serious as he absorbed the horrors of World War II, and felt pleased we had avoided the usual channel wrangle. Meanwhile, I was amazed to see agony aunt Denise Robertson was still administering softly spoken Geordie words of wisdom on This Morning. She was doing this the last time I watched the show, when Fred Talbot was still jumping about on a floating weather map in the Albert Dock. Worth the cash? The pair found the new technology did nothing for their relationship - as they didn't share the television watching experience . But, after an hour, I started feeling a bit lonely. There was an unnerving silence in the living room as we sat with our earpieces corked in. Every now and then Ben would shout: ‘Why are you shaking your head in disgust? or ‘What are you laughing at?’ and quickly switch his headset to my channel, by which time the joke had passed, Phillip had stopped giggling and the person talking about their piles on a phone-in had hung up. My earpiece (which must be frequently recharged) cut in and out, so I missed a crucial piece of information about how I could win £25,000. Sometimes, when you switch between programmes, it takes a minute or so for the sound to catch up, so I also had a very unnerving moment when commentary about Rommel’s Afrika Korps advancing on the Allies provided the soundtrack to an item about whether it was ever right to abort a disabled baby. Losing concentration, I started looking over the top of my glasses, with the result that hundreds of German troops were running through Denise’s carefully-teased curls. Overall, this experience is not great for our relationship. I noticed that Ben and I were sitting further apart on the sofa than normal. What’s more, sometimes I can persuade him to massage my feet in exchange for agreeing to watch Match Of The Day, and this brave new telly world is threatening that. Secretly, we love the argy-bargy that comes with channel-choosing. Favours are traded (‘You uncork the Pinot and I’ll find an old Peep Show on the Dave channel’), questions are posed (‘How come the Spooks always manage to smash a terrorist cell in exactly one hour?’) and games are played (our personal favourite being Spot The Art Thief in the Antiques Roadshow crowd). Would I like a Samsung S9C OLED TV? Well, the picture is crisp and fabulous, the smart apps fun and the voice recognition a hoot (‘Put Countdown on now!’). But if having one means losing the shared jokes and the crafty sofa hugs, I’ll keep my old-fashioned gogglebox for now. The Samsung S9C OLED TV is available at John Lewis.  Road to Rouen by Ben Hatch is published by Headline priced £8.99.","£6,999 Samsung S9C OLED TV is available now at John Lewis ."

No injuries have been reported as a result of the malfunction on the roller coaster, which speeds up to 60 miles an hour and involves going upside down four times. Scroll down for video . Stuck: Emergency workers seek to reassure the 24 passengers seated upright on the Joker's Jinx roller coaster at Six Flags America in Maryland . Technicians don't know what has caused the ride to become stuck on a curved part of the track and riders have been reached by park staff in cherry pickers and handed umbrella's to shade them from the sun. 'While we are not yet sure what caused the stoppage, the ride performed as it is designed to,' a statement provided to ABC News from Six Flags said. 'The ride will remain closed until the park completes a thorough investigation and both the staff and ride manufacturer have determined the ride is safe for operation,' the statement said. The ride ceased operating at around 2.30pm and officers from Prince George County were on scene quickly and reached the passengers at around 4pm said Chief Marc Bashoor. Awkward: The Joker's Jinx roller coaster travels at up to 60 mph and its riders were stopped almost 80-feet up . Care: The 24 passengers were handed umbrellas and water while they waited to be pulled from the top . In total there are 50 first responders on the scene and according to The Washington Post they have been delivering food and water to the riders. Rescue options should the ride fail to be re-started apparently included ropes and harnesses for the passengers to lower themselves down from. Because of the curvature of the track at the point where it has broken down, it is impossible to walk passengers off the roller coaster.

"By . Rob Cooper . A fascinating archive of almost every original First World War recruitment poster ever issued has emerged for sale after spending 30 years hidden in an attic. The extremely rare collection includes nearly 200 posters issued between 1914 and 1916 to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting in the army. The posters have an increasingly menacing tone in the months before compulsory conscription was introduced in 1916 after Britain had suffered so many losses on the Western Front. 'Glorious adventure': An early poster (left) remembering the deadly December 1914 raid by the German navy on Scarborough, and (right) a patriotic call to duty from the early days of the First World War .

In 1915 (right) the posters took a darker twist, and made clear that people were expected to sign up . Happy new year! As 1915 dawned, men were urged to sign up and fight. Earlier people had wrongly assumed that the Great War would be over by Christmas 1914. The messages became more forceful throughout the year (right) War posters: An early poster (left) featuring Britannia remembering the deadly sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1,198 lives. Right: The authorities turned to emotional blackmail from 1915 as casualties continued . What the Germans have done from us: A poster created after the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1,198 lives. Right: More emotional blackmail with a poster that asks 'what did you do in the Great War daddy?' Go and help! A poster from 1915 as it became clear that the war was not going to be over quite as quickly as people hoped . 'Slip across and help lad': The poster makers turned to emotional blackmail in 1915 as war losses began to mount - and the stready stream of new recruits began to peter out . Arthur Maxted inherited the collection from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. For the past 30 years he has stored them in his loft at his home in Kent and forgot about them. He only realised the true value of the collection recently when he started researching and documenting the posters. They are now being sold at auction 100 years since the outbreak of the war and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000. The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops. They were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with people wanting to enlist after Britain declared war against Germany. Many thought the war was an opportunity for an adventure with friends - but when it became clear they wouldn't be 'home by Christmas' and victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled. Time to join? These recruitment posters (left and right) make it quite clear that it is a young man's duty to sign up to the armed forces . Recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Messages . included 'Why aren't you in khaki? You'll be wanted. Enlist at once', . 'Don't stand looking at this - go and help!' and 'Daddy, what did you do . in the Great War?'. Others targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. One . read: 'To the women of Britain. Some of your men folk are holding back . on your account. Won't you prove your love for your Country by . persuading them to go?' By . the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the . Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some . reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. The collection, which is only missing eight posters, is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset. Won't you help and send a man to join the army? These two posters tell women that their husbands are needed on the frontline and say they should not be selfish and stop them from going to do their duty . Step into your place! Emotional blackmail from 1915 as the authorities make an effort to recruit more men as the casualties mounted . Mr Maxted, 72, said: 'The posters were . collected by my maternal grandfather who worked for a printing company . during the war. Sadly it is a mystery as to why he kept hold of them, as . they were not of any monetary worth back then. 'My . aunt passed them on to me about 30 years ago and they spent many years . in my loft. It was only recently that I started to document them and . realised they might be quite valuable.' Patrick . Bogue, auctioneer, said: 'With an inevitability of war approaching and a . shortfall in soldiers, Parliament authorised an increase in the army of . half a million men in August 1914. 'As . a result the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee was formed to boost the . recruiting effort and part of the drive included creating posters which . were put up in public places. 'Interestingly, . the posters show how over time the methods and messages used to recruit . men changed. Many of the early posters depended on patriotism. Come along boys! A poster from 1915 (left) before the last recruitment poster was issued in 1916 (right) before conscription was introduced . 'Early recruits viewed the war as a great adventure which was not to be missed, particularly as the general view was that it would all be over by Christmas 1914. 'Initially these methods of propaganda provided a steady stream of new recruits but by November 1914 there was a marked decline in numbers. 'As it became clear the war was not going to be over as quickly as first thought, more sophisticated and sinister methods were employed. 'The messages were much more direct and even targeted the wives and children of potential soldiers, such as the now famous 'Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?' 'This collection is almost complete - it includes every poster issued by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee apart from about eight. 'A collection like this is incredibly rare and serves to remind us of the iconic images used to recruit soldiers for this historic war.' The posters will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9.","Collection of 200 posters was stored in a loft for 30 years by Arthur Maxted who inherited them from his grandfather .

"By . Sam Webb . Protesters gathered in London today to call for an end to Israeli military action in Gaza as the conflict in the troubled region shows no sign of abating. Pro-Palestine supporters carried placards with the messages 'Freedom for Palestine' and 'End Israel's attacks on Gaza' outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London. One of the protestors was Susan Jhafouri, a 19-year-old student who has Afghan and Slovakian heritage. Scroll down for video . Growing anger: Pro-Palestinian demonstrators stage a rally outside the Israeli embassy in London today . One placard carried by a demonstrator bore images comparing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler . She said: 'It's inhuman to kill innocent children. I think the fight is between two presidents, not between the civilians. I think Israel should stop the bombing campaign and explain what they want from Palestine and then negotiate.' There are growing concerns about the anti-Semitic nature of some of the protests. One placard carried by a demonstrator bore images comparing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, whose Nazi regime killed millions of Jews in the Holocaust. Mark Gardner, of the UK-based Jewish Community Trust, told The Jerusalem Post that the anger in anti-Israel demonstrations 'risks getting out of hand.' He added: 'We are already seeing examples of intimidation and anti-Semitic abuse from groups of demonstrators. There is no excuse for this, but it comes as no surprise. 'The organisers of these demonstrations, whether Islamist groups or their far Left allies are playing with fire; and we have made the Metropolitan Police fully aware of this specific concern.' The Israeli embassy also saw protests from those who support Palestine on Saturday, while on Sunday pro-Israeli protestors waving flags bearing the Star of David were at the site. Today, Israeli airstrikes continued to pummel a wide range of locations in Gaza and diplomatic efforts intensified to end the fighting that has killed at least 609 Palestinians and 29 Israelis - 27 soldiers and two civilians. At least 609 Palestinians and 29 Israelis - 27 soldiers and two civilians - have died sinve violence once again flared in the strife-hit region . Pro-Palestine supporters carried placards with the messages 'Freedom for Palestine' and 'End Israel's attacks on Gaza' The U.N. office of humanitarian affairs estimates that at least 75 per cent of the Palestinian deaths were civilians, including dozens of children. The fate of another Israeli soldier who went missing following a deadly battle in the Gaza Strip remained unknown, a defense official said earlier today. It was not immediately known if the missing soldier was alive or dead, the Israeli defense official told The Associated Press. The disappearance raised the possibility that he had been captured by Hamas - a nightmare scenario for Israel. In the past, Israel has paid a heavy price in lopsided prisoner swaps to retrieve captured soldiers or remains held by its enemies. Masked man: A protestor with an 'Anonymous' mask outside the Israeli embassy . Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Italy on Tuesday condemned the rise in anti-Semitic protests and violence over the conflict in Gaza, saying they will do everything possible to combat it in their countries. 'Anti-Semitic rhetoric and hostility against Jews, attacks on people of Jewish belief and synagogues have no place in our societies,' German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, France's Laurent Fabius and Italy's Federica Mogherini said in a joint statement issued in Brussels. The three said that while they respect demonstrators' freedom of speech and right to assemble, they will also do everything possible to fight 'acts and statements that cross the line to anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia.' Since the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, participants at anti-Israel demonstrations across Germany have frequently used anti-Semitic slogans and also called for Jews to be gassed - a reference to the killing of Jews by the Nazis in the Holocaust. In Berlin on Tuesday afternoon, about 500 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched from the city's Potsdamer Platz to the landmark Brandenburg Gate, chanting slogans like 'Israel is murder' and 'Israel bombs, Germany finances.' The most direct route for the march would have taken the protesters directly to Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, but police in riot gear steered them well around the monument to the 6 million Jews killed by Nazi Germany. Police had to separate Berlin resident Bernd Wierer from a group of young male protesters after he started arguing with them about their chant: 'Israel is fascist.' The 70-year-old said he was neither Jewish nor had any connections to Israel, but that Germany's Nazi past made it necessary for the country to be particularly vigilant about anti-Semitic slogans. 'They can demonstrate here, I support that, but you can't say those things in Germany,' he said. Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike in Al Shejaeiya neighbourhood during a military operation in eastern Gaza City today . In France, pro-Palestinian youths have clashed repeatedly with police, and on Sunday set fire to cars, pillaged stores and attacked two synagogues in the Paris suburbs. Italy has also seen nonviolent pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Jewish groups have expressed shock and disgust about the growing anti-Semitism in Germany and other European countries with strong Muslim communities. 'We have reached a new level of hatred and violence in all of Europe that cannot even be compared to the anti-Semitism seen during previous conflicts in Israel,' said Stephan Kramer, director of the European office on anti-Semitism of the American Jewish Committee in Brussels.","Demonstrators massed outside embassy in Kensington to vent fury .

"By . Glen Owen . Savings: George Osborne has outlined a range of measures to pay for his pledge . David Cameron will today try to bring an end to weeks of wrangling over energy prices by promising handouts of £1,000 to new home-buyers. The surprise move will form part of a package of measures in George Osborne’s Autumn Statement - seen as a ‘mini-Budget’ - including plans to cut energy bills by £50 a year through the scrapping of green levies. The £1,000 grant, which is to pay for ‘energy saving measures’, is a sop to Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who resisted moves to axe  the levies. Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg will jointly declare that the average £50 cut will be achieved ‘without taking any help away from poor families or sacrificing our green commitments’. The savings are likely to be achieved partly by slashing the number of solid wall insulations energy companies are required to fit - the cost of which is passed on to consumers - from 100,000 to just 25,000 each year. This is expected to generate a saving of £40 per household. A further saving of about £10 will be achieved by the Government agreeing to meet the cost of the Warm Home Discount - which reduces bills for thousands of vulnerable customers - rather than forcing the energy companies to pay for it and pass on the cost. To accommodate objections that cutting the levies will undermine moves to make homes and businesses more energy-efficient, the two leaders will also make the declaration that anyone buying a home will receive up to £1,000 from the Government - ‘or even more for particularly expensive measures’ - to pay for insulation if it is needed. Mr Cameron is determined to wrest the political initiative over energy prices back from Mr Miliband, who has pledged to impose a price freeze for two years if Labour wins the next General Election. However, attempts by No 10 to cut a deal with the companies - and then square the arrangement with the Lib Dems - became increasingly fraught as details leaked into the media. No 10 was forced to deny vigorously a BBC report that Ministers were demanding a price freeze from energy companies until the Election. The measures will form the centrepiece of Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement. However, he also faces pressure from Tory MPs to introduce wider economic reforms. In an article for today’s Mail on Sunday (below) previewing a paper he has written for the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, rising Tory star Dominic Raab demands a raft of middle-class tax cuts worth nearly £3,000 a year to many higher-rate taxpayers – funded by a radical £17.6 billion of spending cuts. Proposals: Dominic Raab MP, pictured, says the road to prosperity is to lower taxes and Government spending . Ed Miliband yearns to mimic Ronald Reagan’s winning pitch to voters in the 1980 US Presidential election: ‘Are you better off than you were five years ago?’ Yet most voters look to the future. If he’s prepared to be bold, David Cameron can still convince people they will be better off under him. It’s because - not despite - the challenges Britain still faces that people want a leader who can deliver a brighter future, not just fleeting respite from the recent economic mire. Even at face value, Miliband would struggle on Reagan’s test. Many fundamentals - including unemployment and inflation - have improved since 2010. But the challenge remains steep. Government has too much debt, the country too little to show for the recovery. The answer isn’t to match Miliband’s Wonga economics - including price controls on energy firms. Starting with the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement on Thursday, the Conservatives should chart a clear, honest and principled road map for prosperity. In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies, I set out several key steps. First, less Government spending and lower taxes. The Conservatives should offer a triple-lock promise: to reduce the tax burden by 2020, not to increase personal taxes, and apply a one-in, one-out rule to any other new taxes. To do so we must rein back further stubbornly high public spending. We can save £17.6billion by steps including halving the number of Government departments and means-testing more benefits such as winter fuel and bus passes. We should cut employers’ National Insurance and business rates to power job creation and level the high street’s playing field with online retailers. We should lead, not follow, the debate about the lowest paid. Miliband’s jobs-killing proposal to legislate for a living wage would hurt the long-term and young unemployed most. A better idea is to raise the threshold for employee NI, properly funded and targeted. Finally, middle-class Peter should not be robbed to pay working-class Paul. While the income tax collected from the basic rate has fallen ten per cent under the Coalition, the amount collected from the higher rate is up by a third. Anyone earning £20,000 a year has felt a rising tax burden. By tackling public spending, the Tories can ease the squeeze on the middle classes. We should cut the basic and higher rates of income tax by a penny each. Long term, we should merge NI and income tax – and move to two rates at 15 and 35 per cent, to boost UK competitiveness and reward hard work and ambition. David Cameron has the conviction and charisma, but must also display some Reaganite will, to illuminate the path towards brighter days ahead.","Surprise move will be part of the Chancellor's Autumn Statement .

"On a glorious summer’s day what middle-aged man hasn’t imagined himself with the wind in his hair, at the wheel of an open-top sports car? Alas, the majority have to content themselves with a trudge behind the family lawn mower. But Mike Clark doesn’t just dream — and he isn’t content with the limitations of terra firma. Scroll down for video . The sky is the limit: Mike Clark in the cockpit of his Fokker Eindecker replica plane on in Horsham, West Sussex . If the sun is shining and the wind in the right direction, Mr Clark is likely to be taxiing out of his garage and taking off from his rural back garden cum runway at the controls of a World War I fighter plane. For £12,000 — less than the cost of a small second-hand roadster — the 62-year-old has built a replica of the celebrated Fokker Eindecker E.III. This elegant German machine — the first specifically designed single-seat fighter aircraft in aviation history — was much feared by the pilots of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, over the skies of France and Belgium. Indeed, between July 1915 and early 1916, it became known as the ‘Fokker Scourge’. Our pilots were mere ‘Fokker Fodder’ and they fell in their scores.

The Fokker is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft . Despite his own mount’s (replica) machine-gun Mr Clark, who is a commercial airline pilot, has no such murderous intent. Instead, he enjoys tootling over the rolling countryside around his home near Horsham, West Sussex, at a cruising speed of 55mph, thanks to his 50-horsepower Hirth motor, which runs off the same fuel as his car, mixed with two-stroke oil. As it weighs just 115 kilos when empty, the Fokker is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft. It took 18 months to build using a kit bought from Grass Strip Aviation, a company based in Stroud.

Kit parts for Mike Clark's Fokker Eindecker replica plane: As with most middle-aged male hobbies, it helps if your partner approves . Since its completion in June 2012, Mr Clark has notched up 90 hours’ flying time. It has a range of 90 miles on a 20-litre tank of fuel, with a sedentary stall speed of 25mph. Mr Clark denies that it is merely a busman’s holiday. ‘It’s still flying, but it’s very different from airline flying,’ he says. ‘It’s the freedom, in some ways it’s more challenging. In the airline world, everything is done by numbers, it all comes out of a book, whereas you rely much more on experience and judgment when you’re flying from a grass strip. ‘The grass is a bit longer, it’s wet, the wind’s not quite right — it’s all down to judgment. The Eindecker is very exposed. ‘Because it is very light it does pick up the (wind) turbulence very well, so you have to choose your time for flying it — normally morning or evening, when it’s a bit calmer.’ Such great heights: So far Mr Clark has flown up to 3,000ft but says he would be a bit scared to go any higher than that . The Fokker is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft .

Support: As with most middle-aged male hobbies, it helps if your partner approves ¿ particularly if your lawn is being used for take-off and landings . Mr Clarke said flying a passenger jet is much different - in the Eindecker he said you have to rely much more on experience and judgement . So far, Mr Clark has flown up to 3,000ft. ‘I’d be a bit scared to go any higher than that,’ he admits. ‘In any case, it gets rather cold up there. You have to wrap up well.’ As with most middle-aged male hobbies, it helps if your partner approves — particularly if your lawn is being used for take-off and landings. Mr Clark’s wife, Esther, is a 54-year-old teacher and textile artist. She is also Dutch, like the Eindecker’s designer, Anthony Fokker. Perhaps that is why she has been ‘very supportive’ of this home aviation project, the latest of several. ‘The only thing she doesn’t like about it is that it’s a two-stroke engine and the exhaust does tend to make rather a smell,’ explains Mr Clark. ‘So she keeps well away when I go flying.’ Mrs Clark says: ‘I’m not too worried about him flying, I worry more when he has a  long drive. I think driving on motorways or country lanes is more dangerous. It makes him happy, and I suppose it’s better than him lingering in bars.’","Mike Clark, 62, has built a replica of the celebrated Fokker Eindecker E.III .

"By . Catherine Ostler . Fit for a prince: George is being treated to a themed birthday party to see in his first year . One might think a future monarch’s first birthday party would be a palatial affair with tiny party crowns, a miniature throne, perhaps even a few liveried footmen carrying in a towering cake to the sound of trumpets, as saluting soldiers march past the regal tot. In truth, however, the Windsor tradition of first birthdays has always tended towards the simple. The Royal Family take the view that, as tinies won’t remember the celebration, there’s little point in bothering. The Queen’s parents were away on tour when she turned one. The Duke of Edinburgh was on naval duty in Malta when Prince Charles woke up in Clarence House on his first birthday (though he did send a model plane). Even Prince William was alone with his nanny, Barbara Barnes, because his parents were in Canada on his first birthday. They held a belated party at Buckingham Palace the next month. Fortunately for peachy-cheeked Prince George, he can rely on the Middleton family, who make it their business — literally — to throw a good party. Today, a full three days before his actual birthday, George was due to be taken by his parents to the Middletons’ home outside Bucklebury in Berkshire. There, his doting grandmother Carole has arranged a Peter Rabbit-themed party that brands him a very middle-class little prince. Although it is being described as a low-key ‘private family occasion’, much thought has gone into making it a perfect first birthday. The presents — a football, wooden train, fleecy top and special photos and recordings — will not be lavish but have been chosen with love and care: there will be a special cake from his Spanish nanny, a piece of lace from his Italian housekeeper, a beautiful polo top and sun hat from Carole and his aunt Pippa. Who better to be in charge than the Middletons, who have built an entire business empire on infant celebrations? Their seven-bedroom Georgian pile, set in 18 acres, is the perfect venue, being spacious and familiar to George, who spent the first few weeks of his life there, being wheeled round the idyllic, rather Beatrix Potterish garden. A cursory glance at the family website, Party Pieces, tells us that Carole, like Pippa, loves a themed event. ‘When she chooses a theme there’s no holding back,’ says a friend. ‘There will be pictures and posters everywhere, vol au vents in the shape of rabbits, fun trails, you name it. She always uses all her own stuff from Party Pieces and runs it like a military manoeuvre, while Michael hangs back somewhere, full of bonhomie.’ Business: Although the Royal Family tend towards muted affairs for infants' birthdays, Carole Middleton is a professional party-thrower, and her grandson's first birthday party will receive the full treatment . In choosing Peter Rabbit, Beatrix Potter’s delightfully naughty, greedy bunny who first appeared in 1902, Carole could not have picked a theme more wonderfully symbolic of middle-class values: Potter is the John Lewis of children’s authors — safe, enduring and moral. Peter is her particularly beloved creation, the immature bunny who, like all small boys, wants to test the limits of his liberty: he disobeys and nearly ends up in a pie like his father, before running home to his mother. The now defunct left-wing Inner London Education Authority banned him and his cousin Benjamin Bunny from London schools in the 1980s because it said the rabbits were too bourgeois. Prince George’s bunny-themed bash is planned as an ‘extended family party’ to kick off his first birthday party week (on Tuesday, the day itself, he will probably have a second celebration organised by Kate at Kensington Palace). 'The place will be groaning with 1970s party food. Carole is a real feeder' The Bucklebury affair will last no . less than two hours but no more than three, so exhaustion and tears . don’t set in. Besides the Middletons, godmother Zara, her husband Mike . Tindall and their six-month-old daughter Mia Grace are on the guest . list. ‘There will be lots of . finger food, oodles of fresh fruit, organic ice creams and fresh fruit . sorbets. He’ll have Peter Rabbit cake and home-made baby-bunny . biscuits,’ says one close source. The adults will have plenty to nibble, too. ‘Carole’s a real feeder,’ says another friend. ‘The place will be groaning with 1970s-style party food that the guests won’t be able to avoid eating.’ Prince George and friends will be seated, apparently, on bean bags printed with animal faces, one of which has ‘George’ embroidered on it. Kate, like Carole, loves anything personalised. Pride of place will go to George’s ‘first birthday book’, which has been meticulously compiled by Kate, who used to take photographs for the Party Pieces website. It contains snaps of George, often alongside his beloved companion, Lupo the black cocker spaniel; his crowd-pleasing trip to Australia and New Zealand; his first steps and many ‘fun snippets’. Kate and William have also made a CD of songs and lullabies which includes them singing ‘Happy First Birthday’. The Cambridges are giving him a traditional wooden train with the carriages spelling out his name (presumably that’s the full George Alexander Louis). Middleton classic: The family business is partial to a themed party, marketing these invitations for any other children wishing to follow suit with a Peter Rabbit themed party . He will also receive a personalised . fleecy dressing-gown, and Prince William has had a hand-stitched . football made for him (possibly in the colours of Aston Villa, the team . William supports). Lupo is ‘giving’ Prince George a paw-printed . photograph of himself and George playing in the garden. Although . the firm instruction has been issued that George is not to be spoilt, a . gratifying, good-natured rivalry has built up among the Windsors’ staff . to see who can give George the most original, moving and comment-worthy . present. To this end, Kate and William’s housekeeper, Antonella Fresolene, is having a pillow made for him out of Tombolo lace, the product of an intricate 14th-century technique involving many bobbins worked around a round pillow. The resulting lace is delicate, elaborate and very expensive. A piece of amber is also normally given on a first birthday in Italy, for the teething baby to suck. Not to be outdone, nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is making a traditional Tarta de Santiago, a dense cake from Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain, which is made with almonds, eggs, sugar and grated orange zest. It is supposed to bring good luck and usually has the Cross of Santiago (St James) on the top in dusted sugar. From this we can assume that George is not one of that growing army of children with a nut allergy. He can also expect to have his earlobe pulled, a Spanish first birthday tradition to bring more good luck. Carole and Pippa have been seen shopping in recent weeks in Blue Almonds, a fashionable London children’s shop, for new outfits including shorts, sun hats, swimming shorts and polo tops, so there may well be gifts of clothes as well as toys. Uncle James is known for humorous . presents: he once bought Carole some old plane seats ‘so she could . practise her “doors to manual” ’. British . manufacturers of baby products will also be sending gifts. Johnstons of . Elgin (Royal Warrant holders for Prince Charles), for instance, have . made some cashmere cushions with ‘George’ knitted into them, in royal . blue with cream lettering. Beatrix Potter perfection: The winding gardens of the Middletons' Berkshire estate will be the ideal setting . Prince . George even has his own commemorative birthday coin from the Royal . Mint, a £5 (always the chosen amount for royal celebrations) coin in . silver (the metal that must cross a baby’s palm to bring health and . wealth). A limited edition of 7,500 are being made at £80 each. Otherwise, . the Georgian silver presents traditional on a first birthday — spoons, . boxes, eggcups — will be the domain of wealthier godparents such as . 23-year-old Earl Grosvenor, heir to the Duke of Westminster, and . long-time family friend William Van Cutsem. Both will see the Cambridges . separately as neither is coming to the party. Ten-month-old . Henry Baker, son of godfather Oliver Baker (a contemporary of the . couple at St Andrews University) and godson of Kate, might make it; . alongside fellow godmother and interior designer Emilia . Jardine-Paterson. One friend says: ‘Wills and Kate want to keep Prince George’s first birthday as private and family-oriented as possible. He can expect to have his earlobe pulled by nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo - a Spanish first birthday tradition to bring more good luck . If George wants to throw toys, have a . teething fit, pull Lupo’s tail or be noisy, they want to be surrounded . by family who will keep it all under wraps. He . is their only child and they want his first birthday to be memorable, . fun and strictly unfussy. Whether the Peter Rabbit theme is considered . middle-class will not trouble them one jot. ‘They . are all unconcerned about the social nuances of a themed first birthday . party for the heir to the throne. It will go swimmingly because that is . what the Middletons are famous for doing. Attention to detail is their . byword.’ One family friend says that, like most mothers of babies who get the opportunity, Kate hands George over to Carole the moment she gets to Bucklebury (the nanny doesn’t normally go with them, and will give her present to the prince at Kensington Palace), which suits everyone because Carole likes to be in control of her own domain just as much as Kate likes a rest. Prince George’s first Bucklebury birthday party is a reminder that he is most certainly 50 per cent Middleton. And, given that the Windsor option wouldn’t have been nearly so much fun, he is all the better off for it.","Royal Family prefer simple parties for infants who won't remember it .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans For Mailonline . This is the shocking moment a convicted Muslim extremist warned there would be a terror attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. Afsor Ali, 27, who worked in security on the London Underground, was captured on video telling viewers not to attend the event on April 29, 2011, at Westminster Abbey in London. Under the alias Abu Assadullah, he can be heard warning there is a 'high possibility of an attack' at the 'royal wedding'. Scroll down for video . Warning: Afsor Ali, 27, is captured on video warning there will be a terror attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. Under the alias Abu Assadullah, he says there is a 'high possibility of an attack' In the footage, posted on YouTube, he also tells viewers that the British public have ‘no one to blame except themselves’ because they failed to condemn the government. In addition to the video, Ali kept a stash of terror manuals on his MP3 player, owned a copy of the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire with a guide on how to make bombs and fire an AK-47, and branded the 9/11 terrorist atrocity 'an historic event'. Now, he has been jailed for two years and seven months after being convicted of three out of four counts of possessing terrorist material at London's Old Bailey. At an earlier hearing, Ali, from Bethnal Green, east London, had admitted possessing someone else’s UK passport in an unsuccessful bid to flee on the Eurostar to Paris in March. Jailed: Ali was today jailed for two years and seven months after being convicted of three out of four counts of possessing terrorist material . And today, he also pleaded guilty to a bail offence by failing to attend a court in February. Ali was handed a 16-month jail sentence for the passport offence . and an eight-month term for skipping bail, to run concurrently, as well as a . further 15-month sentence for possessing terrorist material. Sentencing Ali, Judge Charles Wide QC told him he had made a 'really determined attempt' to evade justice. He said the defendant had lied in his evidence in a bid to make the jury believe that while he was 'radical and committed', he was 'not an extremist and did not support terrorism'. He told Ali: ‘During the trial you tried to give the jury impression that although you were radical you weren’t an extremist and didn’t support terrorism. 'It is absolutely clear you are an extremist and you do support terrorism. You deliberately tried to tuck this material away in a series of subfolders. 'Had you had the intention of using the material the sentence would have been very different.' He continued: 'While you were on bail, subject to strict conditions, you did not report to the police. Sadly action was not taken as early as it should have been. 'You then made a really determined attempt to flee the jurisdiction. You acquired somebody else’s passport. I am told you had a lot of money on you. It is very obvious you were getting help. You are not just a loner. That is a very serious matter.' Dressed in a cream tunic and hat, Ali stood impassively in the dock throughout the hearing before being led down to the cells. Earlier in mitigation, his lawyer Naeem Miam argued that Ali had made no attempt to disseminate the terrorist material and there was no suggestion that he was himself a terrorist. Royal wedding: Ali told viewers not to attend the royal wedding on April 29, 2011, at Westminster Abbey in London. Above, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pictured with their attendants following their wedding . Appearance: Ali is pictured making an earlier court appearance, donning a blue-and-white striped shirt . During the trial, jurors were told Ali . was first arrested in December 2011 when he took part in a protest . against American drone attacks in Pakistan alongside members of the banned group Muslims Against Crusades outside the U.S. embassy. He was released without charge, but during the investigation an MP3 player was seized, while a laptop and external hard drive were taken from his home during a search. When the items were examined, they were shown to contain documents that were useful to terrorists, the court heard. When police searched Ali's home months later, they found his new computer also contained extremist material, jurors were told. Shocking: In another YouTube clip, Ali was seen labelling the 9/11 terrorist atrocity in America 'an historic event' Oliver Glasgow, . prosecuting, told the court Ali had promoted extremism in YouTube videos . under the alias Asad Ullah, which means ‘Lion of God’. He cited the two clips in which the defendant warned of a terror attack at the royal wedding and bragged about the 9/11 attack. The jury was also told that police recovered two personal recordings of a telephone call between Ali and the radical Islamist Shaykh Omar Bakri Mohammed. The defendant also possessed a transcript of a speech given by Omar Bakri, in which he seeks to legitimise suicide bombings. On November 29, 2012, Ali was charged with possession of documents or records containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism contrary to Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000. He was found guilty of possessing two electronic files containing Inspire - the al Qaida magazine - and an electronic file containing 39 Means to Serve and Participate in Jihad. He was found not guilty of a fourth count. Judge Wide ordered the destruction of Ali's computers and MP3 player that were seized by police .","Afsor Ali, 27, was filmed telling viewers not to attend 2011 royal wedding .

The video was reportedly shot today in the Bab al Nairab district of Aleppo, where Syrian forces dropped barrel bombs from helicopters killing 10 people.

Rescue: These dramatic images reportedly show the moment a helpless child was pulled screaming from the rubble after an air strike today in Aleppo, Syria. The footage has not been independently verified . Distressing: As the dirt-covered and bloodstained frame of the boy is hauled to safety, a man shouts: 'Rescuing baby from under rubble in Bab Al Nairab'. Ten people died today when barrel bombs dropped on the district . The amateur footage, which emerged tonight on social media sites and news outlets, has not been independently verified. But it came after barrel bombings today in the same district, which killed at least 10 people including four children and two women. Activists said many others in the historic Bab Al Nairab district, once home to one of the main gates to ancient Aleppo in the 1200s, were buried under the rubble of buildings. The Syrian army has regularly dropped barrel bombs over populated areas in rebel-held territory and parts of Aleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, was seized by rebels in 2012. Distressing: The video circulated widely on social media sites and was reported by news outlets . Encrusted with dirt: The boy is pulled from the rubble crying as rescuers crowd around him in the video . The civil war in Syria is now in its fourth year, killing more than 170,000 people and continuing even after international attention has shifted to conflicts in Gaza and Iraq. It began after a peaceful street uprising against four decades of rule by the Assad family in March 2011. But it spiralled into an armed insurgency when the army responded with massive and deadly force to suppress the unrest. There has been renewed concern from the international community after Islamic State extremists took over huge parts of the north and east of the country. There militants have declared a Caliphate where residents must follow an extreme form of Sunni Islam - and where their enemies' decapitated heads are displayed in public squares.

The IS group is now thought to control around a third of Syria including the city of Raqqa, from where it launches daily attacks on President Bashar al-Assad's troops and tribal militias. Today the terror group reportedly crushed an armed revolt by the Shueitat tribe, in the eastern Syrian province of Deir el-Zour. Expelling the fighters from three villages earlier this month, had been the first sign of local resistance to the Islamic State group since its fighters swept into the province. But the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighters had regained control of the villages, beheading two tribesmen in retribution.","Video reportedly shot today after Syrian forces bombed Aleppo, killing 10 .

Tony Yahle, 37, was rushed to Kettering Medical Center near his home in Dayton, Ohio after his wife Melissa, a nurse, woke up at 4am on August 4 and noticed his breathing sounded strange. She was unable to wake him and performed CPR until the ambulance arrived. First responders found a heartbeat and he remained stable until the afternoon - when his heart stopped.

Strong belief: He came back to life after his son Lawrence yelled: 'You're not going to die today!' 'We'd given him all the medicine we . had in our code cart,' the doctor told ABCNews.com. 'At some point, you have to call it off.' Then Mr Yahle's 17-year-old son, Lawrence, ran down the hallway to his father's body and shouted: 'Dad, you're not going to die today!'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The 2011 riots are set to cost taxpayers more than £100million in compensation payments. So far the public has paid £35.2million as homeowners and businesses are compensated for the criminal damage and looting, but a report warns the total could increase further. A review of the Riot Damages Act, which dates from 1886 and has been applied sparingly since then, revealed the public expenditure cost on claims under the Victorian legislation is £35.2million and rising. Destruction: The 2011 riots, which affected Croydon, pictured, especially fiercely, have cost a huge amount . Elsewhere, the report reveals the insurance industry has paid out more than £167million so far on 2,254 claims, including £1.5million to domestic policyholders. In August 2011, the police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, sparked a tidal wave of rioting, arson and looting that spread across parts of the UK. The review of the Act, conducted by former civil servant Neil Kinghan, concludes it should be replaced with a new version. Mr Kinghan said: 'The Riot Damages Act is an important piece of legislation protecting the public and businesses in the event of a large-scale riot but, at over 100 years old, it is well overdue for reform. 'During my review I met a wide range of people affected by the riots and it was clear that, while central and local government did their best, they were hampered by a lack of preparedness both for the riots themselves and for the demands for compensation they generated.' Costly: Scenes such as this in Hackney, north London, have already led to £167million of insurance payouts . Some of the cash paid out by private insurers is included in the cost to taxpayers because the Act allows insurers to be compensated for riot claims. While Mr Kinghan recommended that the law continues to allow insurers to be reimbursed, he said the amount of compensation that can be provided to insurers should be capped. A cap on compensation to insurers for riot damage should be set to businesses with a turnover of £2million, he said. ABI director-general Otto Thoresen said insurers have now paid out more than £20 million to customers for riot damage claims. He said: 'The recommendation that insurers should continue to be able to recover from the state certain riot payments made to customers is vital if riot cover is to be affordable and available.' He added: 'However, we are concerned that the review recommends that insurer recoveries from the state should be restricted to businesses that turn over less than £2million a year. This could be a disincentive for some larger firms to locate in some areas.' Mr Kinghan's report also recommends that the claims process is speeded up so smaller businesses hit by riots are given the help they need to get back on their feet again. He also recommends setting up a 'riot claims bureau' in the event of further widespread riots, which would be staffed by loss adjusters and insurance experts. Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims Minister Damian Green said: 'This is a very thoughtful and constructive report and we aim to launch a public consultation by the end of the year.'","The public has already paid £35.2million in compensation .

The extremely humiliating experience spurred her on to join her local Slimming World group and has now dropped to a very svelte 9st 5lbs and a trim size 10. Martha explained: 'I tried to lose weight before the big day but obviously it didn't work. 'I had managed to lose a bit but just before the wedding I put on around half a stone because of what I was eating. Martha enjoying bachelorette activities at her sister's hen night in July 2011 before her weight loss . 'When I put on the dress to go to church it split and my sister had to make a bow really quickly to hide the back of it. 'It was not one of my best moments and I was really embarrassed and just felt really stupid. 'I thought if I got the next size down it would spur me to lose weight, but I think I was in a little bit of denial. 'It was just horrible, one of my lowest points, but it kick-started me into losing weight for good.' Martha first began piling on the weight eight-years-ago after the birth of her first child Ashton. She developed 'quick and convenient' eating habits which saw her snack on takeaways, Greggs pasties, supermarket sandwiches and McDonalds. 'I never really cooked and would eat anything and everything that was easy and could be grabbed on the go,' she added. 'I just lived off rubbish easy convenient foods really.' She then fell pregnant once more with Arabella, now six. Despite her best efforts Martha's weight continued to fluctuate, and when her sister Jessica asked her to be a bridesmaid in the summer of 2011 she felt unable to say no. Although spurred into action Martha fell pregnant again straight after the wedding and was forced to put her weight-loss dreams on hold until March 2012. Martha was shamed into losing five stone after she put so much weight she split her bridesmaid dress . Cringe: Martha Gudgeon (left) at her sister's wedding in September 2011 when she was finally inspired to lose weight after splitting her bridesmaid dress . She joined her local Slimming World group and has now dropped to a stunning 9st 5lbs and a svelte size 10. 'I decided I wanted my active life back, I wanted to enjoy my children growing up and be able to wear what I wanted,' she said. 'When I was younger I had a really . healthy, active lifestyle but each time I had a child I put a lot of . weight on. I'd lose most of it and then fall pregnant again. 'I loved Slimming World because it taught me that I could eat what I wanted I just had to watch how much of it I ate. 'It was great for me because I lost all enthusiasm to go to the gym and the group focused on healthy eating. 'I cook everything from scratch now, it just tastes lovely, and I can't get enough fruit and veg. I just love my size now, I feel so much better.' She added that husband Phil, 33, had been supportive throughout her weight loss. 'Phil told me that he didn't realise how much weight I had gained until I lost it, although he has always supported me no matter my size,' she said. Martha is now training as a consultant for Slimming World and is opening a new group in Ubley Parish Hall, in Ubley, near Bladgon, on Monday.

"By . Arthur Martin . Questions: Julie Bailey set up the Cure the NHS campaign after her mother Bella died at Mid Staffordshire . Half the cash paid to victims of the Mid Staffs hospital scandal has been pocketed by their lawyers, the Mail can reveal today. One patient who suffered botched surgery was paid just £6,500 in compensation yet his solicitors picked up £221,000 – 34 times as much. And, in another case of neglect at Stafford hospital, lawyers made almost £50,000 while the victim received only £15,000. Official figures show that 104 negligence claims have succeeded against the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust over the past four years. But ‘ambulance chasing’ lawyers have picked up almost half of the £7.4million compensation paid out by taxpayers. Because the figures are incomplete the solicitors’ share may be higher still. Hundreds of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire between 2005 to 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned that many others had suffered appalling abuse. The startling compensation figures have raised fresh concerns over the tactics employed by lawyers who tout for NHS negligence cases. Using the controversial ‘no-win, no fee’ system, they entice the vulnerable with slick sales pitches on TV adverts. If they win, they demand costs of up to £900 an hour, which they justify as their reward for taking a risk. Last night Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, described the figures as shocking. Shocking: In a case of neglect at Stafford hospital, pictured, lawyers made almost £50,000 while the victim received only £15,000 . ‘Lawyers provide an invaluable service in supporting people’s rights, but they should not be exploiting this in a way which is greedy and excessive,’ she said. ‘It takes a lot for somebody who has suffered negligence – or whose relatives have – at the hands of the health service to take action. ‘To then find that you have greedy lawyers exploiting you by making money on the back of it is unacceptable and extremely disgraceful.’ Bereaved relatives and victims of the Mid Staffs scandal have been frustrated at how long their legal cases have taken. Criticism: Last night Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, described the figures as 'greedy and excessive' By the time some cases finished, the medical staff responsible for the blunders had retired or changed careers – sparing them any accountability. Julie Bailey, who set up the Cure the NHS campaign after her mother Bella died at Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘If the NHS stopped harming patients then the solicitors wouldn’t be able to claim the money. ‘The NHS has created this situation by harming patients and then making it so difficult to get answers. 'If you take legal action you just get a small settlement. You don’t learn any answers and the trust doesn’t learn any lessons. 'I have met people who have been in a legal battle with the NHS for 20 years and they still have no answers.’ Deb Hazeldine, whose 67-year-old mother Ellen Linstead died at Stafford Hospital, added: ‘The system is torture. It took me three years to get my complaint upheld. They treated my complaint with utter contempt. ‘My mum died of something she caught in hospital. The responsibility is on the trust to be open and transparent.’ Lawyers say they expect to see an ‘explosion’ in medical negligence claims in future years, following the scandals at Mid Staffs and at Colchester Hospital University Foundation Trust this week. Last year legal firms received £250million through claims against the NHS as a whole for medical negligence. During a 12-month period between 2011 and 2012, five practices received £35million between them. A spokesman for Mid Staffordshire trust said the compensation payments were made by the NHS Litigation Authority, which acts as an insurance scheme for the hospital, and the majority were for ‘historical’ mistakes. The spokesman added: ‘We never hush up mistakes. All serious incidents are reported to a board held in public every month. This does not reflect Stafford Hospital as it is today. The care of our patients has significantly improved.’","Half of the £7.4m paid to Mid Staff victims has been pocked by lawyers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Pupils will take cheerleading as part of A-level studies for the first time. The module will count towards their A-level in either PE or dance. It can also form part of a BTEC in sport or be taken on its own. Thurstable School in Tiptree, Essex, will run the two-year course for the first time in September next year. Jumping for joy: Students at Thurstable School in Tiptree, Essex, will soon be able to take a two-year course in cheerleading (file photo) The school’s cheerleading . club has proved so popular since it was introduced, pom-pom waving . pupils want to continue to hone their skills. Cathy . Graham, who will teach the sixth formers, said: 'Year 11s are saying we . want to continue, so I said let’s look at a qualification in the sixth . form. 'The school is really happy with that so they’ll be starting from next September.' Mrs . Graham said typical cheerleading lessons would teach health and safety, . first aid, improving performance skills, coaching stunts and even . marketing the sport. Typically there will be three hours’ lesson time a week plus extra required for rehearsals and performances. Cheerleading is already hugely popular in the U.S., with this squad visiting London from Detroit . The cheerleading qualification will not earn students UCAS points for a university or college application. However, Mrs Graham hopes universities will recognise the value of the courses when sixth form students apply to them. She said: 'Most universities these days have a cheerleading squad, it is a massive thing now.' 'More . and more it is seen as something different and shows students have been . part of a team and have stuck at something. It is very up and coming. 'The student will have travelled and have a lot of performance experience.' Deputy headmaster John Lee said: ‘As a sports college we already offer a partnership with Colchester United football training. 'We have had golf training as well, in partnership with a local golf provider. 'We are always looking for ways to engage with students and offer something different, and this is different.'","Two-year course is being offered at Thurstable School in Tiptree, Essex .

"By . Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . It's a race against time. More than 200 people have been employed by Dutch surveying group Fugro to get the job done as quickly as possible. They have a one-year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, before they will be forced to move on by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). Fugro must follow the lead provided by the ATSB. Forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months. ‘We know the time frame we have is about a year, after that we’ll be working in a new box as provided by the ATSB – they’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it (the plane wreckage) may be further south or north, they can order us to move at any time,' said Fugro Managing Director, Steve Duffield. ‘There’s certainly no time to waste. Scroll down for video . On board with the Fugro Equator as crews prepare surveying equipment for the next stage of the search for MH370 . ‘We’ve got one year to search inside our designated box, if you like, before moving on.' The images (below) of the search process which have been provided to Daily Mail Australia by Fugro, give a sense of what the Dutch team is up against. The Fugro, which is 65 metres long, is highlighted by the small circle, dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern Indian Ocean. It has just returned to the area after a crew change. In a setback for the operation, Mr Duffield said the sister ship, Furgo Discovery, has had to be diverted via West Africa and away from the Suez Canal 'because we were worried about pirates, even though we went through the process of hardening the boat'. That included placing barbed wire right about Discovery to try and prevent any potential hijacking. It should arrive in mid-September, about 10 days later than expected. 'I’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success,' Mr Duffield said. Surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea-bed ahead of sensors being sent down. In some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down. Using its advanced survey vessel, the Fugro Equator, fitted with state-of-the art multibeam echosounder equipment, Fugro is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area. The seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off Western Australia. Fugro will spend more than $52 million in the next year in the search for MH370. 200 personnel will work on the project and are 'finding equipment from factories all around the world' Mapping work continues in the area designated by the ATSB, as Fugro try to make the most of every possible minute. ‘They (the ATSB) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate,’ he said. That ‘box’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean, an area approximately the size of Tasmania, 1600 kilometres off the West Australian coast. ‘We are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches,’ Mr Duffield said. Optimistically, he added that ‘we expect to see a debris field’. ‘We are also expecting, in a worst-case scenario, that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object. Inside the control room on board the Fugro Equator where teams will monitor the progress of search equipment scouring the sea bed of the southern Indian Ocean for debris from MH370 . The Equator with a new crew on board is now on its way out to the southern Indian Ocean for a third mission searching for the wreckage of MH370. Fugro has 200 people working on the project, around the world . ‘We’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn, so to speak. That's when we tow our sensors along the bottom. 'That's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the Blue Fins were unsuccessful - it's very deep water we're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places. ‘But our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date, is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea-bed. ‘I’m not really sure how this will search will end up, it’s a massive area about the size of Tasmania and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task.’ The search conducted by the Dutch firm Fugro will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the Indian Ocean off the WA coast . Fugro CEO Rob Luijnenburg with a model of the two ships which are involved in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . The search operation will cost at least $52 million for the next 12 months. Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai will travel to Australia next week to meet with the search team and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss. The Australian government has committed to spending up to $90 million on the MH370 search operation. 'We are working in conjunction with Malaysian government furnished assets,' Mr Duffield said. Initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following the disappearance of MH370 indicated it most likely crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500km south-west of Perth. But despite an international search effort led by Australia and operated out of the Pearce Air Force base in Perth, no debris from the plane has been found. Troubled carrier Malaysia Airlines is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17 . The first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas, conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships, which concluded on April 28. An acoustic search, accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted, also without success. The ocean floor search was completed on May 28. As part of a major restructure, the Malaysian Government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private. Significant job losses are expected. The overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of MH370 and MH17.","'Fugro Equator' returns to the southern Indian Ocean for its third mission .

"By . Sara Nathan . and David Mccormack . and Eleanor Gower . Firefighters responding to the fiery crash that claimed Paul Walker's life stated he was 'dead on arrival', newly-released emergency dispatch tapes have revealed. The recordings emerged as his devastated mother, Cheryl, was pictured outside her Los Angeles home on Thursday - the first time she has been seen since her son and his friend died on Saturday. In the tapes, which first appeared on TMZ, a firefighter speaks with 911 dispatcher and declares the actor dead almost immediately after he and other emergency responders arrive on the scene . 'One vehicle fully involved,' says the firefighter, who arrived less than three minutes after the first 911 call about the crash. 'We have confirmed two DOA... again, confirmed two fatalities.' Sorrow: Paul Walker's mother Cheryl collects the mail outside her home in Los Angeles California on Thursday - a day before dispatch recordings emerged showing that firefighters declared her son 'DOA' The firefighter adds that it is a 'Code N' incident, which means an event is newsworthy and needs to be handled delicately. Walker's friends on the scene had most likely informed firefighters that he was inside, TMZ reported. According to an autopsy released on Wednesday, Walker was killed by injuries from both the impact and the subsequent fire. The . actor died from the ‘combined effects of traumatic and thermal . injuries,’ according to the autopsy released by the Los Angeles County . coroner's office. Tragedy: Paul Walker, pictured in May this year, was killed when the car exploded into flames Saturday . The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was . driven by Rodas, who was dead from ‘multiple traumatic injuries’ before the car exploded in flames, the autopsy said. Results of toxicology testing will take another six to eight weeks. The details emerged as Walker's mother Cheryl, . a former fashion model, was spotted collecting mail and putting the . trash out in the front yard of her Los Angeles home on Thursday. Cheryl . was instrumental in developing Paul's acting career at a young age, . taking him to magazine and TV commercial auditions and hired as a child . model, which helped to financially support his large family. Her appearance came a day after the late actor's grieving sister Amie joined a female friend at Starbucks looking grim faced, while his younger brother Cody began the heart-breaking task of clearing up the late actor’s . personal belongings from his Santa Barbara home. Cody Walker, 25, visited his late brother's home in Santa . Barbara, California, on Wednesday afternoon and later could be seen . packing boxes of the Fast & Furious star’s possessions into the back of a car. As Cody packed the trunk with items including clothes, a surf board, a rifle and . several boxes, a concerned neighbour stopped to give him a hug and pass . on her condolences. The . gates to the actor's home has become something of a shrine in recent . days as fans wishing to pay their respects have left countless bouquets . of flowers and candles. Brave face: Cheryl musters a smile as she takes out the trash in her front yard in a blue sweater and jeans . Tragic loss: Cheryl, a former model, had been instrumental in her son's success in modeling and acting . Walker starred in all but one of the six Fast & Furious blockbuster films that glorified fast cars and dangerous driving. Sheriff's . investigators are still trying to determine what caused Rodas to career . out of control on Saturday. They have said speed was a factor in the crash . about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The . limited-edition Porsche was previously owned by IndyCar driver Graham . Rahal, who has said it was difficult to drive. It is not just fast - it . can hit 100 mph in less than 7 seconds - but also unforgiving in its . handling. Little more than a month before the . actor's tragic death on Saturday, the Walker family had celebrated a family . wedding as another brother, Caleb, 36, had married his fiancée Stephanie . Branch.

Ashlie, 37, also hit out at reports her brother and his good friend . Roger Rodas - who was at the wheel of a Porsche when they crashed in . Los Angeles on Saturday - were drag racing at the time of their death. Breaking . her silence, Miss Walker said: 'They were absolutely not racing, that's . a complete lie. It hurts us when we hear these lies and it makes our . grief worse and more painful. Loss: Paul Walker's younger brother Cody takes a moment to contemplate as he spent several hours on Wednesday removing items from the Fast & Furious star's Santa Barbara home . 'These . are irresponsible allegations and people are trying to make out speed . and racing was the reason for his death when it was just a terrible . accident.' A close family member said Paul would . be the 'biggest angel in heaven', adding: ‘Paul was a wonderful man and . the best person you could ever meet. We are all totally distraught and . beside ourselves with grief. ‘We . can gain hope from this tragic accident through our strong Christian . background and faith.

Meanwhile, Universal Pictures announced . that it has shut down production for an unspecified time on the seventh . installment of the Fast & Furious franchise. The studio announced Wednesday that . the film will shut down 'for a period of time so we can assess all . options available to move forward with the franchise.'

"By . Chris Pleasance For Mailonline . A war hero who sailed the lead landing craft ashore at Sword Beach on D-Day then got it back home again despite a direct hit from a shell has died aged 95. Edmund 'Tommy' Purser was praised in a senior officer's report for his actions on D-Day after sailing back to base despite a shell blast killing several of his crew and leaving his craft almost unseaworthy. The following year he also helped to land troops on the Channel Islands in an operation which ended their occupation by the Nazis on May 9. Edmund 'Tommy' Purser, a veteran of the Second World War who took the lead landing craft on to Sword Beach on D-Day has died aged 95 (pictured left with wife Pam, and right in 1942) Mr Purser joined the Royal Navy in 1940 and spent his early years aboard HMS Vanquisher, helping to defend shipping convoys in the North Atlantic as they made their way from Iceland to the Azores. After becoming a Commissioned Officer in 1942, Mr Purser was transferred to New York where he spent Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year while waiting for his ship to be built. He spent much of the next year in Gibraltar and the Mediterranean helping to guard precious supply convoys from German U-boats, before returning to England in October 1943. There he was transferred to the Landing Craft Infantry and began training for Operation Overlord, part of which was the D-Day landings. Following the invasion of Normandy, Mr Purser's craft was repaired and he sailed several more missions to France, bringing vital supplies and reinforcements ashore. He also took part in liberating of the Channel Islands from the Nazis, again landing troops on the beaches. Some time between the two attacks he met and married his wife, Pam, who was serving in the Women's Royal Navy Service. Mr Purser was mentioned in dispatches by a senior officer after managing to sail his boat back to base on D-Day despite suffering a direct shell hit (craft pictured in American livery after being transferred to the US) After the war Mr Purser took up a career in accounting, living briefly in London, Exeter and Plymouth before he and his wife settled in Devon, where they had two sons, Simon and Stephen. The couple then moved to Bridgehill Garth, before finally moving to Bronte Residential Home in Ebford for their final time together after 69 years of marriage. Mr Purser continued sailing into his later years and held a membership at a sailing club in Topsham, near Exeter, where a flag is today being flown at half mast in his honour. At his funeral Stephen Purser paid tribute to his father, saying he had enjoyed an active social life, loved to dance, and also enjoyed playing golf. He is survived by his wife, now 91, his two sons, and two grandsons Paul and Mark. Like his grandfather, Mark has seen active duty with the army in Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland.","Edmund 'Tommy' Purser served in Royal Navy and took part in D-Day .

"By . Mia De Graaf . The half-brother of a senior Conservative MP is set to deny the sexual abuse of an 11-year-old schoolboy in the 1970s. Charles Napier, 67, whose brother John Whittingdale represents Maldon, faces one charge of inciting a child to commit gross indecency at a west London school. His former colleague, ex headteacher Richard Alston, 69, will also stand trial accused of assaulting the same pupil between 1977 and 1982. Trial: Charles Napier (left), the brother of John Whittingdale MP (right), is accused of abusing an 11-year-old boy . The pair were arrested as part of an investigation launched following claims made in parliament about a paedophile ring with connections to the UK establishment. They appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court for a preliminary hearing today. Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court that the defendants intended to plead not guilty to all matters. Mr Zinner said: ‘This case arises out of charges against defendants in relation to the alleged sexual assault and gross indecency on a pupil. ‘The alleged assaults are historical in that they are alleged to have taken place between 1977 and, I believe, 1982’. Co-accused: Richard Alton, former headteacher at the west London school, faces five sexual abuse charges for allegedly abusing the same pupil . Napier, dressed in a grey suit, blue and white check shirt and red tie, and Alston, wearing a dark grey suit, both spoke only to confirm their names. Granting the pair bail, Judge Alistair McCreath said they will next appear in court for their plea hearing on October 28. ‘You are both free to go on the same bail conditions you have had up until now. ‘You both know perfectly well your bail conditions, they still apply. 'Your next appearance before the court will be on October 28’. Police arrested Napier and Alston last year under Operation Cayacos, a strand of investigation launched following claims by MP Tom Watson in parliament that there was a sex abuse gang with links to the UK establishment. In 2012 Mr Watson used Parliamentary privilege to claim that a file of evidence used to convict Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained 'clear intelligence' of a sex abuse gang. He wrote to Scotland Yard, who launched criminal investigation Operation Fairbank, which has since spawned two more inquiries - Fernbridge, which is looking at claims linked to the Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London in the 1980s, and Cayacos. Napier, also a former teacher, has lived in Sweden and worked for the British council in Cairo and is a respected playwright and theatre director. Alston is the former head of New Barns School in Toddington, Gloucestershire, which closed in 1992. Preliminary hearing: Both men spoke only to confirm their name at the hearing at Southwark Crown Court . Napier, of Dorset, is yet to enter a plea to a single charge of inciting a child to commit an act of gross indecency. Alston, of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, is yet to enter pleas to five counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency with a child. The pair will return to court for their plea hearing on October 28.

"By . Hugo Gye . An apparently healthy baby boy died in his sleep during a morning nap after contracting a common virus which usually manifests itself as nothing worse than a minor fever. Isaiah Afflick-Paynter, aged just 14 months, went into cardiac arrest when he contracted enterovirus - though his mother was told that all he needed was cough medicine. After an inquest into the infant's death, his parents paid tribute to his 'big smile' and spoke of their devastation at his sudden death. Tragedy: Isaiah Afflick-Paynter died in July after contracting the common enterovirus . The little boy fell ill in July, worrying his parents as he appeared breathless and threw up at home in Ribbleton, Lancashire. His mother Chanel Afflick called an NHS Primary Care helpline and was told he probably had an infection and should get some rest. The next day, a chemist advised her to give Isaiah cough medicine, and she put him to bed after dropping his older brother Malachi off at school. But when she tried to wake him he was unresponsive, so she rushed him to Royal Preston Hospital where he was put on life support, but he was pronounced dead an hour later. An inquest into the youngster's death in Preston found that he had died of natural causes. Mother: Chanel Afflick thought he just had a cough and put him to bed for a nap after doing the school run . Tribute: Isaiah's parents said he had a 'big smile' and loved spending time with his family . Ms Afflick, 32, told the hearing: 'He was just being sick, I rang Primary Care on Sunday evening and they said there was nothing they could do and to stick it out. 'On Monday morning we took Malachi to school and on the way back I nipped to the chemist and said he was being sick and had a cough. They could only offer cough medicine. 'We went home and laid on the settee, I said we'd go for a lie down, he had a bit of toast and I thought he was getting better. 'He went to sleep but then he wasn't waking up. I ran across to my neighbour's house and they tried to bring him round, then we got the ambulance. 'You just never imagine that your baby will die. You think that after one year old they are safe and past any harm.' The inquest heard that Isaiah had contracted an enterovirus from food or something in his environment, and that while most children suffer only a minor illness from the virus it can occasionally prove fatal. Hearing: Paul Paynter and Ms Afflick outside Preston Coroner's Court after the inquest into Isaiah's death . Finding: The coroner declared a verdict of death by natural causes saying there was nothing to be done . Paediatric pathologist Melanie Newbould told the inquest: 'It's an oral route, it could be on food, or could be due to touching something and putting it in his mouth. It could have been a number of days that he had it, but probably didn't have any symptoms which related to it.' She added: 'In a small number of people this might affect the heart muscle and get a marked inflammation in the heart muscle. Enterovirus is an umbrella term for a . group of viruses which cause diseases ranging from the common cold to . the crippling illness polio. The virus is usually transmitted by eating contaminated food or touching surfaces which are carrying the pathogen. The . most common illness caused by the virus is a cold and fever, which are . usually defeated by the body's immune system within a few days. However, some patients suffer a more severe reaction, leading to cardiac arrest which can prove fatal. Enterovirus . is also a well-known cause of meningitis in children, while some . strains of the virus lead to polio, another devastating childhood . illness. It is not . possible to determine whether or not children are likely to suffer an . adverse reaction from enterovirus, nor is there a reliable treatment for . it. 'For reasons that we don't understand people get the enterovirus infection and it goes to the heart muscle and it can be fatal. Of those people who die of this infection the majority would be in this age group of one to two years of age. 'It could have been because his heart muscle was inflamed and didn't work as well, or you can get an increase of fluid in the lungs. There is nothing that can be done against the virus because we don't have the treatment. 'When I examined the heart it was slightly large, in particular the muscle of the heart looked quite pale and looked quite patchy. 'It made me think that there must have been something wrong with the heart muscle, it made me think this could be an infection of the heart muscle. When I looked at the heart under the microscope it was severely inflamed. 'It appears to me he died due to inflammation of the heart muscle which he got because of an oral infection. Everything else was normal.' Speaking after the inquest, Isaiah's father Paul Paynter, 39, said: 'My boy was as good a son as any could be. He was a very happy boy and we are heartbroken that he has gone. 'He had a big smile and was known for it. He has two older sisters and an older brother, Malachi. They were very close even though he still wasn't able to speak. 'Since his death I have found it more difficult to look forward. All we have now are memories. The medics were fantastic and tried for a lengthy period of time to save him.' Police investigated the little boy's death but could not find any cause for concern, saying that Isaiah had been a 'beautiful boy'. Tests showed the cause of death as being of myocarditis due to enterovirus. Coroner Simon Jones told the boy's family: 'In a tiny minority of people particularly in young children it is sadly a fatal condition because there is nothing that can be done. 'It is a viral infection where you have to hope for the body to recover on its own. This is a naturally occurring condition.'","Isaiah Afflick-Paynter died aged 14 months after contracting enterovirus .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A Mexican singer has posed with a jar apparently containing two of her ribs. Ariadna Thalia Sodi Miranda - known solely as Thalía - has taunted fans for years with the suggestion that she had two ribs removed to make her waist thinner. Last week, the 42-year-old reignited the rumour by mentioning it in an interview. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: Mexican singer Thalía has posed with a jar of the ribs she apparently removed to look thinner . Taunting: This is the latest of a number of teasing vines released by the singer about the myth . She then posted a video of herself on Instagram, holding her bare abdomen, with the caption: 'You think I removed my ribs? Yes, no? #ThaliasRibs #Myth' Now, the performer, who has a strong Filipino fan base, has posted another video - of her ribs apparently pickling in a jar. The teasing vine shows her gasping as she sits on a sunny balcony with the jar on a table in front of her. Rumour mill: The 42-year-old mother-of-two has recently reignited the rumours surrounding her physique . Posting it on Instagram, she wrote: 'To all my loving Filipino fans, here is the proof!

"By . Spencer Matthews . I've been given a deadline of September 6 to get back to Men's Health cover shape. Back in December last year I got into my best shape ever and made the cover of the top fitness magazine, weighing in a 12st 8lbs and 8 per cent body fat. I was ripped. I am far from that now (13st 6lbs and 15 per cent body fat), and this week I was told I've got a very revealing photo and video shoot at the beginning of next month that's going to have nationwide exposure. If I'm flabby and out of shape then it's going to be on show for all to see. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Back in shape: Spencer has been working with Shaun Stafford to get fit for his latest shoot . No pressure then – but at least I've got a deadline I suppose. I've got a four point game plan to reach the target . 1. Minimum five gym sessions per week, with top trainer Shaun Stafford at City Athletic Gym. 2. Take three Forza T5 Super Strength every day to boost fat burning, add energy and stop snacking . 3. Eat clean and low carbs . 4. No more booze and late nights. Booze is the killer for any weight-loss regime. I love a glass of red wine but it's 250 calories – that's 20 minutes running a swift pace on the treadmill. I have to remind myself of that every time I think about having a snifter. Going that extra mile: Spencer has only got until September to get back into shape . Dedication: Spencer has been avoiding both alcohol and carbs in order to maintain his fitness . If you have a large night out, not only have you put away 2,000 calories of booze you also set your body metabolism back a day – you can't work out on a hangover (well, I wouldn't advise it). Your body is working hard to detox itself and you can't change your body shape in that state. First session back with Shaun Stafford this week was pretty grim. He was especially hard on me because I'd cancelled a session at the last minute earlier in the week – it was the day after my birthday, can't he give a guy a break? Anyway, he warned me it would be a punishing schedule, so I popped two Forza T5 Super Strength tablets just before I got changed. They take a couple of minutes to kick in and then I was fired up for a hard session. Feeling the strain? Spencer says that his workout with Shaun is no walk in the park . Practice makes perfect: Spencer works up a sweat with a kettlebell . One quick point before we start on the work out – there is no easy way of doing this. Some very rare people enjoy going to the gym, I'm not one of them but I do enjoy the results - being fitter, healthier, and looking good naked. If you want to see a difference you have to work hard for 50 minutes in the gym, a few times a week and really push yourself. OK, rant over, now carry on. Giant Volume Training . We started with something Shaun calls Giant Volume Training – circuit training type exercises that work big muscle groups in top and lower body and burn a lot of calories and get the blood pumping. You can see from the look on my face in the pictures that it's not entirely fun. Spencer says he was in his best shape in December last year, however he has since gained almost a stone . Then it's 10 squats, 10 flat bench presses, 10 x prone dumb bell rows, 10 x kettle bell swings. Only rest for the time it takes you to walk from one exercise to the next, then take one minute rest at the end of each full set of four. We did 10 of these sets – and I was shattered. But it wasn't over – punishment for cancelling the day after my birthday came next. Metabolic Conditioning . Metabolic conditioning is the fancy name for rolling a big 80kg tire six times and then pushing it back. Thirty seconds rest, then do it again, and again. Shaun made me do it five times and I thought I was going to be sick. Then it was time for the battle ropes. Five reps of that and I was finished. I work it out that I've got another 15 of these torture sessions to go before I'm ready. They won't get any easier but hopefully I won't feel quite so nauseous at the end of them as time goes by. Lots of love, . Spencer xxx .","Spencer has less than a month to get in shape .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Prince William proved himself his mother's son today when he observed live surgery for the first time, like Princess Diana did more than 17 years ago. Dressed in medical scrubs, the Duke of Cambridge observed a breast reconstruction operation and the removal of a cancerous bladder tumour at the Royal Marsden hospital in west London. He later hailed the 'incredible' work of the two surgical teams at the hospital, which he has been president of since 2007. Scroll down for video . 'Incredible': Prince William watched parts of two procedures at the Royal Marsden hospital in west London . Watcher: Prince William here he is seen watching the removal of a bladder tumour . Concerned: The future king also observed the breast reconstruction surgery of a female patient during the visit . The visit closely matched a 1996 visit by Princess Diana to Harefield Hospital in Middlesex, where she too donned surgical clothing to watching a heart operation on a small boy from Cameroon. This afternoon the Duke witnessed the operations in the hospital’s Wolfson Surgical Suite where he was introduced to the operating teams led by surgeons, Mr Stuart James and Mr Pardeep Kumar. He spent around 10 minutes viewing a breast reconstruction procedure for a female patient in her 60s. As he was greeted by lead surgeon, Mr James, William said: 'It’s slightly surreal meeting you in this situation.' Echoes: The Prince was following in the footsteps of Princess Diana, who watched a heart operation at Harefield Hospital in 1996 . 'Insightful': Lead surgeon Pardeep Kumar, left, praised the Prince's understanding of the work he witnessed . The Duke looked into a micro-vascular microscope placed above the body as he was talked through the surgical procedure, which usually takes six to eight hours to complete. 'That’s amazing,' he said as he peered through the microscope. 'That’s incredible. Is this fairly major surgery?' 'Think of it as long rather than major,' Mr James replied. The Duke put on a face mask as he moved into a second operating theatre to view surgery to remove a bladder tumour for a male patient in his 80s. 'There’s space for you on this side,' Mr Kumar, the lead surgeon, said. 'Thank you, perfect,' the Duke replied. As Mr Kumar explained the procedure, William asked: 'That’s the whole bladder you’ve got there? Are you searching for any other signs?' 'That's amazing!': The Duke spoke of his admiration for the incricate procedure as he watched through a micro-vascular microscope placed above the patient . Interested: Lead surgeon Stuart James, left, explained the breast reconstruction procedure to the Prince. William watched about 10 minutes of the six-to-eight hour procedure . William is the first royal to view surgery at the Royal Marsden, which is a world-leading cancer centre specialising in all areas of diagnosis, treatment, care and research into the disease. He has been president of the hospital trust since 2007, a position previously held by Diana from 1989 until her death in 1997. The Prince seemed at home as the arrived at the Chelsea site, greeting hospital personnel in front of the main entrance. He reserved an especially warm welcome to Royal Marsden chief executive Cally Palmer, whom he has known for some years as part of his previous work with the hospital. Warm welcome: The Prince arrived in his suit at the site of the hospital, of which he has been president since 2007 . Old acquaintance: The Prince seemed especially pleased to see Royal Marsden chief executive Cally Palmer . Mwah! He embraced and kissed Ms Palmer, whom he knows from previous work with the hospital . The Wolfson Surgical Suite was reopened in 2010 following an extensive rebuilding and refurbishment programme after a fire in 2008 devastated the theatre area. During his visit, the Duke watched a demonstration of the latest radiotherapy technology, CyberKnife, which allows larger doses of the treatment to be delivered because of its improved accuracy and means patients require fewer hospital visits. The Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge previously opened the trust’s cancer unit for children and young people at its hospital in Sutton, south London, in 2011. Consultant urological surgeon Mr Kumar later praised William’s understanding of the work of his team. He said: 'He really had an insight into the kind of work we do. He really understood. The questions he asked were really on the money and were very insightful.' 'For want of a better word, he did enjoy himself. Peering: William observed each procedure for around ten minutes . 'The Royal Marsden offers one of the most comprehensive ranges of bladder reconstruction surgeries in the country. 'The Duke was fascinated by the procedure and the intricacies of the surgery and it was a privilege to talk him through the surgery and its benefits.” Consultant plastic surgeon Mr James, 43, said the royal visit had not been a distraction during the procedure. He said: 'The priority is looking after the patient. This sort of operation is slow, meticulous and very careful. A spokeswoman for the Royal Marsden confirmed that both operations had gone well so far and continued after the Duke’s departure. Earlier in the day the Prince and wife Catherine attended a Poppy Day event at Kensington Palace .","The Duke of Cambridge wore scrubs as he observed two live operations .

"By . Thomas Burrows . A grieving woman has been ordered by a church to remove the headstone from her partner's grave - because it has kisses on it. Janet Corless, 52, was devastated when her partner of 30 years Mike Howsey died in January this year, aged 49. He died from a pulmonary embolism caused by deep vein thrombosis. To commemorate her partner, she spent £2,000 on a loving tribute with an inscription containing two small kisses on the headstone and one on the base, as well as the phrase 'sleep tight Dad'. The headstone was erected on May 2. Scroll down for video . Ms Corless, 52, (left) and daughter Sophie, 19, (right) are furious that St Mary's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, has ordered them to remove the headstone they erected to commemorate Mike Howsey, Ms Corless' partner and Miss Howsey's father . St Mary's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire said the headstone was 'inappropriate' because it contained kisses and the phrase 'sleep tight Dad' Ms Corless said she was 'absolutely heartbroken' by the decision by the church to remove the headstone, which she had erected on May 2 to commemorate her partner, Mike Howsey, who died in January this year . But Ms Corless and daughter Sophie, 19, have had to remove the stone after the Roman Catholic church told them the inscription was 'inappropriate'. Ms Corless, a primary school supervisor from Walton-le-Dale in Lancashire, was disgusted by the decision, especially as she said other headstones in the churchyard had similar phrases and kisses. She said: 'The priest took exception to the little kisses and the phrase ""sleep tight Dad"". 'I can't believe it. It's so callous and I'm absolutely heartbroken. 'It's only seven months since Mike died suddenly right in front of Sophie and me and it is still very raw. 'The headstone we chose was beautiful and we were delighted with it when it was put on the grave. Mike Howsey (pictured) died in January this year. His partner, Janet Corless, spent £2,000 on a tribute but has been ordered to remove the headstone because it was deemed 'inappropriate' 'But when they told us the inscription was inappropriate and would have to go it was a complete bombshell. 'I had a meeting with the priest and pleaded with him to allow it but he seemed totally unsympathetic. 'He said the kisses weren't acceptable on the headstone and neither was the phrase on the base. 'I couldn't believe it and I just stormed out. I was hysterical.' She added: 'Mike meant the world to us. It's hard enough coping with our loss without having something like this making it worse. 'Why can't they show some compassion?' Ms Corless said her partner died suddenly after he became ill last Christmas. 'Mike became really poorly the week after Christmas. He nearly passed out when walking upstairs and so he went to the doctors. 'They thought he was badly anaemic and needed a blood transfusion so he had that on New Year's Day. 'He was sent home and a few days later he collapsed and died. It's been an incredibly difficult time for us and me and my daughter worked hard to get the money together so we could get a special headstone. 'We don't have another £2,000 to spend on another one but Cocker Memorials, who supplied the headstone, have been very kind to us and so hopefully we won't have to."" Ms Corless, a primary school supervisor from Walton-le-Dale in Lancashire, was disgusted by the decision by St Mary's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, to remove the headstone . Cocker Memorials, who are based in Preston, insisted the inscription was authorised before it was erected at St Mary's Brownedge Church in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire. Company director Michelle Howe, said she had received verbal approval from the church before the stone was erected. 'Sometimes we get written confirmation and sometimes it's done with a phone call. 'This was over the phone. 'We wouldn't have gone ahead and made the headstone if we didn't have approval. 'But it now looks like we will have to make an entirely new one because covering up the letters won't look right.' Miss Howsey, the daughter of Ms Corless and Mr Howsey, added: 'The priest said we could have ""sleep tight Dad"", but on a separate piece of stone - not on the headstone. 'So, really, it's just down to those little kisses. 'I've been round the churchyard and there are other headstones with kisses on. 'It seems ridiculous.' A local parishioner at St Mary's Brownedge Church said: 'The priest is straight down the line. 'Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with it but he's a bit old school.' Father George Corrie at St Mary's said: 'We extend our deepest sympathies to Ms Corless at this difficult time and will be working closely with the stonemason to make sure her partner's headstone is erected correctly as soon as possible.' A spokesman for the Diocese of Salford, which includes Bamber Bridge, was unavailable for comment.","Janet Corless' partner Mike Howsey died in January this year .

"By . Ruth Styles . Playing with their children, worshipping in beautifully decorated shrines and relaxing with their families, the happy smiles of Iraq's Yazidi people betray no hint of the disaster that would befall them just months after these photos were taken. Many of the families pictured live in Iraq's Nineveh province and are thought to have fled to Mount Sinjar, where they are currently awaiting rescue and surviving on food parachuted in by British, American and Kurdish forces. Others have fallen victim to the murderous Islamic State jihadis who currently occupy their home region and, just yesterday, were reported to have massacred 500 men, women and children. Threatened by IS: A pair of little girls play in front of a painting depicting the lighting of holy fire during a visit to the Yazidi temple in Lalesh . Innocent: A pair of Yazidi twin girls cuddle up to their pet sheep (left) while, right, a little girl poses for a photo in the temple. The fate of all three is currently unknown . 'They are . not Muslims but they are are seen by Islamic State terrorists as . devil-worshippers and heretical Muslims,' explains Eric Lafforgue, the . photographer behind the haunting images. 'The . Yazidi religion blends elements of Sufism, Judaism, . Christianity, Hinduism and Zoroastrianism. They also pray facing the sun as . opposed to Mecca like the Muslims do.' Although . you cannot convert to the Yazidi religion, the people are proud of . their 6,000-year-old belief system and were happy to show Lafforgue . around their elaborately decorated temple, which is currently being guarded by Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. His . guide was Luqman Suleeman, a local teacher and a journalist for a local . news website. Like so many members of the Yazidi community, his future . appears precarious.

'I think . he is OK as he is still posting updates on his Facebook page,' says . Lafforgue. 'The area around the temple itself is safe and protected by . the Peshmerga but many of those who used to visit it have fled and I . don't know whether they're alive or dead.' Inside . the temple complex at Lalesh, which has been destroyed . countless times over the centuries by furious neighbours and rebuilt just as many by the . Yazidi, are elaborate Indian-style paintings depicting young women with . holy fire. The . temple is also home to elaborate bas-reliefs depicting peacocks, the sun and the moon and Arabic inscriptions detailing . the history of the Yazidi and the persecution they have suffered in the . past. 'They . are a sign of peace to the Yazidis who have been persecuted by Muslim . extremists for quite some time,' explains Lafforgue. 'It is said that a . Muslim who kills a Yazidi will be rewarded with 72 virgins in the . afterlife.' But . important though religion is to the Yazidi, much of their time is spent . with friends and family, although with restrictions on certain foods, . deer and lettuce among them, preparing supper takes a considerable . amount of planning. Celebration: . Many Yazidi families such as this one travel to Lalesh to celebrate . important family events, in this case, the baptism of their baby . daughter . Rite of passage: All Yazidi are given an extra . sibling who will act as a guardian angel in the afterlife. They also . have similar baptism rites to Christians . Congratulations: . The baby girl's father is congratulated by Syrian Yazidi worshipper. His origin is made plain by his headdress - a garment Iraqi Yazidis . don't wear . Tradition: Yazidis have a number of dietary restrictions, including deer, lettuce and fish; the latter in honour of the Christian prophet Jonah . Holy . man: A Yazidi fakir or holy man. They are supposed to earn a living . from begging but many work for the temple. Some think they have . supernatural powers . Important . man: Babe Cavish is a high ranking priest living in Lalesh. He spends . his life in the the sacred temple and will never leave . Record: These Arabic inscriptions are considered a sign of peace by the Yazidi who have long been persecuted by their neighbours, most recently by Saddam Hussein . Other traditions extend to childcare, with Yazidi babies given blue pearl collars to wear in the belief that the necklaces will protect them from curses and supernatural harm. 'They are very hospitable people,' adds Lafforgue. 'They were smiling all the time and welcomed me into their homes. What did surprise me is that they don't really speak Kurdish, despite living in a Kurdish region. 'Instead, they speak Arabic which was forced on them during Saddam Hussein's time. They hate him because he oppressed them and did his best to kill their culture and make them to convert to Islam.' Sadly for the Yazidis, many of whom are still stranded on Sinjar Mountain, history appears to be repeating itself but with the murderous jihadis of ISIS taking Saddam's place and throwing their future once more into doubt. Ritual: . Yazidi people tie knots in scarves to make a wish while they worship. They then untie another knot so someone else's wish comes true . Sacred: . Worshippers also use scarves in another part of the temple, throwing . them on top of a sacred rock during prayer. If it stays on, their prayer . will be granted . Important: . Amporae of holy oil are stored in the bottom of the temple. As well as . being used in ceremonies, it is also used in lamps to keep the holy . flame burning . Peace: .

"By . Associated Press . In The Silence of the Lambs FBI agent Clarice Starling tempts serial killer Hannibal Lecter with the chance to relocate to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. 'That's only a part of the island,' FBI agent Starling says. 'There's a very, very nice beach. Terns nest there.' Plum Island's future has recently been caught in a heated debate. One federal agency is preparing a final report on the research center's proposed sale. At the same time, Long Island officials are considering new zoning laws that will prevent any major development of the 843-acre property if it's sold. Still others want the government to scrap its plans to sell the mysterious island entirely. Plum Island Animal Disease Center, pictured, is at the center of a heated development row. The Long Island, New York, facility may soon be sold, concerning environmentalists . Animal diseases have been studied and researched on the island, 100 miles east of New York City. It opened in 1954 on property that once housed a U.S. Army base from the Spanish-American War. In 2009, Congress voted to close the aging laboratory.  Proceeds from the sale are expected to defray the costs of moving operations to a new laboratory at Kansas State University. Some lawmakers claim the sale of Plum Island will barely dent the estimated $1.1 billion cost for the new laboratory. 'My concern is the unknown and uncertainty,' said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who has introduced legislation to stop the sale. Long Island U.S. Rep. Timothy Bishop has introduced similar legislation in the House. 'Our key goal is to preserve it as open space,' Blumenthal told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. 'Once we lose it, it will be lost forever.' The proposed sale of Plum Island, pictured here, may soon involve the relocation of Long Island's Plum Island Animal Disease Center all the way to Kansas State University . The General Services Administration, which is charged with overseeing the sale, has held several public hearings in both New York and Connecticut and issued a final environmental impact statement in June. The GSA will soon issue a 'record of decision,' one of the final steps before the agency proceeds with a sale, a spokesman said. The GSA's 500-page environmental report issued in June has been taken with some skepticism by environmentalists. Environmental groups on both sides of Long Island Sound have called for the property to simply be a nature preserve. They're concerned selling the island would jeopardize endangered wildlife, including terns and seals. The EPA has also joined the dispute, saying the GSA's report 'does not provide a sufficiently detailed evaluation of the potential impacts of the sale of Plum Island,' according to regional administrator Judith Enck. 'EPA strongly believes that conservation options have the best potential to respect the rich ecological resources of Plum Island,' Enck said. 'The island provides important habitat for a number of species and we hope that it will be protected and preserved.' This file photo shows people scouting for seals, resting on the rocky shore of Plum Island. The island, home to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, may soon be sold, leaving the seals' future uncertain . In 2007, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation issued a report saying hundreds of tons of contaminated soil had been removed from landfills and other areas on the island. At the time, there appeared to be no existing environmental threats there. However, it's the local residents of Southfold, located in eastern Long Island, that could play the most significant role in determining the island's future. Town Supervisor Scott Russell said a proposal may soon pass that would bar most of the island from any significant development. The town plans to pass a law creating a 600-acre conservation zone. The site where the existing government lab is located - a structure that resembles a modern-day college facility - would remain available should a research entity or university want to take it over.

"By . Nick Enoch . A policeman surprised crowds watching the Tour de France by taking a busker’s guitar and bursting into song. The appropriately named PC Will Medley, from the Leeds City Neighbourhood Policing Team, gave the impromptu performance while patrolling Leeds city centre in West Yorkshire, as part of the policing operation for the Grand Depart on Saturday. His accomplished rendition of Stealers Wheel’s Stuck In The Middle With You - famously used during a torture scene in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs - drew in dozens of onlookers, who can be seen giving him a round of applause. Scroll down for video . PC Will Medley surprised crowds watching the Tour de France by taking a busker’s guitar and bursting into song last weekend . His accomplished rendition of Stealers Wheel’s Stuck In The Middle With You drew in dozens of onlookers, who can be seen giving him a round of applause in Leeds city centre on Saturday . 'There was a great atmosphere in the city centre for the Tour de France,' said PC Medley, who has played the guitar for nearly 15 years. 'When I was on patrol in Briggate, a busker asked me if it was OK to play. 'I had a chat with him and told him that I played the guitar. 'He asked me to play a song so I obliged. The video has attracted hundreds of positive comments labelling the performance as 'an amazing advert for West Yorkshire Police' 'There weren’t that many people there at first but when I started playing, a crowd started gathering and showing support. Someone shouted, ""Get on the microphone"" so I did.' PC Medley’s performance was filmed by colleague PC Matt Thirkill in Briggate and posted on the neighbourhood policing team’s Facebook page, where it has already reached 174,720 people and notched up 1,416 likes and 833 shares. The video has attracted hundreds of positive comments labelling the performance as 'an amazing advert for West Yorkshire Police' and an example of 'true public interaction'. The reaction to PC Medley’s stunning performance has even caused charges of 'stealing the limelight' to be dropped - which was one of the jokes from his colleagues. Sergeant Andy Berriman said: 'We did joke that Will is now wanted as the prime suspect for an offence of theft of limelight but the public’s response both at the time and to the Facebook posting has been fantastic. 'It is without doubt the biggest response we’ve had to anything we’ve posted on our Facebook page and the comments it has received are overwhelmingly positive. He added: 'We set out during the Tour de France to show the human face of policing and that clearly came across with officers getting into the spirit of the event in Leeds and further afield. 'Will’s impromptu performance was clearly a welcome addition to that positive approach to community relations and it has definitely helped to boost our image and won us some fans.'

"By . Jennifer Newton For Mailonline . With wide smiles and faces full of hope it is hard to believe that these happy people are living in the squalor of a makeshift shanty town. Grinning for the camera, the children of the Manila slums act like any other youngsters by playing in a paddling pool and even tying rubber bands together to make bracelets. This is even though they are some of the poorest people in the world. Despite being surrounded by squalor in the makeshift shanty town of Tondo in Manila, these children can't help but smile as they play in the street . With no proper bathroom, the children of the slums take a bath in an inflatable paddling pool in the middle of the street . A young girl collects rubber bands and ties them together to make a bracelet and necklace, resembling the recent loom band craze . A little boy laughs out loud as he is washed in the alley of the Tondo slum in Manila, as others line up behind him to use the water . The images of the playful children were taken by Belgian photographer Sebastien Cuvelier on a trip to the Philippines, where he visisted four slums named Divisoria, Payatas, Quiapo and Tondo, as well as Singkamas in Makati City over a two month period. The 38-year-old, who now lives in Luxembourg City said: 'I wanted to show everyday life in slums around Manila, where people seem to be happy despite the terrible living conditions. 'The people were incredibly welcoming. Not one smile was forced. No one was ashamed of where they lived. Their dignity was impressive. 'The first time inside any slum is always very shocking; you can't believe your eyes. 'But it was very important for me not to look at them with pity or compassion. A little boy smiles for the camera after being pictured by Belgian photographer Sebastien Cuvelier, while sitting next to a dumping site in Payatas, Manila . A young girl has a face of joy after taking an impromptu shower under a leaking drain pipe during a storm in Singkamas in Makati City . Photographer Mr Cuvelier said: 'The people were incredibly welcoming. Not one smile was forced. No one was ashamed of where they lived' 'I had to act unimpressed and show that I was on the same level as them, even though I was white and had a camera. 'The Filipino people are amazing and always manage to see the positive side of things, which I find incredibly moving.' Mr Cuvelier visited around 30 homes to offer an insight into the reality of life for civilians living in the slums. He added: 'Seeing people live on a dump site was shocking. 'You can imagine the smell and the amount of insects when there are acres of trash lying around you in the scorching sun. 'The people there spend their days sorting through the trash, trying to find anything of value, mostly metal. Three brothers look happy as they play under the watchful eye of their mother in the Divisoria slum, which is littered with rubbish . A young girl smiles at passers-by who walk past her makeshift house built next to a dump in Payatas . A man and his son pose outside their makeshift house in Divisoria, Manila, one of four slums that Mr Cuvelier visited on his two month trip to the Philippines . With poverty widespread many people live in makeshift homes. This family live in a cramped room built under a canal bridge in Quiapo, Manila . 'And there, in the middle of the dumping site, was a sign that said 'room 4 rent' I still cannot believe that anyone would actually ask for rent money in such a terrible area, but it is the case in all slums I have visited. 'There is a picture I took, which shows a sole tree in the middle of a sea of trash. 'If this tree could grow there, anything can happen. To me, the tree represents hope for these people.' The photographer was able to visit the slums while working as a volunteer for a Manila-based French NGO called the Virlanie Foundation. He explained: 'I was introduced to the Virlanie contact in each slum I went to. A man proudly carries his grand-daughter outside of his shack built over a canal near Divisoria while being pictured by Mr Cuvelier . Mr Cuvelier visited around 30 homes to offer an insight into the reality of life for civilians living in the slums including the shack of this married couple . This cheerful old man peeks his head out of his shack, which is plastered in graffiti and political posters in Tondo . 'The NGO reaches out to a wide number of families there so it is very well respected and eased my way in, I could not have been there without the support of Virlanie.' The Virlanie Foundation is a private, non-profit organisation reaching out to street children in the Philippines and has been helping children who come from difficult situation to become a responsible and an independent adult life with the hope of a brighter future.

"By . James Rush For Mailonline . As the worst drought in 32 years threatens to cause a food crisis across Central America, people living in Nicaragua have been advised to consider farming and eating iguanas. Low rainfall in an unusually hot season has led to a series of droughts in parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, damaging crops and pushing up food prices. Now, a government expert in Nicaragua has recommended keeping and eating iguanas as a way of providing food, as well as an income. As the worst draught in 32 years threatens to cause a food crisis across Central America, a government expert in Nicaragua has recommended people keeping and eating iguanas . Land management expert Guillermo Membreño told state-run online newspaper La Voz del Sandinismo, as translated by The Guardian: 'Breeding iguanas brings two benefits. Not only does it supply dietary protein, it also offers a commercial use for the animals.' He said the tropical lizards contained 24 per cent more protein than chicken and could also be sold for their meat, skin or as pets. While hunting iguanas is outlawed by the country's environmental laws from January to the end of April, they are allowed to be kept as food. Iguana meat has been described as similar to chicken, but sweeter, and is most often used in stews, tacos and roasts. The suggestions made by the government expert however have reportedly been mocked by some Nicaraguans. The advice comes after bean and maize crops have been destroyed by the poor rainfall and hot weather,  linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon. A boy holds up an iguana for sale on the highway in the north of Managua, Nicaragua, in May. He is selling the iguana for 300 Cordobas ($12) In a recent report, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, run by the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'Extremely poor households across large areas of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador will experience a rapid deterioration in their food security in early 2015. 'Atypically high levels of humanitarian assistance, possibly the highest since Hurricane Mitch in 1998, will likely be required in order to avoid a food crisis.' According to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, thousands of families are no longer able to buy enough food to survive. While . hunting iguanas is outlawed by the country's environmental laws from . January to the end of April, they are allowed to be kept as food . In Guatemala, the government has said it is to provide 170,000 families with food from early October, while the Honduras government is already distributing foods including rice, beans and flour, along with vitamin supplements, to more than 75,000 families. The Worldwatch Institute's Nourishing The Planet programme has said iguanas are already used for meat in Puerto Rico, after their population exploded since their introduction in 1970. Elsewhere, Mexico and El Salvador exports iguana meat, with nearly 10,000kg exported to the U.S. between 2001 and 2008. According to the blog post, the lizard's eggs, which are also edible, have a cheesy flavour.","Low rainfall and hot weather has led to series of droughts across region .

A-Qiong Ho works as a receptionist at a hotel in the city of Langzhou in China's south-western Sichuan Province. She said that after her husband left the family when the boy Xiaolong was just five years old she had struggled to discipline him and hold down a job to pay their bills. The 13-year-old boy Xiaolong photographed chained to a balcony by his mother after he stole her bike . She finally had enough when she discovered the keys for her electric motorcycle had vanished and the bike had gone as well as her son. She told local media: 'I thought he was doing homework and when I couldn't find my motorcycle keys to go to the shops, I went to ask him and found he was gone as well. 'I couldn't really do anything but wait until he came back several hours later. 'He came just before I was due to start my shift, and I didn't have any opportunity to punish him properly or discipline him. 'I didn't want him going back out again, so I came up with the idea of chaining him to the balcony. 'I told him I would only free him when he had done all his homework when I came back.' Location: A-Qiong Ho works as a receptionist at a hotel in the city of Langzhou in China's Sichuan Province . However, shocked neighbours who spotted the boy in chains alerted police who entered the property to free the teenager. When the mother returned, she was ordered to go to the police station to collect him and to explain her actions. On learning however that his mother faced jail and that he could end up in a home, the boy promised officers that in the future he would try and be better behaved. His mother also promised the punishments would not be so harsh. She admitted: 'I suppose didn't really think about what would happen if for example there was a fire or something. 'But having a child with so much energy who was so naughty is sometimes just too much.'","A-Qiong Ho works in Langzhou in China's south-western Sichuan Province .

"By . Louise Eccles . and Claire Ellicott . and Jaya Narain . The mother of a disabled girl who died at the age of 11 is suing for compensation, claiming doctors had failed to warn her that she could be born handicapped. Joanne Chinnock says she ‘didn’t want a damaged child’ and would have terminated her pregnancy if she had been told her baby had a one-in-13 chance of being seriously abnormal. Her daughter Bethany Chinnock-Schumann had an extremely rare chromosomal disorder which left her nearly blind and in ‘almost constant pain’. On her first birthday: Bethany Chinnock-Schumann (centre), whose parents were social workers Jo Chinnock (right) and Paul Schumann (left), lived a life of almost constant pain from birth to death . She died in 2009, but Miss Chinnock . and her partner Paul Schumann told a court they would ‘almost certainly’ have asked for an abortion if they had been fully informed of the . risks. They have now made a . claim for £500,000 to compensate them for the damage done to their lives . and their careers – and to make up for the cost of raising their . daughter. Giving evidence Miss Chinnock, from Somerset, told the High Court that her life had changed from the minute Bethany was born. She said: ‘She was in constant pain, screaming and crying. Our life stopped to look after her. ‘I did nothing else but look after her. We had to catheterise her and feed her and give her medication day and night. Bethany Chinnock-Schumann had an extremely rare chromosomal disorder which left her nearly blind and in 'almost constant pain' Miss Chinnock and her partner were both social workers who were used to working with disabled people . ‘She . was constantly being sick, so would need to be changed. A vast amount . of her life was spent in hospital. Lots of times she was incubated, in . intensive care. ‘We saw the . country by hospital – Alder Hey, Great Ormond Street, Cardiff. My whole . focus while Bethany was alive was to look after her.’ Miss Chinnock and her partner were both social workers who were used to working with disabled people. In 2001 they tried to sue Liverpool Women’s Hospital NHS Trust for ‘wrongful birth’. However . after a meeting that year with a group of experts, who said they . thought the claim was unlikely to succeed, their legal team told them . that they should abandon the case. Social workers: Jo Chinnock (left) and Paul Schumann (right), both pictured outside the High Court in Central London, have split up. They are suing a leading law firm and barrister for alleged professional negligence . Bethany’s . parents, both 45, are no longer together – but they are suing law firm . Veale Wasbrough and a barrister called Karen Rea for alleged . professional negligence. Their . new counsel Michael Redfern QC said the couple had indicated to . hospital staff that they would have no hesitation in going through with . an abortion if there was a risk of serious disability. At 11 weeks pregnant, Miss Chinnock had a routine nuchal translucency scan, which tests for chromosomal conditions. She . was told there was increased fluid under the baby’s skin, at the back . of her neck, but that it was a ‘soft marker’ for possible problems. However . the parents were not told that when cross-referenced with other . factors, the results actually showed a one-in-13 risk of the rare . chromosomal abnormality, trisomy, he said. Doctors . also failed to carry out amniocentesis and cardiocentesis tests when . she was 15 and 20 weeks pregnant, which would have flagged up the . condition. Miss Chinnock, from Somerset, told the High Court that her life had changed from the minute Bethany was born . Mr Redfern . claimed that barrister Karen Rea and solicitor Jan Markland had taken . ‘their eyes off the ball’ when handling the case. He said the lawyers ignored the fact that important tests had not been carried out. He also said they had ignored the parents’ determination not to have a disabled child when they told them to abandon the case. This . meant they had missed their chance of receiving compensation from the . NHS for the damage to their careers, the cost of looking after a . severely disabled child and the emotional harm to Miss Chinnock, the . court heard. Mr Redfern . added: ‘We say it is indefensible that she did not get information, . advice, or further testing in the form of amniocentesis or . cardiocentesis. ‘We would . invite a finding of fact that Joanne Chinnock made it plain to the . doctors and the ancillary staff that she didn’t want a damaged child. ‘If . there was a risk that there was going to be an abnormality then, . dependent on the level of that risk, she would have terminated. ‘If there was a confirmation through scanning, then she would most certainly have terminated the pregnancy. ‘We say that, in so far as the claim against the hospital is concerned, nothing could be clearer.’ He added: ‘In those circumstances, we could not get a more compelling case where there was a breach of duty.’ Denying . negligence, solicitors from Veale Wasbrough insisted that the experts . had been given all the facts on which to base their opinion on whether . the claim had a chance of success. The firm are arguing that the parents’ claim against them was launched too late. Allegations: Liverpool Women's Hospital, as it appears today . They have also said that Mr Schumann was not one of their clients, and that the lawyers did not owe him a duty of care. The judge, Mr Justice Dingemans, has decided to reserve his judgment until a later date. ‘Wrongful . birth’ claims are made on the grounds that a hospital has failed to . discover abnormalities in good time, depriving parents of the chance to . consider having an abortion. In . the past, parents of other disabled children have managed to . successfully argue that medical negligence denied them an opportunity to . terminate the pregnancy before the 24-week legal limit. ‘Wrongful birth’ claims have cost the NHS around £54million over the past five years.","Bethany Chinnock-Schumann lived life of almost constant pain until death .

"By . Valerie Elliott . A surge in obesity among dogs is being blamed on rules limiting where they can run off the lead. Half of Britain’s eight million dogs are now classified as overweight – a dramatic leap from just 35 per cent of the nation’s canine population in 2010. Experts believe a growing restriction on dogs exercising in public spaces is the cause, along with owners allowing their pets to overfeed. Scroll down for video . Half of Britain's eight million dogs are overweight - including Cavalier King Charles spaniel Chancer (pictured) Councils have made increasing use of the Dog Control Orders introduced in 2006 to stop dogs being let off the lead in public areas. While the ban has been welcomed in children’s parks and cemeteries, its implementation elsewhere has been called draconian. Popular beaches restricting dogs being exercised off the lead include Polzeath, north Cornwall and Salcombe South Sands in Devon. Dog owners are also angry about a move to ban dogs off the lead from 60 per cent of the 550-acre woodland at Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire. A decision is due next month. The unhealthy lifestyle of the 21st Century dog is revealed in a new TV series presented by leading vet Mark Evans. Cassie, a black rescue labrador, will appear on new TV series Dogs: Their Secret Lives . Dogs: Their Secret Lives features footage from secret cameras which track Chancer, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, and Cassie, a black rescue labrador, to find out why they are so fat. Mr Evans said: ‘I am convinced that lack of exercise is a major cause of the problem. In the past two years there has been a 25 per cent reduction in the number of British people who now exercise their dogs off the lead.’ He said the 50 per cent figure for the number of obese dogs in Britain was based on research from Liverpool University, home of the UK’s only specialist pet obesity clinic. The dogs featured in the TV series are both discovered to be overfed: spaniel Chancer weighed in at the clinic at 37lb. Her owner, Jane Burton, 52, from Birkenhead, could not understand why she was so fat when she was only fed a can of pet food each morning and evening. But a secret camera exposed how the family pet was being over-indulged with treats every day. One of the main culprits was Mrs Burton’s own mother, Joan Clement, 89, who has Alzheimer’s. Eight-year-old Cassie, a black labrador, arrived at the clinic weighing 103lb. Her owner, Adrian Jackson, 46, a company director. from Burscough, Lancashire, said: ‘We got her from a rescue centre and we noticed she wolfed down her food as soon as she got it. We think she wasn’t fed properly by previous owners.’ But cameras showed that not only was Cassie greedy, her owners were overfeeding her, and spoiling her with treats. Both dogs are now on diets. In Nottinghamshire, Newark and Sherwood District Council has used Dog Control Orders in 72 separate areas. Mark Evans presents the series and says he is convinced that lack of exercise is major cause of the problem . Polzeath beach in north Cornwall is one of the many popular beaches that has banned dogs off their leads . Local dog owner Nathan Bray, 41, said: ‘Our dog, Dexter, a pointer, needs a lot of exercise, but we’ve had to put him on the lead. He’s not been at all happy by the lack of freedom and he’s got chubby from the lack of exercise.’ James Yeats, RSPCA chief veterinary officer, said: ‘Dog Control Orders are problematic and if they cause people not to exercise their dogs and they carry on feeding their pet in the same way, the dogs will become overweight. It is a major issue.’","Experts believe growing restriction on dogs exercising in public is cause .

"By . Corey Charlton . Connor Tremble, 17, was allegedly murdered by jealous love rival Will Blencowe . A jilted young man stabbed his 17-year-old love rival to death hours after warning him to 'run' if they ever met, a jury heard. Connor Tremble, aged 17 years, suffered multiple stab wounds at his flat and died in hospital 40 hours later. Will Blencowe, aged 21 years, went to his 'love rival’s' flat the night before Valentine’s Day and attacked him after finding out the teenager was seeing his ex-girlfriend Aimee Harrison. With the help of two close friends, Bradley Jones and Grant Clemens, Blencowe then fled more than 50 miles away, the court was told. However, police tracked him down and arrested him on Valentine’s Day, while Connor was still fighting for his life. Told he was being arrested for attempted murder, Blencowe 'giggled'. At the opening day of the trial at Oxford Crown Court, prosecutor Richard Barton told the jury: 'This case concerns how a troubled young man had wholly unwarranted feelings of jealousy and resentment towards his former girlfriend’s new partner and those feelings led him, after some planning on his part, to track down and stab to death that young man, the person who he perceived to be his love rival. 'Immediately after he fatally wounded that young man he fled the scene in what was a vain attempt to avoid detection. 'He met up with two close friends who, out of some misplaced sense of loyalty, knowingly assisted him in that attempt to avoid detection and avoid facing the consequences of that attack.' Blencowe had been in a troubled and violent relationship with Miss Harrison for around four years. Mr Barton told the jury of seven women and five men that during that time he had a short temper and was jealous of anyone who showed an interest in her. He added that Blencowe owned a range of knives, including a machete and a flick knife. Mr Barton said: 'To her he seemed obsessed with these weapons.' The couple broke up in September 2013 and Miss Harrison began dating Connor early this year. They tried to keep the relationship quiet but Blencowe found out. The court heard Blencowe had mental health difficulties and was living at special accommodation in Banbury, Oxfordshire. The day Connor was stabbed Blencowe had a meeting with a key worker, appearing emotional and telling her he still loved Miss Harrison. When she tried to cheer him up, he said: 'What’s the point? I’m going to be dead or in jail.' Later that afternoon Miss Harrison called Blencowe after finding out he had been making threats towards Connor. She asked him: 'What should I tell Connor if he sees you?' He responded: 'Just tell him to run.' At around 5.20pm that day Blencowe got a train from Banbury to Oxford and then a taxi to near Connor’s flat in Fairacres Road. Mr Barton told that by a 'terrible coincidence' the door to Connor’s flat had been painted that day and had to be left ajar. Connor . had returned to the flat at about 6.30pm and was in the living room . while a friend who was staying with him was in the bedroom. The friend heard Connor shouting and when he went to see what was happening caught a glimpse of someone fleeing the scene. He found Connor bleeding profusely on the floor and saying: 'I’m dying.' Connor Tremble, pictured left and again right with a friend (not his girlfriend Aimee Harrison), was found lying on his stomach bleeding profusely . Emergency services were called at 6.43pm and Connor was rushed to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. He had been stabbed through the lung and had multiple wounds on his back and buttocks, as if he had been on his stomach 'with someone repeatedly stabbing from above', said Mr Barton. Meanwhile Blencowe returned to his taxi and was driven to Witney, Oxfordshire, taking off a heavy coat and woollen hat on the journey. Mr Barton said: “Neither that clothing or that weapon have been retrieved.” Blencowe was then driven by his mother to Kingham, Oxfordshire, where he met up with Jones and they were then both dropped in Chipping Norton. They then got a taxi to Clemens’ home in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, where the prosecutor said they hatched a plan to get Blencowe away. Mr Barton said they convinced Bradley and Declan Townsend to drive Blencowe to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, where he checked into the Croft Guest House. He moved to another guest house the next day but police tracked him down and arrested him at around 4pm on February 14, when Connor was still alive. Mr Barton said: 'When they told him it was attempted murder he repeated that. He said ""attempted murder?"" And he giggled.' A search of the Croft Guest House found a small amount of blood on a hand towel. 'The blood on that tiny spot has DNA that matches Connor Tremble’s DNA,' said Mr Barton. 'The chances of it not coming from Connor Tremble or somebody related to him is one in a billion.' The court also heard that Blencowe had threatened and assaulted another man who he found out Miss Harrison was seeing after they broke up. Blencowe was subsequently charged with murder, which he denies. Jones, aged 21 years, from Bledington, near Chipping Norton, and 21-year-old Clemens, from Stockwells, Moreton-in-Marsh, both deny perverting the course of justice. The three-week trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles at Oxford Crown Court, continues.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . In what was one of the closest Presidential races in American history, it was a public relations gamble that may well have tipped the balance - had it ever been shown. But this video for Gerald Ford's 1976 election campaign against Jimmy Carter was shelved because it was deemed to shocking to air to a country still fragile from JFK's assassination, Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. In the five-minute clip, Ford, who survived two assassination attempts himself, is seen giving a speech when a cherry bomb goes off. Believing it was a gun shot, he flinches - but then calmly continues with barely a quiver in his voice. Scroll down for video . All smiles: The U.S. President Gerald Ford seen before giving a speech at the University of Michigan in a clip from a campaign video for the 1976 election which was shelved because his aides felt it was too insensitive . Fear factor: Ford, who survived two assassination attempts during his tenure, flinches during the speech after a cherry bomb goes - but calmly continues when he realises it is not a gun shot . The video then cuts to him parading through Dallas in an open-top car in very similar fashion to JFK when he was shot dead in the same city 13 years before. At that point, a narrator says: 'Neither the cherry bombs of a misguided prankster nor all the memories of recent years can keep people and their President apart. 'When a limousine can parade openly through the streets of Dallas, there's a change that's come over America.' Ford's media team hoped it would . emphasise that the incumbent had indeed healed an embattled country in . the two years since taking office. 'Emotionally powerful': The video then cuts to a scene showing Ford riding in an open-top car through Dallas, just as JFK had done when he was shot dead in the city 13 years previously . Motorcade: President John F Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally ride through Dallas moments before Kennedy was assassinated . But when it was shown to a focus group, it became apparent that it had gone too far. Recalling the viewing, pollster Bob Teeter later recalled that 'it was shocking to them'. 'It was just too emotional.... it was just frightening.' he added. Some in Ford's inner circle feared the subject matter was still too raw for the American people and that it would particularly harm the campaign in Texas. As it turned out, Ford lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter, who secured 50.1 per cent of the vote to his 48 per cent. Presidential historian Michael Beschloss noted on PBS Newshour, that with such tight margins, the video had the potential to swing the result the other way. He said: 'I found it emotionally . powerful. I think it would have been even more affecting, had it aired . as planned, in that national atmosphere 13 years after President . Kennedy's murder and in the immediate wake of America's traumas over . Vietnam, urban riots, campus demonstrations and Watergate. Near miss: Gerald Ford is surrounded by his security team immediately after the first of two assassination attempts made against him during his president . Would-be assassin: Charles Manson disciple Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme is arrested after pointing a loaded gun at the president. She was jailed for life in 1975 for trying to kill the 38th U.S. president with a Colt 45-caliber pistol . 'Especially since it advertises a President not known for his emotional appeal, the commercial does an impressive job of presenting, on an emotional level, the best case for Ford's election - that he had healed a ravaged country.' He adds that it 'might conceivably (along with so many other factors) have changed the result of that year's Presidential race'. As vice-president, Ford found himself thrust into the Presidential office in 1974 after the resignation of Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal. He had been charged with restoring trust in the government, which many feel he succeeded in doing. At the Ford's funeral in 2007, former president George W Bush said: 'In President Ford, the world saw the best of America and America found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nation's history.' But six months after taking office, Ford pardoned Nixon for his part in the cover-up of the burglary at Democratic Party HQ in the Watergate building - a move some believe ultimately cost him the 1976 election. Ford died on Boxing Day in 2006 at the age of 93.","Clip shows Ford flinching when cherry bomb goes off during speech .

"By . Jenny Awford For Mailonline . A painter and decorator who won more than £7million on the lottery has vowed to share his fortune with a workmate, honouring a long-standing pact to 'see each other right'. Willie Sibbald, 48, from Edinburgh, matched all six numbers on his Lucky Dip ticket for Saturday's Lotto rollover draw, scooping winnings of £7,084,472. He broke the good news to his friend and colleague of 17 years, Rab Layden, and they both handed in their notice yesterday. Scroll down for video . Millionaire painter and decorator Willie Sibbald, 48, from Edinburgh (right) with his best friend Rab Layden. The Lucky Dip winner has decided to honour a long-standing pact with his colleague to 'see each other right' if either of them ever won the lottery . The two friends have both played the lottery every week for years, buying two tickets each, and promised if either of them won they would make sure the other would not need to work again. Mr Sibbald said: 'We used to say 'Imagine it was us, what would you do?' But you never expect it. 'It's one of those things you say. You're sitting there eating your piece and you'd say 'Rab, imagine if we won this, you'd never need to work again.' But you never really think it's going to happen.' The pair are both dedicated followers of the Scottish national football team and are now looking forward to travelling to all the away matches. The generous decorator scooped £7,084,472 on the lottery after his numbers came up in Saturday's draw . Mr Layden, 57, also from Edinburgh, was at work painting a kitchen when he received the call. The pair, who decorated houses and commercial properties, then met and told bosses they would not be returning to work. 'He phoned me at 1.45pm and said 'By the way I've got something to tell you, are you sitting down? I'm the guy that won the lottery' - and I about collapsed,' said Mr Layden. 'I then met him at the yard and told the bosses at 2.40pm and retired five minutes later. Then we went for a pint.' 'The trust and the loyalty is there, there was never any doubt about it. Truth and honesty always comes to the fore.' Mr Sibbald admitted he had missed the live draw after falling asleep. And he only realised he was a multimillionaire when he was watching TV and spotted the winning numbers during an advert break. Mr Sibbald missed the live draw after falling asleep and only realised he was a multimillionaire when he was watching TV and spotted the winning numbers during an advert break . Describing the moment he realised he had won, Mr Sibbald said: 'I was staying with one of my relatives and I checked the ticket and shouted to my aunty 'I've won the lottery' and we checked the ticket again and again. It was just crazy.' He had to hide the ticket away from his aunt's pet dog, Sandy - who he said likes to eat bits of paper. 'I was just looking at the ticket and wanted to phone somebody but had to wait to get it verified. I hardly got a wink of sleep all night. 'My brother was on a night out so I waited until the following morning and called his wife to pass on the good news. She didn't believe me at first and thought I was joking - it's not exactly a call you expect on a Sunday morning.' After putting down his paint brush, he now hopes to buy a Rolls-Royce - after he learns to drive - but has no plans to move from his home city. 'It's been such a whirlwind I've not had time to really think about what I will do with the money but I will probably learn to drive and get myself a car,' he said. The winning ticket was bought at the newsagent's in Moredun Park Road, Moredun. And the winning Lotto numbers were 16, 36, 40, 43, 45 and 47 and the bonus ball was 10.","Willie Sibbald, 48, has vowed to share his winnings with friend Rab Layden .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Parliament's Victorian plumbing is causing a stink in the corridors of power. There has been a surge in complaints from MPs and peers about smelly toilets, cracked cisterns, flooded floors and sewage pouring down office walls, MailOnline can reveal. This summer complaints are running at more than a third higher than the same time last year, with a multi-billion pound renovation of Parliament still years off. In the last two years there have been more than 4,300 complaints about the toilets and plumbing in Parliament . The problems are so bad that engineers receive the equivalent of more than seven complaints every day of the week. In the last two years alone, there have been more than 4,300 complaints about the toilets and plumbing in Parliament. Every part of Parliament has been affected, from an overflowing gents toilet in the Bishops Corridor to missing toilet rolls and broken lights in the ministerial corridor in the Commons. Toilets are regularly blocked, sinks over-flowing and cubicles flooded. There are frequent requests for floors to be mopped, bins to be emptied and new handryers to be fitted. There are complaints about 'poo all over the floor', vomit in sinks and toilet paper hanging from ceilings. A frequent demand is for broken toilet seats to be replaced. One complained 'the one current is cracked please do asap as it bites'. In April this year a ladies toilet flooded, leaving 'water pouring down walls through to ground floor' and raising concerns about electrics. The ancient plumbing has also started making bizarre sounds. 'When the tap water pours there is a very loud banging sound coming from the toilets area,' said one. 'Men's toilets cracked seat and is making a dull sound when flushing,' said another. Former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw has repeatedly complained about urine pouring into his Commons office . In 2012 Mr Bradshaw posted this picture online of his office which was becoming overwhelmed with the smell of sewage . Since the start of the year there have been growing numbers of complaints. In February there were 172 complaints lodged with the Parliamentary authorities, up 6 per cent. By April the number was 170, up 37 per cent year-on-year, and by May it hit 163, up 41 per cent. June was also up 31 per cent to 213, according to figures obatined by MailOnline. In May this year there were several complaints about a 'bad smell of sewage around the coffee machine' and 'constantly leaking water'. Offices, corridors, kitchens, the press gallery, lifts, function rooms and even the Speaker's Office have been blighted by a 'strong smell of sewage'. Since the start of this year, monthly complaints about toilets in Parliament are running at around a third higher than the same period in 2013, according to figures obtained by MailOnline . Michael Gove was moved from being Education Secretary to become Chief Whip in last month's reshuffle . Michael Gove's new role as government Chief Whip got off to an inauspicious start when he became trapped in a toilet in Parliament. Not only did he lose his first vote in charge - after Labour ambushed him over plans to have its manifesto independently audited - it later emerged he almost missed the vote altogether. Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow Commons leader, revealed: 'He not only lost his first vote but he managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby and he nearly broke his own whip.' Mr Gove's Cabinet colleague William Hague leapt to his defence, insisting he was just being thorough and making sure there were no MPs hiding in the toilets. 'Knowledge of who is in the toilets in whatever lobby is a very important piece of information for any chief whip,' Mr Hague said. 'I take this as evidence he was carrying out his duties very assiduously.' One complaint lodged in January read: 'Please can someone clean the toilets as an MP has called them 'disgusting'. The cubical on the left is very dirty. Former Labour Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw has frequently complained about urine pouring into his Commons office. In November 2012 he took to Twitter to complain that his office 'stinks' after sewage from a toilets above his office seeped through Parliament's crumbling walls. He branded the incident 'urinegate'. And on July 3 this year he reported: 'Foul smelling urine pouring into office *again* much worse than before. evacuated. electrics down.' Mr Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, told MailOnline: 'We've had urine pour into our office twice in the last year from a gents loo upstairs. 'The Commons staff have responded quickly but it hasn't been very nice and the second time it happened we had to evacuate because of the smell, and the flood blew the electrics. 'Apparently the old pipes are so corroded they're springing more and more leaks. It feels as if a large parts of Parliament haven't been modernised since it was built.' The Commons Commission has warned the repair bill for Parliament will top £1.6billion, saying it is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world. A recent report by MPs revealed decades of alterations had created a complex patchwork of wiring and plumbing which was almost impossible to repair. 'Even routine tasks, such as unblocking down pipes and sewage outlets, are problematic in this environment, where pipes disappear into inaccessible voids and are entangled with other uncharted services and asbestos,' the House of Commons Commission said. A feasibility study sent to potential contractors warned that 'small leaks or serious floods, has become a relatively common occurrence' in the Palace of Westminster. It added: 'The Victorian drainage pipes and culverts under the Palace cope with waste water, rain water, sewage and cooking by-products on a scale for which they were not originally intended and these are pumped upwards into the London sewers at the north end of the Palace. 'The system still works, but requires continual maintenance to keep the channels clear.' A spokesman for the House of Parliament said: 'The level of complaints relating to toilet facilities on the Parliamentary Estate has remained consistent since 2012. 'Comments from users of the amenities are expected given that there are over one million visitors to Parliament each year and many of the 600 toilets across the Estate are in Victorian era buildings. 'Parliament takes its responsibilities regarding health and safety seriously and all toilets are cleaned regularly and subject to routine maintenance. 'Facilities across the Estate are also the subject of a rolling programme of refurbishment which will replace toilets as required.'","EXCLUSIVE: Complaints this summer running at a third higher than in 2013 .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A former government minister who resigned yesterday over the ‘intolerable’ pressure placed on his family by the new Commons expenses regime has been ridiculed today over his claim that £28,000 in rent is not enough. Mark Simmonds, the former Foreign Office minister, said the Commons housing allowance would force to him to live in the ‘outer reaches of London’ which he was not prepared to do. But the MailOnline has found a number of luxury flats within half a mile of Westminster which he could easily afford from his taxpayer-funded housing allowance. There are also scores of four-bed family homes in London's sought-after suburbs - home to hundreds of thousands of Conservative voters - within Mr Simmonds' budget. Labour MPs today accused the former minister of talking 'total nonsense' and said he was guilty of expecting taxpayers to pay for luxuries few other families could afford. Within half a mile of Parliament there are at least seven luxury flats available for MPs to rent within their £20,000 a year housing allowance. Many of the flats are in complexes which boast private gyms and pools . Mark Simmonds resigned from the Government complaining that his family life had become 'intolerable' Mr Simmonds has a budget of £20,600-a-year for himself and an extra £2,425 for each child if he wants to rent a property big enough for his family - even though they live in his Lincolnshire constituency of Boston and Skegness. If the Tory MP insisted on bringing down his family for weekends, he has a number of options for accommodation close to Westminster. For a home within easy walking distance from Westminster Mr Simmonds could rent a mid-terrace Georgian house conversion with three large double bedrooms, a big family kitchen, living room and a garden in Oval - less than 2 miles from Parliament. The house costs £24,444 a year. If he was willing to use public transport, the allowance would get him a luxury four bed semi-detached property with large garden in Bromley, South London, for £27,000 a year. Bromley – a core Conservative-stronghold in London’s commuter belt – is just 20 minutes away from Victoria station, which is just 15 minutes walk from Parliament. Mr Simmonds earned £89,435 a year as a minister and employed his wife on up to £25,000 a year as his office secretary. The family also made more than £500,000 after selling their taxpayer-funded London property in 2010 after the Commons expenses regime banned MPs from claiming mortgage interest on their second homes. If Mr Simmonds opted for a one-bed flat for himself to stay in London, while his family stayed in his constituency his ‘generous’ Commons housing allowance would allow him to stay in the lap of luxury. According to the online estate agents ‘rightmove’, Mr Simmonds could afford a one-bedroom apartment less than half a mile from Parliament. The luxury, fully-furnished property allows access to a communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym. Mr Simmonds could afford a luxury, fully-furnished property with access to communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym just minutes from Parliament near the London Eye . If the former Foreign Office minister could cope with a 20 minute train ride from Bromley, he could rent a four bed house in the South London commuter belt . Another apartment just a stones throw from Westminster available in Mr Simmonds' price bracket is a 'beautiful one bedroom fully furnished apartment with a secure underground car parking space close to local amenities and St James' underground tube station'. 'The property was fully refurbished in 2009 and remains in excellent condition throughout. The property also has a private balcony that overlooks the gardens to the rear.' According to the estate agents renting the property 'residents of Vestry Court enjoy exclusive use of the private swimming pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and gym facilities'. It is 'conveniently located for access to London's West End, and Waterloo and Westminster underground stations', according to the estate agent. Labour MP John Mann said Mr Simmonds was talking 'total nonsense' Labour MP John Mann said Mr Simmonds’ claim he could not afford to live in London on the Commons housing allowance was ‘total nonsense’. He said: ‘The £28,000 he can get is more than the average salary in his constituency. It’s simply untrue that you can’t rent in London for that much. It’s a poor excuse for going.’ Mr Mann also hit out at Mr Simmonds’ assumption that taxpayers should fork out so his family could stay in London and his constituency. He said: ‘His children can’t be in two places at once while they are at school. They allowance is an essential living allowance and it is generous.’ Fellow Labour MP Grahame Morris added: ‘I think his comments will gain little public sympathy when under his government most working families, especially in London, are facing a cost of living crisis forcing ordinary people on much more modest incomes to live further away from their place of work and commute longer distances. ‘Perhaps as a minister he is also lamenting the loss of previous paid directorships which can be very lucrative.’ But Mr Simmonds insisted the current allowance ‘doesn’t stretch anywhere near the cost of renting a flat near Westminster’. He said: ‘Now of course MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them, it’s not the lifestyle I want, it is not the lifestyle I have chosen for my family.’ He added: ‘I have to stay in a different hotel room every week and any parent would hate that – and I do. ‘The accommodation allowance needs to provide for families – and it doesn’t. When my children are on holiday they can’t come and stay with me in London - I can’t see them.’ ‘It has a really negative impact on the quality of life. I am not the only one who feels like this, but I am the only one at the moment who is doing anything about it.’","Estate agents reveal luxury flats and sprawling homes near Westminster .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The fugitive 'White Widow' of a 7/7 London bomber is wanted in connection with seven murders in Kenya, police have revealed. British-born Samantha Lewthwaite is alleged to have ordered the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab. Kenyan security officials have described her as an 'incredible threat' and said they are working 'around the clock' to bring her in. Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, otherwise known as the White Widow, is wanted for ordering the murders of seven people in Kenya including two radical Muslim clerics and two Protestant preachers . Hate preacher Aboud Rogo Mohammed was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while taking his wife to hospital on August 27 last year. Mohammed was shot 17 times as he drove along, while his wife Khania Said was shot once in the thigh. His father and five-year-old daughter, who were also in the car, were not hit. Lewthwaite was a disciple of Mohammed's and preached with him at the Masjid Musa mosque in the port-city of Mombasa, converting thousands of Somalis to fight for al-Shabaab. However, the pair fell out and a war of words began, during which Mohammed vowed to 'get rid' of Lewthwaite, who had become too demanding. He was killed nine months after she was last seen. His successor, Sheik Ibrahim Rogo, suffered the same fate last month when he was also killed in a drive-by along with associates Omar Abu Rumeisa, Salim Aboud and Gadafi Mohammed. The killings mark a rift between al-Shabaab and Lewthwaite, with security sources saying there is a power struggle between tribal elders and the White Widow. British-born Lewthwaite (left) is alleged to have ordered the execution of Aboud Rogo Mohammed (right) a hate preacher from Mombasa who was shot 17 times while driving his wife to hospital last year . Speaking to the Mirror, an intelligence source said: 'Samantha Lewthwaite is fighting for greater control of al-Shabaab which is angering the ­organisation’s hierarchy. 'She has become paranoid and ­unreliable to the group after being on the run for so long. They believe her judgement is clouded and she could find herself out on her own very soon.' Two Protestant pastors, Charles Matole and Ebrahim Kidata, are also believed to have been killed at the request of Lewthwaite. The body of Matole, 41, was found in the Redeemed Gospel Church in Mombasa  on October 19 sitting in a chair and clutching a bible. He was executed with a single bullet to the head after police questioned him over whether any young men had come to him seeking help after being asked to join al-Shabaab. Kidata's body was found dumped in bushes in the town of Kilifi, 40 miles from Mombasa, the day before Matole was killed. Gunmen attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in September, killing 67 people including children as young as five. The siege, which lasted several days, ended after soldiers stormed the building and the roof collapsed . The newly-ordained preacher, of the East African Pentecostal Churches, was believed to have been strangled. East Kenya police commander Aggrey Adoli said: 'We believe Samantha Lewthwaite is behind these killings as well as a gang of others. 'We believe she is involved in ­recruitment of jihadists and propagation of al-Shabaab and Al Qaeda activities in the country with other like minded individuals. Once we apprehend Samantha Lewthwaite she'll have a lot of questions to answer. 'She is without a doubt an incredible threat to national and ­international security. We are working round the clock to bring her in to stop her causing more carnage.' The officer said she is wanted on charges of 'murder and inciting Muslim youths to violence'. Interpol issued this international arrest warrant for Lewthwaite after she was named as one of the prime suspects behind the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in September . Seven of Lewthwaite's ­disciples, including a Tanzanian preacher, a Somali national, a Ugandan and three Kenyans, are also being hunted. Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. The mother-of-four was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and was the son of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.","Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, is accused of murdering seven in Kenya .

As well as the pasties, the lorry also spilt some of the cinnamon rolls it was carrying. Pictures taken at the scene show a police car blocking off the roundabout, near the village of Balderton at 4.30am this morning. A busy roundabout in Nottinghamshire was splatted with pasties and cinnamon rolls when a lorry dropped the snacks this morning . Nottinghamshire Police had to close a busy roundabout after a lorry spilt its cargo of cheese and baked bean pasties all over the carriageway . Pasties and rolls, in blue trays, were heaped on to the pavement as police officers helped the Highways Agency clear the snacks off the road. The lorry did not crash and it is believed the snacks fell from their storage spot on the top of the vehicle. The incident was then the source of some amusement on Twitter with @NottsSpecials - the account for Special Constables in Nottinghamshire Police - tweeting: 'Bit cheesy but someone spilt the beans, yes cheese and baked bean pasties over the A1 - we sorted it, yeast we could do. 'It was a bit of a roll around initially but kneaded to clear due to traffic build up.

The spillage was the source of some amusement on Twitter, with the Special Constables in Nottinghamshire Police tweeting that the clean-up was the 'yeast we could do' People on Twitter shared a joke with the Special Constables in Nottinghamshire Police, who had helped clean up a roundabout near the village of Balderton after a lorry dropped cheese and baked bean pasties on the road .

Others then joined in the conservation, including bakery chain Greggs, who tweeted: '*shocked face* hope everyone was ok!' A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police confirmed officers were called to the scene at 4.30am. He said: 'A lorry shed its load which led to baked goods going over the highway.' The incident follows a similar one in June this year, when a huge spillage of mash potato brought the A64 near Malton, a major road in North Yorkshire to a standstill.

"By . Andy Hampson, Press Association . West Brom boss Alan Irvine has warned rival clubs they have no chance of prising Saido Berahino from his grasp this month. The highly-rated 21-year-old underlined his talent with both Baggies goals in their season-opening 2-2 draw with Sunderland in the Barclays Premier League. The England Under-21 striker caught the eye with nine goals last season and Irvine is anticipating more this term. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Saido Berahino discussing his childhood as a refugee . Spot on: Berahino scores the West Brom equaliser from the spot to score the first goal under Alan Irvine . Leading the line: Berahino celebrates his first goal in what could be an important season for him . The downside to headline-grabbing performances is that other managers might be alerted to make a move before the end of the summer transfer deadline, but Irvine is confident the club would not consider a sale. Irvine said: 'I think everybody should know about him already, but I can't see any way this club would be interested in letting Saido go. You can't let top young English talented players go. 'It could be a very big season for him. He is a terrific lad, he is very talented and he works very hard at his game. He is a pleasure to work with. 'He has got a love for football and with the talent and professional attitude he has got, I think he could be a very good player for this season and beyond.' Irvine himself is under pressure to hit the ground running at the Hawthorns having been the club's surprise choice as new head coach. Here to stay: Irvine insists that the young Englishman is not for sale during this transfer window . Grabbing the attention: The striker enjoys scoring his second goal and putting West Brom into the lead . The Scot was David Moyes' assistant for five years at Everton but his only previous spells as a manager, at Preston and Sheffield Wednesday, were outside the top flight. His reign did not start well as Lee Cattermole fired Sunderland ahead with a superb long-range strike after just five minutes. But the hosts then settled and deserved their equaliser before the break, although it came in fortuitous circumstances after the award of a contentious penalty. Valentin Roberge was adjudged to have fouled Victor Anichebe despite only minimal contact and even Irvine admitted the decision was 'soft'. Berahino struck from the spot and added a second after 74 minutes but Sebastian Larsson snatched a point for the Black Cats by rounding off a fine move five minutes from time. Irvine said: 'The first game of the season is always special because you've spent a long time working towards it. Making progress: New signing Jack Rodwell managed over an hour for Sunderland on his debut . 'But it was special for me as well, to do it in the Premier League was something different. The actual occasion was similar to a big game elsewhere.' Record £10million signing Brown Ideye did not get off the bench. Irvine said of the Nigerian: 'He's been with us for a week. He is in good condition physically but I think it would be a big ask for him, physically and in understanding what we need him to do. 'He is still getting to know the names of everyone. It is asking a lot to throw someone into a Premier League game at that point.' The contest, between two of last season's relegation battlers, was an entertaining affair. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was pleased with the resilience of his side and saw marked improvement in their attitude. Good attitude: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet praised his team's response once they fell behind . He said: 'Last year, after conceding the second goal, maybe we would have collapsed and conceded three or four. 'There is a little bit better, stronger mentality in the team. 'If you see the reaction of the players on the pitch when we score and the celebration, coming back and trying to go again, I think it is a good sign for the future.' Poyet gave a debut to his £10million midfielder, Jack Rodwell, who is looking to rekindle the early promise he showed at Everton after two frustrating seasons at Manchester City. The 23-year-old played 68 minutes before being replaced by Jordi Gomez. Poyet said: 'He started well and then we killed him for 20 minutes without the ball. We made him only defend, which of course is going to help us, but we need to give him the ball. 'In the second half I was very pleased - (it was) the Jack Rodwell we want to see, driving with the ball, getting to the edge of the box, winning (the ball), turning, passing. 'I was tempted to leave him on the pitch for a bit longer but I think it was enough and I think he will get better and better.'","Irvine says England U21 striker will be a good player 'this season and beyond'

"By . Darren Boyle For Mailonline . A judge has issued an arrest warrant for the granddaughter of Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs after she breached a court order. Judge Peter Moss ordered the apprehension of Emma Beach after she failed to respond to a court summons issued by the Probation Service. The 26-year-old heroin addict has missed a number of appointments with probationers and drug treatment organisations ordered as part of an earlier sentence handed down for shoplifting. Emma Beach, left, grand daughter of Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs, right, faces arrest after failing to respond to a court summons issued by the Probation Service following an earlier conviction for theft . After she failed to appear in court yesterday, Judge Moss issued the arrest warrant. In June, Beach had three extra probation sessions added to her sentence for failing to show up to earlier appointments. Before the earlier hearing, the court heard that Beach had been arrested with her mother Karen Briggs, accused of stealing £150 worth of meat from a BP Connect shop. Rachael Lane, prosecuting, told the court of the latest matter: 'This is a fresh allegation of a breach against Miss Beach, arising from her failure to attend a number of appointments.' The judge was told Beach had been sent a court summons to her home, in Cobham, Surrey, but no response had been received. Judge Moss ordered that Beach be arrested and brought to court. Guildford Crown Court, pictured, heard that Beach, who has 16 convictions,  and her mother Karen Briggs, who has 32 convictions, funded their heroin addiction by stealing from a range of different shops . In January Beach and her mother were arrested over the theft of £400 pounds worth of Yankee Candles from a branch of Clinton Cards, in Walton-on-Thames, as well as for the theft of a parcel belonging to a neighbour. Briggs was jailed while her daughter was given a treatment order on the grounds that her mother was a bad influence and all of Beach's drug-taking, since she was 14, had involved her mother. The judge told Beach: 'I know you are injecting into veins which are now beginning to cause difficulties for you. 'We know the risks. You know this could easily kill you. It seems you didn't take that on board.' Her famous grandfather, who played Mike Baldwin in the popular long-running ITV soap, has long-since given up on his daughter and granddaughter, having previously tried to help them but with no success. On her last appearance in court, Briggs was told by magistrate Malcolm Stewart: 'I have heard that you want to change and this is your chance. Make the most of it, its going to be difficult.' Judge Moss has also previously said of Beach: 'I'm sure she would love it if somebody would wave a magic wand and she would no longer be addicted to heroin. 'I don't own that magic wand.' Beach has 16 convictions for 23 offences while her mother has 32 convictions for 52 offences.

"By . Rob Cooper . Bungling border police burst into the 'sham' wedding of two Harrods workers and halted it before realising the marriage was real. Chinese bride Miao Guo, 34, and Italian groom Massimo Ciabattini, 31, were taking their vows in Camden Town Hall when four border police in thick black jackets stormed into the room. They led the pair and their two bridesmaids away into separate rooms and questioned them for 30 minutes before realising they had made a mistake. Newly-wed: Miao Guo, 34, who was getting married to Massimo Chiabattini, 31, when border agency workers suddenly burst in . The bride and groom were then allowed back into the room and they later got married. Officials had become suspicious because the pair, who met at Harrods in Knightsbridge, had trouble spelling each other's surnames and the bride's visa was due to expire in six weeks. The only guests at the wedding were the bridesmaids. They were so pleased that they were about to break up a sham wedding that they invited a local newspaper reporter from the Camden New Journal along to watch. Groom: Massimo Ciabattini, a retail manager, who got married to his Chinese partner . But, when they realised they had made a mistake, the journalist was quickly ushered away. A worker for the Home Office admitted afterwards: 'It is either the best sham wedding I have ever seen or it is real'. Before the wedding ceremony began at 4pm last Thursday plain-clothed officials from the Home Office waited outside the town hall, in north London, while the border police hid out of sight in a car. Officials usually wait until the wedding is underway to avoid the bride and groom fleeing. Mr Ciabattini listed his job title as a retail manager on his wedding certificate, while his bride wrote that she was a sales associate. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants condemned the Home Office and accused them of 'operating generally on a basis of mistrust' when it came to international marriages. The wedding had been 'red flagged' by . Camden Council as a possible sham marriage in advance - and they had . called in the Home Office to investigate. The border police called in to carry out the raid are employed by the Home Office. However, the couple's answers to questions about their relationship and life had matched up perfectly - and they had genuine bookings afterwards at a restaurant with friends and a hotel room for the night. Store workers: The couple, an Italian man in his thirties and a Chinese woman in her twenties, both work at Harrods in Knightsbridge . Wedding venue: The couple tied the knot at Camden Town Hall after Home Office officials allowed the ceremony to go ahead . An official added that the fact the couple were 'extremely good-looking' and wearing expensive, tailored clothes, and had a real Chanel handbag, would also have been a clue that it was genuine as visa weddings are frequently performed by 'very mismatched couples' who turn up for the service in 'anoraks'. Guy Taylor, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, added: 'That does not justify them operating generally on a basis of mistrust. They do not take people's sides they automatically assume that people are out to swindle the visa regulations, that is their default position. That is what leads to this type of appalling mistake.' New bride: Miao Guo, 34, who tied the know with Italian Massimo Ciabattini, 31, after border agency officials wrongly raided their wedding thinking it was a sham . Romance: Miao Guo was allowed to marry her new husband after border agency officials were convinced that their relationship was genuine . He questioned why better background checks had not been made on the couple beforehand in order to avoid ruining their ceremony. 'It does devastate wedding days,' he said. 'This is a life event where people's expectations, money and energy is being poured into this one day and the Home Office don't seem to care about ruining it by not making better background checks. Why didn't they interview them beforehand?"" A spokesman from Camden Council said: 'We are legally obliged to report any suspected sham marriages or civil partnerships to the Home Office, based on the criteria outlined in the Immigration and Asylum Act of 1999. It is then for the Home Office to decide how to progress and whether to take action.' A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Where suspicions are raised that a marriage may not be genuine we will investigate. On this occasion no action was taken. 'We continue to work closely with registrars to prevent people from abusing the marriage system in a bid to get round our immigration laws.'","Chinese bride Miao Guo, 34, and Italian groom Massimo Ciabattini, 31, were in the middle of their wedding ceremony .

"By . Leon Watson . Got stung: Jamie Brown, 29, has been jailed for 24 weeks after being caught by police when he sat on a wasps nest . A thief fleeing the scene of a burglary found his life of crime had a painful sting in the tail when a cloud of wasps attacked him after he sat on their nest. Jamie Brown tried to hide from police by sneaking into a bush after breaking into a shop in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on Saturday night . But as he blundered in the 29-year-old disturbed a colony of wasps and they went for him en masse. Officers heard the unfortunate thief cry out as he was stung repeatedly by the angry insects before being arrested. Brown, who stole a £200 fish tank, then spent six hours in agony at Leeds General Infirmary, before being discharged. Today, he appeared before magistrates, admitted burglary and was jailed. Inspector Chris Bowen, of the Leeds inner south neighbourhood policing team (NPT), said: 'Instead of taking him to the cells, we had to take him straight to hospital.' Police were called at about 8.15pm to reports of a commercial burglary at The Range furniture outlet in Hunslet, Leeds. On arrival, officers discovered a fish tank discarded along with a pair of gloves close to the scene. Insp Bowen added: 'The officers heard noises coming from a bush nearby. 'He was apparently in so much pain after sitting on or disturbing the nest that he was struggling to breathe. He was in hospital for about five or six hours, but seems to be physically well now.' Brown pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary which the court heard breached a suspended sentence for a previous theft and a ban from entering the homeware store. Lorraine Harris, prosecuting, said: 'The alarm was triggered and police were called, parking their car near to the store. 'Police saw the defendant running towards them. He was sweating heavily and rubbing his head. 'He said he was running home and had been attacked by wasps. A witness said she saw him wearing gloves, which they later found with the fish tank. 'He had gone into the bushes to relieve himself. Due to the number of wasps in the nest he was taken to hospital. The glove marks were found and a foot print recovered. 'When asked why he was in the area he said he was visiting his aunt.' Caught by the buzz: Brown tried to steal a fish tank from The Range furniture outlet in Hunslet, Leeds. He was then stung repeatedly by wasps . The court heard Brown has a number of previous convictions for theft. Sentencing Brown to 24 weeks in prison, deputy district judge Andrew Pascoe said: 'You will go to prison for 16 weeks and serve eight weeks respectively for burglary. 'I hope that you use that time usefully in regards to your drug problem.' There was little sympathy for the suspect from internet users when news of his arrest was posted on the local neighbourhood policing team's Facebook page. The team wrote: 'A male has been arrested after breaking into business premises in Hunslet. The male however is currently in hospital after making the unfortunate decision to hide from the police in a bush and thus disturbing a wasps' nest.' The post was 'liked' by more than 1,700 people and attracted nearly 200 comments. One user joked that the burglar must have been 'buzzing' after the incident. Another said: 'So wasps do have a purpose after all!' Another wrote: 'Love a bit of karma!' In a further update on its Facebook page, the NPT told followers: 'You will be pleased to know his swellings have gone down.'","Jamie Brown broke into a shop in Leeds, West Yorks, on Saturday .

"By . Alex Finnis . A model has revealed how she exposed a fashion photographer and rapist who preyed on his subjects - by blogging about her experiences with him. Roswell Ivory, 26, was sexually abused by Shaun Colclough, 40, at his studio in Hackney Wick, East London, but had no idea he had done the same to others until she shared her story. Ms Ivory told how he deliberately made her feel vulnerable, asked intimate questions about her sex life and straddled her. He was jailed for seven years on August 2 for sexually abusing two women, with Judge Sheelagh Canavan saying he clearly enjoyed the 'humiliation and degradation of women'. Roswell Ivory exposed photographer and sexual predator Shaun Colclough when she blogged about her experiences with him and other models came forward with similar stories . Ms Ivory, who specialises in alternative and fetish-style clothing and art nudes, spoke of how Colclough behaved erratically and tried to dominate her by destroying her self-esteem. She first realised she was not alone when she told another model about what had happened during a fashion show in Barcelona. 'She just went white,' Ms Ivory said. 'She told me what happened to her and it was exactly the same, the same sentences, the same pattern [of behaviour].' Colclough, 40, was jailed for seven years for sexually abusing two woman, but escaped three charges . She then decided to use her popular blog to ask if any other models had had bad experiences in Hackney Wick, though did not name Colclough himself. She said about ten girls wrote back to her, each one of them naming him explicitly. Her next step was to contact the police, not knowing that a 27-year-old part-time model had already registered a similar complaint after enduring seven and a half hours of horror with the predator. The police had investigated him and seized his computer, but decided that it would be too risky to prosecute with it being just one word against another. But after Ms Ivory's complaint and the resulting court case at Snaresbrook Crown Court, Colclough was found guilty of sexually abusing both women. Similar complaints had also been made by three other woman, but he was acquitted of three other charges, including indecently assaulting Ms Ivory and of indecently exposing himself to another model. During the trial it emerged that Colclough had previously served a six-year sentence for raping an 85-year-old woman in her own home in 1996, when he was aged just 22. The court also heard how he would bully the girls into striking explicitly sexual poses, tell them to perform oral sex on him and force their legs apart when they refused to do open-leg shots. Ms Ivory first contacted Colclough in January 2011, as she wanted to update her portfolio with some artistic nude and fashion photos. His website showed that he had worked for some of the world's top international agencies, including Premier, Oxygen and IMG. 'Usually I get references from other models,' she said, 'but because he worked with all these big agencies I thought he must be wonderful.' Ms Ivory told how Colclough tried to make her feel vulnerable and lower her self-esteem . However, she quickly began to feel uncomfortable with what Colclough was asking her to do. 'For a fashion shoot you always wear make-up and do your hair but he insisted on no make-up or styling,' she told The Times. 'This was his way of lowering my self-esteem. He knew I would feel vulnerable doing 'fashion' without make-up.' She continued: 'He walked towards me with the camera repeatedly saying ""you are vulnerable, you are very vulnerable"" until he was right up to me.' Ms Ivory broke down in tears when she saw the mugshots he took for the first time in court. Judge Sheelagh Canavan told him: 'You targeted these women on the basis that they were likely to be vulnerable and unlikely to stand up to you.' The judge added he had completed a sexual offenders course in prison, and a second one when he was released into the community. She said: 'You've had, if you were ever going to, the tools and opportunity to put your offending behind you.' Ms Ivory shouted as he was led down from the dock: 'You look vulnerable to me.'","Roswell Ivory, 26, blogged about her experiences with Shaun Colclough .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Managers Bob Peeters and Uwe Rosler were involved in a bust-up following the final whistle of Charlton's 2-1 Sky Bet Championship victory over Wigan Athletic at the Valley. Franck Moussa's 93rd minute deflected winner sparked an ugly row on the touchline after Peeters celebrated wildly in front of Latics counterpart Rosler. Peeters apologised to his players for his part in the celebration, but the Belgian insisted he would not say sorry to Rosler, who had launched a tirade of abuse in his direction. VIDEO Scroll down for Rosler talks candidly about his cancer and footballing upbringing . Shake up: Bob Peeters and Uwe Rosler shake hands at the final whistle shortly before an altercation . Hold back: Players and staff step in to stop Peeters and Rosler continuing their argument . Frustration: Rosler wants to continue his feud with Peeters after the Charlton boss celebrated a late winner . Both men were separated by their respective backroom staff and the unsavoury incident proved the main talking point in the post-match press conference. Peeters said: 'We scored the second goal and I started running and celebrating. I didn't know where to go. 'He said, 'Don't come and celebrate in my corner', but I'm not going to mention the other words he said to me. Flash point: Uwe Rosler is lead down the touchline to stop him confronting Bob Peeters . 'I need to keep my composure and go away because I know it is emotional in a game where you score in the 94th minute with a deflected shot. 'In that moment, I need to be smarter and just step away. I lost my composure a bit. 'I apologise before my players that I lost my composure. I need to be strong in every moment, but I'm not going to apologise to him because he said things to me. Never ever.' Rosler gave his version of events and said: 'My colleague was running 25-30 metres to celebrate right in front of our bench and I told him what I thought about this.' Asked if he was friends with Peeters now, Rosler replied, 'We are colleagues, put it that way.' It took a little of the gloss off a fine victory for Charlton against one of the Championship favourites. Peeters' side went ahead after eight minutes when Jordan Cousins produced a superb strike into the top corner beyond Scott Carson. Callum McManaman levelled for Wigan in the 22nd minute - the Lancashire's club first ever goal at the Valley - before Moussa struck via a deflection off Robert Kiernan to hand a delighted Peeters his first league win in charge. Peeters added: 'I'm very happy to get the three points because when you see the chances we created especially in the last 20 minutes then we needed to score earlier. Double security: The Wigan coaching staff haul Uwe Rosler away from continuing his altercation with Peeters . 'If you can win the game then the 94th minute with a deflected shot makes you very happy because we put a lot of effort into this game. 'I'm very happy for Franck Moussa because he came on and gave us the goal and the three points.' Wigan are still searching for their first win in the league this season and Rosler said: 'Last week we won a point, this time we lost one. It's not only the timing of the goal. it's a deflected goal. 'I felt for the first 30 minutes we were in complete control and passed the ball well. We could have created one or two bigger chances. 'Their goal came against the run of play, but we responded well through Callum. In the second half there was nothing between the two sides and the goal was cruel.'","Bob Peeters and Uwe Rosler bust-up after Franck Moussa winner sparks  row .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Caretaker boss Keith Millen does not want Saturday's dramatic late 2-1 defeat at Arsenal to be his last in charge of Crystal Palace. Millen was in temporary charge at the Emirates Stadium following the shock departure of Tony Pulis less than 48 hours before the new Barclays Premier League season kicked off. The well-organised Eagles were left frustrated after taking the lead through a first-half header from Brede Hangeland, one of the few summer signings sanctioned by chairman Steve Parish, as the Gunners fought back to snatch victory in stoppage time through Aaron Ramsey. Job plea: Keith Millen is keen on replacing Tony Pulis on a permanent basis following Tony Pulis' exit . Proud man: Millen was pleased with Crystal Palace's display against Arsenal . Laurent Koscielny flicked in a free-kick from £30million Chile forward Alexis Sanchez to level before the break. Arsenal lacked a cutting edge in the final third, creating only a few half-chances against a side who had Jason Puncheon sent off for a second yellow card - until Ramsey slotted home after Mathieu Debuchy's shot was saved. Millen, who was in temporary charge last season after Ian Holloway left ahead of Pulis' appointment in November, feels he has unfinished business with the club. 'I am proud of the players, of the performance, but am disappointed not to get something which we deserved,' he said. 'When you think what the players have been through in the last couple of days, you are never quite sure how they are going to respond to Tony leaving. 'We said to them before the game ""make sure there are no excuses"" because I didn't want to have to stand up for them and say their heads weren't right to do a job because of what's happened.' Late winner: Welsh international Aaron Ramsey scored late on for Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium . Millen continued: 'Would I like it to be my last game? No, I would like to continue. 'I enjoy being in charge. Whether it's the right time or not, I will speak to the chairman on Sunday. 'In the last two days the chairman has not had a chance to speak to the players, he's not spoken to me about what his ideas are going forward, he just said ""let's focus on today's game"". 'On Monday I am sure there will be some more conversations. The players need to know which direction the club is going. Hopefully at the start of the week there will be some more answers. 'If the chairman felt it was right for me I would sit down and talk to him about it. 'I like working at this club and I certainly enjoy working with the players because they are a good honest group that works hard for you. They respect my decisions.' Whoever takes over will have little chance to bring in the required additions before the transfer window closes. 'We have identified all summer the areas we need to strengthen but for whatever reason it's not happened,' said Millen. 'Tony knew what players he wanted and the club do. The new manager who comes in, in two weeks he's got to know which players he wants. It's not ideal if a club chooses them - you need a manager to choose new players.' Mutual respect: Glenn Murray would be happy to play under Crystal Palace's temporary manager Millen . Veteran Palace forward Glenn Murray believes Millen would have the trust of the players to take the club forwards. 'A lot of the players have worked with Keith for a long time and respect him,' said Murray, who joined from Brighton in 2011, helping the club win promotion two years ago and was on the bench at Arsenal. 'We showed in the time when he took over from Ian (Holloway) and again today that we work hard for him and enjoy playing under him. 'It has got to be the right man now, and it will take as long as it takes, that is up to the hierarchy.'","Keith Millen is in charge of Crystal Palace following Tony Pulis' shock exit .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The story of Edward De Lacy Evans read like every other man's in the 19th century - he was a labourer, husband and father. But underneath the suit and tie was a body of a woman named Ellen Tremayne - also known as Ellen Tremaye - who could have been Australia's first transgender person. Mr De Lacy Evans arrived on Australian shores from Ireland in June 1856 as an assisted immigrant on-board the Ocean Monarch. It is speculated he was born between 1829 to 1841 due to a discrepancy in shipping lists, and birth, marriage and death certificates. Edward De Lacy Evans who could be Australia's first transgender person as a woman (left) and as a man (right) during his stint in Kew Asylum . A portrait of Edward De Lacy Evans in male and female attire. The image is probably a fake cut-and-paste produced by a photographer after it was discovered De Lacy Evans was a man . According to ship records, he was a 26-year-old Roman Catholic from Kilkenny who could read and write, and was listed as a housemaid. When she arrived in Victoria, Mr De Lacy Evans was still known as Ellen Tremayne and caused quite a stir on the trip over. According to the State Library of Victoria's The La Trobe Journal, he wore a man's shirt and trousers underneath his dress and had formed sexual attachments to some of the other female passengers on the Ocean Monarch, including his soon-to-be first wife, Mary Delahunty - a 34-year-old governess who was also from Ireland. He travelled with a trunk labelled with the name 'Edward De Lacy Evans' on it who, according to De Lacy Evans' third wife, was his uncle. There was also speculation her husband or lover was named 'Edward De Lacy Evans' and he had somehow tricked the transsexual by placing his trunk on the Ocean Monarch and deserted the 26-year-old. Mr De Lacy Evans', who was still identified as a woman, first job in Australia was as a maidservant at a Melton public house but some time after he left his position and started dressing like a man, and ditched the name of Ellen Tremayne. Mr De Lacy Evans continued living as a man for 25 years after he left Kew Asylum in 1879 (left) and the right picture is of him and his third wife, Julia Marquand . Now as Edmund De Lacy, he went and sought out Ms Delahunty, marrying her at St Francis' Roman Catholic Church in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. But their marriage was not a happy one, with evidence suggesting they 'did not live comfortably together'. After Ms Delahunty opened a school in Blackwood, she left Mr De Lacy Evans and married an American mining surveyor Lyman Oatman Hart who lived in Daylesford - north-west of Melbourne. In the next 20 years, Mr De Lacy Evans married twice - his second wife was Sarah Moore who died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1867 and a Julia Marquand of Bendigo - north of Melbourne. Mr De Lacy Evans worked as a carter, miner, blacksmith and ploughman in the areas of Blackwood, Bendigo and Stawell. The breakdown of his third marriage came after March 1878 when Ms Marquand gave birth to a child fathered by her brother-in-law, Jean Baptiste Loridan. Despite Mr De Lacy Evans knowing it was not his child, he registered himself as the child's father but his resentment over the pregnancy started taking its toll on the marriage. In July 1879, he started violently acting out against Ms Marquand and his 15-month-old daughter, fell into a deep depression and then was admitted to Bendigo Hospital's lunacy ward for amentia - a mental disability. Another portrait done of Mr De Lacy Evans done by Aaron Flegeltaub who was active between 1882-1891 . For the first six weeks of his stint in the hospital, Mr De Lacy Evans refused to bathe until he was transferred to the Kew Asylum and forcibly stripped that his secret was discovered. He was handed over to female nurses and forced to dress as a woman . In an interview, Mr De Lacy Evans' recalled the moment he was outed as a female at Kew Asylum. 'I was sittin’ the carriage at the railway station, an’ the wife was cryin’ and the kid was squealin’, an’ I was laughin’ at ‘em,' he said during an interview. 'Well, when we got to Kew, the fellers there took hold o’ me to give me a bath, an’ they stripped me to put me in the water, an’ then they saw the mistake. 'One feller ran off as if he was frightened; the others looked thunderstruck an’ couldn't speak. 'I was handed over to the women, and they dressed me up in frocks and petticoats.' Mr De Lacy Evans' outing as a female caused a worldwide stir, with one photographer named Nicholas White sneaking into the hospital and taking photos of the transsexual dressed as a man and a woman as well as possibly a straitjacket. As a transgender person, Mr De Lacy Evans' faced brutal treatment inside the asylum including a report done up by The Australian Medical Journal that said he cried and screamed as he was probed during a gynaecological examination - which verified he was a physiologically a woman. A drawing done of Mr De Lacy Evans entitled The Sandhurst impersonator working as a man at the Victorian goldfields . With the news in circulation, Mr De Lacy Evans received offers to be 'publicly exhibited' and after his release from Kew Asylum he took up the opportunities. He was once offered three to five pounds per week for a tour. He appeared as 'The Wonderful Male Impersonator' at St Georges Hall on Bourke Street in Melbourne in January 1880 and another time alongside a trapeze artist and 'The Electric Boy' at Sydney's Egyptian Hall on George Street in September 1880. When the truth came out his wife, Ms Marquand denied knowing her husband was in fact a woman and accounted for her daughter's existence by telling reporters: 'Some strange man entered the house one night about the time her husband should have returned home'. Ms Marquand also stated her husband would never let her see him stripped or washing himself. Additionally, Mr De Lacy Evans could have fooled his wife into thinking he was a man by fashioning a homemade strap-on dildo. There was also evidence Mr De Lacy Evans' second wife, Sarah Moore, found out about her husband's cross-dressing about a year into their marriage . A witness reported seeing Ms Moore punching Mr De Lacy Evans in the breast - her 'weak place'. Mr De Lacy Evans lived as a man for another 25 years and found no success in show business. In February 1881, he was applying for relief at the Melbourne Police Court and wanted to be admission to the Benevolent Asylum. Mr De Lacy Evans died in August 1901 in the Melbourne Immigrants’ Home at St Kilda Road, where he had been since February 1881.","For about 20 years of his life, Edward De Lacy Evans lived as a man .

"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . AFL player, Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch has suffered a neck fracture, which was detected four days after he suffered the injury during last weekend's clash with Brisbane Lions. A statement from the Adelaide Crows confirms that 'after complaining of soreness and pain in his arm, Lynch was sent for an MRI scan (on Thursday). It revealed a fracture.' Initial X-Rays and a CT scan had not shown any fractures or serious injury. On Sunday August 10, Lynch was involved in what the Adelaide Crows are calling ‘a sickening collision’ in the second quarter of the match at The Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland. On game day, Lynch was stretchered off in a neck brace after making front-on contact with Brisbane defender Justin Clarke, but scans on the day indicated Lynch had escaped critical neck damage. Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch holds his head and grimaces shortly before being stretchered off after a collision during the game which left him with a neck fracture . Tom Lynch of the Adelaide Crows is stretchered from the field during the round 20 AFL match between the Brisbane Lions and the Adelaide Crows at The Gabba. 23-year-old suffered a neck fracture in the incident. Tom Lynch and Charlie Cameron of the Crows celebrate a goal during the round 20 match last weekend, before Lynch was involved in a 'sickening clash' in the second quarter. Four days later, Lynch discovered he has a small neck fracture which early scans did not show. Lynch was allowed to fly home with the team when cleared of any serious neck injury and the club had been referring to the injury as 'a jarred neck', until the discovery the injury was far worse. Lynch, 23, was experiencing soreness and pain in his arm, the club confirms in their statement. When the young player was not showing signs of recovery by Thursday and continued to experience ‘the occasional tingle in his fingertips’, doctors ordered further scans, concerned there was more to the neck injury, according to 3AW radio. Dr Peter Larkins told 3AW radio that Lynch has fractured C7 and T1 vertebrae in his spine and expects he will be in a neck brace for six weeks. The club confirms that Lynch will wear a neck brace, but for an unknown period of time. They emphasise that the brace is only a precautionary measure, to prevent further damage. Although initial x-rays and a CT scan did not show any serious damage, Tom Lynch discoverd four days later that he has suffered a neck fracture. Lynch is pictured injured and being stretchered off in the Adelaide Crows Round 20 match against the Brisbane Lions on August 10. Tom Lynch will wear a neck brace as a precautionary measure to avoid further injury. The Adelaide Crows forward has had terrible luck with injury this year, undergoing surgery for a broken jaw from a collision with Melbourne Demons' Jack Viney. Fellow Adelaide Crows player, Patrick Dangerfield says the players were worried when the incident occurred but relieved to see their teammate was able to move his arms and legs, according to Adelaide Crows media. Earlier this year, Lynch required surgery for a badly fractured jaw, suffered from a bump from Melbourne Demons midfielder Jack Viney. Lynch was also recovering during the pre-season from foot surgery, only to dislocated his shoulder on the eve of the new season, when he had been finally deemed fit to play. Coach Brenton Sanderson laments that the 23-year-old is having a 'horrific season injury-wise.' Sanderson also defends Lynch, saying that although Lynch has received criticism for ducking his head when he came into contact with Clarke’s torso, Lynch was possibly trying to protect his jaw, considering the forward had suffered his broken jaw earlier in the year in a similar altercation. Tom Lynch (right) was Adelaide's top goal scorer in 2013 and had already scored two goals against Brisbane Lions, before he was involved in the serious collision in the second quarter of the Round 20 match. ‘You have to remember  earlier in the year... he (Lynch) came out and lifted his head he got his jaw smashed in half. I think this time, instead of lifting his head up in the contest, Sanderson kept his head down,’ Sanderson told Adelaide Crows Football Club media. Adelaide’s 2013 leading goalkicker had already kicked two goals before he was stretchered off. Adelaide went on to secure a 105-point win over Brisbane. Lynch sat out last night’s narrow loss to Richmond. At this stage it is unknown how long Lynch will be out with injury.","Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch has suffered a small neck fracture .

"By . David Mccormack . The German government is set to scrap its decades-old policy of not spying on key NATO allies – including the U.S. – in response to the latest spy scandal, which exposed a German intelligence officer as a double-agent leaking secret documents to the U.S. The decision was announced by Thomas de Maizière, an Interior Minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. He told the newspaper Bild that Berlin wants ‘360 degree surveillance’ of all intelligence-gathering operations in Germany. Scroll down for video . German Chancellor Angela Merkel interrupted a trade visit to China on Monday to describe the latest spying scandal as a 'clear contradiction of the notion of trustworthy co-operation' After the defeat of the Nazis and the end of World War II in 1945, the new authorities of West Germany adopted a policy of turning a blind eye to the intelligence activities of some of the victors, namely the U.S., Britain and France. Bild claims to have obtained a document detailing ‘concrete countermeasures’ that the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) – Germany’s equivalent of the CIA - plans to implement. The minister comments were echoed by Stephan Mayer, a domestic security spokesman for Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrats. ‘We must focus more strongly on our so-called allies,’ he said. The BND ‘double agent’ is reported to have simply emailed Berlin’s American embassy and asked whether officials were interested in ‘co-operation’. The Bundesnachrichtendienst (pictured), Germany¿s equivalent of the CIA, has 'concrete' plans to spy on U.S. for first time since 1945 after 'double agent' scanda . German prosecutors say the 31-year-old man is suspected of selling over 218 top-secret German intelligence documents to his US spymasters in return for cash payments of $13,600 per document between 2012 and 2014. He was caught by German counter-espionage agents only after he was found offering similar BND documents to Berlin’s Russian embassy. He was arrested last week. New German counter-espionage measures would almost certainly result in the monitoring of ‘listening posts’, which the National Security Agency (NSA) runs from the roof of its Berlin embassy. Its existence was revealed last year when evidence supplied by the whistle-blower Edward Snowden revealed that NSA had bugged Chancellor Merkel’s cell phone. CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden was responsible for last year's revelation that the NSA had bugged Chancellor Merkel's cell phone . She interrupted a current trade visit to China on Monday to describe the scandal as a ‘very serious development’. She added: ‘It is a clear contradiction of the notion of trustworthy co-operation.’ The White House has said the U.S. will work with Germany to resolve its concerns. Spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. is aware that a German citizen was arrested amid allegations he was purportedly working for the U.S., but he would not say whether the reports are accurate. However two U.S. officials familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters on Monday that the CIA was involved in a spying operation against Germany that had led to the alleged recruitment of the German intelligence official. CIA Director John Brennan has asked to brief key members of the U.S. Congress on the matter.","Angela Merkel's government is set to scrap its decades-old policy of not spying on key NATO allies – including the U.S.

"By . Harriet Arkell . University student Nawal Masaad, 27, pictured arriving at court today, was caught at Heathrow with euro notes wrapped in clingfilm in her underwear, London's Old Bailey heard . A university student was caught trying to smuggle vast quantities of euros in her underwear through Heathrow to give to a British terrorist fighting in Syria, the Old Bailey heard today. Nawal Msaad, 27, had a stash of 20,000 euro in notes wrapped up in clingfilm as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul from Heathrow, jurors heard. The court was told Msaad, from Holloway, north London, had agreed to be a 'trusted courier' for her close friend Amal El-Wahabi, also 27. The money was allegedly to be taken to Turkey at the request of El-Wahabi's husband, Aine Davis, who had joined fighters in Syria. Msaad was stopped by police at the departure gate and the cash, which had been hidden in a condom in her pants, was found when they searched her. Msaad and El-Wahabi, of north west London, are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of funding terrorism. They deny the charge. Prosecutor Mark Dennis, QC, said the women, both of whom were born in London, had been close friends for years. Davis left London in July last year to pursue the jihadist cause but had maintained regular contact with his wife, with whom he has two young sons, he said. The 30-year-old, who was also born in London with roots in Gambia, converted to Islam six or seven years ago, the court heard. Mr Dennis said: 'It is alleged in this case that the money that the second defendant was attempting to take out to Turkey was money that had been raised in this country and had been destined to support the jihadist cause which Davis was now pursuing with like-minded supporters. 'The allegation in this case is that each defendant, when becoming concerned in the arrangement of the smuggling of this money to Turkey at the behest of Davis, knew of, at the very least had reasonable cause to suspect, that the money was or might be used for the purposes of terrorism.' Msaad had been studying human resources at London Metropolitan University in Aldgate at the time her friend had allegedly offered her 1,000 euros to be a courier. On January 16, she set off for Heathrow airport for the three-day trip but was stopped by police at the departure gate and questioned about why she was going to Istanbul. Friends: Msaad was allegedly offered 1,000 euros by Amal El-Wahabi, 27, pictured, to be a courier to Turkey . 'Taggazzled': Nawal Msaad, 26, from North London, shows off her tag which she has 'tagazzled' in this photo which she posted on her open Twitter profile . She said it was for a 'short break' and that she was buying gold for her mother. She said she had 20,000 euros 'around me'. Mr Dennis said: 'She was then taken to a private room where she pulled out a roll of banknotes from inside her underwear and handed it across to the officers. The banknotes were tightly rolled and were wrapped in cling film. 'It would appear that it would have been further hidden inside her body, wrapped in a condom.' There were 38 500 euro notes, four 200 euro notes and two 100 euro notes, totalling 20,000 euros. The court heard how the arrangements were made in the days before in phone calls and WhatsApp messages between El-Wahabi and her husband Davis and her friend Msaad. On the day Msaad was arrested, police went to El-Wahabi's home where they seized mobile phones. Court: Jurors at London's Old Bailey, pictured, heard that the money was destined to help jihadists in Syria . In police interviews, Msaad declined to explain the money, and would only say 'No comment'. El-Wahabi gave three short statements to police maintaining that an iPod, Kindle and iPad found at her address belonged to 'the father of my children' who was now living in Turkey. She denied knowledge of any terrorist activities or their funding, but material recovered from her mobile phone was at odds with her claim not to know about her husband's active support for the violent jihadist cause, the court heard. Davis had sent her photos including a 'selfie' while he had been away, jurors were told. There were also videos from Davis to his wife containing jihadist propaganda. One sent in September last year showed a 'boy martyr' aged between ten and 13 holding a Kalashnikov rifle, Mr Dennis said. The court heard that when Davis left, El-Wahabi - who was living on benefits, had been reluctant to follow and leave behind her friends and family. But by December last year she was coming around to the idea of joining him wherever he was, jurors were told. The trial continues.

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . How do you put a sentence on a life sentence is the question being asked by Liam Knight and his family. In January last year, Liam was speared through the head with a metal pole by a teenage gatecrasher at an 18th birthday party in Sydney and on Friday, his attacker was sentenced to at least eight years. 'For me it's going to be a life sentence,' he told Channel 9's 60 Minutes when asked if the sentence was fair. 'For him to have eight years - I was hoping for more.' Scroll down for video . Liam Knight was speared through the head with a metal pole by a teenage gatecrasher at an 18th birthday party in Sydney . Liam and his mother Mary discussed the challenges of sentencing a person who has given another person a 'life sentence' 'The fact that he did it when he was underage, you can't expect him to get too much.' Yet Liam is already looking to the future and said he was focused on getting his White Knight Foundation running and raising money for it. 'Our aim is to help victims of youth violence and raise awareness of gatecrashing,' he said. Liam said the foundation's aim was to help victims through their recovery. 'I've had a lot of help from the community, the community has helped me that much that I want to give back to them,' he said. Liam was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of his friend Harry Staples in Forestville in Sydney's north when things went horribly wrong. The teenager was celebrating 18th birthday of a friend in Forestville in Sydney's north when things went horribly wrong . Liam said two girls at the party invited the gatecrashers to the party . The then 16-year-old, who can only be called DS for legal reasons, gatecrashed the party with four other young men only to be told they were not on the guest list, and unwelcome. Liam said the trial had been a 'full on' experience given he is still a teenager. 'I didn't expect myself to be in this position,' he said. Of his attacker's previous nine prior criminal convictions including resisting police and assault, Liam said he was 'trouble'. 'He's a bad cookie. He should have been locked up before then,' he said. The attacker breached bail on the night he gatecrashed the party and speared Liam. 'He shouldn't have even been there - I don't know how stupid you can get to actually break bail that many times and think you can get away with it,' he said. 'So he's not the smartest man around.' Liam explained that two girls at the party sent the address and invited DS and other young men to attend. 'Just trying to make a reputation for himself with his mates and look where it's ended, he's in jail and I'm in a state that I'll be in for the rest of my life.' The teenager has set up The White Knight Foundation to help other youth violence victims . Liam said he missed surfing but was using music as an escape and was getting his freedom back now he can drive . Once at the party DS scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed, shouting to his mates, 'come on, we can come through this way'. Harry Staples' father, Phillip Staples, shone a torch on DS and said: 'Mate, you're not invited, you have to leave.' Angry and intoxicated, DS pushed Mr Staples in the chest, and punched one of the party guests in the face. Then he began throwing building materials at partygoers. One of four steel three-metre bars that he threw into the crowd pierced Liam's skull and lodged in his head. Paramedics arrived on the scene and sedated Knight, but had to wait for firefighters to cut the large piece of steel protruding from his head, before they took the young man to hospital. In Royal North Shore Hospital, Knight underwent a five hour emergency bilateral craniectomy. Liam said he thanked doctors for the fact he survived and was 'still here'. Of his recovery, the teenager said physically he had improved a lot in the last year-and-a-half and that the paralysis on his left side was getting better but had 'plateaued'. 'Obviously sometimes I get down still,' he said. Extreme harm: Liam Knight, pictured leaving Downing Centre Court following the sentencing of his attacker, suffered an 'extreme' degree of harm in the 'catastrophic' steel pole assault in January last year, said Judge Ronald Solomon, which left Knight with permanent injuries and his future life 'in tatters' Plans shattered: Liam, pictured leavibng the Downing Centre Court on Friday afternoon, told the court last month in a pre-sentencing hearing that the metal pole attack by the teenager known as DS, 'changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party, my life as it was before the injury is gone. I nearly lost my life numerous times that night. The future I had planned has gone . Liam said the attack had robbed him of the chance to celebrate social events during his last year of school and also surfing and rugby. 'I used to just go out the back, sit there, just chill out, clear my head,' he said and added that although he misses it, music is his 'escape' now. The teenager said he was slowly getting his freedom back since he started driving. 'I'm loving it,' he said. 'I would always have to wait for my mates to come pick me up and if they couldn't take me I'd sit here on the couch after doing physio.' His mother Mary said there were no winners or losers following the life-changing attack but reiterated Liam's sentiments about the challenges of sentencing someone who has given another a 'life sentence'. 'I have mixed feelings,' she said. Despite remaining positive throughout his recovery, Liam admitted there were times he was angry about what happened to him and being left in a position where he should not be. 'There's moments I remember I broke down, before the court started and they warned me about what he could get and that's when I just kind of broke down and said: ""Well I've got a life sentence on me so why shouldn't he?"",' he said. However his mother said it was devastating to see her young son not to be able to do his shoelaces or tie. 'That's embarrassing for him,' she said. 'But then I look at him from where he was to where he is now, he's come such a long way... he's amazing. 'I don't think I know anyone that has such a positive attitude towards to what's happened to him. 'He's got a special quality about him... he brings tears to my eyes.' Pole assault victim Liam Knight (pictured, right, alighting from the vehicle) arrives at the Downing Centre Court on Friday for the sentencing of the teenager who threw a steel rod at his head, permanently injuring Knight who said his life has been ruined by the attack . The teenager who threw a three metre metal pole into a party crowd in January last year, piercing the skull of Liam Knight(pictured, left) and leaving him with permanent injuries has received a minimum eight year sentence for his crime . Angry and intoxicated: The teenager, then aged 16 years, arrived at party in Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year where Liam Knight was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of Harry Staples  when things went horribly wrong. The teen, known as DS, gatecrashed the party and scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed. Then he threw four three-metre bars into the crowd, piercing Liam's skull . Last month, the court heard the attack had left Knight's life 'in tatters'. In sentencing DS to a maximum of 12 years and six months over the attack on Friday, acting Judge Ronald Solomon told Sydney's District Court that the consequences for Liam were 'catastrophic'. The pole pierced Knight's skull and came out the other side, leaving him with permanent brain injuries that he said would prevent him from surfing, playing rugby and perhaps even running again. 'The degree of violence perpetrated by the offender was high and the degree of harm extreme,' Judge Solomon said. 'DS has changed my whole life for the simple fact that he couldn't get into a party,' Liam told the court during DS's sentence hearing in June. 'My family should never have heard the words ""your child has been seriously injured and may not live"",' Liam said in a victim impact statement read by his brother to the court on Friday. 'I nearly lost my life numerous times that night. 'DS changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party. My life as it was before the injury is gone. The future I had planned has gone.'","Liam Knight has questioned his attacker's eight-year jail sentence .

"By . Caroline Mcguire For Mailonline . It's one childhood experience that few have managed to escape: head over the bath while mum washes in some super-strength head lice potion, followed by hours having the little horrors combed out of the hair. But after years of being blasted by special shampoos, nits are now becoming resistant to many of the lotions on offer in supermarkets and pharmacies. So mums are turning in their droves to the internet to discover alternative solutions. Scroll down for video . Alex Butler regularly uses hair straighteners on her children including Magda (pictured). The mum-of-three finds the kids prefer the tongs as they see it as a treat. She said: ""It's a nice change because they aren't allowed to have their hair straightened usually."" Mum-of-three Alex Butler from Brighton swapped potions for hair irons after it was recommended by a parent at her children's school. The 36-year-old now uses the practice on each of her three children, Magda, 11, Pearl, nine, and Camille, six. She said: 'I used hair straighteners on my daughter’s hair to pop the eggs and burn the lice, lots of the other mums at school swear by it. 'I also use the lice shampoo Hedrin, they both work. 'But with three children, you get them so regularly when they're a certain age. 'Using the straighteners is a nice change because they aren't allowed to have their hair straightened usually, so it makes it into an enjoyable thing. ' Alexandra Butler (36) is a mother to Magda (11), Pearl (nine) and Camille (six). With so many young children in the house, she finds there are often issues with headlice. She is one of many British parents turning to alternative methods to supplement traditional nit lotions. It isn't the only alternative method being used by British parents though; internet forums reveal parents suggesting a range of quick-fix solutions that include using mayonnaise on the scalp or bleaching the hair. One in five parents even admit to shaving their child’s hair in an attempt to eliminate head lice. With near a quarter of parents turning to the web to search for help in getting rid of the pests, scientists are now  warning people that most new-age solutions will only make the problem worse and can also put children in danger. Ian Burgess, director of the Medical Entomology Centre said; 'There is a huge amount of incorrect head lice information online, which exists on the more popular sites parents are visiting. 'This gives worried parents misplaced confidence in ineffective methods. 'When they follow this advice, head lice are allowed to spread further and quicker. 'I’ve heard of mums dyeing their child’s hair, in an attempt to kill the lice. 'They believe this was effective because they can’t find lice, but in fact the lice have just been dyed along with the hair.' Hedrin lice lotion has now undertaken a comprehensive study of popular forums and social networking sites used by parents of attitudes towards head lice, in an effort to promote the sharing of best practice advice.","Alex Butler turned to her straighteners after becoming fed up of potions .

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Northern Territory policeman Garry Smith has been making people laugh on Facebook . Although he cops some flack from his mates, it's all part of the job for Northern Territory policeman Garry Smith, who has earned himself a legion of fans on social media. Senior Sergeant Smith uses the Northern Territory Police Force Facebook page to keep the public up to date with police-related information by using humour when appropriate and signing off with his signature 'boom boom' dad jokes. His jokes include: 'What snakes are found on police cars? Windshield vipers', and result in hundreds of likes, comments and shares. 'Some of the jokes are pretty ordinary,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia. 'But as one person commented, by entwining humour into the posts, people feel compelled to read to the end, where I infamously like to place a witty 'boom boom' joke, as a reward for their attention,' he said. Sgt Smith said he was fine with his jokes being defined as dad humour and that Facebook was a great medium for getting important messages across to a large audience quickly. 'It's also a way to educate and connect with the public and using humour is one of the best ways to do that.' he said. 'I will not incorporate humour into a serious incident or whereby we want people to respond with accurate and timely information. 'Policing can be a tough occupation and I am trying to simply humanise the funny side of it.' Mr Smith said his humour was inspired by unusual or quirky events, such as an officer who found a small snake earlier this month . With more than 36,000 likes on the Northern Territory Police Force page, the reaction to his jokes is overwhelmingly positive, Mr Smith said. 'A vast majority of likers on our Facebook page are very supportive of the NT police force and going off the number of likes, shares and comments we receive to some of the more funny posts, it appears most people appreciate a more light-hearted approach to what is a very serious job,' he said. Sgt Smith said while he only applied humour when appropriate, it allowed him to humanise the work the police do. 'If I can educate people, making them realise police are only human, than I consider this an extra bonus,' he said. The officer regularly finishes off his Facebook posts with a dad joke . His signature boom boom attracts hundreds of comments, likes and shares . Mr Smith said he only incorporates humour when appropriate and it allows him to humanise the work the Northern Territory police do . Despite his popularity, Sgt Smith said he does not consider himself Facebook famous and is surprised by the reaction he gets. 'I really enjoy the opportunity to inject a bit of fun into the lighter side of our job,' he said. 'I'm certainly not after recognition. This is all about us - the NT police force and the at times, challenging job that we do.' Yet some of the feedback has included marriage proposals and being called the funniest man in the Northern Territory. 'Garry Smith you're a champion. best way to get a message across is how you do it. Great stuff,' Scott Sims commented on one of the posts. Sarah Bretherton wrote that she loves the 'dad jokes' at the end of the police officer's posts. He said the notoriety was becoming coming in his everyday life. 'There is a lot of good-humoured banter thrown around between my colleagues, family and friends following some of the posts,' he said. 'I do 'cop' a bit of flack but it's all in good fun.' Mr Smith said he had no problem with his humour being labelled as dad jokes . His fans regularly comment about how much they appreciate Mr Smith's unique form of joking . His posts have even earned him the title of the Northern Territory's funniest man by one fan . After an absence on Facebook, people were quick to welcome him back when they recognised the tone of the posts . 'Most people like it and some cringe however it’s all about us - the NT Police.' When looking for inspiration, Sgt Smith said quirky or unusual incidents were best, such a police officer who found a small snake earlier this month. 'Police are here to keep people safe and I take this as an opportunity to remind people of that and that we are human too,' he said. 'I do what I do for the goodness of our organisation. I love my job and will do anything I can to support the NT police force, whilst attempting to make a larger audience aware of our existence. 'We are a small police force covering vast distances and challenges and slowly but surely we are being noticed on a larger and national scale.'

'This post was in relation to a crash between a sedan and a truck on 31 July, which could easily have claimed the life of two small children, if it weren’t for the parents correctly fitting two safety capsules.' As always, Sgt Smith had a joke for Daily Mail Australia. 'And finally – what does a cat like to eat on a hot summer's day? A mice cream cone – Boom boom.'

"By . Jill Reilly for MailOnline . A woman in labour was given an injection of a disinfectant directly into her nervous system instead of an epidural. The Swedish mother had been admitted to hospital Malmo when the mix-up occurred last month leaving the new mother writhing in agony. The accident happened when two containers were mistakenly switched on the morning of July 26. A woman giving birth was given an injection of a disinfectant instead of an epidural directly into her nervous system . During an epidurals  pain killers are injected directly into the nerve canal along the spine to instantly block pain signals to the brain. But in the mix-up the woman was given a shot of chlorhexidine - a strong chemical used to disinfect medical catheters, medical devices which are inserted into the body, reported The Local. A week after giving birth, the woman was still at the hospital writhing in pain. 'She has extreme pain in her back, and feels something like electric jolts all the way down through her feet,' the woman's husband said. After two weeks under observation, the woman was finally able to return today. We consider this extremely serious,' Anders Rehn, acting director of Skåne University Hospital, (pictured) told local paper Sydsvenskan on Wednesday . 'We consider this extremely serious,' Anders Rehn, acting director of Skåne University Hospital, told local paper Sydsvenskan on Wednesday. The hospital says it consulted a neurologist who said that the dose was so weak that the risk of lasting damage was small. 'But obviously this shouldn't happen,' Mr Rehn added. 'We have removed the containers so they cannot be switched. The chemical is no longer in the birthing clinic.' It is not the first time this has happened to a woman giving birth. In 2011 a 33-year-old Sydney mother was left paralysed from the waist down and suffered painful nerve damage after she was injected with a powerful skin antiseptic instead of a saline solution during an epidural.","The Swedish mother had been admitted to hospital Malmo to give birth .

A study of almost 5,000 British teenagers found those with symmetrical facial features - regarded by many as being more attractive - were just as likely to fall ill as their asymmetrical counterparts. Beauty is just skin deep: Scientists at Brunel University have found those with symmetrical facial features, like actors Brad Pitt and Natalie Portman, are just as likely to fall ill as those with asymmetrical faces. Past studies have regarded symmetry as being more attractive, because it signals good health . The research flies in the face of . previous findings that suggest there are fewer cases of illness among . physically desirable people. Perfect facial symmetry has traditionally been associated with attractiveness. It is also thought to be behind the psychology . of human mate choice, because it signals good health. A team led by Dr Nicholas Pound, of Brunel University, used 3D face scans of 15-year-olds taking part to compare their features with a range of common illnesses as they grew up. They found no association between the rate of 16 infections - including measles, mumps, tonsilitis, flu and glandular fever - and a person's looks. In addition, when analysing symptoms including diarrhoea, vomiting, high temperature and earache, researchers found no link with good looks. They say the findings suggest that preferences for symmetrical faces, such as . those of George Clooney and Kate Moss, are unlikely to be explained by . the evolutionary benefits of choosing mates of high genetic quality. No link: Researchers found no association between symmetrical features, boasted by model Kate Moss and actor George Clooney, and 16 different illnesses including measles, mumps, tonsillitis, flu and glandular fever . Dr Pound said: 'The idea that symmetry . in facial traits is associated with attractiveness because it reliably . indicates good physiological health,particularly to potential sexual . partners, has generated an extensive literature on the evolution of . human mate choice. 'But overall, this study does not support the idea facial symmetry acts as a reliable cue to physiological health. 'This suggests although gross facial asymmetries may be . associated with specific pathological processes and injuries, subtle . variations in facial symmetry are not associated with variations in . general health during childhood.' Earlier this year, another study of 15,000 young men and women found the more attractive they were rated, the less likely they were to suffer from a wide range of health problems including asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Previous research has suggested that good looks (such as those of Michelle Pfeiffer) may be a marker of good genes, increasing the likelihood of having healthy offspring . Researchers in the U.S. said good looks may be a marker of good genes, which also signal good health, as well as increasing the likelihood of having healthy offspring. The men and women were put into five categories - very unattractive, unattractive, about average, attractive or very attractive. The more attractive the person was rated, the lower the risk of ill health. For instance, for each increase in the rating of physical attractiveness for men, there was a 13 per cent reduction in the likelihood of a diagnosis for high cholesterol, a 20 per cent drop in the risk of high blood pressure and a 15 per cent reduction in the probability of being diagnosed with depression. Women who were rated as more attractive were 21 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with high blood pressure, 22 per cent less likely to have diabetes, 12 per cent less likely to be asthmatic and 17 per cent less likely to suffer from depression. Both the men and women who were rated as very physically attractive were also more positive about their own health and had fewer days off work due to illness. They also had a reduced number of chronic disease diagnoses, of psychological disorders and of disease diagnoses overall. The new study was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. It involved teenagers in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.","Study at Brunel University found good looks do not protect against illness .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A bride-to-be died two days after she was due to walk down the aisle, after contracting pneumonia in both lungs. Katie Kozlowska was 26 years old when she passed away in January 2011. Doctors suspect the  pneumonia was triggered by swine flu. Three years on and her mother Jean Barker, of New Whittington in Derbyshire, recalled being powerless as her fit, energetic daughter succumbed to the condition over the course of a month. The 54-year-old has now written a book, which she hopes will give courage and hope to other parents who have lost their children. Scroll down for video . Katie Kozlowska, of Rayleigh in Essex, died in January 2011, just two days after she was supposed to get married. The 26-year-old died of double pneumonia, after doctors suspect she contracted swine flu . Miss Kozlowska, pictured with her mother Jean Barker, fell unwell around Christmas 2010, and was admitted to intensive care at Southend Hospital . She said: 'I kept asking the doctors, ""why?"" 'Why was she not getting any better? It didn't seem possible that someone so young could die of pneumonia in the 21st Century, but despite everything they tried, nothing worked. 'After she died I collapsed at her bedside. I was hysterical and refused to let her go.' Miss Kozlowska was rushed to intensive care in January 2011 just weeks after she became engaged to be married. Miss Barker, a holistic therapist, said: 'At school Katie was very popular. She was always the girl who the others wanted to hang around with. 'She'd always been very energetic and intelligent, and kept herself fit. 'From a young age she was very active - a real wildfire, and very happy. 'When she told us she was getting married after a year of being with her partner, I was over the moon. I liked her fiance very much. 'When they both came to see us just before Christmas, she was doing very well. The business she was helping to run was becoming quite successful.' During the visit Miss Barker continued to help her daughter plan for her wedding which was planned for January 26, 2011. Miss Barker said: 'We'd ordered her wedding dress, a beautiful Italian design with gems on the edging. I was getting ready to do her flowers - she loved tulips - and her wedding cake. 'The bridesmaids were going to wear a deep purple. Katie had been to see and booked the venue and the invitations were just about to go out.' But as the visit wore on, Miss Barker became concerned about her daughter's health. Miss Kozlowska, pictured with her sister Claire left, was due to get married on January 26, 2011. But on January 28, she passed away. Three years on, her mother Jean Barker, right, has now written a book to help other parents who lose a child, cope with their grief . She said: 'She was coughing and spluttering - she looked shocking. She told me she had been to see a doctor who told her she simply had flu. 'I sent her off to bed, and she rested all day. When I brought her a cup of tea in the evening she was burning up, and shivering. She was extremely pale. She didn't seem herself at all. 'I asked Katie to stay with me for a few days but she decided to go back to her home, more than an hour away, on the understanding she would go back to the doctor if she got any worse.' Shortly after Christmas, Miss Barker received a phone call to say her her daughter had been taken from her home in Rayleigh, Essex, to intensive care at Southend University Hospital. Miss Barker said: 'By the time we arrived, she was on oxygen in the high-dependency unit with suspected swine flu. 'Weeks earlier I was talking to her about her wedding day. Now I found myself thinking about her funeral' - Jean Barker, Miss Kozlowska's mother . 'They tried physiotherapy to shift the blockage in her lungs, but they couldn't get to the point where she could be taken off oxygen. 'She developed double pneumonia and was weakening rapidly. Things were piling on top of her. Her body was so weak that she couldn't fight the infection, so they put her into a controlled coma. 'She contracted acute respiratory distress syndrome - holes had developed in her lungs which couldn't be repaired. She started fighting for her life as her organs began shutting down. 'I couldn't understand what was going on. Each time I asked what was happening, I was told they were trying everything they could think of to stabilise her.' The wedding was postponed as Miss Barker and her younger daughter Claire Barker, 26, prayed that she would pull through. But just after dawn on January 28, 2011 Miss Barker was told she needed to get to the hospital urgently. She said: 'By the time I arrived shortly after 8.30am, Katie had already passed away. 'I collapsed on to the floor. I refused to let her go. I didn't want to leave her side.' The death certificate recorded the cause of death as pneumonia. Doctors later told the family that the suspected swine flu had weakened her, making her vulnerable to lung infections. Miss Barker now faced the heartbreaking task of preparing for her daughter's funeral. Miss Barker, from New Whittington in Derbyshire, said: 'Weeks earlier I was talking to her about her wedding day. Now I found myself thinking about her funeral' She said: 'I told myself I could do the flowers. I was ready to do it for the wedding. Just weeks earlier I was talking to her about her wedding day. 'Now I found myself thinking about her funeral. It seemed so unfair. In the end, I couldn't do the flowers because I was too upset. The tulips she loved so much ended up being put on top of her coffin. 'We held a memorial service in Derbyshire for all her school friends who couldn't attend her funeral. 'Hundreds of people were there - including former teachers. I knew that Katie was popular but I hadn't appreciated quite what she meant to people.' In the three years since losing her daughter Miss Barker, who was put on a course of antidepressants and received therapy, has found comfort in her bereavement by writing down her experiences for her book, entitled The Angel Whispered. She said: 'I had Katie's ashes interred in her godfather's grave after the funeral. I couldn't bare the thought of her being on her own. I've put a plaque up, and it's helpful to have a place to go where I know she is. 'I just carried myself along for a long time after she died. It was incredibly hard. I can't stand it when the year rolls around to January. 'It's always very difficult to get reminders of that time. 'I'll always carry the pain with me, but by setting my thoughts down on the page it's given me a chance to process what's happened. 'Whenever I felt angry or upset, it was a way of getting through it. 'I can talk about it now without crying, and that's a step forward.' Miss Barker's book, The Angel Whispered, is available on Amazon.","Katie Kozlowska died in January 2011 contracting pneumonia in both lungs .

"By . Sarah Griffiths For Mailonline . Allergy-free nuts could be coming to supermarkets within a few years after scientists found a way to modify the proteins that cause allergic reactions. Researchers are putting the finishing touches to a new method to develop safe cashews and say that other allergy-free nuts are could be developed too. Proteins in nuts trigger a response in allergy sufferers that ranges from mild itching in the mouth or skin, to life-threatening anaphylaxis, which leaves them struggling to breathe. Scientists are developing a new method to create safe cashews and say that other allergy-free nuts are could be in the pipeline. They are changing the shape of proteins found in tree nuts and peanuts that trigger an immune response in people who are allergic to them . Around one in 100,000 people have severe reactions to nuts in Britain and peanuts are the most common cause of fatal allergic reactions to food. The standard advice for people with nut allergies is to avoid the food all together, but this new method could put nuts back on the menu and mean that allergy sufferers won't have to check food labels any more. Speaking at the 248th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in San Francisco, Dr Chris Mattison said: ‘Clinical trials to test immunotherapy are underway, but we're approaching it from an agricultural perspective rather than medical. ‘Can we change the food, instead of treating the person, so we can eliminate or reduce severe reactions?’ His team is looking at ways to modify proteins in tree nuts and peanuts that trigger an immune response in people who are allergic to them. Proteins in nuts trigger a response in allergy sufferers that range from itching to life-threatening anaphylaxis which requires an EpiPen (pictured) The response is launched by antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which recognise and latch onto the proteins. Dr Mattison, a researcher with the Agricultural Research Service branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington DC, said that changing the shape of the proteins makes it harder for IgE to find them. While past research in this area has used harsh chemicals, Dr Mattison sought to achieve results using compounds that are generally regarded as safe (Gras). These substances are accepted by the Food and Drug Administration for use in food and pharmaceuticals. ‘We found that the Gras compound sodium sulphite can effectively disrupt the structure of a couple of the cashew allergens,’ Dr Mattison said . ‘And we've done a couple of different tests to show we reduced IgE binding to the proteins when they've been treated with sodium sulphite.’ The team of scientists plan to conduct experiments on whole nuts and test the modified proteins on cells in the lab to see how they respond. They are also looking at enzymes - molecules that can cut up proteins - as candidates to disrupt the allergens. While the researchers’ work so far focuses on cashew proteins, Dr Mattison is hopeful that the allergenic proteins, Gras compound and enzymes could be applied to make other nuts safer to allergy sufferers. ‘One of our goals is to apply our knowledge from the cashew experiments to other tree nuts and to peanuts,’ he said.

"By . Caroline Mcguire For Mailonline . For centuries, dogs have been man's best friend, whether it was for companionship, hunting or protection. And now 21st century pets are being used to help humans with difficult illnesses to lead a more normal life. Jacob Owens, eight, from Peterborough, struggles with a severe form of autism that makes it difficult to communicate or express feelings in a way that is understood by others. Jacob and his dog Minta, who transformed his life. Until she arrived, the eight-year-old struggled to communicate with other humans. A severe case of autism left him often isolated from others. It that meant for many years, he rarely even smiled and had no friends. Even a trip to the local shops could result in terrible distress, because every aspect of Jacob's life needed to be regimented in order for him to be comfortable. It meant that as the years passed, he led an increasingly lonely and isolated life as contact with new people occurred less frequently. His mum Susan Owens was heartbroken at having to watch her child become so sad and it seemed like there was little they could do to change the situation. She said: 'Jacob was a very lonely little boy who had no friends, it was horrible to see how isolated and lonely he was. 'For the family, it was difficult because everyday life would cause him great distress - even going to the shops. This meant my life had to be regimented to reduce this stress as much as possible.' But everything changed in 2013, when Susan got in contact with the charity Support Dogs. Through its Autism Assistance Programme, they found a Labrador called Araminta, nicknamed Minta, who would become the new family pet. Jacob rarely used to even smile, but since Minta arrived from Support Dogs on the Autism Assistance Programme, the transformation in his personality has been dramatic. In just a short while, the transformation to the whole Owens family was vast. Susan said: 'When Minta entered our family, our lives were changed and the change in Jacob was phenomenal. 'Firstly, there was the difference she made in everyday life. 'Now when we need to go to the shops or want to go on a family day out we tell Jacob that Minta wants to go and he doesn’t become stressed. Before Minta the dog arrived, a simple trip to the shops with his mum Susan (pictured) could cause huge distress to Jacob. But now he's so confident that he's even happy to talk to strangers who ask about his pet . 'Even when Minta is not around, knowing she is close by keeps Jacob happy and calm.' But the biggest plus to having Minta around is the change in Jacob. Susan said: 'Before when we went out in public, Jacob would want to be invisible. 'He would become very distressed if people wanted to talk to him, but now the difference is incredible. 'If people stop to talk to him about Minta, he will happily stand and talk to strangers because he’s proud of her. 'I can’t put into words how incredible this is to watch - to go from wanting to be invisible to growing in confidence in everyday and wanting the world to see you. It’s amazing!' Minty and Jacob are now best friends, with Jacob's mum crediting the dog with being the best medicine in the world. Autism Assistance Dogs are specially trained to help a child become more independent and sociable in a safe way. In special cases like Jacob's dogs are the only way of providing comfort to a child. Susan said: 'Every Jacob needs a Minta - they are best friends. 'If Jacob is sick or sad, she is there, without being told to do this. He loves her and she loves him. Minta is the best medicine.' Jacob and Minta have been part of the Drontal Special Roles campaign, celebrating the nation’s most treasured pets.","Jacob, eight, has severe form of autism, so he struggles to communicate .

"By . Anders Sandberg, The Conversation . Predicting or worrying about disasters is a popular pastime. But when somebody with money at stake becomes concerned, we really start to take notice. Financial people likely sat up when Paul Singer, manager of the Elliott Management hedge fund, warned in his latest newsletter of the risks association with electromagnetic pulses. The Earth has a vast natural magnetic field, courtesy of currents inside its core. As long as it is stable it is not noticeable except for turning compass needles. But if something forced it to move, the shift across miles of cable can induce currents strong enough to burn out fuses or damage transformers . 'Even horrendous nuclear war, except in its most extreme form, can be a relatively localised issue, and the threat from asteroids can possibly be mitigated,' he wrote. 'The risks associated with an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, represent another story entirely.' Electricity and magnetism are tightly linked. Change an electric field – for example by moving charge – and a magnetic field appears. Change a magnetic field – for example by rotating a magnet – and electric fields appear. This is why electromagnets, generators and antennas work. Electromagnetic waves, whether radio, light or X-rays, are just oscillating fields. A sharper change– such as generated by a nuclear explosion - can produce currents that disrupt smaller devices.  In fact, microchips are easily burned out by a few volts in the wrong place . The Earth has a vast natural magnetic field, courtesy of currents inside its core. As long as it is stable it is not noticeable except for turning compass needles. But what if something forced it to move? The change would produce currents in long conductors such as power lines or telecoms cables. The field is weak, but a shift across miles of cable can induce powerful currents, strong enough to burn out fuses or damage transformers and other electronics. A sharper push – such as generated by a nuclear explosion - can produce currents that disrupt smaller devices. In fact, microchips are easily burned out by a few volts in the wrong place. What worries Mr Singer is either naturally occurring geomagnetic storms, caused by the solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field. He is also worried about deliberately produced electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) by nuclear weapons, or so-called e-weapons, devices that have been developed to disrupt enemy electronics. If something causes widespread and persistent black-outs and equipment damage the economic damage – and human problems – would be enormous. Naturally occurring geomagnetic storms, caused by the solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, could damage the Earth's magnetosphere causing widespread blackouts and travel chaos . Could something like this happen? In 1859 a solar storm, the 'Carrington event', named after an amateur astronomer, caused auroras down to the Caribbean, making telegraph systems across the world fail – pylons threw sparks and operators got electric shocks. It is worth noting that telegraphs are simple, sturdy systems compared to today's fine electronics. In 1989, a solar storm blacked out the power grid in Quebec. Small storms, a recent study shows, can cause noticeable bumps in insurance claims for industrial electrical equipment. More recently, a near-miss was reported in July 2012, where Earth dodged a plasma cloud ejected by the sun only by a few degrees. Had it hit, the consequences would be dire. A report from Lloyds emerging risk group has reviewed the evidence. They find that a Carrington-level geomagnetic storm is almost inevitable. There predict there will be one about every 150 years. This poses a threat to regions dependent on electricity. Such storms could cause outages lasting from two weeks to two years. The main problem is the availability of spare transformers. When hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, the main reason power could not be restored on lower Manhattan – despite the obvious wealth of the place – was that ordering replacement transformers takes months. Sandy's worst effects were in a single location. In the case of a big storm, replacements would be needed in hundreds of locations at the same time. Scientists are worried about deliberately produced electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) by nuclear weapons, or so-called e-weapons. These can cause widespread and persistent black-outs and equipment damage . The cost of a Carrington-like event to the US economy would likely cost up to $2.6 trillion (£1.55 trillion). A report by the US National Academies was even more pessimistic, guessing at a higher range and a multi-year recovery. Besides disrupting electricity such storms can also destroy satellites, disrupt GPS navigation and make other parts of the infrastructure fail. Singer is probably right to worry about solar storms. Estimates are that there is a 12 per cent risk over the next decade for a storm bad enough. Fortunately, we can improve our infrastructure when we recognise there is a problem. We can build more resilient systems, have a few back-up transformers in storage and harden devices. This costs money, but it is cheaper than a few weeks without power. What is probably more worrying is the use of electromagnetic pulses created by weapons. This is a real threat, which was discovered the hard way in 1962, when a high-altitude Pacific nuclear test caused electrical damage 870 miles (1,400km) away in Hawaii. In fact, deliberate destruction of enemy power grids using high-altitude detonations soon became part of the strategy of the superpowers. In the case of nuclear war there will no doubt be more things to worry about than just the power grid, but it is worth recognising the threat posed to nearby nations. Electromagnetic fields know no boundaries.. Life has existed on the Earth for billions of years, during which there have been many reversals. There . is no obvious correlation between animal extinctions and those . reversals. Likewise, reversal patterns do not have any correlation with . human development and evolution. It . appears that some animals, such as whales and some birds use Earth's . magnetic field for migration and direction finding. Since geomagnetic . reversal takes a number of thousands of years, they could well adapt to . the changing magnetic environment or develop different methods of . navigation. Radiation . at ground level would increase, however, with some estimates suggesting that overall . exposure to cosmic radiation would double causing more deaths from . cancer. ‘But only slightly,’ said Professor Richard Holme. ‘And . much less than lying on the beach in Florida for a day. So if it . happened, the protection method would probably be to wear a big floppy . hat.’ Electric grid . collapse from severe solar storms is a major risk. As the magnetic field . continues to weaken, scientists are highlighting the importance off-the . grid energy systems using renewable energy sources to protect the Earth . against a black out. 'The very highly charged particles can . have a deleterious effect on the satellites and astronauts,' added Dr . Mona Kessel, a Magnetosphere discipline scientist at Nasa. In one area, there is evidence . that a flip is already occurring. ‘The increasing strength of the South . Atlantic anomaly, an area of weak field over Brazil, is already a . problem,’ said Professor Richard Holme. The . Earth's climate could also change. A recent Danish study has found that . the earth's weather has been significantly affected by the planet's . magnetic field. They . claimed that fluctuations in the number of cosmic rays hitting the . atmosphere directly alter the amount of cloud covering the planet. Henrik . Svensmark, a weather scientist at the Danish National Space Centre who . led the team behind the research, believes that the planet is . experiencing a natural period of low cloud cover due to fewer cosmic . rays entering the atmosphere. Electromagnetic pulses from non-nuclear devices are a real possibility, either based on an explosion compressing a magnetic coil or strong microwave fields. They have so far not been used for terrorism – presumably they are not bloody enough – but several countries have researched it. Do we need to protect ourselves against e-weapons in the future? They are not lethal, the principles to build them are well known and it is not hard to imagine some people thinking they have good reasons for disrupting centres of power, finance or data. So, yes, defence against them would be a good idea. That there are back-up copies and that data centres can be hardened might be less helpful than it looks if everybody needs new computers, networks, phones, cars and printers simultaneously – the disruption could be quite profound. Building more resilient gadgets would be to our advantage. In the end, an electromagnetic disaster might cost trillions, harm millions of people and weaken society – perhaps on a global scale. It is a global catastrophic risk worth reducing. But it does not represent an existential risk just yet. But we are rapidly becoming more dependent on our fragile and vast electrical infrastructure. Some insulation is needed.

A bus carrying the Brazilian national football team has come under attack by protesters who hammered on on its sides while carrying placards protesting against the forthcoming World Cup. The team, including stars such as Neymar, David Luiz and Hulk, were on their way to a training session in Rio de Janeiro when a large group of demonstrators blocked their path - covering the bus in stickers protesting the ever-growing cost of next month's tournament. With the World Cup kicking off in Sao Paolo on June 12, there is increasing concern over how prepared Brazil is to play host, with rumours of violent protests over the coming weeks and stadiums and transport systems that are yet to even be completed, let alone tested.

Desperation: Protestors are against the money being spent by the government on the World Cup . A banner reading: 'There will not be be a cup' was among those being carried by the protesters who bombarded the national team's bus. Security is being beefed up around the country, with 157,000 soldiers and police assigned to keep order during the tournament.

A . fresh wave of protests are expected against the billions shelled out by . the government to host the event - although the authorities don't . anticipate demonstrations as intense as those seen last year . Some police officers have sought to use security worries over the World Cup to pressure for pay raises, staging strikes that brought looting and other chaos. Alongside the security concerns, many are worried that the basic infrastructure in place could cause serious problems, not least because a number of stadiums remain untested, some bus lanes and airports appear unfinished.

Everywhere you look: The World Cup seems to be on everyone's mind as residents of cities around Brazil paint walls with football-inspired graffiti . Anti-World Cup graffiti on the streets of Rio de Janeiro reads: 'Less weapons, Less jails, more schools, peace, more health and demilitarization' High hopes: Brazil legend Ronaldo has said he is 'embarrassed' about the chaos coming from his country . With such a large number of fans, players and officials trying to get around the country on tight deadlines, the transport issues are highly significant, while matches played in stadiums that have never before hosted football matches at full capacity have raised serious safety concerns. Brazil legend Ronaldo is just one of those who has voiced his embarrassment over the problems. 'In 2007 when they decided that the World Cup would be in Brazil, President Lula signed everything and agreed to everything and then they get here and there’s this bureaucracy, total confusion and lateness,' he said. 'It’s a shame. I am embarrassed, this is my country and I love it and we shouldn’t be transmitting this image abroad,' he added. 'But we mustn’t forget that Brazil wasn’t perfect before the World Cup. It was the same or worse,' Ronaldo went on to say.

Archaeologists discovered numerous precious treasures from jade artefacts and musical instruments to life-sized decorated chariots and weapons, which were buried with king Liu Fei in an area of modern day Xuyi County. Liu Fei ruled the kingdom of Jiangdu - part of the Chinese Empire – for 26 years before dying in 128 BC. An elaborate mausoleum that was built for king Liu Fei, who ruled Jiangdu 2,100 years ago, has been unearthed in China. It contains three tombs as well as pits housing the chariots and weapons, where archeologists found more than 10,000 precious artefacts. The tomb of Liu Fei is shown at the bottom of the image . Archaeologists found a second tomb adjacent to the king’s. No one knows who was buried there but they must have been of high status, experts said. Archaeologists found pottery and lacquered objects made of gold and silver, plus jades. A Jade Coffin was the most important discovery. It is the only intact one of its kind ever discovered. A series of 11 tombs were found to the north of the king’s, but they are not thought to contain human sacrifices as this practice had died out by the time the king was buried. They yielded gold belt hooks in the shapes of a goose and a rabbit and one revealed artefacts engraved with the name Nao. Records indicate that Liu Fei had a beautiful consort called Lady Nao, but it is not certain whether the tomb belongs to her or a relative. It is thought that the mausoleum was plundered long ago, but archaeologists still found over 10,000 artefacts, some of which were crafted from gold, silver and jade. Excavations of the mausoleum, which comprises three tombs as well as pits housing the chariots and weapons, took place between 2009 and 2011, LiveScience reported. According to the journal of Chinese Archaeology, a team from Nanjing Museum examined the remains of a well that surrounded the complex, which was built to be 1,608 ft (490 metres) long. They worked quickly to document the site, which they said was at risk from quarrying. A large mound of earth once protected the king’s tomb, which has two shafts leading to a roomy burial chamber measuring 115ft by 85ft (35 by 26 metres). It contained goods fit for a king in his afterlife, the archaeologists explained. This is an image of a chariot-and-horse pit, made of wood, lacquer, bronze, gold and silver, found in one of the pits in the mausoleum where archaeologists found the tomb of Liu Fei. The chariots were among items buried with the ruler that would be helpful in the afterlife . The bronze mat weight (pictured top left) was found in the tomb adjacent to Liu Fei's. It contains inlaid gold, silver and gemstones. A gold rabbit belt hook (pictured right) was also found in one of the tombs . Archaeologists found a second tomb adjacent to the king's. A Jade Coffin (pictured) was the most important discovery. It is the only intact one of its kind ever discovered . Historical texts recount the king's lavish lifestyle, so it came as little surprise to archaeologists that he was buried in such luxurious surroundings. Weapons discovered in the burial chamber included iron swords, crossbows, knives and more than 20 model chariots, alongside instruments such as chime bells and parts for a stringed instrument called a zither. Archaeologists discovered numerous precious treasures from jade artefacts and musical instruments to life-sized decorated chariots, which were buried with king Liu Fei in an area of modern day Xuyi County in Jiangsu (marked on the map) This gilded bronze elephant sculpture, (pictured left) found in Liu Fei's tomb, shows an elephant and its mahout, the person who works with, tends and rides the elephant. During the second century BC China had contact with groups in Southeast Asia where elephants could be found.  Another figurine is of a rhino and his groomer (right) The king's tomb includes musical instruments, such as chime bells (pictured) which were discovered alongside elaborate monster and dragon-shaped rack stands . Because, according to ancient tradition,  the king needed riches in the afterlife, a hoard of 100,000 coins containing a square hole in the centre of each, were buried with him. The banliang coins were made by the first emperor of China. This is the tomb of Liu Fei, the ruler of the Jiangdu kingdom in the Chinese Empire. It is just possible to pick out the different chambers of the tomb . Goose and deer-shaped lamps were discovered in another part of the chamber as well as a silver basin, while another area, set up like a kitchen, catered for the king’s food needs in the afterlife. Cauldrons, wine jars, tripods, jugs and cups were found as well as shells, bones and seeds, suggesting that food was left with the king. Despite the rich selection of artefacts that survived a past plundering, the king’s body was not found in the tomb and his coffins were damaged. ‘Near the coffins many jade pieces and fragments, originally parts of the jade burial suit, were discovered. These pieces also indicate that the inner coffin, originally lacquered and inlaid with jade plaques, was exquisitely manufactured,’ the archaeologists wrote in the journal. Off the main burial chamber, more pits were found housing a jumble of weapons such as swords and shields, as well as two chariot pits. One contains five life-size chariots, made of wood and elaborately decorated with lacquer. Some parts of the vehicles were inlaid with gold and silver. Other looted tombs were also discovered, which could belong to high status individuals. An undamaged ‘jade coffin’ is the only one of its kind to have been found in China. Liu Fei's financial needs, for the afterlife, were provided for with a treasury of over 100,000 banliang coins, (pictured). These coins contain a square hole in the middle and were created when China was unified under the first emperor, who died 210 BC . Off the main burial chamber, more pits were found housing a jumble of weapons such as swords and shields, as well as two chariot pits. Colourful wheels are pictured . Liu Fei's tomb alone contains about 8,000 artifacts, including treasures made of gold, silver, jade and lacquer. Two bronze lamps in the shape of deer (pictured left)  are gilded with gold. A monster-shaped rack stand, (pictured right) made of bronze and inlaid with silver, accompanies the chime bells in Liu Fei's tomb .","Mausoleum belongs to king Liu Fei who ruled the kingdom of Jiangdu, China, before dying in 128BC .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Stuart Broad will follow the example of footballers such as Demba Ba and Paul Gascoigne and wear a protective face mask to ensure that he can play in the final Test at The Oval despite breaking his nose in two places at Old Trafford. The nasty blow Broad took when he top-edged a bouncer from Varun Aaron into the gap between the peak of his helmet and grille during England’s thumping fourth Test win looked to have ruled him out of the series climax. Yet Broad, man of the match at Old Trafford, emerged from a Manchester hospital after missing India’s startling collapse and ruled out reconstructive surgery before insisting he will be fit to play, complete with a mask, on Friday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook salutes victorious England effort . In the wars: Stuart Broad will wear a protective mask in order to play in the final Test against India . Strong look: Paul Gascoigne wears a mask to protect his cheek-bone during a match for Lazio . Personalised: Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba had his initials and squad name printed on his mask last year . Flawed design: The helmet which didn't help Broad . ‘Little bit sore this morning but not too bad,’ tweeted Broad while posting a photo of his face looking very much the worse for wear. ‘Doc did a great job with the stitches. On to The Oval (with a mask).’ It is a boost for England, who on Sunday named an unchanged 13-man squad for their final Test, with Steven Finn retaining his place once it became clear that Liam Plunkett would not return in time from injury. Broad, sublime in India’s first innings at Old Trafford with six for 25, faces an operation on his right knee that will rule him out for four months after this series and desperately wanted to be given the all-clear for The Oval. His injury, on the fastest pitch of the summer, came as he tried to pull the lively Aaron for a third successive six but only succeeded in finding a gap in his modern Ayrtek helmet that will soon be closed by new safety regulations. Broad fell to his haunches and MS Dhoni called for urgent assistance as India’s players quickly forgot the animosity between the sides to ensure that their opponent was not seriously hurt. A smile on Broad’s face as he was led from the field was a sign that he was bruised but unbowed and he later revealed that he watched eight of the nine Indian wickets to fall spectacularly after tea on Saturday from a hospital bed. Impact: Broad top-edged a delivery from Varun Aaron into the gap between the grille and peak of his helmet . VIDEO Cook salutes victorious England effort . Delivery: Analysis of Varun Aaron's 88.1mph bowl . ‘It was a big impact but if there’s no risk we will play him, no doubt about that,’ said England coach Peter Moores. ‘It is a big game at The Oval and we want him there. If that means playing with a football face mask so be it. He will have panda eyes. He will look lovely.’ Clearly England’s medical staff are comfortable that there are no concussion issues with Broad at a time when awareness of the dangers of the condition is increasing, not least because of a Mail on Sunday campaign. Broad’s injury follows that suffered by Somerset’s Craig Kieswetter this summer when he broke his nose and fractured his eye socket after a ball from Northants’ David Willey had managed, like Broad’s, to burst through his visor. Cricketers have often lowered the grille of their helmet if they felt it was restricting their vision but new guidelines are set to outlaw that practice, particularly in light of these incidents. Bristol manufacturer Ayrtek claim to employ a ‘unique air-cushioning impact system’, with the sharper peak of the helmet making it less likely for the ball to get between the grille and lid. But it did when Broad top-edged Aaron. Broken bones: Aaron's delivery crashes into Broad's face during the fourth Test at Old Trafford . Previous: A history of cricket's painful blows . Now a new British safety standard for helmets will limit the ability of players to adjust their protective grille settings, with a maximum of 55 millimetres recommended. The one disappointment for England after their second consecutive huge victory is that their support seamers did not fully grab their big chance in the absence of Broad and with Jimmy Anderson suffering from sickness and off the field for 35 minutes of the last session. Chris Jordan may have ended the Test with two wickets in two balls, and could have had a third had he not overstepped when dismissing Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but he ended up with three wickets in the match while Chris Woakes struck just once, the wicket of Murali Vijay that at least began India’s decline. Neither took a wicket in the third Test win and while England want to provide proper opportunities to young players they will consider bringing in either Finn or Ben Stokes to their final Test team. At least Broad and Anderson will be available to carry on one of the best new-ball partnerships in English history, with Anderson now just eight wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham and becoming England’s leading Test wicket-taker. The perfect English script sees Anderson breaking the record in an Oval victory with Broad not being restricted by his Phantom of the Opera impression.

"By . Jenny Hope . A new ‘smart’ drug for breast cancer extends women’s lives by six months while reducing toxic side effects including hair loss. Campaigners claim the drug offers a ‘precious lifeline’ for women with the most aggressive form of the disease, who have tried other treatments. Known as T-DM1, it combines the ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent. Lifeline: Emma Barnes is trialling the new treatment in Manchester after Herceptin stopped working. It has stopped any new secondary tumours . T-DM1 is designed to seek out and destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage. Results . from a major trial show the drug prolonged the lives of patients with . advanced HER2-positive breast cancer by 30.9 months compared with 25.1 . months on standard therapy. Patients on T-DM1 had fewer, less severe . side effects and reported a better quality of life. The . results were released yesterday at the European Society for Medical . Oncology in Vienna, Austria. Around 10,000 British women have HER-2 . positive breast cancer diagnosed each year – about one in five of those . affected. Paul Ellis, . professor of cancer medicine at King’s College London, said the trial . results were remarkable in patients with advanced  disease who had . relapsed on existing treatment. ‘HER-2 . positive breast cancer is very aggressive and once it progresses to the . “advanced” stage it becomes very difficult to treat,’ he said. ‘These . results are truly outstanding and will positively alter the outlook and . outcomes for patients.’ Professor . Ellis said the drug was possibly the biggest advance since Herceptin . was licensed for use in 2000. ‘T-DM1 contains an extremely potent form . of chemotherapy that’s been around 20 years which we haven’t been able . to use before because it’s so toxic,’ he said. ‘Clever . new technology has allowed these two older drugs to be linked so that . the chemotherapy  is not released until it reaches  the target. ‘Drugs . used at this stage of the disease often make women feel worse, but the . beauty of this treatment is that it costs women fewer side effects such . as hair loss and improves their quality of life.’ Breast cancer screening can catch the disease early. But some forms are aggressive and resistant to treatment. Now a new drug could provide a lifeline . The . international trial recruited 991 patients, including mother-of-two . Emma Barnes, 36, who has been battling HER-2 positive breast cancer for . nine years. She joined the . trial in May 2010 at the Christie Hospital Manchester after developing a . liver tumour and has been having infusions of T-DM1 every three weeks. Although she became resistant to Herceptin after five years of . treatment, the new drug has stopped any new secondary tumours. Breast cancer rates have increased by 90 per cent in the last four decades, figures suggest. In 1971, there were 66 cases for every 100,000 women in England but by 2010 the rate had soared to 126 per 100,000, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest. But the number of women dying from the disease has steadily declined since screening was introduced in 1987. Charity Breast Cancer UK called on the Government to take action to reduce exposure to cancer-causing chemicals. Clare Dimmer, chair of Breast Cancer UK, said: 'This shocking increase in breast cancer rates over just one generation underlines how vital it is that all the root causes of breast cancer are fully explored. 'Whilst death rates from breast cancer have thankfully decreased, still more and more of us are getting the disease. This epidemic is clearly not down to genetics and lifestyle choices alone. 'Breast Cancer UK calls on the Government to finally start tackling the growing health risk associated with our exposure to hazardous chemicals, such as Bisphenol A, that have been scientifically linked to breast cancer as well as many other diseases, and to take action to ban them.' The ONS said that in 2010, 41,259 new cases were diagnosed, 731 more than 2009. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in English women and in 2011 more than 9,700 women died from the disease. ‘I’m . doing most things that I want to do,’ she said. ‘My husband Garry has . been amazing, and the children, but I think the drug’s been fantastic.’ She . has experienced minor side effects but says it’s worth it. ‘I’ve got no . evidence of disease at the moment,’ she added. ‘I hope that every woman . who needs this drug will eventually be able to get it.’ T-DM1 . seeks out and destroys cancerous cells in a two-stage attack. It . attaches to the tumour cell and blocks signals that encourage the cancer . to spread. Then it . breaches the outer defences and releases chemotherapy to destroy it from . within. This spares healthy tissue from unnecessary damage. The . cancer’s return is also delayed and side effects from chemotherapy such . as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced. Professor . Ellis, who also works at Guy’s Hospital, London, said around 1,000 . women a year would benefit from the drug in the UK after relapsing. But . eventually it might be used before the disease spread possibly . replacing current treatment using Herceptin and chemotherapy as separate . agents. It was possible the technology could be effective in treating . other types of tumour. The . drug’s manufacturer, Roche, is applying for a licence in Europe, which . could mean it is available for patients before the end of 2013. The . price is not yet known. Baroness . Morgan, chief executive of the research charity Breast  Cancer . Campaign, said: ‘This “smart” drug could be a precious lifeline for . women with HER2- positive advanced breast cancer who currently have . limited treatment options. We hope it will be made available to women as . early as possible.’ Carolyn . Rogers, senior clinical nurse specialist at another charity, Breast . Cancer Care, said: ‘The trial evaluates a new way of combining . chemotherapy and targeted therapy in one agent which could help delay . the progression of secondary breast cancer as well as reduce the . likelihood of some of the very unpleasant side effects that are . associated with chemotherapy.’","Novel treatment also reduces toxic side effects including hair loss .

"By . Claire Ellicott . A couple who were told their premature baby boy would die if he underwent surgery after being born with four life-threatening heart defects, today hailed their 'miracle' son after he proved doctors wrong to survive. Alfie McAusland, was born three months early  with his main arteries in the wrong . place, a large hole in his heart, a narrowing valve, and unconnected blood . vessels. His parents Natalie and Christopher, from Tullibody in Alloa, Scotland, were told there was no hope for their tiny son. Doctors, who had never encountered this . combination of deadly defects before, advised the couple to let 2lb 6oz . Alfie die naturally as he was too small to survive surgery. Fighter: Alfie in hospital recovering from his 15-and-a-half hour surgery to re-wire his heart (left) and today with his mother Natalie . But Mrs McAusland said 'gut instinct' told her that Alfie was a 'fighter' and she refused to give up on her son. Now, after spending weeks on a . ventilator and just 10 months after a marathon 15-and-a-half hours in . theatre to re-wire his heart, Alfie is like any healthy 18-month-old, . who loves playing with his twin brother Blair. Natalie and Christopher with their twin boys. It was the first day that Alfie (right) and Blair had been brought together at nine weeks old . Mrs McAusland, 33, said: 'He’s a miracle. They said he was too small and would not survive to be big enough to have the surgery. 'It was devastating. They basically said they couldn’t possibly fix his heart and we were advised to let him go. 'As a parent, to be faced with that decision was the worst thing. But we felt it would be an injustice not to give him the opportunity to fight for himself. 'If there was ever someone on the brink of this world and the next, that was Alfie. He didn’t seem to be here nor there. 'Now, sometimes I will look at him and cry without realising it. I’m so proud of how strong he’s been. Even one of the cardiologists refers to him as ‘miracle boy’.' Staff at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Hospital, where he was treated, consulted with surgeons as far a field as Canada before going ahead with the risky operation when he was just eight months old. The surgery was even carefully scheduled to coincide with when his 32-year-old dad was home from his private security work in Iraq. The family’s nightmare began just four days after Alfie and his brother were born 12 weeks premature in Stirling. Scans detected anomalies with his heart and he was taken to Yorkhill, where he was diagnosed with four major defects. Together they left Alfie with an insufficient circulation that put excess pressure on his heart and lungs, which would have eventually resulted in heart failure. Luckily he developed a small obstruction in his heart, which helped restrict the amount of blood that was flooding into his lungs. Alfie on a heart and lung bypass machine immediately after his surgery. He recovered well and no longer needs medication . Mrs McAusland, who has three other children, said: 'He was on and off a ventilator for eight weeks and somehow managed to gain enough strength at 16 weeks to come home for a while. 'There were periods when he would turn blue. He set his apnoea monitor off about a dozen times a night because his breathing was so shallow. 'It was just a case of keeping him stable at home until he was big enough for the surgery. But even at that point there were no guarantees they would be able to do a complete repair.' Alfie was so weak that his mother had to wait three weeks before she got to hold him for the first time, while he was still on a ventilator. At eight months old, however, his condition started to deteriorate. He was so poorly he could barely suckle a bottle. But as he was nearing the target weight of 13lbs, which he had to be to endure the risky operation, surgeons decided to proceed before he became too weak. Full of beans: Alfie (right) now loves to play with his twin brother Blair . Mrs McAusland said: 'He went in [to surgery] at 9am and it wasn’t until half past midnight that we got him back to the intensive care unit. 'Even after the surgery, we were told it was difficult to see anyway out of the situation for him. At that point they had done everything they could for him. But to come that far and be faced with the prospect of burying your baby was devastating. 'I felt guilty because if this was to be the end, it would be a terrible way to die. But I’m glad we took the risk. It’s been worth the gamble.' Alfie had to be hooked up to a heart and lung bypass machine to keep him alive during the surgery.He only came off it two days later when his heart was able to cope with the changes. Alfie was born with transposition of . the great arteries, which meant the vessels taking blood away from the . heart to the lungs and the body were plumbed in the wrong way around. He also had double outlet right . ventricle, which meant there were no blood vessels connected to the . heart’s main pumping chamber to the body. His third defect was ventricle septal defect, which left a large hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles. And he had mitral valve stenosis, a . narrowing of the valve, restricting the flow of blood and causing a . lethal build up of pressure behind it. He also remained on a ventilator for a further six weeks, until he was eventually able to go home. He had to take up to 12 medicines a day. But despite being on and off a ventilator for 14 weeks in total during six months in hospital, Alfie is now off all medication. Alfie may need further surgery in his teens to replace a synthetic valve, which he will eventually grow out of. But Mrs McAusland said: 'We were told if he survived the operation, the world was his. 'He came off all his medicines two weeks ago and now he’s just a normal little boy who loves playing with his brother, rolling around the floor and playing with cars. 'He’s such a happy boy and always got a smile. I’m so proud of him, I’m just bursting with pride. I always knew he was a fighter and the staff at Yorkhill were amazing.' Consultant cardiac surgeon Mark Danton, who performed Alfie‘s operation, said: 'He had quite a complex cardio anatomy that is very rare in public literature. 'The surgical process was quite a long process because of the combination of defects that had to be dealt with. 'We certainly pushed the envelope. He was a challenge. He had a complex combination of conditions, he was premature, and if you put it all down on paper there were a lot of risk factors to cause some anxiety and increase the operative risk. 'There are a lot of uncertainties and unknowns in rare conditions but we are delighted with his recovery. He now has a heart that works like a normal heart. 'His exercise tolerance should be pretty close to normal and I can’t see any reason why he should not have a good outlook.'","Alfie was born three months early with four major heart defects .

"By . Chris Hastings . 22-year-old Joanna Vanderham as Denise Lovett in BBC drama The Paradise . In the hit BBC drama The Paradise, she played plucky Denise Lovett, the Victorian shop girl who defied convention and fell headover-heels in love with her boss. Now, Joanna Vanderham has landed the starring role in an even more celebrated costume drama featuring illicit love across the class divide. The 22-year-old is to follow in the footsteps of Julie Christie and play manipulative society beauty Marian Maudsley in a new BBC adaptation of L. P. Hartley’s classic novel The Go-Between. Published in 1953, The Go-Between’s story of lost innocence starts with the iconic line: ‘The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.’ In the steamy summer of 1900, 13-year-old Leo Colston falls under Marian’s spell when he stays at her Norfolk home. The besotted teenager agrees to act as a go-between and deliver love messages between her and tenant farmer Ted Burgess. At first, Leo has no idea of the nature of Marian’s relationship with working-class Burgess – he is convinced she is in love with Viscount Trimingham, whom she will soon be engaged to marry. But when his role as messenger is discovered, there are disastrous consequences. The 1970 film starred a 30-year-old Christie alongside Alan Bates as Burgess and Dominic Guard as the young Leo. It is considered one of the best British films of all time, and Joanna’s performance is bound to draw comparisons with Christie’s. Joanna said: ‘I am so excited to have been asked to play Marian Maudsley. I hope to bring the spirit of L. P. Hartley’s iconic and wonderful story to life on screen.’ The cast of the new 90-minute drama, which has been adapted by Musketeers writer Adrian Hodges, will also include Shameless star Ben Batt as Burgess, Jack Hollington as Leo, Stephen Campbell Moore as Trimingham and Lesley Manville as Marian’s mother. Last night Ben Stephenson, controller of BBC drama, said: ‘The Go-Between is a compelling story of class, sex and innocence, which this terrific cast will capture in all of its subtlety and power.’ The adaptation is one of four new BBC films celebrating landmarks of English literature. The others will be Laurie Lee’s Cider With Rosie, D. H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover and J. B. Priestley’s An Inspector Calls. The Go-Between will be screened next year.

"By . Carol Driver . and Emma Glanfield . Passengers on Qantas’s Dubai to London flights will continue to fly over Iraqi airspace as the airline reveals it had no plans to reroute the flight. The Australian carrier said based on its latest security assessments it would not be changing the route of its twice-daily A380 flights. It comes after its alliance partner Emirates said it would stop its planes flying over Iraq within the next seven to ten days due to concerns about missile strikes following the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. No plans to change: Qantas has said its Dubai to London flight will still fly over Iraqi airspace . Emirates has decided to re-route planes along different flight paths amid concerns about the dangers posed by Islamic militants on the ground. A Qantas spokesman said the airline regularly reviewed its flight paths and made any adjustments it considered prudent. ‘There is no suggestion that flying over Iraq is unsafe for commercial airlines, particularly given the cruising altitude that most, including Qantas, maintain,’ he said. ‘We will continue to monitor the situation, with safety as our top priority.’ It is understood Qantas's two daily Dubai-London flights fly over Iraq at an altitude of 38,000 to 41,000 feet. Other airlines that were flying over Iraq on Monday included British Airways, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, as well as Emirates, which had yet to change its flight paths, according to FlightRadar24. A spokesman for British Airways said he would not discuss flight plans. He added: 'Our flight plans vary depending on a variety of factors, but our highest and first priority is always the safety of our crew and customers. 'We would never fly in airspace unless we were satisfied that it was safe to do so.' Emirates decided to re-route planes along different flight paths amid concerns about the dangers posed by Islamic militants on the ground. The . above graphic shows the flight paths of a snapshot of planes flying . over Mosul, an ISIS stronghold in Iraq, last weekend. The prospect has . been raised that ISIS has missiles which could shoot down a plane . Sir Tim Clark, president of the Dubai-based airline, said he believed other airlines would soon follow suit as he called for government agencies to offer more advice about flying over conflict zones. The move comes after MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while travelling over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, on July 17. Mr Clark confirmed routes being considered included over Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea, over Cairo and into European airspace, or over Iran. He said he had taken action because he was no longer ‘comfortable’ with planes flying over ISIS-held territory in Iraq. ‘This is a political animal but the fact of the matter is MH17 changed everything, and that was very nearly in European airspace,’ he told The Times. ‘We cannot continue to say, “Well it’s a political thing”. We have to do something. We have to take the bull by the horns.’ Emirates currently operates the largest number of flights over Iraq, with more than 50 a day travelling in and out of British airports. The country lies on the border of the main flight path between Europe and Asia, with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day. A popular route is over the Iraqi city of Mosul, a stronghold of ISIS militants.","Australian carrier has no plans to reroute its twice-daily flight .

"By . Wills Robinson . Major commercial airlines have created a virtual 'no fly' zone' over Ukraine after cancelling or redirecting flights in the wake of the attack on flight MH17. British Airways, KLM and Virgin Atlantic are among the international operators who have altered their journeys after the Malaysia Airlines aircraft was shot down  near the Russia-Ukraine border. The traffic control body Eurocontrol has also advised airlines to avoid the area as a safety precaution. Scroll down for video . Avoiding the area: A map from airline tracker FlightRadar24, shows that a large number of planes (highlighted in yellow) have been diverted away from Ukrainian airspace . Airliner tracking sites, including FlightRadar24, are indicating that traffic is now steering clear of Ukrainian airspace. Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Alitalia and Delta have also diverted their services while German providers Lufthansa said they were taking a 'wide detour' around the region. A  spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: 'The Ukrainian authorities are responsible for managing their airspace and the UK or other countries cannot enforce airspace restrictions in the area. 'However, the CAA has previously issued advice to UK airlines on operating in this area and following this incident, Eurocontrol (the European air traffic control body) has issued advice to airlines to plan routes that avoid the area.' A British Airways spokesman said the only flight that would be flying in the area was the daily service between Heathrow and Kiev. 'The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority.' they said. 'Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace with the exception of our once-a-day service between Heathrow and Kiev. We are keeping this service under review but Kiev is several hundred kilometres from the incident site.'

Budget airlines Ryaniar and Easyjet have not been affected as they do not use Ukrainian air space. Delta tweeted: 'Out of an abundance of caution, Delta is not routing flights through Ukrainian airspace.' Many airlines had continued to use the route despite warnings not to because of the fighting, said Norman Shanks, former head of group security at airports group BAA and professor of aviation security at Coventry University in England. 'It is a busy aviation route and there have been suggestions that a notice was given to aviators telling airlines to avoid that particular area,' Shanks said. 'But Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money.'","British Airways, KLM, Emirates and Virgin have all redirected services .

The decision was backed up in a referendum the followed on May 11, although tt has not yet been officially recognised as a separate republic by any foreign country.

"By . Wills Robinson . An airstrike which demolished an apartment block in eastern Ukraine has killed at least 11 civilians. The four-story building in Snizhne, a town in the rebel-dominated Donetsk region, appeared to have been hit by two missiles which wiped out several tiers at once. The attack adds to the hundreds of casualties who have died during the pro-Russian insurgency over the last four months. Debris: Rescue workers remove debris at a collapsed apartment which was wiped out by airstrike  in Snizhne, 60 miles east of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine . Rescue workers managed to pull one small child with broken legs alive from the rubble. Government officials denied claims that the attack was carried out by Ukraine's air force, but did not say who was to blame. The Defense Ministry insisted the bombing could not have been carried out by the air force as none of its planes were deployed at the time of the strike. Ukraine's Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko called the incident a 'cynical and bloody provocation' aimed at discrediting the armed forces. No official death toll has been produced, but hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed to date. Authorities believe 258 servicemen have been killed in fighting and 922 injured. The separatist Luhansk People's Republic said that 12 more civilians were killed Monday evening in the eastern city of Luhansk following rocket attacks and airstrikes. It was not immediately possible to verify those claims. On Monday, Ukraine said one of its military transport planes carrying eight personnel was shot down by a missile fired from Russian territory. Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said there was 'unconditional evidence' that Russia was involved in downing the craft. Defense Ministry representatives initially suggested all those on the plane had survived and been accounted for. The ministry updated its account to specify that while four on the plane were evacuated, another two were taken captive by rebels and that the whereabouts of two more is unknown. In the last two weeks, the government has halved the territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists, who have been forced back into the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Many in the armed insurgency are known to be Russian nationals, but Moscow says they are simply citizens who went to fight in Ukraine on their own. Victim: Igor Chernetsov, whose wife was killed in the strike, raises his arm to clean-up workers near his house . Rubble: People carry out computers buried in the debris from the collapsed building . Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of involvement in attacks on its troops and supplying rebels with weaponry. Lysenko said Ukrainian border guards came under gunfire from inside Russian territory. He did not specify that he believed Russia to be directly responsible for the attack. Moscow has in turn accused Ukraine of shelling a border town inside Russia, killing one person. But Ukraine has denied firing shells onto foreign soil. A delegation of international military attaches and reporters Tuesday visited the site of the shelling, in the Russian border town of Donetsk, in what a senior Russian Defense Ministry official termed an 'act of good will.' Officials showed a residential building damaged by the rocket and a series of craters next to a border crossing .

Grand . plans: A multi-billion dollar canal expansion will include locks that . are as wide as 180ft and can accept much larger container ships . The latest setback in the canal's . expansion came in May, when about 5,000 laborers walked off the job for . two weeks as part of a strike over wages by construction workers . nationwide. That . followed a two-week stoppage in February in a dispute over $1.6billion . in extra costs between the canal's administrator and the European . contractor building a third new set of locks. Meanwhile, a Chinese firm was recently awarded a contract to build a $40billion (£23billion) waterway . through Nicaragua, around 420 miles north. The 173-mile waterway would stretch from Punta Gorda on the Caribbean through Lake Nicaragua to the mouth of the river Brito on the Pacific; the path initially favored by 19th century American . engineers. While just a threat on paper for now, Panamanian authorities . have responded with the possibility of digging a fourth set of locks to . maintain dominance. Because of the interruptions and . overspending, the canal's original completion date of this October has been . pushed back by 14 months and analysts say more delays can't be ruled . out. Journey: The work, which began in the country in September 2007 and is the largest project at the canal since its construction, was due to be finished this year . Vessel: But it has been delayed by 14 months after becoming beset by problems, including cost overruns, strikes and the threat of competition from a Chinese rival route.

Left, Two Panama Canal workers paddle in their small boat near a cargo ship sailing through the Miraflores Locks and, right, an aerial view of the Miraflores station . Attraction: Locals wave and take photos as a ship passes through the Miraflores locks on the Panama Canal in January this year . The . construction of the 48-mile ship canal across the Isthmus of Panama a . century ago transformed international trade, greatly reducing travel . time between the Atlantic and the Pacific by eliminating the need for . ships to go around the tip of South America. The construction claimed . the lives of an estimated 30,000 workers, many from diseases like . malaria and yellow fever. As . part of the £3billion expansion project, wider locks with mechanical . gates will reduce congestion and be able accommodate post-Panamex . vessels, which are as long as three football fields and have the . capacity to carry about 2.5 times the number of containers than held by . ships currently using the canal. Canal . administrator Jorge Quijano acknowledges he would have liked to finish . the expansion in time for Friday's centennial. 'But we knew from the . beginning a project as complex as this wouldn't necessarily be done on . time', he said. However, not . everyone is as understanding. Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou . complained about the delays during a recent visit to Panama, saying they . affect his country's trade with the United States. Rivalry: A Chinese firm was recently awarded a contract to build a $40billion (£23billion) waterway through Nicaragua, around 420 miles north of the Panama Canal . A century old: Panama is currently undertaking a massive canal expansion project, with hopes of having an additional traffic lane completed in 14 months . Grand opening: The canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and revolutionised maritime travel and trade, first opened on August 15, 1914 . Two major cargo . shippers, Denmark's Maersk and Taiwan's Evergreen, have already rerouted . part of their operations, depriving the canal of about $80 million a . year, Quijano says. When . funding for the expansion was approved by a referendum in 2006, its . completion was envisioned as a coming out party for Panama, a chance to . showcase the country's pro-business credentials and role as a linchpin . of global commerce. But . competition is lurking. In addition to the proposed waterway through Nicaragua, Egypt is embarking on an expansion of the Suez . Canal. Reflecting . the more subdued mood, President Juan Carlos Varela opposed suggestions . that the centennial be declared a national holiday. 'The anniversary is . best celebrated by working,' he told journalists recently. 'Panama . already has plenty of free days.' Varela . didn't attend a low-key ceremony held at the Miraflores locks Friday . morning. About 100 people, including canal workers, showed up to wave . flags and greet cargo ships as they passed by, while a school band . played patriotic songs. Think big: Panama has even toyed with the idea of developing a fourth set of mechanical locks, which would further increase the canal's travel capacity . Early days: During construction, French workers used dredging machines to dig. The canal's expansion will allow for dredging boats to now travel the waterway . Panamanians . will celebrate their canal's anniversary with an evening of fireworks . and a free concert by salsa crooner Ruben Blades, before a 500-pound cake will . be served to hundreds of VIPs. Descendants of French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, the canal's flamboyant first developer, are expected to attend. So . are relatives of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, whose enthusiasm . for the 'big ditch""'spurred the isthmus to proclaim its independence . from Colombia in 1903 and sign a treaty granting perpetual control of . the future waterway and adjacent 550-square mile canal zone to the . United States. Nostalgia . for those earlier days runs deep in Paraiso, or Paradise in English, a . village on the canal's Pacific Ocean entrance where blue U.S. mailboxes . recall a vibrant, bygone era when it was part of the canal zone. While . Panama has prospered in the past decade, taxi driver Carlos Bennett . said the benefits haven't been shared widely. Like many Panamanians, . he's counting on the canal expansion to lift the nation's welfare but is . concerned that the recent stumbles could backfire. Malaria and yellow fever ran rampant during construction with nearly 30,000 workers losing their lives on the project . In 1942, a new set of locks were added near Panama City, where the bulk of the 100th anniversary celebrations will take place . 'The . anniversary should've been the moment to celebrate the expansion . project, that all of Panama needs urgently,' said Mr Bennett, the . grandson of a canal worker who emigrated from the British Virgin . Islands. 'We can't afford the luxury of looking like we're incapable to the rest of the world.' Linking . the Isthmus of Panama, the canal eliminated the need for ships to go around the . dangerous waters along South America's tip, reducing fuel costs and . travel times. Despite . the subdued anniversary, each Saturday in August, 'Magical Nights at . the Panama Canal,' will open to the public from 6 to 10pm and will . include fireworks, live music, and dancing, as well as historical . costumed characters.","The 48-mile ship canal, situated in Panama, Central America, celebrated the 100th anniversary of its opening today .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . U.S. Senator John McCain said Thursday that there would be 'hell to pay, and there should be,' if Russian forces or pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine were behind the missile attack that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight 17. 'This was an airliner headed towards Russian airspace,' the Arizona Republican said on MSNBC. 'And it has the earmarks – and I'm not concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian.' 'If that's true, this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are. And there will be incredible repercussions if this is the case.' 'If it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly believing that this is a Ukrainian warplane,' McCain warned, 'I think there's going to be hell to pay and there should be.' Scroll down for video . McCain unleashed: The hawkish senator warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if Russia or its proxies were responsible for downing a passenger plane . A Russian 'Buk' air defense missile like this one is believed to have shot down Malaysian Airlines flight 17, with Russia and Ukraine pointing fingers of blame at each other . The senator's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds of luggage, airplane sections and even human remains in a nine-mile debris field where the Boeing 777 went down Thursday. He also told host Andrew Mitchell that President Barack Obama has mishandled the Ukraine crisis by going soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin and refusing to arm Ukrainian government forces. 'The United States – it has been insulting in how small and how little help we have given,' he complained. 'I mean, they have been begging us for defensive weaponry [but] we have not given it to them.' He also slammed the White House for the shallowness of economic sanctions the U.S. has pushed on Moscow after Putin annexed a region of Ukraine that was populated mainly by ethnic Russians. 'The sanctions so far in exchange for Crimea have been minuscule,' said McCain. 'These latest enacted by the Obama administration, I think, are helpful. But if you ask the Ukrainian government that's struggling, they said they need weapons [with] which to defend themselves.' Earlier in the day McCain went directly after Putin, telling Roll Call that if the plane was fired on by 'separatists, which are also Russian, Vladimir Putin should be paying a heavy price.' He also cautioned that it was too soon to know for sure what happened as the aircraft, carrying 295 souls between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, flew at 32,000 feet over the easternmost part of Ukraine and nearly into Russian airspace. Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) talked to Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev after word reached Moscow of the attacked aircraft . Wreckage: Firefighters contained blazes at the site of the crash near the town of Shaktarsk, in rebel-held east Ukraine . Putin on Thursday called the idea of Russian government involvement in the plane's destruction 'stupiditry' and blamed Ukraine. 'This tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land,' he said, at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.' 'And without question, the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.' U.S. officials said Thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile. The Associated Press reported that Soviet-era 'Buk' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist fighters.","Hawkish GOP senator threw down the gauntlet and warned Vladimir Putin .

"By . Daniel Mills . Four Victorian teenagers who spent nearly 36 hours glued to a popular video game have smashed a Guinness World Record for their marathon session. The youths, form Warnambool in south-west Victoria, claimed the feat previously held by a group of German teenagers after carefully planning their game play, allocated breaks and eating habits which included strategically stuffing bottles of water, snacks and sandwiches underneath their chairs so that they were easily accessible. Played in the hall of the teenagers' high school, at least one of the four were required to be manning the controls at any one time, and only after every hour could they take a 10 minute break. The teenagers lasted a marathon 35 hours and 46 minutes in front of the popular video game Mario Kart . Justice of the Peace scouts where required to log the quartet's playing time inside a hall at Brauer College Warrnambool High School . Harry said there was enough sunlight beaming through in the daylight hours for the teenagers to keep their vitamin D levels maintained . Harry Twyford, 17, told Daily Mail Australia the quartet had to film footage of them playing the popular video game Mario Kart and have qualified scrutineers such as Justices of the Peace keeping log of their 'longest video game marathon playing a racing game.' Mario Kart was the game of choice for the record breaking effort . 'We had witnesses came in every few hours who signed logbooks,' he said. 'We got sore eyes but had eye drops that helped, and I kept a food supply under the chair with water bottles and sandwiches trying to just keep them healthy.' Harry, who spent one of the longest periods in front of the video game, lasted a 15-hour stretch in which he saved up is hourly-rest increments for a midnight nap. He was helped by friends James Hickman, Josh Alexander and Matt Smith who all helped conquer the Guinness record which started at 8am on Friday and finished at 7.45pm on Saturday night. Harry said the idea came about when he was reading a record book and felt the urge to want to break one of his own. The record attempt was for a racing-style game and Harry, the brainchild behind the idea, chose the popular multi-player game Mario Kart . He said it was 'easy picking a team' because the four or share an interest in video games, and in particular, an interest in the popular multi-player version Mario Kart that pits opponents against one another on various racing circuits. He said It took hours of practice and plenty of concentration, but the four managed to ward-off the onset of illness to take out the German-held record which was previously 30 hours long. The marathon session was watched by family and friends inside the Brauer College at Warrnambool and the four even managed to raise $500 for a new cancer centre which is being built in the Victorian town. Responding to criticism on Facebook about their achievement, Harry said the record took six months of hard work and planning to achieve. 'You may be thinking we're a bunch of slackers, bludgers and lazy students, when as a matter of fact this was an incredibly difficult thing to achieve which required assistance from copious amounts of individuals in the community,' he told ABC.","Four teenagers claimed the German record in 35 hours, 46 minutes .

"By . Harriet Hernando . As bow ties are plumped and hair is coiffed for this evening’s First Night of the Proms, an orchestra will be preparing to play Elgar’s biblical oratorio The Kingdom. But that isn’t the only curtain raiser, for today the home where Edward Elgar composed some of his finest pieces goes on the market for £2.25 million. The 18th century four-bedroom house just outside of Bray in Berkshire saw Elgar labour over the oratorio and part of his Cello Concerto. Stunning: The Mansion near Bray in Berkshire, which saw Elgar compose some of his finest pieces, is on sale for £2.25 million . Riverside: The Berkshire mansion's gardens are set beside the River Thames . Historic: the swimming pool was formerly the music room where English composer Elgar wrote his Cello Concerto and The Kingdom . A historic blue plaque marks the gated entrance to the Berkshire mansion where Elgar composed music. The home belonged to his close friend Frank Schuster, a patron of the arts . A historic blue plaque by the gated entrance marks his time in the mansion, stating that ‘he often stayed and composed in this house’. The present resident is Pauline Turner, a humanist celebrant who has been there for five years. Earlier, the home was owned by Miss Van de Weyer, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria who regularly stopped by for afternoon tea. The sale of the home will likely cause a sit among Elgar fans, who have visited the mansion over the years to see where he worked. Sir Edward William Elgar was an an English composer who achieved international fame in the classical music arena. His best known compositions include the Enigma Variations and the Pomp and Circumstance Marches concertos for violin and cello. Born on June 2 , 1857, Elgar was  the son of a music shopkeeper and piano tuner in provincial Worcester, and brought up as a Catholic. He received practical training as a performer on the violin and other instruments, and taught himself composition. In Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion and he became an outsider. He did however attain national prominence in 1899 when his ‘Enigma’ Variations premiered in London. His next major work, the oratorio The Dream of Gerontius, quickly became successful in Britain and Germany. A decade followed which saw the composition of two further oratorios, The Apostles and The Kingdom and a stream of orchestral works culminating in the First Symphony and the Violin Concerto. When his wife died, Elgar, who had been living in London, moved back to the West Midlands. He was working with renewed energy on an opera and a Third Symphony when he died in 1934. There was . the time when a crew of Norwegian sailors arrived, out of the blue and . via the river Thames, dressed in naval costumes. They . sang Rule, Britannia! and staged a trumpet call outside what was the . music room , then toasted the moment with shots of schnapps. As they left the house via the Thames on their rowing barge they raised their oars in salute as they sailed past. Elgar . would sit in the music room, which is now the swimming pool, and compose . music that he would perform in front of an audience that included . Gabriel Faure, George Bernard Shaw, Dame Nellie Melba, Siegfried Sassoon . and Arnold Benett. Al fresco: A patio overlooks the manicured lawn belonging to the Berkshire mansion which Savills put up for sale today . Original: The leaded windows are some of the original features which still remain in the 18th century mansion . Roomy: The mansion is known for its high ceilings and open spaces . Open plan: While a new kitchen has been fitted since Elgar's days, the house clearly retains some of the 18th century features such as the leaded windows in the background . The property, called Long White Cloud, which was owned by Eldgar’s close friend Frank Schuster, was a regular haunt of the legendary composer in the early 20th century. In 1906 he came up with The Kingdom and, four years later, worked on his Violin Concerto. The house was named Long White Cloud, which is the Maori name for New Zealand, by a more recent resident, Stirling Moss. Mr Moss, 84, is a former Formula One racing driver from England. Stirling Moss, 84, is a former Formula One driver who raced for England. He was a top racer but never quite managed to get it over the line, becoming known as 'the greatest driver to never win the World Championship' by sports commentators. Moss was raised in Long White Cloud by his father Alfred, who was a dentist, and his mother Aileen. His sister Pat was also gifted behind the wheel and she became a successful rally driver. Moss, who raced from 1948 to 1962, won 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 Formula One Grand Prix. He would compete in as many as 62 races in a single year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his racing career, including Cooper 500, ERA, Lotus, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Aston Martin, Maserati, Ferrari and Jaguar. He remained the English driver with the most Formula One victories until 1991 when Nigel Mansell overtook him after competing in more races. He now lives in West Kensington, London. It was his family home and he drove his first racing car around the track in the grounds of the property as a boy. The Mosses owned the home until 1959 and in 1963 the estate was sold and split up into two homes. Spread across 4,840 sq ft, it has five bedrooms, four reception rooms, an indoor swimming pool and a 32ft drawing room. It still contains many of the original features including leaded light windows and ornate fireplaces. Fiona Copeman, an associate director at Savills estate agents, said: ‘Long White Cloud is a historic home set within idyllic riverside gardens. ‘We've had quite a lot of interest in the property and already had six viewings.

"By . Tim Shipman . Intelligence obtained from a secret US eavesdropping operation helped prevent terror attacks at the 2012 Olympics, it was revealed yesterday. William Hague defended collaboration between Britain’s GCHQ agency and the National Security Agency in America as a ‘cornerstone’ of national security that had protected London. The Foreign Secretary dismissed as ‘baseless’ claims that British spy chiefs have used the American espionage programme Prism to circumvent UK law and snoop on emails and phone calls. Scroll down for video . Defence: Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague today defended British spy agencies, including GCHQ, against claims they used data from the US to circumvent UK law . But he admitted personally approving ‘hundreds’ of intelligence missions ‘every year’ – many of them involving US spies. Ed Snowden – a former CIA man and whistleblower who has fled to Hong Kong – claims the NSA has had access to data held by nine of the world’s top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Skype. But Mr Hague told the Commons yesterday all intelligence obtained from America is subject to British law with approvals from a Cabinet minister, overseen by the Intelligence Commissioner. In a robust defence of British spy chiefs, Mr Hague described ties between GCHQ and the NSA as ‘a relationship that is unique in the world’. ‘This relationship has been and remains essential to the security of both nations, has stopped many terrorist and espionage plots against this country, and has saved many lives,’ he told MPs. ‘We have experienced an extremely busy period in intelligence and diplomacy in the last three years. The growing and diffuse nature of threats from terrorists, criminals or espionage has only increased the importance of the intelligence relationship with the United States. ‘This was particularly the case in the run to the Olympics. Our activity to counter terrorism intensified and rose to a peak in the summer of last year.’ The Prime Minister was challenged about the work of GCHQ on a visit to the new London Gateway container port which is under construction on the River Thames  near Tilbury in Essex . Mr Hague did not specifically credit . Prism with saving the Olympics from a terror strike, but a senior . security source told the Mail the Prism programme ‘was an important . component of our counterrorism preparations ahead of the Olympics’. The Foreign Secretary added: ‘It has . been suggested GCHQ uses our partnership with the United States to get . around UK law, obtaining information that they cannot legally obtain in . the UK. I wish to be absolutely clear that this accusation is baseless. ‘Any data obtained by us from the US involving UK nationals is subject to proper UK statutory controls and safeguards.’ But David Blunkett, the Labour former home secretary, suggested the rules were not tight enough and that if the US offered intelligence to the UK, rather than it being requested, no ministerial warrant was required. The Foreign Secretary declined to spell out details of how Britain uses Prism, saying he would not comment on leaks. Fanciful: Downing Street today dismissed the idea that staff at Cheltenham-based GCHQ worked to find ways to circumvent the law . Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former CIA technical assistant, claims GCHQ compiled 197 dossiers on UK citizens based on information from the US spying project Prism . He insisted British law does not . allow ‘indiscriminate trawling through peoples’ communications’. But he . made clear that terrorists and organised crime bosses ‘cannot rely on . their privacy’ being preserved. Parliament’s intelligence and security committee, headed by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, will receive a full report from GCHQ today on Prism. Leaked documents suggest the programme helped produce 197 intelligence reports last year. A group of civil liberties campaigners accused ministers of using the sort of justifications for monitoring ‘we might expect from China, not the UK’. Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) is to give a statement to the Commons today while Sir Malcolm Rifkind's Intelligence and Security Committee will carry out a visit to Washington this week to meet representatives from the CIA and NSA . In a joint statement, Index on . Censorship, English PEN, and Open Rights Group said: ‘Mass surveillance . chills freedom of expression and undermines our fundamental rights to . freedom of expression and privacy.’ Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty said: . ‘The Foreign Secretary’s statement to Parliament is most revealing for . what he refused to reveal. He evaded specific questions as brazenly as . his agencies have apparently avoided legal scrutiny. ‘Reports to a secret committee are a . start but the public won’t be satisfied without greater honesty and . legal protection from those who compromise our freedoms in freedom’s . name.’ By James Slack . Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, police and the security services can access a wide variety of communications data. At the lower level, this can include records of who a person was calling or texting, but not the content of the call. The current row is focussed on a far more intrusive level of surveillance: the actual contents of internet telephone calls, emails and postings on social networking sites. The security services and police already have far-reaching powers to monitor this sensitive information, provided they get a ministerial warrant. The issue is over what happens when the intelligence agencies know a terror suspect is using new internet technologies, based overseas, which they currently find extremely difficult to access. In this scenario, and assuming the U.S. can carry out the surveillance, it’s inevitable that the UK’s spies will wish to ask their closest ally for help. The key question is would it be legal for the British agents to do the work themselves, were they able to do it? If the answer is yes, GCHQ – on behalf of the British intelligence services – will submit a request to the NSA. The results can then be shared with MI5 and MI6.","Edward Snowden, a former CIA technical assistant, leaked details of Prism .

"By . Lucy Thackray . 'A loving mentor': Philomene Tiernan was on the MH17 flight when it was shot out of the sky by suspected terrorists . Sister Philomene Tiernan spent her life inspiring the young girls she oversaw at a girls' high school in Sydney. As news of the tragic MH17 flight broke, it soon became clear the dedicated Catholic nun was among the 28 Australians on board who lost their lives when the plane was shot out of the sky over Ukraine. Here her former student, Daily Mail Australia reporter LUCY THACKRAY, gives a first-hand account of what made her favourite mentor so special..... 'Sister Philomene Tiernan was one of those all-too-rare people that made everyone she met feel special. We knew her as Sister Phil and she was the kindest person I'm sure I will ever come across. She was the loving Nanna of Kincoppal-Rose Bay school in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, who seemed to possess an inbuilt radar for any homesick girl who had just arrived at the boarding school. Sister Phil had that special ability to make us all feel at home. This is undoubtedly the hardest thing I've ever had to write, and I think that’s because I just don’t feel my words can do justice to what an amazing woman she really was. Sister Phil was cherished by so many people. Today, I am in complete shock and at a loss for a woman that had such a huge impact on thousands of girls who passed through the big school gates. Sister Phil never stopped working. She had once been a Director of Boarding and boarding mistress, responsible for caring for the boarders who came to the school from around the world. Scroll down for video . 'Inspiration': Philomene Tiernan, pictured left, was a mentor at Kincoppal-Rose Bay Girls' School in Sydney. Lucy Thackray, pictured right, is one of the many students she oversaw during her time at the institution . Dedicated: Philomene Tiernan, pictured centre with former colleagues, was a boarding mistress and responsible for caring for those who boarded at the school . But the truth is she never really left the boarding school. She would walk through the dormitories making sure every one of the 150 girls was fine. Today, the outpouring of grief from the school’s extensive community is not just from the recent kids, but from their mothers and no doubt grandmothers as well. 'Her warm smile never left her face': 'Sister Phil', pictured with the headmistress of the school Hilary Johnston-Croke, was a caring and nurturing guide . She had an unwavering ability to know where everyone lived, how many siblings they had, and even the name of their favourite biscuit. How she stored all that information about those hundreds of girls is honestly a mystery. Her last role was in religious guidance, giving prayer sessions for the girls, and offering spiritual comfort to those in need. She made every single one of them feel special. Sister Phil was such a crucial part of the school for so many years and it's impossible to think of the community without her. In 2011, two years after I graduated, I went back to the school as a tutor. Sister Phil saw me in the library and gasped as if one of her own daughters had just come home. It was the same every time I saw her - the same excitement and joy that I know she shared with everyone. She would envelop you in a big hug whenever she saw you and would kindly pat your wrist as you babbled on to her about your latest news. 'Well, isn't that wonderful!' she'd say earnestly. 'Oh darling, I am so proud, aren't you doing well!' It didn't matter if she had somewhere to be. She would sit and listen and every time you felt truly enriched by that experience. She had a warm smile that never left her face and a wonderful sense of humour that comes only from a genuine love of life. Final goodbye: Lucy Thackray, pictured far left in 2009 when she graduated from Kincoppal Rose Bay, has paid an emotional tribute to her former mentor . She connected with everyone she came across. Generations of Kincoppal alumni are hurting now that someone who only gave love to the world could be taken like this. It's days like this when you really realise that karma doesn't exist. If it did, why would tragedy ever choose Sister Phil? Philomene Tiernan was on her way back to Australia from France when her plane crashed, killing everyone on board . Her entire existence was to bring good into this world. But she gave unwavering guidance and taught people that faith in God, in themselves, and in the world would carry you through the journey. All morning I'd been thinking how tragic the MH17 crash was, but it wasn't until I heard Sister Phil's name called out in the newsroom that it all became real. This hideous crash that I'd been hearing about all morning wasn't halfway across the world, it was suddenly brought home. A Sister of the Society of the Sacred Heart, Sister Phil was on her way home from Joigny in Burgundy, France, where the society was founded. While in Paris, I am told she saw Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat in her resting place at St Francis Xavier Church, which was a special moment for her. I hope that this experience had brought her joy. Sister Phil has lived a meaningful, beautiful life and leaves such a huge mark on the world. I hope that everyone touched by her, particularly those from Kincoppal-Rose Bay, finds strength in the messages and guidance that Sister Phil gave us all. Thank you, Sister Phil. Rest in Peace.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A 50-year-old Ferrari which is one of only three of its kind and described as one of the iconic car maker’s most important models is expected to sell for a whopping £20million. The 1965 handbuilt Ferrari, which has mainly been used as a road car even though it was designed to compete at motorsport events, can reach a top speed of 170mph. Despite it selling at auction for less than £1million in the mid-1990s, it is now expected to fetch £20million when it goes under the hammer in California next month. The 1965 handbuilt Ferrari, which has mainly been used as a road car even though it was designed to compete at motorsport events, can reach a top speed of 170mph . The 50-year-old grey Ferrari 275 GTB/C Speciale is one of only three of its kind and has been described as one of the iconic car maker's most important models . Despite being designed to compete at motorsport events, the sports car has mainly been used as a road vehicle over the years and was once owned by a British colonel . The stunning grey 275 GTB/C Speciale, known as 06701, was owned by an English colonel in 1970s. It is made from super-lightweight aluminium and powered by a V12 engine which develops around 300bhp. There are only two other models exactly like it, and it is thought both of those may never go onto the open market again.

At one point, the car was owned by Ferrari collector, Brandon Wang who showed it off at various competitive events, including the International Festival at Goodwood, Tutte Le Ferrari in Mugello and the 1997 Tour Auto . The Ferrari’s first owner was a businessman who used it as a road car before selling it on to its next owner, who kept and maintained the vehicle for 25 years. It was later passed onto Ferrari collector, Brandon Wang, who showed it off at various competitive events, including the International Festival at Goodwood, Tutte Le Ferrari in Mugello and the 1997 Tour Auto. Following a restoration which saw the car refinished in its current two-tone silver and grey color scheme - throwback to its original colour scheme - the car was passed on to its current owner. The Ferrari 275 GTB/C Speciale will go under the hammer in Monterey, California over the weekend of August 15-16.","The 1965 handbuilt Ferrari sold at auction for £1million in the mid-1990s but is now expected to fetch up to £20million .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . The Church of England was in turmoil last night after its firm opposition to assisted dying began to crumble following the intervention of Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. As the Church’s rejection of the right to die was challenged by more senior Anglicans, CofE leaders called for a proposed law change to be delayed so a Royal Commission could subject the issue to high-level public debate. The argument over assisted dying has joined same-sex marriage and women bishops as key sources of division for Anglicans. Archbishop . of Canterbury Justin Welby, left, warned a proposed new law on assisted dying . is ‘mistaken and dangerous’, but his predecessor Lord Carey, right, insists it . would not be ‘anti-Christian’ to change the law . The debate burst into the open on . Saturday when Lord Carey wrote in the Mail that helping someone who is . in great pain to die was in keeping with Christian belief. He . said it was not anti-Christian to believe terminally ill people should . be allowed to die with dignity. On the same day, however, the Archbishop . of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said he would oppose a Bill to legalise . assisted dying put forward by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord . Falconer. Archbishop Welby . said it would leave a ‘sword of Damocles’ hanging over the elderly, . putting them under pressure to end their lives. Yesterday . Lord Carey’s views were supported by Desmond Tutu, the former . Archbishop of Cape Town, who said he wanted to focus on ‘dignity for the . dying’. In an article in the Observer, he wrote: ‘I revere the sanctity of life – but not at any cost.’ Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu says he would not like his life to be 'prolonged artificially' Lord . Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill would require patients to administer the . poison themselves. It  would not help those who are paralysed or lack . the capacity to operate a mechanism to inject the drugs. Existing . rules effectively mean no relative or friend will be prosecuted for . aiding a suicide if it is done out of compassion and not for gain. But . they ban British doctors taking any role in a death. Falconer’s . Bill would enable doctors to help a patient die by prescribing deadly . drugs if they are  terminally ill and expected to die within six months. The patient would have to be over 18 and to have lived in England or Wales for at least a year. Two . doctors would have to certify the patient was terminally ill and it was . their informed wish to die. The patient would also have to signify . their consent. There would be 14 days before drugs were provided, or six . days if death was expected within a month. The . man described as the ‘moral conscience of South Africa’ condemned as . ‘disgraceful’ how Nelson Mandela was kept alive by gruelling hospital . treatment. Lord Falconer said . Lord Carey’s article was ‘profoundly significant’, adding: ‘It seemed to . me to express views held by very many committed Anglicans. It provided . real leadership for the alternative view. He made absolutely clear that . there is no Christian reason to oppose assisted suicide. ‘I . respect the views of those who oppose. The significance of the Carey . and the Tutu interventions is that there is nothing anti-Christian about . supporting assisted dying.’ He added that he worried critics of the . Bill would try to scupper it when it is debated in the House of Lords on . Friday. He told The Guardian: . ‘I fear that somebody may put a wrecking amendment down. That finishes . it off for that session. I am urging all my supporters to come on Friday . to vote down such a motion.’ The Bishop of Buckingham, the Right . Reverend Alan Wilson, yesterday became the first serving bishop to back . the right to die. He said: ‘I . have come to support assisted dying precisely because I do believe . strongly in the sanctity of life. 'Part of honouring this is respecting . people’s integrity to make decisions about themselves.’ Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Falconer is proposing a change in the law to allow someone with less than six months to live to be prescribed a lethal dose by doctors . Lord Carey said he had dropped his opposition to assisted dying  ‘in the face of the reality of needless suffering’. But . on Saturday, Archbishop Welby wrote in The Times: ‘I know of health . professionals who are already concerned by the ways in which their . clients have suggestions “to go to Switzerland” whispered in their ears . by relatives weary of caring for them and exasperated by seeing their . inheritances dwindle through care costs.’ Senior CofE figures have now called for a Royal Commission. The . Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, urged Lord . Falconer to withdraw his Bill to make way for such a commission, adding: . ‘We were surprised by the content of Lord Carey’s article, but... it . has brought the issues to the forefront of public discussion.’ About right: Sir Chris Woodhead is backing the bill . Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic, yesterday gave his backing to Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill. He believes the proposals are ‘about right’ and in tune with public opinion. And he said the Falconer law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution and career disaster. ‘They would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance.’ Sir Chris made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications. He told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that the decision to end one’s life ‘must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well’. ‘I wouldn’t dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me,’ he said. The Falconer proposals were ‘about right, given the range of public opinion on this issue’. Alternatives were ‘bleak’. ‘I would be far better if I could have my death assisted in a peaceful, dignified way so that my suffering wasn’t prolonged.’","Lord Carey said it was not anti-Christian to help terminally ill die with dignity .

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for the Daily Mail . Follow @@riathalsam . There aren’t many folk in football who know more than Mark Lillis about the peculiarities and challenges of caretaker management. He is the annual solution of Huddersfield Town, the club who three times in as many seasons have turned to the same man to put out their fires. Each time, he reduces his workload as the academy manager and goes to whip the big kids into shape. Each time, he knows there is something of the substitute teacher about this situation, which he has experienced an astonishing five times when you factor in stints at Derby and Stockport. Once more into the breach: Mark Lillis has embarked on his third caretaker spell at Huddersfield Town in the space of three seasons following the departure of Mark Robins on the opening day of the season . ‘You learn the post massively through experience — you have to make it clear: “I am a manager, not a caretaker — put that to bed and put the same effort in”.’ That was Lillis explaining how he addresses the class. ‘I don’t want people to ease off the gas,’ he added. The 54-year-old was talking after Huddersfield lost 3-1 to Cardiff on Saturday, a game he never would have expected to oversee. By the standards of a man who has spent almost four decades in football, taking charge after one game ‘is a new one to me’. It has been a strange few days at Huddersfield, starting with the 4-0 defeat by Bournemouth, then the staggeringly early departure of their manager, Mark Robins. When chairman Dean Hoyle revealed late last week that Robins had actually walked away — not been sacked, as per the accepted wisdom — he said his former manager complained that the players were ‘gone’, as were the fans. In form: Kenwyne Jones scored Cardiff's second goal in their 3-1 home win over Huddersfield on Saturday . What worse time, then, to face Cardiff, for whom another season in this division would be viewed far differently than it would at Huddersfield? What more appropriate time to face Cardiff, the club who have had their share of dysfunctional moments? For Lillis, the fans stayed onside and, more importantly, the players did as well, even after Kenwyne Jones made it 2-0 and then 3-1. ‘Our spirit impressed me,’ said Lillis. Those things matter to a manager, but especially a caretaker. He’s seen the lot, has Lillis, a former player for Huddersfield as well as Aston Villa and Manchester City. He runs a good academy at Huddersfield and since managing Halifax for 60 games at the turn of the millennium has had no overwhelming desire to return to permanent management. ‘You have moments,’ said Lillis. ‘Don’t get me wrong, on Tuesday (in the 5-3 Capital One Cup win over Chesterfield) I enjoyed it. At 3-1 down people are shouting, “You’re getting sacked in the morning”. Spirit: Murray Wallace pulled the scoreline back to 2-1 but Huddersfield were unable to get an equaliser . ‘When you get back to 3-3 and win 5-3 you get that adrenaline buzz again.’ His caretaker career has so far spanned 14 games across his five stints. ‘My shortest one was after Lee Clark (sacked in 2012). I didn’t get a game. ‘We had two days — a light training session on the Thursday, then an international break and the new man came in. My longest was last year (after Simon Grayson’s sacking) — we had five games, lost one, drew a couple and won a couple. ‘In these last few days I have felt comfortable with the group. The experience helps and I think that’s why the club asked me to step in. They know it is in decent hands.’ On he will go. At some point soon he will return to the work he really loves, but always ready to man the hose. ‘You just go on,’ he said. ‘Huddersfield know I will just keep going. You take one game at a time.’ Spoken like a true manager. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . In the first instance, Charlton’s 2-1 victory over Championship heavyweights Wigan. In the second, the squabbling of the two managers after Franck Moussa’s winner. Charlton’s Bob Peeters celebrated in front of Uwe Rosler, before the two men had to be separated. Peeters said: ‘I’m not going to apologise to him because he said things to me. Never ever.’ Over the top? Brentford manager Uwe Rosler thought this celebration by his Charlton counterpart Bob Peeters was too much, leaving to an altercation at the final whistle .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Coronation Street star Bill Roache has dropped his attempt to claim back £100,000 of legal costs from his rape trial, saying he ‘wants to move on with his life’. After his acquittal earlier this year the actor’s lawyers said they were planning to take action to recover the money from taxpayers. However, the 82-year-old, who recently returned to his role as Ken Barlow on the soap, said he no longer wishes to pursue the claim, despite his legal bills being in excess of £100,000. Coronation Street actor Bill Roache, seen here with fellow cast member Anne Kirkbridge, has dropped his attempt to claim £100,000 in legal costs from his rape trial . He has reportedly told friends: ‘I just want to move on and put the nightmare behind me.’ Mr Roache was found not guilty by a jury of two counts of rape and four counts of indecent assault in February after a four-week trial. A source close to the actor told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Initially Bill and his legal team did look into trying to recoup the money. But Bill has now decided he will no longer be going down that road.’ Mr Roache, pictured with his wife Sara, now simply wants to put the 'nightmare' court case behind him . The source added: ‘It would have been a long, drawn-out process and Bill is desperate to draw a line under what was a truly horrific ordeal for him and his family. ‘Instead he is focusing on getting on with the rest of his life and doing what he loves – being on Coronation Street. He is the happiest he has been in a long time.'","Bill Roache decided not to pursue the claim as it would take too long .

"By . Simon Walters For The Mail On Sunday . and Mark Nicol for the Mail On Sunday . David Cameron has called for 'tough, intelligent and patient' measures to combat the threat from IS terrorists to Britain . David Cameron last night held out the prospect of Britain backing wider military action in Iraq after vowing that he would not be deterred by Tony Blair’s disastrous war against Saddam Hussein. Air strikes and food drops to help refugees being attacked by Islamic State (IS) fanatics were not enough, said the Prime Minister. Failure to take tougher measures would increase the risk of more Islamist terror attacks in Britain. Calling for ‘tough, intelligent and patient’ measures to combat the ‘long-term threat to the UK’, Mr Cameron said: ‘The creation of an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and extending into Syria is not a problem miles away from home. ‘Nor is it a problem that should be defined by a war ten years ago. It is our concern here and now. If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain.’ Humanitarian aid was vital, but not a sufficient response to cope with any long-term threat posed by IS, he said. ‘We need a broader political, diplomatic and security response. This threat cannot be removed by air strikes alone. We need a tough, intelligent and patient long-term approach that can defeat the terrorist threat at source.’ Mr Cameron raised fears that the struggle against the terrorists would last ‘the rest of my political lifetime’. He was speaking as RAF Tornado jets returned to RAF Akrotiri in western Cyprus after carrying out vital ‘recon’ sorties over Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq. No 10 officials denied Mr Cameron was paving the way for British military action in Iraq – which he has repeatedly ruled out. 'Vital': A Tornado jet lands in Cyprus yesterday after a flying a mission over warn-torn Iraq . But diplomatic observers seized on his reference to the 2003 Iraq War, seen by most as a catastrophe for Iraq and Britain, as well as for Mr Blair personally. Government insiders said Mr Cameron’s comments were meant to signal that he refused to accept the Iraq War was the cause of the current crisis – or that Britain had no right to be involved in attempts to tackle it. He is ready to back calls for more military hardware to be given to the Kurds. Previously, Britain was prepared only to transport weapons on behalf of other EU nations. But now Mr Cameron is willing to supply them directly to Kurdish forces fighting IS jihadists in Iraq – a move that risks drawing Britain back into the conflict. According to military sources, British military training teams may also be needed. While the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are noted for their courage, they are seen as tactically inept. lLast night, the Bishop of Leeds, the Right Reverend Nicholas Baines, accused the Prime Minister of failing to develop ‘a coherent or comprehensive approach to Islamic extremism as it is developing across the globe’.","Cameron warns that creation of extremist state is a problem for Britain .

"By . Associated Press . Notre Dame is facing the possibility of losing three starters before the football season has even begun after another embarrassing hit for a university that prides itself on high academic standards. The university on Friday barred KeiVarae Russell, the team's best cornerback, leading returning receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive end Ishaq Williams, and backup linebacker Kendall Moore from practice and games while it investigates 'suspected academic dishonesty.' The Rev. John Jenkins, Notre Dame's president, said the school is looking into allegations the players had course work done for them. FILE - In this Aug. 1, 2014, file photo, Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly talks to the media at the beginning of fall practice in South Bend, Ind. Notre Dame says it is investigating ""suspected academic dishonesty"" involving several students, including four members of the football team. The school released a statement Friday, Aug. 15 saying it has notified the NCAA and that because of potential NCAA violations the four players are being held out of practice and completion until the conclusion of the investigation and the university honor code process. (AP Photo/Joe Raymond, File) The news comes a season after quarterback Everett Golson was suspended for the 2013 season for academic impropriety and after Daniels was suspended for the spring semester. The Irish finished 9-4 behind Tommy Rees last season, but coming off an appearance in the BCS title game in 2012 it was a step back. Golson has returned, but now coach Brian Kelly could be scrambling to fill holes before opening his fifth season in South Bend at home against Rice on Aug. 30. Athletic director Jack Swarbrick said Kelly was 'devastated' by the news. Jenkins and Swarbrick expressed support for Kelly. 'We have great confidence in Brian and his staff,' Jenkins said. 'They have been nothing but supportive.' Jenkins said the investigation shows Notre Dame's honor system works, saying it was started when someone on the university staff became suspicious of papers and homework turned in by the players. 'At any university you're dealing with young people. The vast majority of them make good decisions. But young people sometimes make bad decisions,' he said. 'Our job is to hold them accountable and to use those incidents as ways to educate them. That's what we're doing.' Rev. John I.

(AP Photo/Joe Raymond) Jenkins said Notre Dame has notified the NCAA about the inquiry. Because of potential violations, the four players can't compete until the conclusion of the investigation and the university honor code process. Jenkins said during a news conference that no student has been judged responsible for ""academic dishonesty."" 'Nobody has been dismissed,' Jenkins said. Jenkins said there is no timetable regarding how long the investigation will take. 'We will take as long as it takes to have a thorough and fair investigation and proceed through our academic honor code process,' Jenkins said. He added that such investigations at Notre Dame aren't common 'but it happens.' The university also is investigating if other students are involved. Jenkins said it was too early to say if the four players acted together. Jenkins said if it is found they violated the school's honor code the penalties could range from an F on an assignment, to an F in the course, to dismissal from school. The penalty would be decided by an honor committee. Swarbrick said the players haven't . been suspended. He said they remain grant-in-aid students and have . access to athletic facilities and resources. Jenkins . said he didn't want to speculate on possible NCAA punishment, while .

At right is Notre Dame Vice President/Director of Athletics Jack Swarbrick.(AP Photo/Joe Raymond) 'There are a few narrow instances where that triggers an NCAA concern, but I must stress we have no evidence of most of those here. No involvement by a member of the coaching staff, no transcript impropriety, those sorts of things,' he said. 'If it has NCAA consequences, we'll let them know.' Jenkins said the school would vacate victories if it is determined players have been ineligible during past competition. All four were members of the 2012 team that played for the BCS national championship. The investigation is the latest in a series for the Irish in the past 15 months involving academics, starting with Golson. Jerian Grant, the leading scorer on the basketball team at the time, was suspended in December for the spring semester because of an academic violation. Daniels was suspended two weeks later for the spring semester and was recently reinstated. Swarbrick said the previous cases were different. 'Let's not confuse academic probation, where you don't make grades in a semester, with academic dishonesty. They are very different things,' he said. Jenkins said he doesn't believe it's a sign Notre Dame has to make changes in the student-athletes it admits. 'We're confident that the students we admit have the capacity to be successful,' he said.","All four were members of the 2012 team that played for the BCS national championship .

"By . Hugo Duncan . More than half of homeowners think now is a good time to sell after house prices rose nearly £50 a day during the past 12 months. The value of the average home jumped by £17,261 to £186,322 in the year to July – or £47.29 a day – according to Halifax. The 10.2 per cent rise is the biggest since the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 heralded the start of Britain’s financial crisis. For sale: More than half of homeowners think now is a good time to sell, according to a new report . Surging prices have led a record proportion of homeowners to believe it is ‘a good time to sell’, according to a Halifax report – creating the right conditions for a surge in the number of homes coming on to the market. But signs that the housing market is accelerating will fuel speculation that the first interest rate rise since July 2007 could be just months away. The Bank of England is expected to freeze rates at 0.5 per cent when its latest meeting ends at noon today, but experts say an increase before the end of the year is a distinct possibility. A poll by ComRes for ITV News last night showed that half of mortgage holders, or 49 per cent, are already cutting back their spending over concerns that the rate may rise. Others have also been affected by fears of an increase, with 35 per cent of all adults tightening their purse strings in anticipation of higher rates. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘Far from slowing, house price inflation may even be accelerating. The UK is cruising at strong growth rates. We expect the Bank of England to respond by hiking rates in November.’ The Halifax report found the average house price in the UK rose by 1.4 per cent in July alone – the equivalent of £80 a day. London and the South East have led the recovery in the housing market but there are signs that it is spreading elsewhere, with hotspots springing up in the regions. Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, said: ‘Rising prices mean people think it is a good time to sell. Much of the inflation is coming from London and the South East.’ Priced out: The proportion of people who think it is a good time to buy has fallen to its lowest level on record . Halifax said 57 per cent of those questioned believed the next 12 months would be ‘a good time to sell’, while only 32 per cent felt it would be ‘a bad time’. The key figure is the difference between the two percentages, which is the biggest since Halifax started collecting the data in April 2011 – suggesting confidence among sellers is sky high. But the proportion of people who think it is a good time to buy has fallen to its lowest level on record as soaring prices and fears of higher interest rates dent confidence. Estate agents in London said increasing numbers of homeowners are selling up and leaving the capital for the regions. Jonathan Hudson, of Hudsons Property in the West End, said: ‘It has been clear since late last year that the London ripple had taken effect. People selling up in the capital and looking to upsize to larger family homes are clearly fuelling price growth in regional areas. ‘It is good for sellers who are still looking to move outside London where prices still have lots to make up on London, meaning a new lifestyle, bigger home and perhaps reducing or losing their mortgage debt altogether before any interest rates rises kick in.’","Market acceleration will fuel speculation of imminent interest rate rise .

'Like I've said all along, I'll take that [compliment]. But if it was somebody else - but you get an A-list celebrity, you can take that compliment,' he said on the program. Kingsbury told Highly Questionable's hosts he's received attention from both single and married mothers. The coach also spoke about about 'signing some cleavage' when asked about female fan interactions - which he said happened 'around five' times.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The gilded streets of Los Angeles are a long way from Southeast Asia – but the backlash over the harsh new anti-gay laws introduced in the small country of Brunei has now travelled all the way over the Pacific to a deeply influential part of the world. Hollywood. Scroll down for video . In the pink: The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a favourite retreat of Hollywood stars since it opened in 1912 - but has found itself at the centre of protests against its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, and Brunei's new anti-gay laws . A gathering storm: Celebrities such as comedian Jay Leno have led protests outside the Beverly Hills Hotel . A growing band of film stars, celebrities and other famous figures are joining forces to put pressure on the state’s ruler, the Sultan of Brunei, by targeting the properties he owns. And firmly in the firing line is the celebrated Beverly Hills Hotel – the revered 102-year-old retreat for the great and the good, which – thanks to the fact that it is now owned by the Sultan – is rapidly losing friends and customers as the film world registers its anger. Coming under fire: Protestors have been gathering outside the Beverly Hills Hotel all week . The Motion Picture & Television Fund is the latest group to join a lengthening list of organisations and individuals refusing to do business with hotels owned by the Sultan or the government of Brunei. It says it will no longer hold its annual ‘Night Before the Oscars’ party at the hotel – usually staged there in March – as it has for many years. The Fund says it is making a protest at Brunei’s new sharia criminal law, which punishes same-sex relationships, as well as adultery and abortions, with flogging and stoning. ‘We cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws, and as a result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei,’ the Fund's directors have said in a statement. Flashpoint: The Dorchester Collection, which runs the Beverly Hills Hotel, says the current protests are misdirected . Prominent figures such as comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno, and entrepreneur Richard Branson, have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the Hollywood elite since it opened its doors in 1912. Divisive: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's new anti-gay laws have sparked outrage . Branson tweeted over the weekend that no member of his Virgin staff would stay at any Dorchester Collection property – the hotel group which includes the Beverly Hills Hotel, and is owned by Brunei – ‘until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.’ Mavis Leno, co-chair of the Global Women's Rights Awards with husband Jay Leno, says the new penalties ‘violate international law and have no place in civilised society.’ In an added move, the City of Beverly Hills has voted to pressure the government of Brunei into selling the Beverly Hills Hotel in the wake of its new laws. The resolution urges Brunei to divest its ownership of the hotel and any other properties it owns within Beverly Hills. Emotions were high yesterday in the city’s council chambers as scores of employees, as well as local residents, expressed their concern. Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has praised his state's laws as a ‘great achievement.’ Brunei, a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs, has begun phasing in its version of sharia law, which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery. The most severe punishments – flogging, amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years. Response: Comedian Ellen Degeneres and entrepreneur Richard Branson have been vocal in their opposition . The Dorchester Collection's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected. ‘American companies across the board are funded by foreign investment, including sovereign wealth funds,"" Christopher Cowdray has said in a statement. The surge in celebrity opinion against the Dorchester Collection has also made its presence felt in Britain. Last week, Stephen Fry cancelled a planned stay at Coworth Park in Berkshire after realising that it was part of the hotel group. He tweeted: 'Cancelled in nick of time: discovered @CoworthParkUK that I was booked into is part of the “Dorchester Collection”.' The Beverly Hills Hotel has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102-year history. Leading lights such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, John Wayne, Faye Dunaway and The Beatles have all stayed or partied amid the property's inimitable pink walls.","Hollywood stars join protests against anti-gay laws in Far East state Brunei .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Most grandparents would struggle to understand what twerking is, let alone bust a raunchy move themselves. But these four dancers have proved themselves way ahead of the curve by filming their own video dancing to hits including Low by Flo Rider and Psy's mega-hit Gangnam Style. The troupe were filmed springing into action despite their greying hair, floral skirts and sensible cardigans. Gran-nam: The four dancers have caused a stir in Stourbridge, West Midlands, where they have performed . Busting moves: The 'grannies' were filmed earlier this month dancing and videos of them have attracted hundreds of thousands of views . Footage from their performances around Stourbridge in the West Midlands has brought them hundreds of thousands of hits after being posted online, bringing unexpected fame to the dancers. However, those who find the routines cranked out by these 'grandmothers' implausible for their apparent age may not be surprised to learn that in this case looks can be deceiving. The 'grandmothers' - in fact aged between 33 and 51 - are a practised group who perform for a local theatre company. Sue Hawkins, 42, Jackie Fellows, 51, Deb Nicholls, 42, and Emma Rollason, 33, perform together for Fizzog Productions, a theatre company based in Dudley, West Mids. They have had viewers in stitches by defying their apparent age busting some moves to the popular music hits. Since being posted online the clip has been so popular the dancers have now been invited to the USA to appear on TV shows. Unlikely: The footage shows the dancers' remarkable dexterity, despite their sensible, old-fashioned costume . The hysterical video was taken by Lucy Rutherford who posted it on YouTube and Facebook later that day. By the following morning, she said she was getting emails, notifications and friend requests from people across the world. The video has quickly become an online sensation and has already received 965,000 views and shares online in less than a month. Today Ms Rutherford, a paramedic, said: 'I just put it up to show friends and family really. Then, I was getting notifications left, right and centre from people across the world. 'I didn’t ever think it was going to be this popular. From the morning after, it just spiralled out of control. 'I have had friend requests online from people everywhere, like Australia and Japan this week. It is unbelievable. Looks deceiving: Although they seem like grannies, the troupe is actually aged in their thirties, forties and fifties . 'It was so funny. They made me laugh so much on the day and they clearly are making people laugh all over the world now.' The professional dance group have been together for 14 years after meeting at college where they studied Community Theatre. Sue Hawkins, a company director, who plays the ‘elderly’ character Letty in the wacky dance act said: 'We just cannot believe the reaction we’ve had to the video. 'We have had a huge response from people in India who loved the Bhangra dancing and from people in Japan who enjoyed our version of Gangnam. Ms Fellows plays the elderly character May, Ms Nicholls is Hilda, while Ms Rollason portrays an OAP called Ruby. Ms Hawkins added: 'These characters have been around for some time and they appear in comedy sketches which we perform at community events and shows. 'We developed the characters after visiting nursing homes in the Black Country, so these funny characters are based on some of the lovely people we met.'","Demurely-dressed troupe spotted grooving in Stourbridge, West Midlands .

"By . Connie Allfrey . A Northern Ireland adventurer who traced the longest river in Iran from source to sea, has described it as 'dicing with death'. Leon McCarron walked, kayaked and biked along the waterway - from the snowy mountainous headwaters of the south west to the Persian Gulf - in a country still largely shrouded in mystery. The film student was welcomed into Iranian homes and subject to startling acts of kindness and generosity in a state former US president George Bush conversely named part of the 'axis of evil'. Frosty toes: McCarron treks upstream through the snow of the River Karun . A kind benefactor loaned McCarron a bicycle and other equipment when the rapids of the River Karun became too dangerous to boat down. Mr McCarron said: 'A lot of Iranians would often say anything is possible in Iran, it is their motto and one has to agree; within 20 minutes we were fully kitted out for a bicycle expedition, we had to promise to have lots of fun and take pictures to send back to him.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel to Iran, but tour operators have reportedly seen a rise in holiday bookings to this wild and wistful destination. Catch me if you can: The intrepid explorer packing a pace and a hefty rucksack as he heads into the mountains . The expedition earlier this year took more than a month, and Mr McCarron intends to document a film about his 450-mile adventure along the river's course. He walked for a week along the banks of the river from its source until it became wide and deep enough for him and his friend to float their kayak. For navigation they used a map drawn up by Russians during Soviet times. Highlights along the way included Shushtar, the summer capital of the Persian Empire which boasts stunning water features and is renowned for a historic hydraulic system that uses the river water and is protected by the World Heritage. Mr McCarron kayaking with friend in calm waters before braving the perilous rapids and losing a paddle . At one particularly dicey moment Mr McCarron's kayak capsized in deep rapids, causing his paddle to be instantly sucked under the water by a vigorous whirlpool. 'It probably scared me more than anything else I saw on my trip,' said the adventurer. Despite managing to find a replacement paddle in a nearby town, the pair soon decided it was foolhardy to continue. 'Eventually we decided we were dicing with death a little bit too much with the kayak,' McCarron added, 'I think I am more of a low-adrenaline adventurer.' Calm after the storm: Cycling at sunset having been loaned bikes and equipment by a generous local . A friendly Baktiari villager meets Mr McCarron in the snow during part of his 450 mile trek . Bicycles seemed the obvious solution to continue, but the pair were short of funds owing to Iran being unrecognised by the international cash machine network. Fortunately a local shop-owner had hundreds of cycles and loaned them two of his best touring bikes with panniers and sleeping bags, based purely on the premise they send him pictures of their adventure. Mr McCarron and his friend finished their trip at the Gulf, near the city of Abadan and Basra, where British forces were based during the Iraqi conflict. A Khuzestan family are warm and welcoming towards Mr McCarron as he passes through their village .","Adventurer traces River Karun  450 miles from source to sea .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . A disabled lion who was reared by a double amputee zookeeper has formed an unlikely bond with a miniature sausage dog with the pair inseparable ever since the cat was a cub. Bonedigger, a 500lb male lion might dwarf Milo, an eight-year-old Dachshund but he rarely leaves his side. The two have been inseparable over the past five years at G.W. Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. Scroll down for video . Bonedigger and Milo are so close that the dog leans in as if he is giving the 500lb lion a kiss . The two have been inseparable over the past five years at G.W. Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma . Mr Reinke, who reared the lion introduced Bonedigger to the dashunds Milo, Bullet and Angel . 'Milo does his best to copy Bonedigger when the lion tries puffing to communicate with other lions in the park', says Mr Reinke . Bonedigger shares a meal with the dogs at Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma . Bonedigger was born with a metabolic bone disease that left him mildly crippled and has also struck up an unusual bond with zookeeper John Reinke, who lost both of his legs following a bungee jump accident. When Milo and two other five-year old wiener dogs, Bullet and Angel, sensed that the the lion was disabled they sought to comfort and protect him. Now Bonedigger and his pack of dogs cuddle, feast on raw meat and play in the grounds together. Mr Reinke, who works at the zoo witnessed the bond develop between the unlikely duo. He said: ‘This friendship between an 11 pound wiener dog and a 500 pound lion is the only of it's kind in the world ever seen. ‘Milo does his best to copy Bonedigger when the lion tries puffing to communicate with other lions in the park. Bonedigger who weighs 500lbs dwarfs his unlikely friend Milo but the lion treats the dog like one of his own cubs . Mr Reinke developed his bond with big cats after striking up a friendship with seven-foot lion Bonedigger, pictured . Bonedigger is too big to be kept in Mr Reinke's house but is kept in an enclosure at the animal park nearby . Bonedigger was hand-reared by Mr Reinke along with a tiger called Tony after he realised his ability to bring up animals. He added: 'They used to live with me in the house. I raised them both with bottled formula and raw meat until they grew too big for the house. 'Bondigger’s like a dog and when he hasn't seen me for ages he gets all excited and runs up to me. 'Tony is perfectly healthy, but is a bit too playful. When Bonedigger senses that I am losing control of the play, he snarls at Tony and you can tell he is being protective and telling him to stop.’ Now the big cats have moved into their own enclosure and he has also hand-reared another two tiger cubs called Tippy and Orlando. Even now that Bonedigger is too big to be kept in his house, the zookeeper says he is never too far away . Mr Reinke pats Bonedigger on the head in his enclosure with Tony, a tiger he also hand reared in his home . Bonedigger the lion and Tony the tiger play with each other as Mr Reine looks on. He says Tony is perfectly healthy but a little 'too playful' Mr Reinke explained: 'I brought up tiger cubs named Tippy and Orlando. They keep me busy and they need to be entertained every day. ‘Tippy liked to play tug of war with my prosthetic legs, which is good, because I guess that would hurt otherwise!’ Mr Reinke admits he has always been on the wild side after an accident during a bungee jump in 1994. He fell through a faulty trap door from 55 feet, crushing both of his legs. ‘I pierced my side with a six inch metal stake too and I asked my friends to call my wife because I thought that was it,’ said the ex-turbine engineer. ‘I broke my hip, my back, and shattered both feet and raked my intestines. Needless to say, I was in a coma for eight days after I reached the hospital. My wife Kristi couldn’t recognise me when she first saw me. ‘When I finally woke up the doctors told me that I would never walk again.’ John Reinke feeding Tippy the tiger cub in his home near GW Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma . Mr Reinke holding cubs Tippy and Orlando with spider monkey Ricky perched on his shoulders . Mr Reinke's wife Kirsti also helps to raise the tiger cubs and gives a bottle to cub Tippy . Mr Renke allows the animals into his own home and garden and even lets the small tigers chew on his prosthetic legs . After five years of painstaking rehabilitation, John learned to use his legs again, and he began to rebuild his life. He and his wife Kristi, 45, had a second son Peyton six years after their first son, Nathan was born. But in the years that followed, John suffered from repeated infections in his legs and eventually had both amputated. ‘That was another low moment for me because I value my independence highly,’ added Mr Reinke. ‘Bringing up Bonedigger and Tony helped me recover, especially my relationship with Bonedigger.’ Bringing up the cubs is a family affair as Mr Reinke's sons Peyton and Nathan also help out their father .

"By . Darren Boyle . A cannabis addict killed the DJ friend of Bez from Happy Mondays after stabbing him 13 times, before stabbing a young girl, crashing into a pub and eventually taking his own life. Darren Gasper, 34, who had smoked cannabis almost every day since he was 13, knocked DJ Robert Jackson, 43, unconscious with a blow to the head, then wrapped him inside a carpet before stabbing the victim 13 times in the back as he lay motionless inside. Gasper also stabbed a young girl in the stomach and placed a dog bowl over the dead man’s body before fleeing the house in Moston, Manchester. Robert Jackson was beaten and stabbed by his friend Darren Gasper and left with a bowl of dog food on his head after the crazed attack at his Manchester home in July 2013. A 13-year-old girl was also stabbed . Darren Gasper hijacked a car after the double stabbing and rammed the wall of a pub as well as stabbing himself after being spotted by police, the daily cannabis user was taken to hospital but died shortly afterwards . The inquest heard that Gasper had been a daily cannabis user since he was just 13 and prone to violence . After the knife attacks, the father-of-one who suffered from 'paranoia induced violence' phoned his ex-girlfriend saying: 'I want to kill myself because I have just killed ""Jacko"".' Shortly afterwards Gasper hijacked a car at knifepoint, stabbed himself in the stomach before driving the vehicle into the side of his sister’s pub as he was being approached by a police patrol. Officers found the knife lodged in Gasper’s chest and he was pronounced dead in hospital as a result of his self inflicted knife wounds. The girl who cannot be named suffered serious injuries but has since made a recovery. Jackson nicknamed 'Jacko' was a security guard and a well known DJ at a number of pubs and clubs in Manchester. He was said to be close friends with Happy Mondays star Mark 'Bez' Berry, Stone Roses bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield and knew Noel and Liam Gallagher. Gasper never worked and had been in and out of prison. His ex-girlfriend Simone MacMillan who had a 15 year relationship with him told the Manchester hearing: 'He smoked cannabis almost every day. He used to say that he had enough, was depressed and had no money and was going to kill himself.' She said in the weeks before the tragedy in July last year Gasper went berserk, threw a microwave and pushed her. In one instance the couple were about to go to bed when Gasper came up to the bedroom sat on the bed and began screaming. 'He then went down and put shoes on,' she said: 'All I could see was evil in him.'. Robert Jackson, left, was also a friend of Stone Roses bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield, right . Miss McMillan fled to a nearby hotel whilst he took her car and crashed it into the nearby Alliance pub. The inquest heard that prior to the attack, Gasper had been good friends with Jackson before attacking him in the kitchen on his home. Next door neighbour Joy Marshall told the hearing: 'I heard very loud banging so loud it made me jump and my pet animals were scared.' Gasper then rang Miss Macmillan telling her to tell their son he loved him and confessing to the killing. PC Jonathan Pritchley said in a statement: 'Police attended the address and one of the officers looked in the front window and I could see a body partly covered lying on the kitchen floor. 'The door was forced and there also an injured female on the floor in the hallway. The man was lying face-down under a brown rug and he had sustained numerous stab sounds to the back and had severe injuries to the head and face. 'He was lying in a large pool of blood. Paramedics attended and confirmed the male in the kitchen was dead. They began to treat the female in the hallway who was taken to hospital. A search was undertaken of the address and during the search we noticed a large lump hammer on the floor in the hallway leading to the kitchen. 'There was a golf club behind the front door and a knife missing from a knife block on the kitchen unit.' Police later spotted Gasper in a hijacked Skoda car outside the same pub he had crashed into a week earlier. As four officers approached the vehicle it started to move forward and accelerated quickly into the brick wall of the pub with considerable force. The inquest heard Mr Jackson was knocked unconscious by the blow to the head before being stabbed . As officers went to the wreckage, Gasper appeared to grimace and appeared to be dazed and slow to react. Then the sergeant noticed the whole of his left side was covered in blood. He died shortly afterwards. Traces of cocaine were found in system but not from recent use. Det Insp Michael Gladwin who investigated the attack said: 'Robert Jackson and Darren Gasper were friends and Mr Gasper would quite regularly visit Mr Jackson’s house. We still don’t know details of any particular problem between them that led to this incident. 'After examinations we concluded he was assaulted in the area he was found.. There was no indication of movement around the kitchen. There were no signs to suggest a struggle had taken place. The rug had multiple sites of damage consistent with him being stabbed through it. A dog bowl containing dog food was placed on top of the rug. 'At the time Gasper was wanted by the police for criminal damage. He was suffering from paranoia induced violence. The police visited Jackson’s home on July 24 where he said he hadn’t seen Gasper for around two months. Gasper had used cannabis since the age of 13.' Tests showed the cause of Jackson’s death as being blunt force head injuries and multiple stab wounds. Recording a verdict of unlawful killing on Jackson and suicide on Gasper, Coroner Graham Jackson. said: 'Mr Jackson was rendered unconscious by a blow to the head and then stabbed multiple times and wrapped in the rug or blanket and perversely a dog food bowl was placed on top of the body. 'I am satisfied that he was the victim of a most vicious assault. An unlawful act clearly caused the death. I offer my sympathies and condolences to his immediate family. Why all of this happened goodness only knows.'","Darren Gasper beat and stabbed his friend Robert Jackson in his kitchen .

"By . Associated Press . Once-teeming Lake Mead marinas are idle as a 14-year drought steadily drops water levels to historic lows. Officials from nearby Las Vegas are pushing conservation, but are also drilling a new pipeline to keep drawing water from the lake. Hundreds of miles away, farmers who receive water from the lake behind Hoover Dam are preparing for the worst. The receding shoreline at one of the main reservoirs in the vast Colorado River water system is raising concerns about the future of a network serving a perennially parched region home to 40 million people and 4 million acres of farmland. Scroll down for video... Hoover Dam: The bathtub ring of light minerals shows the high water mark of the reservoir which has shrunk to its lowest point since it was first filled in the 1930s . Sinking feeling: The bathtub ring that delineates the high water mark is seen at Lake Mead in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada . All is revealed: Wind kicks up dust on an area that was once under water at Hemenway Harbor . The Intake Towers (Left, before) at the the Hoover Dam in 2007. Right, how they appeared last week. North America's largest man-made reservoir dropped below 1,082 feet above sea level . Marina operators, water managers and farmers who for decades have chased every drop of water across the booming Southwest and part of Mexico are closely tracking the reservoir water level already at its lowest point since it was first filled in the 1930s. 'We just hope for snow and rain up in Colorado, so it'll come our way,' said marina operator Steve Biggs, referring to precipitation in the Rockies that flows down the Colorado River to help fill the reservoir separating Nevada and Arizona. By 2016, continued drought could trigger cuts in water deliveries to both states. While water authorities say they've been saving water for potential dry days, the prospect of the first cuts is already prompting action. 'I've downsized in the last couple of years, probably a good thing the way this water shortage is going,' said farmer Dennis Bagnall, who has planted just 225 of the 1,500 acres that are typically green this time of year on his farm south of Phoenix. Boats are moored at the Lake Mead Marina in 2007 (top) but in 2008 the marina was moved - and for good reason! A buoy at what was once the Echo Bay Marina sits high and dry. The lack of rain has pushed most of California and Nevada into extreme or exceptional drought . A fish cleaning station is seen far from any water at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada. The lake supplies water to parts of Nevada, Arizona, Southern California and northern Mexico, and the supply is disappearing . (Top) Boats are moored at the Lake Mead Marina in 2007. (Bottom) A pair of rest rooms on pontoon floats rest on dirt in Boulder Harbor where the marina was once located . Last week, officials announced an $11 million pilot program involving the federal government and water agencies in Denver, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix to pay farmers, cities and industries to reduce river water use. 'We can certainly hope for better conditions than we've experienced in recent times, but we have to actively and continue to plan for the worst case,' said Michael J. Lacey, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources. This week, an update from the federal Bureau of Reclamation, the keeper of the Colorado River network's dams and reservoirs, will help set the course for water deliveries for the next two years. Administrators say they're confident they can meet current commitments next year. Federal officials and water administrators in metro areas such as Las Vegas and Phoenix say they're committed to finding new ways to make every drop of river water count — from cloud seeding to pipelines to new reservoirs to desalination plants. They point to agreements to leave surpluses unused in wet years, share pain in dry years and buy water designated for farms for city use. (Left) Lake Mead Marina is seen behind dry cracked earth in an area that was once filled with water. (Right) Lake Mead is seen in the distance behind dry cracked earth in an area that used to be underwater . At many lakes, now landlocked boat docks are upward hikes from the water . The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts some meat and produce prices will rise as much as 6% as farmers pay more money to water crops and feed livestock . Lake Mead is seen in the distance behind boats in dry dock near the Lake Mead Marina in 2007 (top) but now things are even worse (below) But they're all watching Lake Mead, the biggest in a Colorado River basin that supplies water to California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and part of Mexico. The states get annual allotments dating to the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Over the years, the amount hasn't kept pace with a post-World War II development boom in the Southwest, and pressure has increased with drought gripping the region for almost 15 years. The effect of increased demand and diminished supply is visible on Lake Mead's canyon walls. A white mineral band often compared with a bathtub ring marks the depleted water level. The lake is expected to drop to 1,080 feet above sea level this year — down almost the width of a football field from a high of 1,225 feet in 1983. A projected level of 1,075 feet in January 2016 would trigger cuts in water deliveries to Arizona and Nevada. At 1,000 feet, drinking water intakes would go dry to Las Vegas, a city of 2 million residents and a destination for 40 million tourists per year that is almost completely dependent on the reservoir. That has the Southern Nevada Water Authority spending more than $800 million to build a 20-foot-diameter pipe so it can keep getting water. Boats are moored at the Lake Mead Marina in 2007 (top) but in 2008 the marina was moved - and for good reason! Lily Yoder, 13, climbs on a boat at the Boulder Harbor boat ramp. Last week, North America's largest man-made reservoir dropped below 1,082 feet above sea level, the lowest it's been since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s . Nevada's Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, has hit an all time-low since it was first filled in the 1930s, raising concerns that a water shortage could be declared for a region home to 40 million people in seven fast-growing states . The dwindling supplies are easy to see in this comparison over just seven years. A 14-year drought in the Southwestern United States and a dwindling supply of water from the Colorado River . The region is also stressing water conservation, prohibiting grass lawns for new homes and fountains at businesses. Officials say the overall effort has reduced consumption 33 percent in recent years while the Las Vegas area added 400,000 residents. But severely restricting water use for swimming pools or lawns in a city like Phoenix wouldn't make much difference, said Kathryn Sorensen, the city's Water Services Department director, because conservation efforts need to be applied across the western U.S. 'The solution can't come just from municipal conservation; there isn't enough water there,' she said. If cuts do come, they'll test the agreements forged in recent years between big, growing cities and farmers. In California, home to 38 million residents, farmers in the sparsely populated Imperial Valley in southeast California have senior water rights ensuring that they get water regardless of the condition. Kevin Kelley, general manager of the Imperial Irrigation District, defends his agency's position at the head of the line and dismisses the idea that water should go to those who can pay the most or make the most compelling economic argument. The National Park Service has been forced to close or extend boat launch ramps, and move entire marinas to try to keep up with the receding water level . What was once the Echo Bay Marina sits high and dry next to Lake Mead . Imperial Valley farmers grow some 200 crops, Kelley said, from alfalfa to cotton and celery to zucchini. 'There has to be a place in a diverse economy and a diverse Southwest for a place like this that grows food and fiber year-round,' he said. In Arizona, reduced deliveries of Colorado River water would largely affect the Central Arizona Project, which manages canals supplying 80 percent of the state's population. A tiered system means farmers would face cuts first, shielding Native American tribes and big cities. Bagnall, who owns Morningstar Farms in Coolidge, Arizona, worries about the future of farming in the region. Tighter supplies mean there will be less farming and fewer dollars going to agricultural services like fertilizer suppliers. 'Eventually,' he said, 'the prices are going to hit the consumer. Sooner or later, it's got to go up. So it's just a domino effect.'","California drought having ramifications beyond the state .

Speaking as a BT Sport ambassador, Mourinho said: 'Why I like the Premier League so much is that at this moment, nobody knows who is going to win the title. 'I know that we want to and I know that we can, but it is the kind of competition where I can't say. 'At this moment, I think between us, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United, Man City - who is going to be first, who is going to play in the Europa League, I don't know.' Mourinho guided Real Madrid to the La Liga title in 2012 but admitted the annual two-horse title race in Spain was a turn off. He said: 'My concept is this is the best league, because the concept is competitive teams. 'When I was in Spain and we won the league we won every game.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A campaign has been launched to award a knighthood to the last British survivor of the legendary Dambusters raid. George 'Johnny' Johnson, 92, was a Flight Sergeant and bomb aimer during the 1943 raid on the dams in Hitler's heartland. He survived the mission and 49 other war-time raids with 617 and 97 squadrons but he and his colleagues have never been officially honoured. Flt Sgt George 'Johnnie' Johnson the last British Dambuster with the Canadian Lancaster at RAF Coningsby . Widower Mr Johnson, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol has campaigned for those who took part in Bomber Campaign to be officially recognised by the Government. His cause has now been taken up by Stephen Hadley who has started a petition to have him knighted. The campaign, launched through Change.org, a site where people can launch petitions to publicise their pet projects, has already had support from across the country and from as far afield as Los Angeles.

The Daily Mail's special 4am reports of the Ruhr flooding in the Dambusters raids . Operation Chastise was an attack on German dams carried out on 16–17 May 1943 by the RAF’s 617 Squadron, subsequently publicised as the ""Dam Busters"", using a specially developed ""bouncing bomb"" invented and developed by Barnes Wallis. The Möhne and Edersee Dams were breached, causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and of villages in the Eder valley; the Sorpe dam sustained only minor damage. Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and several more were damaged. Factories and mines were also either damaged or destroyed. An estimated 1,600 people drowned. Despite the raid’s fame, it did not do too much damage and quick repairs by the Germans, meant the dams were back in action four months later. Mr Hadley, 55, from Kent, who read about Mr Johnson in the news, said: 'It is shocking when you hear that David Cameron's hairdresser gets an award but someone like Mr Johnson has never had any formal recognition. 'When you look at what he achieved during the war it is simply incredible but what is even more incredible is the fact that he has never had any official recognition of any kind. 'This is not just about Mr Johnson it is also about recognising everyone who took part in the raid, their bravery was incredible.' When asked recently about being a hero, Mr Johnson modestly said: 'For me, that word doesn't mean a thing. Comrades in arms: Flt Sgt Johnny Johnson (left) and Wing Cmdr Guy Gibson (right) 'I had a job to do and I did it to the best of my ability, as all of us did. I'm just lucky, firstly, that I got back from the raid and secondly that I am still living.' Mr Johnson was part of Flight Lieutenant Joe McCarthy's crew in the Dambusters raid. After lining up the attack on the Sorpe dam ten times they dropped their 'bouncing bomb' from 30ft and damaged it. The raid claimed the lives of 53 airmen. The handful of survivors still alive include Les Munro from New Zealand and Frederick Sutherland from Canada. Mr Johnson married sweetheart Gwyn in 1943, just two months before the raid and they had three children. She died on August 19, 2005.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Qantas is not altering flight paths over Iraq despite alliance partner Emirates' plans to stop flying above the area within 10 days due to fears of MH17-style attacks. The Australian airline's decision to keep flying through Iraqi airspace on Dubai to London flights is based on its latest security assessments. Emirates has decided to re-route planes along different flight paths amid concerns about the dangers posed by Islamic militants on the ground and the risk of missile strikes following the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. Scroll down for video . Qantas is not altering flight paths over Iraq despite alliance partner Emirates' plans to stop flying above the area . Despite their joint venture, because the airlines have separate operations teams, Qantas is not required to follow Emirate's lead. Emirates route change comes after MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while travelling over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, on July 17. Sir Tim Clark, president of the Dubai-based airline, said he believed other airlines would soon follow suit as he called for government agencies to offer more advice about flying over conflict zones. Mr Clark said Emirates flights would be re-routed over the next week to ten days and confirmed routes being considered included over Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea, over Cairo and into European airspace, or over Iran. He said he had taken action because he was no longer ‘comfortable’ with planes flying over ISIS-held territory in Iraq. Sir Tim Clark, president of Dubai-based airline Emirates, said planes would be re-routed along different flight paths over the next week to 10 days amid concerns about missile strikes and the dangers posed by militants . 'This is a political animal but the fact of the matter is MH17 changed everything, and that was very nearly in European airspace,' he told The Times. 'We cannot continue to say, ""Well it's a political thing"". We have to do something. We have to take the bull by the horns.' A Qantas spokesman said the airline constantly reviewed its flight paths and made changes when needed, reported Sydney Morning Herald. 'There is no suggestion that flying over Iraq is unsafe for commercial airlines, particularly given the cruising altitude that most, including Qantas, maintain,' he said. 'We will continue to monitor the situation, with safety as our top priority.' Qantas has two daily A380 flights on the Dubai-London route, which fly at an altitude of 38,000 to 41,000 feet over Iraq. The above map, which shows routes taken by major airline carriers this month, shows how planes are flying over dangerous areas of the world. Dotted lines are probable routes for which exact data is not available . The Civil Aviation Safety Authority provides advice to Qantas from US and European regulators and the airline is currently avoiding Syrian airspace. The move by Emirates could result in longer flight times and increased costs such as fuel and staffing, all of which could be passed onto passengers unless the airline is prepared to cover the costs. According to an aviation analyst, consumers were unlikely to be prepared to wear these costs when Qantas is seen as one of the world's safest airline. Emirates currently operates the largest number of flights over Iraq as well as flights to Baghdad, Erbil  and Basra in the country, although no changes to these flights have been outlined as yet. The country lies on the border of the main flight path between Europe and Asia, with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day. A popular route is over the Iraqi city of Mosul, a stronghold of ISIS militants. On Monday, Emirates as well as Lufthansa, British Airways and Qatar Airways were flying in Iraqi airpace, according to FlightRadar24. The above graphic shows the flight paths of a snapshot of planes flying over Mosul, an ISIS stronghold in Iraq, last weekend. The prospect has been raised that ISIS has missiles which could shoot down a plane . ISIS, the terrorist group which took over swathes of Iraq in June and declared it an 'Islamic State', are a brutal, anti-West group which has boasted of holding mass executions, crucifixion and imposing hardline Islamic law on its conquered territory. The move by Emirates comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between airline industry groups today, which will see chiefs discuss possible ways to reduce the risks of flying over conflict zones. The meeting, held by the International Civil Aviation Organisation – a United Nations body – comes following two major air disasters this month. As well as MH17 being shot down, an Air Algerie plane crashed in Mali, north Africa, on Thursday, killing all of the 116 passengers on board. It is not yet clear what brought down the plane. Some airline insurers are considering pulling coverage for flight over high-risk areas over Africa and the Middle East, reported The Financial Times. It was has been reported that the U.S. is investigating if Iraqi fighters have missiles able to bring down a civilian aircraft. Until the MH17 disaster, Emirates flew over eastern Ukraine along with Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa and Etihad Airways while Air France and British Airways were not. Since moving its European hub from Singapore to Dubai last year, Qantas has avoided eastern Ukraine and stopped flying over Crimea in the country's south in April because of escalating conflict with Russia. While Virgin Australia does not offer flights to Europe from Australia it does codeshare with Singapore Airlines and Etihad. Qantas has been contacted for comment.","Emirates will stop flying over Iraq and re-route planes to other flight paths .

And one in ten are forced to withdraw extra money abroad within two days of touching down after using up their spending money. Blowing budgets: One in ten Brits will be forced to draw out extra money while on holiday after overspending . Brits typically blow their holiday budget by £148 - and one in ten go way over our intended amount by £500 or more, the research by prepaid travel money card Kalixa Pay found. However, many fail to consider the consequences when we return home as 24 per cent of us take at least three months to pay off holiday debts. A further one in 14 (seven per cent) will take up to six months and longer to account for holiday overspending. The reasons why Brits go so over budget include underestimating the cost of food and drink, day trips and buying mementos, a poll of 2,000 adults found. Yet 43 per cent of holidaymakers admit 'common sense goes out the window' as soon as they set foot abroad.

Wetnominate sees revellers going to extreme lengths to get soaking wet before nominating a friend to do the same or go one better.

"By . Wills Robinson For Mailonline . Anxiety: Stephanie Bottrill, 52, walked out in front of a lorry last year after she was told to 'move house' because of the 'bedroom tax . The brother of a woman who walked out in front of a lorry and killed herself because of 'bedroom tax' has said she wasn't willing to 'give somebody else a chance' in a housing system that requires people to 'take turns'. Grandmother Stephanie Bottrill, 52, walked across a motorway on May 4 last year after her local council allegedly told her she had to move out of her three-bedroom terrace house in Solihull, West Midlands, because of the spare room subsidy. A coroner has today recorded a verdict of suicide  saying the Government's housing policy had caused her 'considerable anxiety and stress'. But after the inquest, her brother, Kevin Owens - joined by Ms Bottrill’s sister, Josephine Trueman - told reporters she 'wasn’t prepared to give somebody else a chance' of a larger home. He said: 'For social housing to work it needs for everybody to take a turn.' 'When you’re adequately housed by successive governments, and your needs are met, you must give somebody else a turn. 'It’s terrible that people in this country are cramped into one and two-bedroom flats with children while other people sit on three-bedroom houses. 'Our thoughts go out to the lorry driver whose life has been blighted by this, and we just wanted to pass on our thoughts to him.' Mr Owens also disputed the claim his sister had made about being given half an hour to 'make a decision' on a house. He added: 'Much has been written about ""bedroom tax"" pushing her - it wasn’t, because prior to that she’d attempted suicide before and that hadn’t been reported before. 'It might have been the catalyst to push her but was it just an excuse she was looking for? - That’s all I’ve got to say.' During a hearing at Birmingham Coroners Court today, the Black County coroner, Zafar Siddique, said: 'Given the evidence of notes left of her intention, I am satisfied she intended to take her own life.' The case of Ms Bottrill, from Solihull, West Midlands, made headlines after son Steven Bottrill, 28, claimed that she had blamed the Government’s housing policy for death in a suicide note. The former postal worker, who lived alone in the three-bedroom terrace home, had agreed to go and see her GP the day before her death after her concerned daughter-in-law telephoned to make the appointment. Scroll down for video . Family: Her brother, Kevin Owens, who was at the hearing, condemned people 'sitting in three bedroom houses' like the one his sister owned in Solihull (pictured), while families were 'cramped' in smaller properties . Mr Siddique, summing up the evidence of Dr Bindu Nair, said that when Ms Bottrill attended - accompanied by her daughter Laura Bottrill - she had been 'clear-headed' and given a frank account of a history of anxiety. 'She informed me she had called her children in the early hours of May 3 2013, saying she couldn’t cope with the stress and wanted to end it all,' the GP said, in his statement to the coroner. Dr Nair added: 'She expressed unhappiness at being pushed by the housing department to make a decision in half an hour, in reference to being made to move into a smaller property.' He added that Ms Bottrill was 'happy to move but it was the way in which she was forced to make a decision' which had caused her 'considerable anxiety and stress'. Medical notes revealed Ms Bottrill had been seeing both a neurologist and her GP since 1993 with 'stress and depression from her life circumstances', her doctor said. Summarising, Mr Siddique said that in 2005 she took an overdose of anti-depressants over concern about her family. Then in June 2010, she was prescribed diazepam over a dispute with her neighbour after a fence was removed. Today’s inquest into Ms Bottrill’s death heard she had the option of a move from the three-bed address where she had lived for 20 years, to another a smaller property in Sheldon in Birmingham. Both her son and later her daughter had then moved out, leaving her alone. 'She was still coming to terms about whether to move or have to pay extra to stay in her current property,' said her GP, Dr Nair. He added that 'she felt she wasn’t given the time to make her decision'. The GP concluded she was 'not clinically depressed' and 'had shown insight into her problems', agreeing to come back to see the doctor a few days later. However, he was later to learn she had taken her own life. Reason: Mr Owens added that 'bedroom tax' may have been the catalyst that pushed her to walk in front of a lorry (not pictured) and questioned whether it was just the 'excuse she was looking for' In notes left for family members, summarised by Mr Siddique, Ms Bottrill had made clear her anxieties 'particularly in relation to the house move'. In one of the notes, addressed to her son Steven, 28, she wrote: 'Don’t blame yourself for me ending my life. The only people to blame are the Government.' Mr Siddique added: 'She also expressed the fact she did not blame her family and loved them very much but because of the housing changes she felt under considerable anxiety and stress.' A spokesman for Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council said there was 'never a requirement for Ms Bottrill to move'. The council said houses were not imposed on people; rather, householders selected from a council list of available properties, made bids on their choices, and in Ms Bottrill’s case she had been successful with two properties. 'The last contact we had with Ms Bottrill was that she wanted to talk about moving,' the spokesman said. 'It was never a situation where she would have been asked to make a decision in half an hour.' The council said Ms Bottrill had also been eligible for a discretionary housing payment of £3,000, a type of grant aimed at covering the costs of moving home.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . When Karen Atkinson fell into with the wrong crowd at the age of 11, her life took a chilling turn. What started with a few puffs of a cigarette eventually turned into a dangerous cocaine addiction. By 13 she’d dabbled in cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine and by 15 was an everyday user. ‘I lost touch with my school friends and became mainly interested in drugs, which was really sad,’ mum-of-one Karen, 30, from Billericay, told Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes on ITV’s This Morning. Scroll down for video . Karen Atkinson and her mum Linda shared their chilling story on This Morning . ‘My other friends were doing what teenagers do, but drugs took over. The drug of choice at the time was coke and all other drugs - like cannabis and ecstasy - were for weekends. But cocaine became an everyday thing. It seemed normal to me,' she admitted. ‘It was so expensive but it was being bought for me by the crowd I was in because they were older and earning money. And any money I had from birthdays or Christmases I would spend on drugs.’ ‘I knew my parents were so naive, which made me feel guilty. I knew in their wildest dreams they didn’t know what was going on.' Karen’s mum Linda, who also appeared on the programme, explained: ‘I didn’t see it coming. At 10 she was a lovely bubbly child who enjoyed sports and life and was always a pleasure to have around. I was very naive and I didn’t know anything about drugs.’ Karen Atkinson and her mum Linda with presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford . When Karen started becoming difficult and moody, Linda didn’t suspect drugs were involved. ‘I thought it was just the teenage years – the stroppiness and going off to the room. I obviously wish I had been more knowledgeable. It didn’t twig until she was 15 when someone phoned me to let me know. ‘I’ve never thought my children were angels, but I didn’t expect anything to this point.’ It was only when Karen confided in a family friend that Linda found out the truth. Karen Atkinson was addicted to cocaine by the age of 15 . ‘It was a really traumatic time and obviously there was a lot of guilt,’ Linda recalled. But even when her parents were trying to help her quit, Karen continued to take the class A drug: ‘They tried everything,’ she said of her parents’ efforts. ‘They’d lock me in my room, but I’d climb out the window. It took the harshest of experiences for Karen to wake up to where her life was heading. ‘I ended up seeing people overdose, go to prison, and die. I realised it was not what I wanted.’ When all Karen's friends were doing their GCSE’s Karen was in rehab on day release. ‘I switched my whole group of friends and I was so grateful to my other friends who were still there for me,’ she said. It’s been 11 years since Karen has been clean and she’s now trying to turn those years of addiction into a positive for other addicts, by helping parents spot the signs of drug abuse. ‘Mum and dad have always said that they wished they’d known more and could have helped more. It’s all well and good having the dangers of drugs being taught at school, but parents also need the knowledge and confidence and to talk about things. 'Prevention would have been better than a cure,' she said. Karen has now produced a 40-minute DVD for parents and teenagers called Think About IT, which tackles smoking, drinking, drugs as well as sex. Linda admitted, ‘I wish there had been more out there about drugs at the time. I didn’t have a clue.’ Rebecca’s DVD is available on her website, www.realiteen.co.uk .","Karen Atkinson, 30, from Billericay, was 11 when she tried tobacco .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The New York Times editorial board on Saturday endorsed a repeal of the federal ban on marijuana, becoming the largest paper in the nation to back the idea as it compared the U.S. government's stance on America's most widely used illicit drug to the prohibition on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. The post on the newspaper's website is part of an editorial series that in the coming days will explore different aspects of marijuana use, from health effects to how the criminal justice system treats it. 'It took 13 years for the United States to come to its senses and end Prohibition, 13 years in which people kept drinking, otherwise law-abiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished,' the editorial states. Forward thinking? The New York Times suggested in an editorial published Saturday that the United States make pot legal . 'It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana, inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol.' The editorial under the headline 'Repeal Prohibition, Again' comes less than two years after voters in Washington state and Colorado became the first in the nation to sanction taxing and regulating pot at the state level for recreational users 21 years and older. Marijuana stores have since opened in both states. A number of other states, including Oregon and Alaska, will vote this year on whether to take the same step, and polls from the Pew Research Center and Gallup have shown a majority of Americans support legalizing weed. The New York Times editorial cites the 658,000 arrests nationwide for marijuana possession in 2012, and the fact such arrests disproportionately ensnare young African American men. Quick work: The call comes less than two years after voters in Washington state and Colorado became the first in the nation to sanction taxing and regulating pot at the state level . It also finds moderate pot use poses no risk to otherwise healthy adults, but that concerns about the drug's effects on the adolescent brain should merit banning its use by those under the age of 21. The New York Times, which on its editorial Web page showed a U.S. flag with its stars morphing into marijuana leaves, is the largest newspaper in the nation to take an editorial position calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana. 'I think it’s playing right into the hands of this big (marijuana) industry that seeks only to increase addiction while reaping profits,” said Kevin Sabet, co-founder of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalization. A number of smaller newspapers, including the Newark, New Jersey-based Star-Ledger, have called for some form of legalizing or decriminalizing pot, which over 20 U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow for medical use. Evidence: The New York Times editorial cites the 658,000 arrests nationwide for marijuana possession in 2012, and the fact such arrests disproportionately ensnare young African American men . ALASKA (legalization)Alaska may seem like an unlikely place to follow the lead of liberals in Colorado and Washington, but the state's libertarian electorate may provide a good look at how a different breed of voters will respond to marijuana legalization. It's early, but proponents have a big head start on fundraising and organization, led by the Marijuana Policy Project based in Washington, D.C. Marijuana legalization failed in Alaska in 2000 and 2004, but advocates say the landscape has changed markedly since then.If the measure is approved, adults could use marijuana legally and purchase it at state-licensed stores, but use in public would still be illegal. OREGON (legalization)Oregonians rejected legalization just two years ago but are all but certain to have a chance to reconsider this November. State elections officials haven't yet validated the signatures turned in last week, but advocates submitted far more than they needed. Oregon has long been on the leading edge of the decades-long push to loosen marijuana laws. It was the first state to decriminalize small-scale marijuana possession in 1973 — a step that's been taken in more than a dozen other states. Marijuana use remains illegal, but possession of a small amount of the drug is punished with a citation and fine rather than a criminal charge.  Oregon was also among the first states to approve medical marijuana. Unlike Oregon's 2012 effort, the team behind the current initiative has strong backing from many of the groups and individuals who helped bankroll the successful campaigns in Colorado and Washington. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (legalization)The D.C. Cannabis Campaign says the group submitted 55,000 signatures for a legalization initiative on Monday — twice the number required to put the issue before voters. The measure would allow possession of up to two ounces of marijuana in the nation's capital. But the effort could be frustrated by Congress, which reviews all new laws in the District and has moved to block its other recent efforts to ease up on marijuana laws. Last month, the Republican-controlled House took a big step toward blocking a decriminalization bill passed by city lawmakers. That measure would make marijuana possession a civil offense subject to a $25 fine, one of the lowest in the nation. Congress used a similar amendment to block the District from implementing its medical marijuana program for 10 years. FLORIDA (medical)The push for more liberal marijuana laws is not limited to full legalization of the drug. Florida voters will be deciding whether to allow the drug for medicinal use. A poll by Quinnipiac University in May found overwhelming support for medical marijuana in Florida, where it will require support from 60 percent of voters to pass in November. Nearly 9 out of 10 voters said they support allowing adults to use the drug for medical purposes. Support was over 80 percent for all age groups. State lawmakers voted this year to legalize a strain of low-potency marijuana to treat epilepsy and cancer patients. NEW YORK (medical)New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill earlier this month making his state the 23rd to allow medical marijuana, though his state will have one of the most restrictive programs in the country. The drug isn't expected to be available for at least 19 months while the state works out regulations.Patients with one of 10 diseases will be allowed to use the drug, but it must be ingested or vaporized; smoking it will remain illegal. Some advocates argued it is too restrictive but called it an important step.","Pot laws disproportionately impact young black men and its addiction is a 'relatively minor problems' when compared with alcohol and tobacco .

"By . James Tozer . A lonely police worker who became addicted to Nurofen Plus for her back pain died after taking a cocktail of illegal drugs. Nikola Bradford, 36, became so hooked on the over-the-counter tablets that she tried to kick her habit by urging local chemists not to sell them to her, an inquest heard. But the communications officer became depressed that she was single and working unsociable hours while friends were settling down and starting families, and began travelling to nearby towns to buy the pills, her mother revealed. Nikola Bradford, seen here on the left enjoying a night out with friends, started taking Nurofen for back pain after falling down some stairs but soon became addicted to it . Miss Bradford was eventually admitted to hospital after taking 32 of the tablets, which can become addictive because they contain codeine as well as ibuprofen. She recovered, but just days later she inexplicably took a fatal overdose of cocaine, amphetamines and Ecstasy, the inquest heard. She had begun taking painkillers for migraines in her teens, the hearing was told, and was badly affected by the loss of her father in a road accident in 2001. Toxicology tests showed Miss Bradford had large amounts of cocaine in her system and had also taken  amphetamines and ecstasy . Her troubles with Nurofen Plus began after the breakdown of a relationship in 2005 and a fall down stairs in 2010, after which she required surgery on fractured vertebrae. Her mother, Dianne Westwell, told the hearing she had lost friends because of the unsociable hours she worked in her job with Greater Manchester Police. ‘That was half her problem – a lot of her friends were married with children and she found it very difficult with the work pattern she had to go out with friends,’ she said. ‘She was very lonely. She complained of back pain quite often.’ On November 21 last year one of her daughter’s colleagues called her to say Miss Bradford was . ‘unsteady on her feet and didn’t appear herself’. Mrs Westwell said: ‘She looked like she was drunk. She was slurring her words. She said she hadn’t taken any tablets but from her demeanour it was obvious.’ An empty 32-pill packet of Nurofen Plus was found in Miss Bradford’s bag. She was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed with a kidney problem and told to stop taking ibuprofen. Mrs Westwell said her daughter seemed ‘happy’ when she saw her on November 27. But three days later she failed to respond to an invitation to Sunday lunch and her body was found at her Bolton home. Her sister Erika told the inquest how, in the run-up to the tragedy, she had told her sister to ‘sort herself out’ as the pair argued by text message. Miss Bradford was so addicted to Nurofen that she asked her local chemists to stop selling them to her . ‘She had told the chemist in the past when she had wanted to stop [taking Nurofen] not to serve her,’ she said. ‘When she went back to taking it that’s when she would travel because everyone locally knew not to sell it.’ According to Miss Bradford’s family, she used to take both Nurofen – which only contains ibuprofen – and Nurofen Plus. Toxicology tests showed that she had not taken Nurofen on the day of her death but that there were fatal levels of cocaine, and she had taken amphetamines and Ecstasy. Many popular pills taken for headaches, sore backs, migraines and period pain contain codeine, a powerful painkiller from the same family of drugs as heroin and morphine. It makes people feel relaxed, so even if the pain has gone, some people will keep taking it for the calming effect – leading them to become addicted. It is available without prescription in low doses and can be combined with paracetamol or ibuprofen – as in Nurofen plus. Side-effects of codeine range from drowsiness and dizziness to fits and heart rhythm problems. With 25million packs of painkillers containing codeine sold over the counter each year in the UK, it is feared that tens of thousands of people could be addicted to tablets such as Nurofen Plus, Panadol Ultra, Migraleve and other tablets available without prescription. Young, female professionals are believed to be particularly vulnerable. Packs are limited to 32 tablets, contain warnings about addiction and can only be sold under the supervision of a pharmacist. Ibuprofen, the second ingredient in Nurofen Plus, is also not without risk. Side-effects include indigestion, stomach ulcers and an increased risk of stroke and heart attack. It should not be taken by anyone with kidney problems. The family were unaware she was using illegal drugs as well. Coroner Alan Walsh recorded that her death was as a result of drug misuse but said mystery surrounded how she had obtained illicit drugs. Recording a narrative verdict at the hearing in Bolton, he said: ‘She found relief in pain by taking Nurofen, it is available over the counter and she became quite addicted. ‘It’s sad that she felt the need to take these illicit drugs.’ NHS guidelines and information on packets advise against taking Nurofen Plus for more than three days in a row as the codeine makes it addictive.","Nikola Bradford had cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy in her system .

"By . James Slack . and Jack Doyle . and Kieran Corcoran . On the run: Somali-born jihadist Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have been in possession of his passport when he cut off his tag . A police blunder saw officers wait 48 hours to quiz cab drivers over the disappearance of terror suspect Mohammed . Ahmed Mohamed -  despite fearing he had used a taxi to escape authorities while dressed in a . burka, it has been claimed. The 27-year-old Somalian, was last seen dressed in a burka leaving the An-Noor Masjid mosque in Acton, West London last Friday. But it was not until Sunday that Police began questioning some of the many local private car firms in the area. The suspect, whose alleged offences . include unauthorised internet access and illicit meetings, faced 20 . charges and had previously spent almost nine months in police custody. A controller at Churchill Radio Cars in Acton told MailOnline that Police had visited him on Wednesday explaining they were trying to trace the man in the Burka. Officers had asked him to provide a list of all the jobs they had taken for the Friday afternoon. And a controller at cab firm West London Cars said officers had visited him on the Sunday and asked for a list of all the jobs done by eight of their drivers who were working on the Friday afternoon. He told the Daily Mirror: 'They were very secretive and didn't say what it was for.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said the police were unable to comment for 'operational reasons'. He said: 'Extensive inquiries are continuing to trace Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed.' Yesterday, the Crown Prosecution Service revealed that he had been held for four months at the start of this year, before being bailed in April. It also said that he had been in custody between October 2011 and February 2012. A warrant was issued today for Mohamed's arrest after he failed to attend the Old Bailey for a hearing related to his charges. The revelation came as it was claimed . Mohamed may even have had his passport with him when he escaped the . authorities by cutting off his ankle tag. The details of how easily he got away heaped fresh pressure on the Home Office and police yesterday.

Sources . revealed how the terror suspect removed the ankle tag, fitted as a . condition of his terrorism prevention order (T-Pim), after entering the . An-Noor mosque in west London last Friday. He had arrived at 10am and left at 3.15pm. The tag sent a ‘tamper-alert’ to its maker, private security firm G4S, which then rang Mohamed to check where he was. It was only when he did not respond to the call that police and the Home Office were alerted. But by the time officers arrived he had disappeared. Admission: Theresa May was forced to admit inadvertently misleading Parliament when she said on Monday police had seized the fanatic's travel document. In fact, officers were never able to find one . Security officials launched a major manhunt for the jihadist, but fear he may already have fled to Somalia. On Monday, Mrs May told MPs  that police had Mohamed’s British passport. But . yesterday she said Mohamed was not in possession of his British . passport when he returned to the UK after being arrested overseas, so . ‘there was no passport for the police to seize’.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . BBC bosses have been forced to knock down a conspiracy theory circulating online that one of their Middle East correspondents was pulled from the air after a complaint by Israel. Rumours emerged on Twitter that Jeremy Bowen had incensed the Israelis by making 'pro-Hamas' comments in a recent article. Writing in the New Statesman last month, the veteran broadcaster said he had not seen 'any evidence' that Hamas had used Palestinian civilians as human shields. Scroll down for video . Twitterstorm: This false statement which emerged online has fuelled a conspiracy theory that BBC reporter Jeremy Bowen was pulled from the air after a complaint from Israel that he made 'pro-Hamas' comments . A few days later, he disappeared from TV screens and has not been seen since, prompting a flurry of speculation. Among them was a mocked-up image of Mr Bowen next to the BBC logo with a false statement giving the reasons for his apparent departure. It read: 'BBC has removed Jeremy Bowen from Gaza, its most experienced Middle East correspondent for saying ""He (sic) had not see any evidence of Hamas using civilians as human shields"". 'Israel complaint (sic) to BBC and said that this was pro-Hamas and BBC immediately pulled him out of Gaza.' On holiday: The rumours circulated despite the veteran broadcaster tweeting that he was on annual leave . The image was quickly retweeted and within the space of 12 hours his name had appeared on the social networking site more than 3,000 times, it was noted by BBC Trending.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain will continue to 'tighten the screw' on Russia with increased sanctions unless it pulls back from eastern Ukraine, Philip Hammond warned today. The Foreign Secretary admitted Britain will suffer some economic pain from trade embargoes with Russia, but insisted: 'You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.' The European Union last night agreed a new crackdown on against vast sectors of the Russian economy, designed to cripple its banks, energy firms and defence capabilities. Russian President Vladmir Putin will continue to be targeted with economic sanctions until he behaves 'properly', the UK government has warned . The EU imposed an arms embargo, banking curbs and a ban on trade in sensitive and dual-use technologies to punish Russia for its actions in its neighbouring country. A further eight Russians will also face asset freezes and travel bans. Global pressure is mounting on Russia to co-operate with the investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The international community believes it was shot down by pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine, almost certainly using a missile from Russia. There are growing calls for Mr Putin to stop the supply of dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists. But Mr Hammond insisted the latest round of sanctions was not the end of it, and Britain would continue to 'ratchet' up pressure on Moscow until Vladmir Putin behaves 'properly'. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond admitted Britain will suffer some economic pain from trade embargoes with Russia . He told BBC Breakfast: 'This is a tough new set of sanctions which we’ve led the way on getting agreed in Europe. 'The whole idea is to have a ratchet here. Every time something happens, every time the Russians fail to respond to international demands, we will tighten the screw a little bit more.' Mr Hammon admitted that the British economy would also take a hit as a result of the econmic crackdown, but insisted: 'The sanctions package is designed to hurt Russia more than it hurts us, but it would be absurd to suggest that we could impose wide-ranging on the Russian economy without also having some impact on ourselves. 'But if we are going to take a stand against Russian aggression, if we are going to insist on Russia behaving like a civilised nation in the modern world then we have to be prepared to pay the price for doing that.' He later told Sky News that the measures had been 'designed to maximise the impact on Russia and minimise the impact on EU economies'.He later . But he added: 'You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs, and if we want to impose economic pain on Russia in order to try to encourage it to behave properly in eastern Ukraine and to give access to the crash site, then we have to be prepared to take these measures.' The White House swiftly followed up the EU's announcement with a fresh round of sanctions of its own, targeting three Russian banks. US president Barack Obama said: 'Today Russia is once again isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of genuine progress. 'It does not have to be this way. This a choice Russia and president Putin has made.' David Cameron yesterday met families of British victims of the atrocity, as he warned Russia has failed to stem the flow of weapons across the border to Ukraine since a surface-to-air missile was used to destroy flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board. Barry Sweeney, whose 28-year-old son Liam died in the July 17 crash, said: 'We basically asked Mr Cameron just to help. The talking I suppose has got to stop and the doing has got to be done. 'I feel very angry and frustrated. It would be nice if they could just stop fighting for a little bit so that we could get all our boys and girls home.' Barry Sweeney, whose son Liam was among 10 Britons killed in the atrocity, is pictured arriving at Downing Street for the meeting with David Cameron . Mr Sweeney, whose son Liam was among 10 Britons killed in the atrocity, said he was meeting the Prime Minister 'under not very nice circumstances' The Prime Minister said: ‘We must do everything we can to make that crash site is properly managed; that their loved ones are brought home and that everything that can be done on that front is being done.’ Mr Cameron added: 'The sanctions really relate to Vladimir Putin's and Russia's behaviour, and we want to make it absolutely clear that Russia's behaviour in destabilising another country - Ukraine - is unacceptable.' Europe's arms embargo will block any trade with Russia in weapons or 'related material'. With its own major arms industry stemming from the era of Cold War isolation, Russia has little need to import weapons from the EU, but sells more than 3billion euros worth a year to member states. However, the embargo will apply only to future contracts, so one big deal that won't be affected is the heavily criticised 1.2billion-euro sale of two French helicopter carriers to Russia, which has already been agreed. The EU's banking curbs are a more significant step. They will deny Russia's state-owned banks access to European capital markets by banning Europeans from buying their bonds, equities or financial instruments with a higher maturity than 90 days. Global pressure is mounting on Russia to co-operate with the investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 . The measures were agreed as world aviation chiefs set up a 'senior level' international task force to deal with the threat to passenger planes following the downing of flight MH17. A top-level safety conference involving more than 190 nations will also take place in February under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Following a meeting of global aviation bodies in Montreal, ICAO's secretary general Raymond Benjamin said all the aviation bodies 'strongly condemned the use of weapons against the civilian aircraft'. European Council president Herman van Rompuy said the new EU sanctions had been imposed after Russia ignored calls to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, with arms and fighters continuing to flow across the border in support of the pro-Moscow separatist rebels. 'It is meant as a strong warning: illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilisation of a neighbouring sovereign country cannot be accepted in 21st century Europe,' he said. 'Furthermore, when the violence created spirals out of control and leads to the killing of almost 300 innocent civilians in their flight from the Netherlands to Malaysia, the situation requires an urgent and determined response.' Meanwhile, US secretary of state John Kerry accused separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine of showing 'an appalling disrespect for human decency' in carrying on fighting close to the site where MH17 crashed after apparently being shot out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile. The fact that not all the remains of the 298 victims of the disaster had yet been recovered had placed 'an unsupportable burden on families', who 'clearly deserve a thorough, international investigation', Mr Kerry said in a Washington DC press conference. Signs were emerging of concern in the City of London about the possible blowback sanctions on Russia could inflict on the UK economy. Energy giant BP - which owns a 20 per cent stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft - warned that further international sanctions could have a 'material adverse impact' on the company's business in Russia and its own financial position.

"By . Ruth Styles . With six grandchildren of her own, among them the third in line to the throne, the Duchess of Cornwall is no stranger to the demands of small children. And she had ample opportunity to show off her childcare skills when a young well-wisher's hat was blown off in front of her during a walkabout in Rutland. Her face wreathed in smiles, the Duchess swiftly picked up the pink hat and tried to put it back on the little girl's head - much to her displeasure and her mother's delight. Scroll down for video . Is that yours? Camilla came to the rescue after a little girl dropped her hat during a visit to Oakham in Rutland . Time to get dressed: The Duchess, a grandmother of six, then attempted to replace the hat on the child's head . Not wearing it! Despite Camilla's best efforts, the tot pulled her hat off again each time . After three attempts, the Duchess chuckled ruefully and handed the garment to the toddler's mother before rushing to catch up with Prince Charles who was saying hello to another well-wisher. The royal couple were in the quaint market town of Oakham in the Midlands county to tour the St John and St Anne Almshouse, which provides a home for local retirees. Prince Charles is patron of the Almshouse Association and during the visit, met some of the residents as well as unveiling a commemorative plaque. Afterwards, the two were driven into Oakham where they met local well-wishers, among them the hat-averse toddler, before stopping for a beer and touring the market. Camilla, who was elegant in a cream jacket and patterned skirt, certainly seemed to enjoy hers - although perhaps not as much as Prince Charles who smiled broadly as he sipped his half pint. I give up! The Duchess gave up after a third attempt was foiled and handed the hat to the child's mother . Nice to meet you: The Duchess beamed as she chatted to young well-wishers during the walkabout . Swapping tips? Camilla, who has six grandchildren of her own, chatted to a young father of twins . Also giving the famously eco-conscious royal a reason to smile were the market stalls, which included several that showcased sustainable production methods - among them Northfield Farm, which runs a herd of rare breed Dexter Cattle on its land, and Rutland Biodynamics. Later, a troupe of Morris Dancers arrived to give a performance before a detour to Oakham Castle allowed the Duchess to take part in a local custom: presenting a floral horseshoe to the Lord of the Manor. According to tradition, any peer of the realm or senior member of the royal family visiting Oakham for the first time should present the Lord of the Manor, currently Jos Hanbury, with a horseshoe.

"By . Ian Lloyd . Sonia met the Queen while out playing in Hamilton Gardens, behind the Yorks' London home aged four . One of the highlights of the Royal Childhood exhibition which opens at Buckingham Palace today is the Queen's unfinished novel, written when she was just eight. As we revealed exclusively in Weekend last week, it was called The Happy Farm and dedicated 'To Sonia, My dear little friend and lover of horses.' And now we can reveal who Sonia was - the girl who became 'my dear little friend' to the most famous woman in the world. It all began in 1930 when, aged just four, Princess Elizabeth of York bumped into Sonia Graham-Hodgson while out playing in Hamilton Gardens, behind the Yorks' London home, 145 Piccadilly, a stone's throw from Hyde Park. The meeting was significant because, as Elizabeth's governess Marion Crawford recorded, 'Sonia was the one friend whom the Queen chose for herself.' The princess was the eldest child of George V's second son, Albert, Duke of York, and his wife the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Her existing circle of friends consisted of cousins - near and distant from both sides of the family - and the selected offspring of aristocrats and courtiers. While Sonia wasn't from the highest echelons of society, she was certainly from a comfortable background. Not only was she a neighbour of the Yorks but her father, Dr Harold Graham-Hodgson, was also one of the country's leading authorities on the diagnostic use of X-rays. In November 1928, King George V, Elizabeth's beloved 'Grandpapa England', fell dangerously ill with a streptococcal infection of the chest. Graham-Hodgson was called in to corroborate the diagnosis. He brought his cumbersome equipment to Buckingham Palace on a lorry, fed the cables through a window and took his X-ray plates in as the king lay in bed. It was the first time  X-rays had been taken of a patient outside a main hospital, and after his recovery the grateful monarch made the specialist a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, which was later upgraded to a knighthood by Elizabeth's father. Two years later little Elizabeth asked the doctor's daughter, 'Will you come and play with me?' Speaking in her 80s, Sonia recalled, 'We played French cricket. She was wearing a pink and white check dress and I was wearing a blue coat,' although she conceded that seven decades later 'we always argue over what we were wearing'. Scroll down for video . Close friends: Sonia Berry, who sadly died in 2012, (right) with the Queen in Hyde Park as a young girl . After playing for an hour in Hamilton Gardens, they left to have their tea and the princess said, 'Goodbye. See you tomorrow.' They would go on to see each other nearly every day after that, apart from family holidays, until Elizabeth moved to Buckingham Palace seven years later. Looking back, Sonia recalled the princess as 'a thoughtful and sensitive child, and naturally well-behaved. She never seemed aware of her position and paid no attention to the people who stood by the railings to watch her play.' 'The Duke of York relished a game of Sardines' The girls were usually accompanied by their nannies, and occasionally left the seclusion of their private garden to play in the other London parks. A charming press photo of the time shows the girls walking hand in hand through Hyde Park, with Sonia a good five or six inches taller than the princess despite being only eight months her senior. The two learned to skip, played hopscotch, and took dancing lessons together. 'I suppose I was the bossy one,' Sonia admitted in 2006. 'I think it was usually me who decided what games we should play.' Sometimes Elizabeth's father joined in, particularly relishing the hide-and- seek game of Sardines. 'I remember my starchy nanny saying she found it very undignified having to hide in a bush with him.' At first Sonia had no idea her friend was a princess, although it was soon made clear. 'I had to curtsey to the Duke and Duchess of York and to Queen Mary,' though she was allowed to call Elizabeth by her pet name of Lilibet. The Queen's handwritten novel that she dedicated to Sonia . This changed in 1936 when, with the abdication of Edward VIII, Elizabeth's parents became king and queen and Sonia's ten-year-old friend became Heiress Presumptive. 'And so things became more formal,' Sonia remembered. 'We called her Princess and curtsied to her. She grew up a lot and became, well, more serious.' The Royal Family moved out of their home at 145 Piccadilly and into first floor apartments at Buckingham Palace. Elizabeth's 30 toy horses went with her, apart from a favourite one called Ben, which she was concerned 'would not like being packed away in a removal van and put in storage. So she asked me to look after him,' recalled Sonia. A couple of weeks later Elizabeth wrote and asked Sonia to come round to the palace and to bring Ben with her. During the war Elizabeth was sent firstly to Balmoral and then to Windsor and the two girls didn't see each other for the duration. In October 1940, at the height of the Blitz, 145 Piccadilly - which was unoccupied at the time - suffered a direct hit, destroying most of the house's back and interior. The elegant façade remained intact until the 1960s when it was pulled down to make way for a road-widening project around Hyde Park Corner and the construction of the Intercontinental Hotel between 1968 and 1975. Today the hotel's Wellington Lounge occupies the former site of No 145 and honours its former occupants by offering traditional afternoon teas 'for an experience fit for Royalty'. The friends were reunited when Elizabeth took her fiancé, Lt Philip Mountbatten, with her to Sonia's 21st birthday. 'He was very good-looking and I could tell the Queen was very fond of him,' Sonia remembered. 'I was there at their wedding in Westminster Abbey and had a marvellous seat up near the front. It was all terribly impressive; and the Queen looked so happy.' The two friends continued to meet from time to time at Sonia's house for tea or dinner parties even after Elizabeth became Queen in 1952. Firm friends: The girls riding their tricycles in the park in 1933 accompanied by their nannies . 'She used to say how nice it was to get out of Buckingham Palace,' and 'once she had arrived here, she was completely at ease.' In October 1953 Sonia married Anthony Berry, who had proposed to her outside the palace on Coronation Day. With the newly crowned Elizabeth's permission, the ceremony took place at the Queen's Chapel, St James's Palace, and the Dean of Windsor officiated. Berry was a director of the prestigious London wine firm, Berry Bros & Rudd, based at 3 St James's Street, which has supplied the British Royal Family since the reign of George III. He and Sonia had two children, a daughter Victoria and a son Simon. The latter is now chairman of the family firm and in 2007, to the delight of his parents, became Clerk of the Royal Cellars, responsible for drawing up the royal wine list and selecting wines and spirits for the Queen's cellar at Buckingham Palace and other official residences. The Berrys retired to a spacious apartment in a Georgian crescent in Bath, where signed photos of the young Elizabeth were a reminder of her special royal friendship. 'She used to say how nice it was to get out of Buckingham Palace, once she had arrived at my house, she was completely at ease' Sonia was occasionally invited to royal parties and in March 2004 was at the Ritz Hotel when the Queen hosted a gathering for friends and family. The two also exchanged letters and cards and in 2006 Sonia sent the Queen an 80th birthday greeting and a silk scarf as a present. In a rare public comment that year she paid tribute to her friend and monarch. 'She has taken the job tremendously seriously and made a great success of it. The Queen was determined that she would work hard; not just enjoy the privileges. 'She has wonderful dedication. She is absolutely steadfast and sets an example to other people. Perhaps at one point she was a little too remote - out of shyness - but that has changed too. I feel terribly privileged to have been her friend for so long. I am very lucky.' Sonia Berry died peacefully at home on 16 March, 2012, at the age of 86, two years after the death of her husband. They left their two children, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild. She also left many memories for the Queen of a special relationship that began on a summer's day over eight decades earlier when a four-year-old princess, isolated in that rarefied world of pre-war royalty, just needed someone to play with.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today promised the families of Britons killed in the Malaysian Airlines atrocity he will do ‘everything we can’ to bring their loved ones home. The Prime Minister today met relatives of some of the 10 UK nationals among the 298 passengers and crew killed when flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Barry Sweeney, whose son Liam was among those killed, said after the meeting: 'I feel very angry and frustrated. It would be nice if they could just stop fighting for a little bit so that we could get all our boys and girls home.' Scroll down for video . Barry Sweeney, whose son Liam was among 10 Britons killed in the atrocity, is pictured arriving at Downing Street for the meeting with David Cameron . Mr Sweeney, whose son Liam was among 10 Britons killed in the atrocity, said he was meeting the Prime Minister 'under not very nice circumstances' Downing Street said David Cameron wanted to 'establish if there are more things that we should be looking at and doing' The process of retrieving the remains of all of those killed has been hampered by masked and armed pro-separatist militiamen, backed by Russia. Speaking ahead of the meeting today, Mr Cameron told Sky News: ‘I am sure that the first concern of the bereaved families is that their loved ones are treated with respect and dignity. ‘We must do everything we can to make that crash site is properly managed; that their loved ones are brought home and that everything that can be done on that front is being done.’ He held talks with the families in Number 10 as the European Union agreed a fresh round of sanctions to tighten the economic stranglehold on Russia. The new measures will include an arms embargo, a ban on the sale of dual use and sensitive technologies, and a ban on the sale of bonds and equities by state-owned Russian banks in European capital markets. Eight more officials - including four members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle - are also expected to be subjected to asset bans and travel freezes. The White House indicated that additional US sanctions can be expected to follow the EU announcement. Mr Cameron added: ‘The sanctions relate to Vladimir Putin and Russia’s behaviour. 'We want to make it absolutely clear that Russia’s behaviour in destabilising another country is unacceptable and therefore the EU with the US will be imposing further sanctions unless that behaviour changes. ‘We are united in sending that tough message, and it is a message that will be backed by tough action.’ Mr Cameron said he wanted to ensure the bodies of those killed were 'treated with respect and dignity' As the families' representatives met in Number 10, the EU agreed a new package of tough sanctions to tighten the stranglehold on Russia . In addition to the 10 Britons, there were 193 Dutch and 43 Malaysian people on MH17 when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on 17 July en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board. So far 227 coffins containing an unknown number of victims have been taken from the site for identification in Hilversum, near Amsterdam. One person, a Dutch citizen, has been formally identified. Among the Britons killed were John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were ardent Newcastle United fans killed on their way to a pre-season tour of New Zealand. The Prime Minister, who visited an immigration raid in Slough today, said Britain would continue to step up pressure on Russia through sanctions to ensure investigators get full access to the crash site . After the meeting, his mother Angela Sweeney said she was strugglling to cope with the lack of information coming from the investigation. She said: 'Just functioning really. Just waiting and my liaison officers have been very, very nice. It's just the waiting is the worst bit.' The couple were among seven of the 10 families of British victims on the downed flight who attended an hour long meeting with Mr Cameron. Mr Sweeney, 52, from Killingworth, North Tyneside, said the relatives had 'probably not' been told anything they did not already know but told how the families asked the Prime Minister for help. He said: 'I've got to say Mr Cameron was very humble. He answered every question that was asked of him. He brought a few experts in to talk about crash sites and how the airplane might have come down.' 'We basically asked Mr Cameron just to help. The talking I suppose has got to stop and the doing has got to be done.' He said the family did not know if their son's body remained at the crash site or if it had been taken to the Netherlands. 'It's very difficult but unfortunately we are going to have to wait to find out,' he added. US secretary of state John Kerry said it was 'unacceptable' that investigators still had not got access to the crash site . Meanwhile, US secretary of state John Kerry warned pro-Russian separatists are showing 'an appalling disrespect for human decency' in carrying on fighting close to the MD17 crash site . The fact that not all the remains of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines disaster in Ukraine had yet been recovered had placed 'an unsupportable burden on families', Mr Kerry said. Speaking in Washington DC, Mr Kerry said it was 'unacceptable' that investigators still had not got access to the crash site. Saying that the Malaysia Airlines plane had been 'tragically shot out of the sky', Mr Kerry added that the victims of the crash and their families 'clearly deserve a thorough, international investigation'. Such a probe was supported by the United States, he said, adding that America supported the efforts of the Malaysians, the Dutch and the Australians to secure the crash site. Mr Kerry went on: 'It's absolutely important that separatists stand back to allow access to the site. It is 10 days since the crash and investigators have still not received full, unfettered access to the crash site. They have no way of collecting debris. 'They still cannot ensure that the victims' remains are recovered. That is an unsupportable burden for the families and an unacceptable standard of behaviour.' He continued: 'Russia meeds to use its considerable influence among separatists to ensure this basic approach to common decency. President (Vladimir) Putin can make a huge difference here is he chooses.' British lawyer John Allen, 44, died with his Dutch wife Sandra and their three children, Christopher, Ian and Julian.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Virgin Atlantic has become the latest major airline to ban flights over Iraq amid the growing threat of passenger jets being shot out of the sky. The decision by Richard Branson’s airline comes after Emirates announced it would stop flying over Iraq because of security fears. Air France-KLM, Air Berlin and Poland’s LOT have followed suit. World aviation bosses last night agree to set up a senior-level task force to deal with growing concerns about flight safety, in the wake of the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives. Scroll down for video . Pro-Russian separatists have been blamed for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flightin eastern Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has urged Moscow to ‘stop the supply of these dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists, which is what has given rise to the disaster with the Malaysian airliner’. However, there are growing fears that insurgents in Iraq could also target passenger flights. The country lies on the border of the main flight path between Europe and Asia, with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day. A popular route is over the Iraqi city of Mosul, a stronghold of ISIS militants. Lufthansa, the main German carrier, has said it will avoid some parts of Iraq, but Qantas has insisted passengers on its Dubai to London flights will continue to fly through Iraqi airspace. British Airways is also continuing to use Iraqi airspace, emphasising the need for clarity about just which routes are safe to fly. International Air Transport Association director general and chief executive Tony Tyler said: 'The tragic shooting down of MH17 was an attack on the whole air transport industry. 'The world's airlines are angry. Civil aircraft are instruments of peace. They should not be the target of weapons of war.’ He went on: 'We were told that flights traversing Ukraine's territory at above 32,000 feet would not be in harm's way. We now know how wrong that guidance was. It is essential that airlines receive clear guidance regarding threats to their passengers, crew and aircraft.’ Last night UN body the International Civil Aviation Organisation announced plans to better share data about the threat posed to civilian flights. A meeting at its headquarters in Montreal agreed information that could affect the safety of airline passengers and crews should be effectively collected and disseminated. The British government accuses Russia of putting the 'dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists' leading to the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine . There are fears IS militia could attempt to shoot down passenger jets flying through Iraqi airspace . The aviation industry has called for the ICAO to also look at the need to incorporate into international law, through appropriate UN frameworks, measures to govern the design, manufacture and deployment of modern anti-aircraft weaponry. The ICAO said it was also convening a high-level safety conference with all of its 191 member states in February 2015. The organisation's secretary general Raymond Benjamin said all the aviation bodies 'strongly condemned the use of weapons against the civilian aircraft'. He described the downing of MH17, with the loss of 298 lives including 10 Britons, as 'unacceptable' and he sent the aviation world's 'deepest condolences' to the families of the victims. Jim McAuslan, general secretary of British pilots' organisation Balpa, said: 'It is reassuring that the UN aviation body and airlines accept that there is a problem with the lack of clear, uniform rules and information guiding pilots on when they should not fly over conflict areas. 'What we need now is action from the working group. The flawed current system allowed 298 innocent passengers, pilots and crew to become targets in a war and pilots want to see a solid and serious solution to stop this ever happening again.' He went on: 'We will be asking the British Government to lead the way and urgently push for a safety-first approach that would protect British passengers whatever airline they are flying with and wherever they are travelling.' Jeff Poole, director general of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (Canso) said: 'The downing of Flight MH17 raises vital questions about the safety of aircraft over conflict zones. 'The incident shows that there are gaps in the overall management of airspace.'","Richard Branson's airline becomes the latest to stop using Iraqi airspace .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Vladimir Putin has been branded a ‘thug’ and a ‘liar’ by one of Britain’s top diplomats as the European Union turned the screw on Russia's banks, arms traders and energy firms. Sir Peter Westmacott, the UK ambassador to the US, said Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine was starting to look like ‘the wrong call’ and the West’s firm response to the downing of Malaysian Airlines plane was starting to have an impact. David Cameron met families of British victims of the atrocity today, as he warns Russia has failed to stem the flow of weapons across the border to Ukraine since a surface-to-air missile was used to destroy flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board. Sir Peter Westmacott, the UK ambassador to the US, branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a ‘thug’ and a ‘liar’ EU diplomats met in Brussels today to agree a fresh round of sanctions designed to cripple the Russian economy and target allies of Vladimir Putin. The new measures include an arms embargo, a ban on the sale of dual use and sensitive technologies, and a ban on the sale of bonds and equities by state-owned Russian banks in European capital markets. Eight more officials - including four members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle - are also expected to be subjected to asset bans and travel freezes. The White House indicated that additional US sanctions can be expected to follow the EU announcement. Mr Cameron said: ‘The sanctions relate to Vladimir Putin and Russia’s behaviour. 'We want to make it absolutely clear that Russia’s behaviour in destabilising another country is unacceptable and therefore the EU with the US will be imposing further sanctions unless that behaviour changes. ‘We are united in sending that tough message, and it is a message that will be backed by tough action.’ It marks the toughest package of measures against Russia so far, amid growing anger at Moscow's aggression. In an extraordinary public attack on the Russian President, Sir Peter said Mr Putin’s behaviour in Ukraine had been ‘thuggish, dishonest and reckless’. He added: ‘He thought he’d done pretty well after he stole Crimea. It doesn’t look so good now.’ Speaking on American television channel MSNBC, he said: ‘It’s starting to look like this was the wrong call. This is a defining moment for what is going on in Ukraine. ‘We’ve had some very bad behaviour from the Russian side for a long time now, and we’ve had this terrible atrocity - the shooting down of the aircraft. 'We have to change the cost/benefit analysis for Putin, for the Russian people, for the government that they have elected here.’ Last night Mr Cameron spoke to US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian PM Mario Renzi to back ‘a strong package of sectoral sanctions as swiftly as possible’. Prime Minister David Cameron will meet families of British victims of the MH17 atrocity today as Brussels prepares to step up sanctions against Russia . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (left) announced Britain would send 1,300 troops to take part in Exercise Black Eagle during a visit to Warsaw with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (second left), meeting their Polish counterparts, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski (right) and Defence Minister Tomasz Siemoniak (second right) Downing Street said Russia has ‘failed to take the steps necessary to de-escalate the crisis’ in Ukraine, including ending support for the separatists and stopping the flow of weapons across the border. ‘Indeed the latest information from the region suggests that even since MH17 was shot down, Russia continues to transfer weapons across the border and to provide practical support to the separatist,’ a spokesman said. However, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind warned more than 'symbolic' sanctions are needed for Russian president Vladimir Putin to back down, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind has warned. The veteran Tory politician said the measures used to date had been 'pretty useless' and urged the international community to take more serious steps that would cause economic damage. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This isn't about his popularity, this is about imposing sanctions that will require Putin to change his policy. Up till now these measures used have been pretty useless. 'If you impose visa controls or asset freezes on 50 or 60 of his cronies, well I'm sure they are very disappointed, (but) why should Putin change his foreign policy? 'When you get into the situation of preventing them having access to financial markets, preventing high quality technology exports to their energy industry, that goes to the very heart of the Russian economy. 'We saw with Iran that the whole impact of financial, banking and economic sanctions is what has brought them to negotiate with the US and with the international community on their nuclear weapons. 'This is not about popularity, it is about economic damage.' Britain has been pushing for sanctions where there is ‘broad consensus’ with other EU countries, including ‘the financial sector, the defence sector and the hi-tech energy sector’. Carnage: Australia's deputy police commissioner warned that the crash site is a 'highly volatile area' and that the purpose of their visit is to conduct a detailed examination of the area . Tragic: The news comes as UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said the downing of flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine may constitute a 'war crime . Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet families of the Britons killed in the MH17 crash today. Ten UK nationals were among the 298 passengers and crew killed when the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Downing Street said all of the families have been invited to meet the Prime Minister and seven are expected at the meeting in Number 10. 'It is really for the Prime Minister to express his sorrow and condolences about what's happened personally, face to face,' a spokesman for Mr Cameron said. 'He will talk about the response so far from the UK and other partners in the international community.' Mr Cameron will also seek to 'establish if there are more things that we should be looking at and doing'. The deal on so-called ‘tier three’ measures covering whole sectors was agreed by EU ambassadors today. However, oil giant BP has warned that further international sanctions on Russia could have a ""material adverse impact"" on the company. The UK business owns a 19.75 per cent stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft, which is the subject of sanctions preventing it from using US financial institutions for new loans over a period longer than 90 days. There is also expected to be a new US and EU-wide embargo on future arms sales to the Russian military. It will be the first time that entire sectors of the Russian economy, rather than individuals or firms, have been targeted by the West. Last week EU member states agreed to add 15 individuals and 18 entities to the list of those subject to asset freezes under the 'tier two' powers. Among them are head of the Russian Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov, Sergei Beseda, head of the FSB department that oversees international operations and intelligence activity and four members of Russia's Security Council. The list, published in the EU's Official Journal, brings to 87 the total number of people subject to sanctions in relation to Russia's annexation of the Crimea. However, Mr Cameron wants to now go further and extend it to cover ‘those with influence on the Russian regime’. It will include travel bans and asset freezes aimed at the ‘cronies’ of Vladimir Putin whose billions depend on their influence in the Kremlin. Meanwhile, it emerged Britain is to send more than 1,300 British troops to Poland as a show of strength against Russia's annexation of Crimea and 'destabilisation' of eastern Ukraine. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Exercise Black Eagle would be the largest British commitment to the region since 2008. The UK has already deployed RAF Typhoon jets to the Nato Baltic Air Policing mission. And at the end of light infantry troops from 1st Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment will take part in Exercise Sabre Junction in Poland, a US-led exercise involving 16 Nato and partner nation.

"By . Carol Driver . A ground steward who checked in all the passengers boarding the doomed Malaysia Airlines plane at Amsterdam airport has paid tribute to the victims. Renuka Manisha Virangna Birbal posted a heartfelt tribute to the 298 travellers and crew who were killed when the Boeing 777 was shot down over Ukraine on Thursday. The tribute was posted on Facebook and has already been shared more than 8,000 times. SCROLL DOWN FOR TRIBUTE IN FULL . Tributes: A woman lights a candle outside the Embassy of the Netherlands in Kiev to commemorate victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 . Renuka writes how she spoke to the passengers while checking them in before they boarded the plane, which was scheduled to fly to Kuala Lumpur. Describing ‘smiles and happy faces’, she explains how one family of six told her: ‘After a long time we’re returning home.’ She writes how children smiled and waved at her, with one asking their mother: ‘Mom when do we see our luggage again?’ Renuka describes grandmothers taking . photos of their grandchildren; a man who is about to start a new life in . Malaysia; a newly married couple jetting off on their honeymoon. Controversial move: Malaysia Airlines used a route over Syria war zone just days after its jet, pictured, was hit by a missile flying over Ukraine . In the moving tribute, she also reveals how one man said his was flying to attend his mother’s funeral; and how she recognises one man travelling with his wife and children who says to her: ‘See you soon’. Renuka signs off the post with: ‘The last time I saw them, talked to them and wish them a pleasant flight the passengers of flight MH017 on 17 July 14. ‘One last smile, one last salute, a happy face... ‘Rest in peace dear passengers & crew.’ Adding: ‘On behalf of the ground handling agents of flight MH017.’ A smile, a greeting, a happy face… . At the transfer desk, I get two football fanatics, one is checked in and the other not, ‘can you check me in Love’. They were not seated next to each other in the business compartment, ‘would you like to sit together sir?’ Any doubt, I want a few hours of rest joked the other one. ‘Cheers.’ A loving family of six with their 10 pieces luggage that I had to put in the system. ‘After long time we're returning home.’ It was busy at the check in desk, so I went there to help my colleagues. A child smiling and waving at me. People bring flowers and candles to the Embassy of the Netherlands in Kiev to commemorate victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 . They thank me for my help so she could sit together. Excited children ‘mom when do we see our luggage again?’ The crew running towards me waving and signaling. They were ready to drop their luggage at the odd size belt. A man who is about to start a new life in Malaysia. A family get dropped off by their grandparents, kids first holiday far away. Grandma makes photos of how her children and grand children check in. This time I do not mind that I am in the picture. Arriving . at the gate G03 a young man asked if he has time to buy something . quickly. ‘Of course, sir, if you only ensures that you are back here at . 1130.’ My colleague helps an elderly woman inside, all the way to her . seat in row 21, she had difficulty walking and traveling alone. The . lady had the same name (one letter difference) as the son of my . colleague and said that she would remembered the name. I appeal to . everyone to go to the toilet before they enter the gate because there . are no toilet facilities at gate G03. A few passengers went back out of . the line. A woman traveling with her husband and her mother still . asks her mother a few times if she had to go to the toilet, the elderly . lady has a bladder problem. I allowed them to wait outside and they can come inside the priority line when their ready. A newly married couple, on the way to their honeymoon. Flowers and a stuffed teddy bear are laid outside the Malaysian Embassy in Moscow in memory of the victims . A . beautiful little girl hold by her mother, her father behind them . pushing the stroller. What is she beautiful, a half Dutch half Malaysian . with beautiful big eyes. She kindly smiled at me. A man who could still join the flight to be on time for the funeral of his mother. Grandchildren traveling with their grandparents. Suddenly I see a familiar face, it is our colleague from the MH ticket counter . He proudly shows me his son, wife and daughter. With a big smile he waved ‘See you soon’.A . woman want to go out of the gate unable to go to the toilet, . unfortunately, we have already begun boarding and nobody can go out. ‘May I board first then?’ of course. I walk quickly along with the last two passengers who may eventually join the flight, and what are they happy... A final farewell to the crew, till next time! And then we removed the bridge.

"By . Ruth Styles . Twisting her skirt nervously in her hands, it is clear that life for Mashid Rezai, from northern Iran, hasn't been easy - and that talking about it is harder still. Aged 11, she doused herself in petrol and set herself ablaze in a bid to avoid an arranged marriage to a man more than 20 years her senior. Now 36, she remains terribly scarred and was forced to flee to London to escape her father - a man so violent he beat his daughter in hospital as she recovered from her burns. Scroll down for video . Common: Mashid says child weddings are common in Iran and girls as young as nine are married off . 'Yes I resent the people who didn’t help me,' admits Mashid, who is too ashamed of her scars to be photographed. 'The people who should have loved me did not protect me. They hurt me for life.' Growing up in a remote village, Mashid says her childhood was a relatively happy one although she, her mother and her three brothers were all terrified of the family patriarch. 'My mother . was my father’s fourth wife,' she explains. 'He didn't have children with his other wives. My mother told me that all three of his previous wives ran away because he . beat them.' And his all too busy fists weren't just directed at his wife. 'I remember once he tied my hands and feet with . rope to a piece of wood and he and my mother beat me with another piece . of wood,' she remembers. 'They were angry with me because I had gone to the gate at the . front of our house to watch a wedding procession and they did not like . the families holding the wedding.' Despite the violence, Mashid says she was a happy child who enjoyed her studies at the village school and loved playing with her brothers. Scarred: Mashid was badly scarred by her suicide attempt and was reluctant to be photographed as a result . Shocking: Mashid's friend Zainab was, like this girl, aged just nine years old when she died . The area she grew up in, close to the city of Arak, was, she says, 'beautiful' and she had plenty of friends with whom to enjoy it, among them a girl named Zainab. With both of her parents working in the fields, Mashid was expected to take on the bulk of household chores and shared cooking duties with her mother. But the peace of her childhood was about to come to an end when Zainab, then just nine years old, was asked for by a much older man. 'She was very beautiful and tall,' remembers Mashid, her voice cracking slightly and tears welling up in her eyes. 'People noticed . her.' Desperate to escape the marriage being forced upon her, Zainab resorted to extreme measures. 'She burnt herself,' whispers Mashid. 'And she died.' Zainab's death would prove to have chilling consequences for her friend. Less than a year after her friend's suicide, Mashid's father announced that she too had been found a husband - despite the fact his daughter was just 11 years old. 'My mother came to me at home and told me that the next afternoon a man would come and ask me for my hand in marriage,' she explains. 'I asked her who it was and she told me the name of a man who lived in our village, who was married and had two children. I was only 11 years old and he was 35.' Mashid was distraught. 'I was crying,' she says as tears well up in her eyes once more. 'I told my mother that he already had a wife and children. 'I said I was only 11 years old. I told her I wanted to be a teacher, because I loved my teacher. But she insisted that I would get married to this man.' The girl ran to her teacher, hoping for help, but was told nothing could be done. Mashid then ran to hide in the mountains but, fearful of being eaten by a wolf, returned home and hid in an outbuilding. 'My parents found me and assumed that because I had returned home I was agreeing to the wedding,' she says.

'I . still couldn’t really believe that it was actually true, that it was . going to happen. But when I saw my family preparing food and setting out . tables, I knew really it was going to happen.' Desperate to avoid marriage and with her friend Zainab's example in mind, Mashid ran into the kitchen, took out a bottle of paraffin, doused herself in the contents and set herself ablaze. 'I was panicking,' she explains. 'I just wanted to . escape so I tried to kill myself. My father had lots of weapons and I . considered using them but I chose fire because I was following what my . friend Zainab had done. 'I poured some paraffin . on my skirt and I lit a match. My skirt caught fire. When I saw the . fire, it was intense and very real. I regretted it. I tried to put the . fire out with my hands. 'I tried to get out but I had shut the door and . it was difficult. I was panicking. The flame was raging and was burning . my face. 'I could see flames in my hair. I managed to get out into the . courtyard. A neighbour was on the flat roof next door. He saw me and . jumped down. I . don’t know what happened after that.' Mashid spent the next three months unconscious in hospital in Arak, although even that wasn't enough to spare her from the wrath of her father who was furious that his plans had been foiled and fearful for the family honour. 'I was screaming constantly every day,' she remembers of the months that followed. 'I . had open skin when they changed the bandages. 'On top of that my father . beat me for what I had done whilst I was at the hospital. Also once I . wet myself and my mother punched me in the face. They were so angry with . me.' When Mashid left hospital, it was to return to her parents' house after her former fiance rejected her because, as she reveals, he now saw her as 'dirty' and 'ugly'. At home, things went from bad to worse with her father becoming increasingly aggressive and even telling her that he wished she was dead. At risk: Mashid says she and other scarred women were attacked with stones and shunned in Iran . Help: Mashid eventually fled to the Iranian capital Tehran where she was taken in by a kindly surgeon . Source: International Centre for Research on Women . 'My . father was very aggressive,' she remembers. 'He told me I shamed the family and he was . embarrassed because of how I looked. 'I overheard my father saying he wanted me . to be taken to a hospital and killed with an injection.' Unable to bear the abuse, Mashid, by then aged 13, stole some money from her parents and escaped to Tehran where she went straight to hospital. A plastic surgeon there took pity on the child, eventually helping her to escape Iran and her violent father for good. Now living in London, Mashid remains terribly scarred but is starting to move on with her life, helped by the Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights Organisation. Her family, however, remain in Iran and she hasn't spoken to them for more than 20 years. 'It was . dangerous for me to stay in Iran,' she adds. 'As burnt, scarred woman, I was . vilified. People attacked me. They insulted me, pulled at my clothing . and children threw stones at me. I was always scared. I had to run . away.' In London, at least, she has found some measure of acceptance and says she would even contemplate a relationship, even though her view of men remains coloured by her father's behaviour. 'I was so surprised when I first arrived [in London] because people did not point at me or throw stones at me,' she remembers. 'It was such a relief. 'Since being here, I have been trying to come to terms with what happened to me. I . want to study, which I didn’t have the chance to before. 'Then I want to . help girls and women at risk of early and forced marriage, so they . don’t end up like me.' As for her family, Mashid says she will never contact them and never wants to see Iran again. 'I can never return,' she continues. 'I can’t bear to. Everything bad that has happened to me happened there. I could not have a . moment of peace there. Even thinking of Iran means I cannot even have peace.'

Freedom-loving felines can scratch at him and Russian president Vladimir Putin, thanks to the selection of scratching posts bearing their faces. The 1.5ft tall toys - which cost £4,500 - took a team of artists 200 hours to finish. They are made from hessian rope and their 3D-printed faces are attached to the post before being hand-painted. Scroll down for video . Clawing back freedom: These scratching posts featuring the likeness of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, who restrict their countries' internet freedom, have been launched to raise money for anti-censorship campaigners . The unique 1.5ft tall toys - which cost £4,500 - took a team of artists 200 hours to finish. Pictured, Vladimir Putin is mauled by a cat . The selection of pet protest products also include cat litter trays with portraits of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt's Abdel Fattah El Sisi. The products form part of a campaign dubbed The Pussycat Riot, named for the politically-charged Russian punk band. It was launched by global network provider HideMyAss.com, which allows netizens to see content blocked by governments. It was launched after new legislation pushed through by Putin's government was widely condemned for its 'draconian' grip on Russians' internet freedoms. The satirical cat products protest against regimes which deny citizens the right to access websites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Other world leaders with questionable track records on internet censorship, such as Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt's Abdel Fattah El Sisi, feature on litter trays . All of the money raised from the products will be donated to the charity Index on Censorship. Cian McKenna-Charley, marketing director at HideMyAss.com, said: 'To paraphrase its creator, the internet is for everyone.

"By . David Wilkes . One of the Queen’s prize racehorses has tested positive for a banned drug, it was revealed last night. Estimate, a five-year-old filly, failed the test when the painkiller morphine was found in a sample taken after a race, Buckingham Palace said. Trained by leading flat racing trainer Sir Michael Stoute, Estimate won the Ascot Gold Cup last year - the first royal horse to win the prestigious race. Scroll down for video . Estimate owned by the Queen has tested positive for morphine, a prohibited substance, Buckingham Palace announced . She came second in this year’s Gold Cup last month, when the test is believed to have occurred. The revelation came five days after the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) announced that at least five horses, from various trainers, had tested positive for banned drugs following race meetings. It has begun an investigation. Morphine is a permitted medication for racehorses but is banned on race days. Initial . indications are that Estimate’s positive test was caused by her eating . contaminated feed, the Palace said. The Queen has been informed. Following . the BHA’s announcement, Northamptonshire-based feed manufacturer Dodson . and Horrell, which has held a royal warrant since 1985, said its . suppliers had informed the company of possible contamination and it . destroyed all of its stock of a feed called Alfalfa Oil Plus. Estimate is pictured left on its way to winning The Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2013 . The Queen watched Estimate win the Gold Cup on Ladies Day with her racing manager John Warren, right, in 2013 . Last night John Warren, the Queen’s bloodstock and racing adviser, said: ‘Sir Michael is working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables. ‘As the . BHA investigates this matter, including potential links between the . different cases, Sir Michael continues to offer his full co-operation.’ Once . investigations are complete, the cases will be put before a BHA . disciplinary panel which will decide if any should be taken. This could include disqualifying the horses involved from the races they had competed in. The Queen is pictured with her racing manager John Warren, left, trainer, Sir Michael Stoute and jockey Ryan Moore, right, before her horse, Estimate, ran at British Champions Day at Ascot in October 2013 . Initial indications are that the positive test resulted from the consumption of a contaminated feed product, the palace said .

"By . Mia De Graaf . 'Stitched up': Nawal Msaad, 27, from north London, claims she did not know where the money came from when she agreed to carry €20,000 to Istanbul . A young British student accused of smuggling cash in her knickers to fund jihadists fighting in Syria today said she had been 'stitched up' by her friend. Nawal Msaad, 27, was caught with the stash of €20,000, the equivalent of £15,830, in rolled up notes as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul from Heathrow, jurors have heard. The Old Bailey was earlier told she agreed to be a 'trusted courier' for her close friend Amal El Wahabi, also 27. The money was to be taken to Turkey at the request of El Wahabi’s husband Aine Davis, who was known as Hamza and had joined fighters in war-torn Syria, the court heard. But she was stopped by police after the cash - which had been hidden inside her in a condom - fell out into her pants. Taking to the witness box at the Old Bailey in tight light pink trousers, a white sleeveless shirt and pink strappy high heel shoes, Msaad insisted she had never meant to smuggle cash abroad to bankroll terrorism. And she accused her friend and co-defendant El Wahabi of 'stitching' her up by not telling her where the money had come from. Her defence barrister Naeem Mian asked her: 'It was put to you that in effect you have been stitched up by her, what do you say to that?' Msaad said: 'Well, she wasn’t completely honest with me about where the money came from. And so I do get that feeling, I’m not going to deny that - the feeling that I have been stitched up.' Msaad, of Holloway, north London, and El Wahabi, of north west London, both deny funding terrorism. Msaad, who was born and raised in London and studying human resource management at London Metropolitan University in Aldgate, said she has known her friend since their school days at Holland Park School. She admitted having a 'soft spot' for her friend, but said they are not very close. And she vehemently denied ever trying to smuggle cash to extremists fighting in Syria, which is in the midst of a bloody civil war. Speaking so softly that the judge had to repeatedly ask her to keep her voice up, she flatly denied the charge against her. Mr Mian asked her: 'Between 13 and 16 of January 2014 were you concerned in an arrangement to make money available for the purposes of terrorism?' She replied: 'No'. He added: 'Did you suspect that the €20,000 given to you by El Wahabi may have been for the purposes of terrorism?' She again replied: 'No'. Her barrister said: 'Were you ever told or did you ever suspect that Aine Davis, otherwise known as Hamza, was or may be involved in terrorism.' She replied: 'No' and also said she had no idea the cash might have come from drug dealing and crime. She added: 'I had no intention to smuggle money into Turkey.' On January 16 this year Msaad set off for Heathrow airport for the three-day trip but when she approached the departure gate she was stopped by police. She said she was going for a 'short break', was buying gold for her mother and had €20,000 'around me'. She was later arrested. Davis allegedly left London in July last year to pursue the jihadist cause but had maintained regular contact with his wife, with whom he has two young sons. The 30-year-old, who was also born in London with roots in Gambia, converted to Islam six or seven years ago, it is alleged. Accusation: Msaad (left) claims she thought the €20,000 was for her school friend and co-defendant Amal El Wahabi (right) to start a new life abroad with her husband and children. Msaad was arrested at Heathrow . Msaad said El Wahabi originally said she had a job for her and that she would be paid €1,000 if she did it. She told jurors she was 'curious' and originally thought it might be a hairdressing job. El Wahabi texted her friend and said 'I asked you because I trust you' but later said she 'can’t explain' the job by phone, the court heard. But El Wahabi later told her it was to courier around €10,000 (£7,900) or 'maybe more' to her husband who she was going to travel abroad to live with, along with their two children. Msaad said she believed the cash was for a new house as the family were setting up home abroad. She later had a phone call with Davis on January 13 who asked her to bring €20,000 (£15,800) over. Msaad told the court: 'I asked ""how much?"" He said 20 bags - a bag is €1,000 in slang.' Asked if she had any concerns about travelling with such a large amount of cash on her, she said: 'It is a lot of money, it’s a big responsibility. 'I just didn’t want to lose their money. I was a bit worried.' But she insisted she didn’t think she was doing anything illegal. Denial: Msaad spoke at the Old Bailey to deny funding terrorism and said she has never held extremist views . She said: 'I asked him ""Are you allowed to bring that amount of money over?"" 'The way he sounded was really reassuring. He said ""It’s fine, you can bring that amount of money"", I had no reason to doubt him.' She admitted she had never asked where the cash came from, but thought it to be Davis’ savings. Msaad, whose family come from Morocco, said she is a Muslim who prays and fasts on Ramadan, but 'wouldn't say my family is particularly religious. I wouldn't call myself religious'. And she denied that she was very political or had ever viewed extremist, jihadi literature. She told the court: 'I would say I'm not more or less than the average person is interested in politics. 'However, I'm sensitive to the situations that are going on in the world, I don't turn a blind eye to anything. 'I'm sympathetic towards situations, but I don't dedicate any of my time towards politics.' The trial was adjourned until 9.30am tomorrow morning.

"By . Simon Jones for the Daily Mail . Sunderland have agreed a £2.5million deal with Brighton for long-term target Will Buckley. The winger was signed by Gus Poyet while manager at the Amex Stadium and he has remained an admirer. The Black Cats boss hopes to follow the 25-year-old winger's signing by completing the protracted £14m deal for Liverpool striker Fabio Borini. Done deal: Sunderland have agreed a fee with Will Buckley who will join up with former manager Gus Poyet . Long-term: Poyet has been a fan of Buckley's game for some time, since working with him at Brighton . The two clubs agreed a fee four weeks ago, but Poyet's efforts to convince the player to move to the Stadium of Light have so far met with frustration. However the Uruguayan has reiterated his desire to seal the deal with the Italian and believes it could be completed before the weekend. Poyet said: 'The idea was to have the deal done a few weeks ago, but for different reasons it was impossible, but we are confident that maybe in the next few days we can do something about Fabio.' The 23-year-old spent last season on loan with the Black Cats, scoring 10 goals in all competitions. Success: Borini was on loan at the Stadium of Light last season when he scored 10 times .

"By . Julian Robinson . Unscrupulous coffee producers are bulking out ground beans with lumps of earth and bits of wood, researchers have found. Ground coffee is being supplemented with cheaper ‘filler’ ingredients including the likes of corn, barley, wheat, soya beans and rice. The likes of acai seed, brown sugar and starch syrup are also reported to have been found in the product before it reaches supermarket shelves and restaurants. A coffee to kick-start the day: But scientists say unscrupulous producers are supplementing ground beans with fillers ranging from corn and rice to twigs and mud . Cases of unwanted ingredients in the drink come amid growing coffee shortages in regions, such as Brazil, where droughts and plant diseases have dramatically cut back supplies. But scientist Suzana Lucy Nixdorf and her team at State University of Londrina in Brazil say they have developed a way to nip coffee counterfeiting in the bud. This graphic shows the variety of filler ingredients found in ground coffee . Her findings are due to be presented at the American Chemical Society National meeting today exposition in San Francisco today. ‘With a lower supply of coffee in the market, prices rise, and that favors fraud because of the economic gain,’ she said in a press release. ‘With our test, it is now possible to know with 95 percent accuracy if coffee is pure or has been tampered with. ‘After roasting and grinding the raw material, it becomes impossible to see any difference between grains of lower cost incorporated into the coffee, especially because of the dark colour and oily texture of coffee.’ The team is analysing a number of fillers considered impurities that can even be parts of the coffee plants, introduced at harvest, that are not supposed to be in the final product. Wood, twigs, sticks, parchment, husks, whole coffee berries or even clumps of earth that are almost the same colour as coffee have been found. Currently, tests include looking at the coffee under a microscope or identifying unwanted additions simply by tasting the coffee. But the new test uses liquid chromatography – a sensitive analytical technique - allowing a closer look at the product ‘in an unbiased way,’ according to Ms Nixdorf. This gives her team a much closer look at the ingredients in an unbiased way, according to Nixdorf. Chromatography is a powerful analytical technique that is very sensitive and highly selective. Coffee . is increasingly being bulked out by ingredients such as rice, (file . picture right), soya beans and even twigs and lumps of earth, . researchers claim . Martin Wattam, the executive director of the British Coffee Association, told The Times that he welcomed the new test – but added there was no evidence ground and roast coffee on offer in Britain had been bulked up with other ingredients. He told the newspaper: ‘The Quality of coffee products varies internationally and some countries may not maintain equivalent standards of coffee enjoyed by many customers in the United Kingdom.’","Ground beans increasingly being bulked out by unwanted 'filler ingredients'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . More than one in six of England’s most troubled families have been released from a ‘cycle of despair’, the government claims. Some 22,000 of the so-called ‘Shameless’ families have been turned around, with children back in school, crime cut and thousands of parents back in work. It follows ministers demanding an end to the ‘it’s not my fault’ culture which allowed up to 120,000 problem families to avoid taking responsibility for their own lives. Families, like those headed by Frank Gallagher in the TV show Shameless, cost the country £9billion-a-year . David Cameron launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in London and other cities in England. The Prime Minister insisted that families depicted by the media as neighbours from hell should not be ‘written off as unreadable or unteachable’. It was claimed that troubled families cost the taxpayer up to £9billion in police callouts, truancy, vandalism and social work. Ministers set a target of helping 120,000 families by 2015. At the £448 million scheme's half-way stage the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) today said town halls were working with 62,000 families to reduce youth crime and truancy or help get jobless adults back to work. More than 22,000 families have been classed as turned around: with children back in school, levels of youth crime and anti-social behaviour significantly reduced and over 1,400 adults in continuous work. Community Secretary Eric Pickles said the 'no nonsense' approach of the scheme was working . The statistics also showed that 92,000 families have now been identified by councils as meeting the criteria for the payment-by-results programme. Wakefield has already turned more than half of its 930 troubled families around and Leicestershire almost half of its 810, the DCLG said. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘I am delighted that our programme is already helping half of our target of 120,000 troubled families at its mid way stage. ‘Councils are making great strides in a very short space of time, dealing with families that have often had problems and created serious issues in their communities for generations. ‘These results show that these problems can be dealt with through a no nonsense and common sense approach, bringing down costs to the taxpayer at the same time.’ Under government criteria, a troubled family is one that meets five out of seven criteria: having a low income, no one in the family who is working, poor housing, parents who have no qualifications, where the mother has a mental health problem, one parent has a long-standing illness or disability, and where the family is unable to afford basics, including food and clothes. Many of the seven are beyond the control of the families themselves. Head of the troubled families programme Louise Casey said: ‘This programme is getting to grips with families who for too long have been allowed to be caught up in a cycle of despair. ‘These results show that a tough, intensive but supportive approach has a big impact; giving hope and opportunity to the families and respite to the communities around them.’ David Cameron launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in London and other English cities . Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ‘Improving lives goes to the heart of what councils do, and the troubled families programme has built on the excellent work councils were already doing to better co-ordinate support across the public sector for families who need it. ‘The progress being made by local authorities vindicates Government's decision to put councils at the centre of this programme and demonstrates the huge difference councils can make in this area when given the necessary powers and adequate resources. ‘Focusing money on tackling root causes of problems rather than treating symptoms provides a better deal for the public purse and for the people we are trying to support, and is vital if we are to make public services sustainable in the long-term. ‘The success of the Troubled Families programme should serve as a lesson to the rest of government in the savings and improvements to public services that can be achieved by adopting a community budget approach to delivering other local services.’","Government claims troubled families cost the taxpayer £9billion .

"By . James Slack for the Daily Mail . Changing tide? Lady Hale claims 'the rising tide of anti-European sentiment' is leading to an emphasis on British law rather than the European convention . Courts are increasingly basing their verdicts on British law rather than European human rights legislation as the 'empire strikes back', according to the country's top woman judge. Lady Hale suggested the move may be a response to 'the rising tide of anti-European sentiment among parliamentarians, the press and the public'. In recent years, a string of controversial verdicts have been handed down which cited the European Convention on Human Rights, which was enshrined into UK law by Labour's Human Rights Act. Commonly, criminals and others have won victories based on the likes of article 8 – the right to a family and private life. But Lady Hale said that 'renewed emphasis' was now being placed on British constitutional principles as a source of rights and obligations, rather than European legislation. The deputy president of the Supreme Court said that UK constitutionalism is 'on the march'. In a lecture to lawyers, Lady Hale said: 'After more than a decade of concentrating on European instruments as the source of rights, remedies and obligations, there is emerging a renewed emphasis on the common law and distinctively UK constitutional principles as a source of legal inspiration. 'It seems to me to take us in some interesting directions.' Lady Hale said the theme had been characterised as 'the empire strikes back' but she preferred to 'broaden' it into 'UK constitutionalism on the march'. She said that inside the Supreme Court there was a 'growing awareness of the extent to which the UK's constitutional principles should be at the forefront of the court's analysis'. Lady Hale added that litigants and litigators had been reminded that they should look 'first to the common law to protect their fundamental rights'. She said she would leave it to others to decide whether the trend was developing 'as a response to the rising tide of anti-European sentiment among parliamentarians, the press and the public' or whether whether a marker was being put down for what might happen if the 1998 Human Rights Act was repealed. The Tories are expected to propose scrapping the legislation in in their manifesto for next year's election. This might mean the courts would have to turn to other laws instead to give protection to the public. Empire strikes back: She said that judges are increasingly aware that UK principals should be emphasised . An alternative, she said, was the courts were expressing 'simple irritation that our proud traditions of UK constitutionalism seemed to have been forgotten'. Earlier this month, Lord Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court - and the UK's most senior judge - said British judges might sometimes have been 'too ready' to follow decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights. Lord Neuberger said judges were beginning to see that such an approach might not be appropriate. He said one of the most controversial aspects of the European Convention on Human Rights was that it was an international set of rules with the European Court of Human Rights - based in Strasbourg, France - as 'its final arbiter'.","Top judge Lady Hale said there is 'renewed emphasis' on British law .

"By . Wills Robinson . Accused: Amal El-Wahabi, 27, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today, was told to put her 'trust in Allah' as she pawned her wedding ring for nappies and milk . A terrorist's wife who allegedly paid a student to smuggle money into Syria pawned her wedding ring to buy nappies while her husband sent pictures of him holding AK47s, the Old Bailey was told today. Amal El-Wahabi, 27, told her husband Aine Davis that she was starving and struggling to provide for her children while he was fighting in the Middle East. But Davis, 30, continued in his bid to get his wife to join him by sending her an ISIS propaganda video via WhatsApp. The court heard he sent the clip, which encourages people to 'pick up arms to jihad', followed shortly by the message: ‘Good innit?’. El-Wahabi, a mother-of-two, is accused of arranging for her friend Nawal Msaad, 27, to hide 20,000 euros in her knickers and take it to Davis. Msaad was detained by counter-terrorism police at Heathrow Airport in January after they discovered the hidden package in her underwear. In a series of messages between El-Wahabi and her husband Davis, she was told to put her 'trust in Allah', despite complaining that her children were suffering. She said: ‘Your boys are ill, it’s hard dealing with them on my own. I’m tired.’ In an earlier exchange, she described how her mother was begging her not to travel to Syria. But she said: ‘After speaking to you last night kind of changed me, I know you need me there. ‘I do wish I was different and I didn’t have to be confused. I do love you and you are my husband.’ El-Wahabi eventually decided to join her husband and got Msaad to conceal the cash in  before travelling to Syria. The court was told Davis sent the incendiary three-minute video while they were arranging the exchange. It featured armed men holding a black flag with the slogan ‘There’s no God like Allah’. The video states: ‘How enjoyable that the guardian of death hugs me and entertains me when I hold my machine gun with the palm of my hand.’ Viewers are told to ‘go ahead and pick up arms to the jihad’ and it carries the name of the terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.' Asked the following day if she had watched it, El-Wahabi replied: ‘Yeah I did, I see how it is.’ Davis had left London a few months earlier to join the jihadist cause in Syria but remained in contact with his wife and their two sons. He told his wife not to let the boys have baseball hats because they were worn by the ‘kaffir.’ El-Wahabi, who calls her terrorist husband ‘Honey bunny,’ tells him in one message ‘the kids are going through a hard time. My faith is so low. It’s too much. We are in a lot of debt.’ She complains that the baby buggy is broken and she cannot afford a new one, but Davis is adamant there is no chance of him returning. ‘How could you think I could come back,’ he asks. ‘Its a test. Be patient. Put your trust in Allah.’ Davis tells her she could go to be with him in Syria. But El-Wahabi replies: ‘You need to watch the news. They are on to people. I don’t think you know how bad it is.’ She adds: ‘I don’t think you understand. Even if I wanted to come I cannot as they are on to people. In another message she states: ‘I don’t know how to deal with this long distance marriage and being broke. I don’t know how long I can be patient. Don’t be angry but I sold my ring.. I needed the money.’ Davis tells her: ‘Forget the news. Allah sees it all.' His wife continues to tell him why she pawned the ring. ‘I needed nappies and food. You don’t know how bad it is. It’s worse than ever. I had no choice. My kids need food and milk.’ Smuggled: Nawal Msaad, also 27, is accused of concealing €20,000 in her knickers to give to El-Wahabi's husband Aine Davis in Syria. She was stopped by counter terrorism police at Heathrow Airport in January . At one point Davis answers: ‘I have no time for this. I am preparing myself for Allah.’ El-Wahabi says: 'I don’t know how I got myself into this, two kids and broke and husband aint around. There is not enough food for the three of us so I don’t eat that much.’ She adds: ‘No matter what I am going through you will not come and help me.. That breaks my heart.’ Davis says: ‘I am never coming back. Get that out of your head.’ But his wife tells him he will not necessarily be caught if he returns: 'You might not go to jail because lots of people are coming back. If you go to jail it is in Allah’s hands.’ Davis sends her a picture of him with a heavily armed comrade and adds: ‘I am good and you think I would come back for humiliation?’ He also mailed her a jihadi video and tells his wife: ‘I have chosen this path. I hope this makes things clear.’ El-Wahabi recruited Msaad to smuggle to the cash to Turkey as there are no direct flights to Syria. She was taken to a private room where she pulled out a roll of banknotes from inside her underwear. Davis, who had previously lived in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen and Egypt, flew to Amsterdam in July 2013 and has not returned to the UK. He is thought to either be dead or still in Syria. Msaad and El-Wahab both deny becoming concerned in a funding arrangement as a result of which money was made available or was to be made available to another, and they knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Amal El-Wahabi, 27, was told to put her 'trust in Allah' as she sold the ring .

The protesters calling themselves Grow Heathrow have created a market garden at Sipson, Middlesex, which would be bulldozed if the airport succeeds in its campaign to build a third runway. The group was served an eviction notice last month and expected bailiffs to enforce it this morning. Protesters at Sipson near Heathrow make plain their views over how long they intend to prevent the expansion of the airport, They have been in situ for four years and were expecting to face bailiffs determined to evict them this morning but instead they were faced with the land owner Imran Malik . However, the owner of the land went alone and was met by the squatters and 'up to 200' supporters. Grow Heathrow was set up on the land four years ago and the group threatened to dig tunnels and use locks to frustrate the expected eviction attempt. Campaigners, some of whom live on the land, have been training in ways to prevent efforts to remove them.

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Accused: Mastermind, hosted by John Humphrys, is being accused of gender bias after it emerged most of its questions last week were about men . Mastermind is being accused of gender bias after it emerged most of its questions last week were about men. A debate has broken out among fans of the BBC2 quiz show after some said it does not reflect the contribution women have made to society. During the first episode of the latest series, screened last Friday, host John Humphrys asked 81 general knowledge questions to the four contestants. Of those, only five were about real or fictional women, 38 were about men and the rest were about things. The imbalance quickly attracted the ire of some viewers on the BBC’s own Points of View Messageboard, an online forum on which diehard fans air their views. One posted: ‘Was it just tonight or do Mastermind questions always overwhelmingly refer to men or things but rarely women?’ To which another replied: ‘Yes, the questions are compiled by phallocrats, even the title is sexist.’ That was followed by another  exasperated viewer who wrote: ‘Well, everyone knows the world is run by, and for, men!!!!’ In contrast another accused the complainers of peddling ‘PC nonsense’ while another added: ‘It’s just fact. The BBC can’t make up questions about women just for the sake of it to even up the numbers. ‘It’s a fact throughout history that men have done more and had more impact on society. I’m not saying that’s a good or bad thing...it just is.’ But that only inflamed the debate with another viewer posting: ‘I am saddened to find such a gender imbalance subtly inherent in a BBC quiz as popular as Mastermind. ‘But I am even more saddened to come across attitudes here that think this is rightly so. One viewer suggested that the BBC should take a look at the works of Christina Rossetti, Emily Dickinson and the Brontë sisters, including Emily Brontë (pictured, left, in a portrait), who wrote Wuthering Heights (right) ‘You should take a look at the works of Christina Rossetti, Emily Dickinson and the Brontë sisters if poetry is your thing, and just to get you started.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘It is ludicrous to make sweeping claims based on one set of questions asked on one programme. ‘Viewers can be assured that the selections made are based on subject matters such as history, science, art and that is what is uppermost in mind.’","During first episode of Mastermind, 81 general knowledge questions asked .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Amal El-Wahabi, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey in London today. She told the court her husband travelled a lot to 'get away from everyone and look for work' A woman accused of sending cash to her terrorist husband in Syria stashed in a friend's underwear has told a court that he would leave the country to get away from the police, drugs and bad influences. Amal El-Wahabi, 27, allegedly asked her friend Nawal Msaad, also 27, to be a trusted courier and take 20,000 euros to Turkey at the request of husband Aine Davis, who she knew by his Muslim name Hamza. But Msaad was stopped by police at Heathrow Airport in January before she boarded a flight and handed over the rolled up notes, which were hidden in her undewear, a court has heard. Giving evidence in the witness box at the Old Bailey, mother-of-two El-Wahabi said she met Hamza while she was working in the nursery at her local mosque when she was 19. The 30-year-old was selling cannabis, class A drugs and had also fathered two children by another woman, she said. El-Wahabi told the court: 'My dad picked up the idea he has money and did not know where the money came from.' When her parents found out he was a drug dealer she had to choose between Hamza and her parents, she said. The defendant, who was born in London with Moroccan roots, said she was very close to her family. But added: 'I stayed with him because he was always there for me and he has helped me so much.' The court also heard how the couple split up for a long period and Hamza had travelled abroad to countries including Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, she said. El-Wahabi’s lawyer Mark Summers asked: 'He is somebody who is happy to be living in London?' But she replied: 'Not at all. The drugs, the influence of friends he has around him, the police targeting him constantly. With him, his problem is he is always being watched.' Asked why he travelled so much, she said: 'To get away from everyone and to look for work.' While he was away, she said: '(He is) much happier because he has not got everyone on his back, he is not influenced by friends and family. He believed when he is away he is more himself. 'He believed if you die doing good, you go to heaven.' The court also heard he only told her the night before that he was leaving on July 28 last year, although she had been suspicious. ‘He said I can’t be here for too long’, she said. ‘He finds it really hard to settle himself here, and always said he didn’t want to stay here for long.’ She said she had been oblivious to her husband buying outdoor wear and survival equipment in the week before he left. ‘The night before, he decided to tell me he was going away’, she added. ‘I was confused. He always tells me “I’m going, I’m going”. ‘But everything had changed between us.’ El-Wahabi said their second child was just two months old when her husband left, but she believed their relationship had changed for the better. ‘He changed so much, and because of what we had been through, it hit him’, she said. ‘When he came back he changed and was more there for us.’ Nawal Msaad, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today. She is accused of concealing ¿20,000 in her knickers to give to El-Wahabi's husband Aine Davis in Syria . El-Wahabi said she had seen Hamza telling their eldest son ‘you have to be good for mummy, look after your brother’. ‘I was thinking why are you saying these things for?’, she said. The court was also shown the contents of an iPod, an iPad, a Kindle and two laptops seized by detectives, including radical lectures and Islamic extremist propaganda videos. El-Wahabi said she was too busy to use the iPod after starting a new beauty training course, while the Kindle had been left behind by Davis at her house by accident. She said she used the iPad after Davis left the country, but she denied seeing any of the material that has been shown to jurors. El-Wahabi said Davis initially told her he was in Amsterdam when she called him, as they kept in touch though WhatsApp. She said she used an Apple Mini Mac laptop that Davis gave her, having bought it from his cousin in 2009. But she said she just used to complete her college assignments. El-Wahabi said she started a beauty course at Wembley campus of the College of North West London in September 2012. She told the court she realised she was pregnant again just two months into her course, but was determined to qualify despite expecting a child. El-Wahabi said she had known her co-defendant Msaad from the age of 13 as they went to school together. Msaad and El-Wahabi both deny becoming concerned in a funding arrangement as a result of which money was made available or was to be made available to another, and they knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Amal El-Wahabi said she met husband while working in nursery at her local mosque .

"By . Emma Innes . Apple has applied for a trademark for ‘iWatch’ in Japan, a patent official has said. This news suggests that the iPhone maker may be moving ahead with plans for a watch-like device. The news comes at a time when gadget makers are turning their attention to wearable computers. The trademark application, submitted on . June 3 and released on the Japan Patent Office website on June 27, would . cover computers, computer peripherals and wristwatches, the official . said. These current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 Apple patent. The patent described a 'wearable device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap, patent image pictured. Its battery life could be extended, using a 'solar panel array', or 'a kinetic power source . Apple's latest patent application suggests the company is pushing forward with its plans to launch what's been dubbed the iWatch. A patent image, pictured, shows what the strap could look like . He added that it was unknown how long the application process would require. An Apple spokesman in Japan could not immediately be reached for comment. Speculation has mounted that Apple is preparing to launch an iWatch and CEO Tim Cook told a gathering of technology and media executives a month ago that wearable products were ripe for exploration. However, he added he was sceptical about Google Inc's recently unveiled Glass which combines a mobile computer and eyeglasses. ‘There's nothing that's going to convince a kid who has never worn glasses or a band or a watch to wear one, or at least I haven't seen it,’ Mr Cook said. Rumours about a possible so-called iWatch first emerged in December when Chinese manufacturers let the news slip. In February, it was reported that Apple had applied for a patent for a wearable device in the U.S and the same month MacUser magazine created an artist's impression of what the wearable tech could potentially look like. Yrving Torrealba's translucent concept of how the iWatch might look has proved to be misguided, if Apple does indeed base their gadget on the technology in their latest patent application . Analysts believe that the Apple smartwatch could be made of glass, will have a one-and-a-half inch LED screen and let users to send and receive email, texts and Facebook alerts as well as communicating with other devices wirelessly though Bluetooth. The U.S. patent application no. 20130044215, filed by Apple originally in August 2011, specifies the technology for a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display'. It describes: 'A wearable video device . ... comprising: a flexible substrate having a flat state and a curled . state [and] a flexible display disposed upon a first surface of the . flexible substrate.' It is expected to run on iOS and a team of 100 engineers, led by head of design Jony Ive, is reportedly working on the project. Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch . Wearable devices are considered a potential area for hit products as smartphones, such as the iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co's Galaxy series, are losing their ability to impress consumers and investors. Samsung, which has leapfrogged Apple as the world's leading smartphone maker, is also developing a wearable device similar to a wristwatch, a source has said. The New York Times reported in February that Apple was experimenting with the design of a device similar to a wristwatch that would operate on the same iOS platform as its iPhone and iPad and would be made with curved glass.

"By . Emma Glanfield . One of Britain’s leading chief constables faced calls to stand down last night amid a criminal probe into a bungled paedophile investigation. Sir Peter Fahy, who heads Greater Manchester Police, is at the centre of an extraordinary inquiry into alleged crimes and gross misconduct. He will be interviewed within weeks in relation to his role overseeing the surveillance of a suspected sex offender, which may have put a child in danger. Scroll down for video . Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, is one of three serving officers to be served with a criminal and gross misconduct notice following investigations by Independent Police Complaints Commission . Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney (pictured) has been served with a gross misconduct notice in relation to the disposal of body parts belonging to victims of notorious serial killer Harold Shipman . His colleague Terry Sweeney, assistant chief constable, is also being investigated over the disposal of body parts belonging to victims of serial killer Harold Shipman. Both inquiries were sparked by an internal whistleblower, who went to the independent police watchdog after the force dismissed his claims. The decision to investigate Sir Peter was welcomed by Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk. The Labour politician has previously clashed with the force over the way it dealt with the sex offences of former Liberal MP Cyril Smith. ‘I have raised concerns for some time about the leadership of Greater Manchester Police in relation to how it tackles sexual abuse,’ he said. ‘With the chief constable now under investigation for what is a very serious matter, it is only right and proper that he is suspended until the inquiries are completed.’ The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched a wide-ranging inquiry into the Manchester force following the whistleblower’s claims. Yesterday Sir Peter was one of four officers, one of whom has retired, told they were being investigated for criminal offences and gross misconduct regarding the paedophile investigation. Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney is the officer served with a gross misconduct notice in relation to Shipman's victims. The investigation is looking into whether police officers misled the families of Harold Shipman's victims over the disposal their loved ones' remains. Greater Manchester Police (above) confirmed the chief constable and other serving officers remained on duty . Human tissue from 12 of the serial killer's victims were kept for more than a decade by Greater Manchester Police before allegedly being secretly destroyed, without permission from their families. The samples were taken from the 12 victims to ensure police had the appropriate evidence should Shipman or his family appeal against his conviction. However, in 2011, police decided to 'respectfully dispose' of the tissue samples without telling the families of the victims. The remains reportedly belonged to Kathleen Grundy, Joan Melia, Winifred Mellor, Bianka Pomfret, Ivy Lomas, Marie Quinn, Irene Turner, Jean Lilley, Muriel Grimshaw, Alice Kitchen, Elizabeth Mellor and Sally Ashworth. Sir Peter Fahy (pictured) is expected be interviewed within weeks in relation to his role overseeing the surveillance of a suspected sex offender . In response to the allegations, made by a whistleblower currently working within the force, the IPCC launched the probe. IPCC investigators have obtained a volume of Greater Manchester Police documents relating to all three investigations, and interviewed the whistleblower. A major incident room has also been set up and relatives of the victims of Shipman are being informed of progress, the IPCC said. Greater Manchester Police today confirmed the chief constable was still 'in post', and the other serving officers remained on duty. Sir Peter said: 'As a chief constable, you face making complex decisions on a daily basis about many high-risk and challenging situations. 'It is right that this decision-making is scrutinised and that I am held to account as part of this investigation.' The married father-of-four joined the police in 1981 and is now the head of one of the biggest police forces in the UK. Prior to his current role, he worked as an assistant chief constable in Surrey, and had positions with Hertfordshire and West Midlands forces before joining Cheshire Constabulary as Chief Constable in 2002. He took up his post at Greater Manchester Police on September 1, 2008, following the death of Michael Todd who was found dead in Snowdonia. He was knighted in 2012 for his services to the force. At the time, he said: 'You can't give a knighthood to a whole police force so it has been given to me as leader of such a hard working organisation.' The IPCC probe was launched back in March but it is only today the officers have been served with criminal and gross misconduct notices. Launching the investigation, IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'These are serious allegations and the gravity and nature of the allegations, and the fact that they are made against senior officers within the force, means they must be investigated independently. 'We will also look at the wider organisational response by Greater Manchester Police in each of these investigations. 'We know that the families involved will have been through very distressing times, and we will be sensitive to this as we conduct our investigations. 'We have a statutory duty to conduct independent investigations in circumstances such as these, but we will make sure that we communicate with the families and do whatever we can to avoid further distress.' Sir Peter also appeared in court last month to plead not guilty over the police shooting of an unarmed man, Anthony Grainger, in 2012. His force is being prosecuted for allegedly breaching health and safety laws in relation to the incident. Tony Lloyd, the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, said he had no evidence to support suspending Sir Peter while the investigations take place but would keep his position ‘under review’.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . This is the moment a London tourist bus driver mounted a pavement to block two cyclists in their tracks before yelling at them to 'get a Highway code'. Ali Choudhry, 19, and a friend were riding through central London, sticking to marked cycle lanes, when they found themselves in conflict with an open-topped double-decker. As they approached the Tower of London on Lower Thames Street, they were directed onto a shared pavement by the road markings. Scroll down for video . Road rage: The bus driver confronts the two cyclists after cutting them off on a pavement in central London . Furious: During his rant the driver is seen telling Ali Choudhry, 19, and his friend to 'get a Highway Code' - after he had mounted the pavement . Halt: The bus driver perches a wheel on the pavement and waits for the cyclists to approach the doors . But the angry driver - who has since been sacked - apparently overtook them in his tour bus and pulled straight onto the pavement in front of them - stopping the pair in their paths. He then climbed from his seat, opened the door and yelled at the two cyclists - telling them to 'get a Highway Code'. Mr Choudry, of Ilford, Essex, said: 'This idiot driver decided to spice things up a bit for us with a spectacular display of road rage. 'He tailgated us at literally three feet and got angry for being held up for a few seconds but had all the time in the world to stop and vent his fury.' The incident happened at around 6pm on August 2, and was captured by Ali’s helmet-mounted camera. 'He said he had a bus full of witnesses, but I said my camera was a more reliable witness, and he shut the doors,' he added. Approach: The two cyclists - who recorded the footage from a camera attached to a helmet - approach the end of the cycle lane on Lower Thames Street in the centre of London . Turn: The bus begins to indicate left before a corner as the pair ride along the pavement . Blocked off: The bus driver pulls onto the pavement, stopping the cyclists in their tracks . Mr Choudry has sent the footage to bus operators Golden Tours and is still waiting to hear back from them. He said: 'I hope they do sort it out as best as they can. The driver really needs to control his irrational anger and what he does as a result of it.' The Metropolitan Police have not been contacted about the incident and have not taken any action. A spokesman for Golden Tours told the Evening Standard: 'Golden Tours were notified of an incident that occurred on 2 August 2014 when a video was uploaded by Ali Choudhry to YouTube. 'After reviewing the evidence provided by Mr Choudhry and the CCTV footage from the bus, the driver was dismissed from his service with Golden Tours with immediate effect on 4 August 2014. 'Golden Tours employs a rigorous recruitment and training process to ensure that the highest level of customer service is provided to our customers and to other shared road users. 'We are grateful that matters such as these are highlighted to us, so that we are able to maintain the high standard of professionalism.'

The site said Snowden's Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena explained Snowden lived a 'measured life, reading Russian classical prose, actively learning Russian and freely travelling around the country'. His public appearance came as he sought further asylum in Russia after his previous stint ended on August 1. Kucherena said: 'The decision on the application has been taken and therefore, with effect from August 1, 2014, Edward Snowden has received a three-year residential permit. 'In the future, Edward himself will take a decision on whether to stay on and get Russian citizenship or leave for the United States.' He said Snowden could apply for citizenship in 2018 after living in Russia for five years, but that he had not decided whether he wanted to stay or leave. Kucherena said Snowden was studying Russian and had an IT-related job, but did not provide further details. 'He is a high-class IT specialist.' He said Snowden's security was being taken seriously and that he was using private security guards. The tone of statements out of the United States, including out of the State Department, suggested his security was at risk, even in Russia, Kucherena said. Kucherena has in the past expressed concerns that Snowden could be in danger because of his intelligence background and the fact the United States wants him to stand trial. 'I should say that he can move freely, he can go to the shops, visit museums and theatres,' he said. '[But] he needs to think about his safety.' Snowden's place of residence has not been disclosed and few pictures of him have appeared in the media. Edward Snowden pictured in Hong Kong after he leaked details of the NSA's spying operations . However, voices in the West have suggested he is strongly under the control of the Russian secret services, an allegation denied in Moscow. Snowden is wanted by US prosecutors for leaking details about the National Security Agency's snooping operations. The . spokesman for the White House National Security Council, Ned Price, said . Snowden needed to return to the United States to face charges related . to the leaks. 'Mr. Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States. He should . return to the U.S. as soon as possible, where he will be accorded full . due process and protections,' Price said. Amnesty International has called on other states to offer him asylum. Currently he cannot travel because his US passport was annulled. 'Edward Snowden is cornered in a legal limbo, without a passport or asylum protection from any government,' said Sherif Elsayed-Ali, deputy director of global thematic issues at Amnesty International.","NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden photographed at Russian opera .

Alan Pardew expects more signings at Newcastle this summer and is backing Facundo Ferreyra to win a permanent stay after arriving on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk. The Argentinian made his debut for the Magpies in Sunday's impressive 3-1 victory over Schalke in Gelsenkirchen. There is a deal in place to sign Ferreyra for around £6million at the end of the season and Pardew believes the 23-year-old – who top scored in his homeland with 17 goals for Velez Sarsfield in 2013 - will prove a hit in the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Newcastle have greater attacking threat - Pardew . Improvement: Pardew is still keen to dip into the transfer market with a month remaining . New man: Facundo Ferreyra made his debut for Newcastle having only signed on Sunday morning . VIDEO Newcastle have greater attacking threat - Pardew . 'We think he is a player who will grow and we have the option to take him on a permanent basis,' said Pardew. 'We believe he will show the form from Argentina in the Premier League with us. '(Fabricio) Coloccini is well aware of him and he had a big influence in Argentina. He went to Ukraine but didn't get many chances, he'll get more chances with us.' Pardew, though, has not ruled out another entry into the transfer market and Sunderland's Connor Wickham could emerge as a target. Big impression: Young winger Aarons, who scored one goal and made another, celebrates in Gelsenkirchen . The 21-year-old was given an ultimatum by boss Gus Poyet last week to sign a new contract or face being sold. However, Sportsmail can reveal that no deal has been put in front of Wickham and United are aware of the situation. And Pardew added: 'We've always maintained that we will watch the window until the last hours. 'We've done some terrific business and I think it must be exciting for Newcastle fans that we've got some terrific, offensive players. 'I feel much more comfortable with the team and we can play a brand of football which is expected of us. 'I think we could really trouble teams this season, which is something we didn't do in the second half of last season.' Wait and see: No new deal has been put in front of Sunderland striker Connor Wickham, alerting Newcastle . The victory over Schalke included goals from Emmanuel Riviere, Rolando Aarons and France international Remy Cabella. But it was 18-year-old Aarons – a Jamaican winger who also qualifies for England – who stole the show. 'The real highlight of pre-season has been Rolando and he was terrific again,' Pardew said. 'It's nice to see a young player really pushing and I thought he caused real problems for Schalke – long may that continue.'","Pardew confident Argentinian Ferreyra will stay permanently .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Different managers and a different league. But this was the same old Edinburgh derby. A windswept, blood and thunder affair best viewed through the cracks of the fingers, it finished as most of them do. With red cards and a Hearts win. The victorious coach Robbie Neilson came closest to the truth when he claimed afterwards: ‘Football broke out a little bit.’ He was being generous. Hibs captain Liam Craig missed a penalty which proved the forerunner to another day of derby misery and recrimination for the Easter Road club and their captain. Prince of Edinburgh: Buaben celebrates after scoring the decisive goal from the penalty spot in second half . Taking a tumble: Buaben was caught by Hibs defender Scott Robertson, who received a second yellow card . Marching orders: Referee William Collum brandishes a red card after Robertson's second bookable offence . Cool customer: Buaben strokes his spot-kick home to put Hearts 2-0 up with 10 minutes left to play . They were edging closer to a point when, from nowhere, Hearts attacker Sam Nicholson smashed a superb 25-yard strike into the top corner of the net in 75 minutes. Three minutes later the visitors, in their white away shirts, surrendered any hope of a result when Scott Robertson earned a second booking for pushing over Prince Buaben in the penalty area. The midfielder picked himself up to smash the ball high into the net from 12 yards for 2-0, condemning Alan Stubbs and his 10 men to a seemingly inevitable fate. It all got too much for some. Osman Sow was red carded for a mid-air elbow on Michael Nelson and according to the defender, it wasn’t his first either. Hibs were also incensed with Hearts sub Jamie Walker escaped an alleged headbutt on Hibs defender Lewis Stevenson moments after Farid El Alagui had pulled a goal back for Hibs. Stunning opener: Sam Nicholson unleashed an unstoppable shot from distance to put Hearts ahead . Raucous: Nicholson, left, is mobbed by his team-mates after his long-range strike found the back of the net . Easter Road skipper Craig won’t look back on his day with any sense of pride. It began badly with his dragged penalty scraping the outside of the post on its way past and ended with the midfielder being frogmarched down the tunnel for his own protection by a club official, red hair flaming with anger as he sought an old fashioned ‘square go’ with Walker. Had he mustered even half as much bravado for his penalty kick in 31 minutes Hibs might have taken something from this. Yet Stubbs refused afterwards to blame the missed penalty for his team’s defeat. ‘The penalty miss came when the game was 0-0 so I don’t think we can look back and say we lost the game because of it,’ said the Hibs boss. Wasteful: Hibs captain Liam Craig skews his penalty wide with the scoreline at 0-0 in the first half . In the wars: Hibs defender Michael Nelson, second right, receives treatment to a facial injury . Winning coach: Hearts boss Robbie Neilson gestures to his side during their 2-1 win at Tynecastle . That it was a key moment, however, is undeniable. Hearts’ stand-in No 1 Jack Hamilton – the 20-year-old third-choice keeper – was cast into the fire after Neil Alexander shattered his cheekbone against Rangers last week and No 2 Scott Gallacher twisted his ankle. He was doing fine until El Alagui’s header landed in the no-man’s land and forced him to rush from his line as Hibs attacker Danny Handling tried to muscle in. Hamilton appeared to get a hand on the ball before clattering into Handling, but referee Willie Collum – a constant source of irritation to the Hearts fans – awarded a soft spot-kick. To a chorus of boos and cheers, Craig’s run up was confident. But his low, sclaffed, left-foot effort looked horrible from the moment it left his foot, skidding hopelessly wide of Hamilton’s post. For Hibs, a club which seems cursed in this fixture, it was happening again. Emboldened by their penalty let-off, Hearts, on the other hand, were working up a head of steam. Feisty affair: Osman Sow fends off a challenge from Michael Nelson during the second half in Edinburgh . You reap what you sow: Osman Sow and Jordan Foster, right, clash as the Hearts striker is sent off . Tempers flare: Hibs captain Liam Craig exchanges angry words with Hearts defender James Keatings . Nicholson, a fine prospect at 19, had a terrific chance with a snap shot in 38 minutes after some persistent Hearts pressure from a corner. A goal looked more likely than not until Hibs keeper Mark Oxley threw himself to the ground to make a fine save. When Jordan McGhee’s controlled right-footed half volley in injury time soared just wide of Oxley’s post, the half-time whistle was timely for Hibs. The second half threatened to break a new record for free-kicks. It was bitty, scratchy and devoid of finesse, a cavalcade of blocks, thumping, sliding challenges and bookings. With 15 minutes to play, it was edging grimly towards a scoreless draw and deserved nothing more. But Nicholson, a lifelong Hearts fan, would be the first player to raise his head and make something happen. Gathering the ball midway into the Hibs half, he performed a sweet nutmeg before galloping forward and smashing an unstoppable shot into the corner of the net past Oxley’s despairing lunge. Tynecastle erupted. And the gathering storm intensified within three minutes when Hibs midfielder Robertson, booked before half-time, hauled down Buaben in the area, earning a red card. ‘I had no qualms about the penalty,’ said Stubbs after the game. ‘If you put two hands on someone and push them, you can’t expect not to get a penalty against you. Consolation goal: Farid El Alagui fires in for Hibs in added time at the end of the game to make it 2-1 . ‘I’m not going to hide behind any decisions when they are what they are. I think it was very easy for the referee to give it. He gave us one, which I think was a penalty but he missed one or two things today.’ No one missed the ball nestling high in the net – in the same corner Craig had gone for. For the fifth time in six derbies, Hibs were heading for defeat. At least under Stubbs their defeats come with a measure of defiance. Sow, the Hearts matchwinner and hero against Rangers last Sunday, was red carded for catching Michael Nelson with his elbow in mid-air. Afterwards the Hibs man, a cut visible above his right eye, said it came 70 minutes after an identical first offence which went unpunished. Delighted: Hearts youngster Jack Hamilton celebrates at the final whistle after impressing in goal for the hosts . With both teams down to 10 men, Hibs rallied. El Alagui’s header right in front of goal from a Craig free-kick was well saved by Hamilton. But the young keeper could do nothing about a well-taken strike from the No 9 in injury time. Too little, too late perhaps. The goal did nothing to improve the Hibs mood or darken that of Hearts as the final whistle prompted familiar scenes of bedlam. Craig was physically pushed down the tunnel for his own protection as Hearts revelled in the realisation that, after two Championship games, they have beaten their two major promotion rivals.","Hibs captain Liam Craig missed a penalty in the 38th minute at Tynecastle .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Kenneth Oranyendu, 42, from Clayton, known as 'The Chairman', was a key member of an international drugs ring which smuggled cocaine into the UK . An international drugs smuggler dubbed 'The Chairman’, who used children's books and coffee machines to hide at least £416,000 worth of drugs, has been jailed for more than seven years. Kenneth Oranyendu, 42, from Clayton, was a key member of the transatlantic plot which saw more than 2.6kilos of drugs being sent to gangsters in Manchester, disguised as everyday items. The high-purity cocaine was stashed in children’s books, a coffee machine and even a sprinkler system before being sent to the UK from California, Brazil and Nicaragua. The gang also used a fake trophy in the shape of an aeroplane - complete with a commemorative plaque - to smuggle the drugs. The smugglers were finally caught - three-and-a-half years after the ring was set up - when the powder was spotted hidden in photocopier cartridges. Manchester Crown Court heard how 23 packages were sent to Manchester over a three-year period. Of these, seven packages were intercepted, with a total estimated street value of around £416,000. It means that the gang could have smuggled thousands of pounds more of cocaine into the UK. Scroll down for video . The gang used children's books, pictured above, to smuggle cocaine into the UK from the US and other countries such as Brazil and Nicaragua . This shows the drugs which were hidden in the children's books as part of the sophisticated plot . The . plot unravelled after a ‘vulnerable’ single mother in Rotherham - . described as an ‘innocent dupe’ - was recruited to receive a . consignment. Manchester Crown Court heard Oranyendu recruited people to use their addresses for the scheme. Staff at East Midlands airport opened the package, which was sent from southern California, before it arrived at the woman’s house. When . they found a kilo of cocaine inside the photocopier equipment, a customs . officer delivered the drugs and arrested the resident. She led them to . Oranyendu’s door. A coffee machine, pictured left, was used to smuggle drugs. It was seized and found to have cocaine stashed in the base, pictured right . A fake trophy of an aeroplane, complete with a commemorative plate, was also one of the items used in the plot . In July 2012, the recovered items were linked to the Manchester conspiracy - nearly three-and-a-half years after the supply chain was set up. An investigation by the NCA found major courier firms such as DHL had unwittingly delivered the items to bogus individuals and companies in Clayton, Abbey Hey and Gorton. Gary Woodhall, defending, said Oranyendu, who admitted conspiracy to import cocaine, was remorseful. A metal-tripod sprinkler, pictured above, was also used to disguise the drugs. In total, 23 packages were sent, although only seven were intercepted . The smugglers used the tripod stands, pictured left, to store pellets of cocaine, pictured right . He said: 'He was not involved in any retail distribution.' The defendant was jailed for seven years and four months.

"By . Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail . A Liberal Democrat minister called last night for cannabis to be  legalised for medical use. Norman Baker said the drug could help relieve symptoms for sufferers of conditions such as multiple sclerosis and help those having chemotherapy. But the Home Office minister's suggestion was dismissed by a Coalition spokesman who pointed to 'clear evidence  cannabis can damage people's mental and physical health'. Drugs minister Norman Baker wants cancer sufferers to be allowed to use cannabis to alleviate pain . Mr Baker's comments are the latest in a series from Lib Dem ministers pressing for a softening of drugs laws. Opponents . of allowing  cannabis for medical purposes insist it could be used as a . back door to decriminalising the drug more widely. But Mr Baker said there was a 'growing body of research'  showing the 'medical properties' of cannabis. He proposed the change in a letter to Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt which was leaked to The Guardian newspaper. 'It . is time to reconsider the medicinal properties of cannabis, given what . I've learned in my role as a minister,' wrote Mr Baker. 'I've seen more and more  evidence that cannabis can  provide genuine medical benefits to treat a number of conditions. The US state of Colorado made history on New Year's day this year - becoming the first to allow cannabis to be sold over the counter. Colorado, along with Washington state, voted to legalise the use and possession of cannabis for people over the age of 21 in November 2012. Washington allowed licensed shops in the state to sell the drug in July. Colorado and Washington are among 20 states to have approved marijuana use for medical purposes. The drug is still illegal under federal law. 'There is a growing body of research that shows the medical properties of chemical components of cannabis. 'I . am uncomfortable that there are credible people I have met who tell me . that cannabis is the only substance that helps relieve their condition. But not only are they stopped from accessing it officially but have to . break the law to help their health. 'Other . countries recognise that cannabis does have medicinal benefit and we . need to look again at this to help people who are ill. This is a quite . separate matter from recreational use which is not at issue here.' He suggested cannabis could be used to help conditions such as MS and glaucoma. In addition, it could be used to combat the side-effects of  treatment for cancer, Aids and Crohn's disease. Campaigners for wholesale changes to drugs legalisation welcomed his intervention. Last . week, Mr Baker's party leader Nick Clegg pledged to abolish prison . terms for users caught with any drugs, including class A substances such . as cocaine and heroin. It was 'utterly senseless' to lock up the 1,000 people a year convicted of possession, he said. Cannabis can bring relief to patients suffering from the side effects of cancer and Aids treatment . The . law currently allows drugs firms to develop medicines based on cannabis . under a licence granted by the Home Office.  One such medicine, . Sativex, is already authorised for use in the UK for the treatment of . MS. However, a Home Office . spokesman said: 'This Government has no plans to legalise cannabis or to . soften our approach to its use as a medicine. 'There . is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful . drug which can  damage people's mental and physical health. Our . cross-government strategy remains clear. 'We . must prevent drug use in our communities, support users through . treatment and recovery, and tackle the organised criminals behind the . drugs trade. 'There has been a long-term downward trend in drug use over the last decade. 'Drug-related . deaths in  England and Wales have continued to fall during the past . three years and people going into treatment today are more likely to . free themselves from dependency than ever before.'","Lib Dem minister has written to Health Secretary calling for review of drug .

"By . John Stevens . and Tamara Cohen . 'Wouldn't mind retiring': Baroness Boothroyd said she would support a retirement age for peers to let new members into the increasingly full House . Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday called for a retirement age to be introduced for elderly peers. Amid claims that the House of Lords has run out of space, Baroness Boothroyd said that the conditions have become ‘appalling’ and suggested that a time limit could be imposed on peers’ length of service. A series of up to 20 new appointments are expected within days. This will boost the total number of peers to 850 – the highest level since most hereditary peers were removed following the House of Lords Act in 1999. Yesterday peers told how officials have been ‘prowling the corridors’ looking for space to squeeze in more desks for the new recruits. ‘Unseemly fights’ in the chamber have been reported because there are not enough seats for the rising number of peers. Lady Boothroyd said: ‘It is so overcrowded that there is only space for two thirds of us in the chamber itself. It is appalling. ‘All prime ministers are very keen to put new members in here so they get their legislation through and they pile them in irrespective. ‘It is what I call lobby fodder, they go through the lobbies and vote for the prime minister who put them there.’ She called for ‘proper reform’ so there would be ‘a retirement age or a number of years they should perform here’. Speaking to Radio 4’s World At One, the 84-year-old added: ‘I’m getting on and I wouldn’t mind putting my hand up for a certain retirement age if it comes to it.’ Lords Speaker Baroness D’Souza said a life peerage should not be a ‘life sentence’. She told the programme: ‘One of the things I want to do is to try to create a culture where it is seen as a public duty to retire in order to allow fresh blood to come in. ‘In practice it [the increasing number of peers] means the chamber is very crowded. At Question Time there are sometimes some rather unseemly fights… there is quite a lot of competition and a lot of resentment that builds out of that.’ The House of Lords has been forced to squeeze in a further 121 desks in the past five years to the offices it has in buildings around Parliament as it tries to accommodate all the peers. Squeezy does it: A packed Lords chamber during a State Opening of Parliament ceremony . Labour’s Lord Foulkes, who has called for the number of peers to be reduced to 450 and a retirement age of 80 to be introduced, said the situation had become a joke. He said: ‘The Tory chief whip has been prowling the corridors to see where they can pack in more peers. People have come round with tape measures to see how big the offices are so they can work out if they can fit in another desk. ‘The chamber is near to overflowing. During Question Time it is more and more difficult to get in. The library is getting increasingly overstretched, it is getting harder to find a seat.’ David Cameron has been increasing the number of Tory peers so that the Lords replicates the political balance in the Commons. Lord Foulkes said: ‘If Labour win [the next election] and want to do the same thing the numbers will shoot up again. It is a joke.’","Baroness Boothroyd, 84, said conditions in the House are now 'appalling'

"By . Lydia Warren For Mailonline . and Associated Press . Kevin Ward Jr's family found out that he had died on Facebook, his devastated father has revealed. Speaking out for the first time since his 20-year-old son died after being hit by NASCAR champion Tony Stewart on Saturday night, Kevin Ward Sr. said his daughter learned of the heartbreaking news online and broke it to him over the phone as they waited for updates in the hospital. 'He was just a very God-gifted kid,' Ward Sr. told Syracuse.com of his son. 'I think he slept with a smile on his face.' Mr Ward expressed his anger at Stewart, saying only he knows the truth of what happened on the track at the Canadaigua Motorsports Park on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Kevin Ward Sr., pictured with his wife Pam and their son Kevin Ward Jr., learned that the young man had died over Facebook. They were at the race where he died but did not see him get hit . 'The one person that knows what happened . that night is possibly facing 10 years in prison. Is he going to say . what he done?' Mr Ward said. He was at the Canadaigua Motorsports Park with his wife Pamela when their son got into a crash on lap 14 of a 25-lap Empire Super Sprint race. A video of the incident apparently shows Stewart's car apparently making contact with Ward's car before the younger driver's vehicle spins out and comes to a stop near a wall. Ward can then be seen getting out of his crashed car and walking towards other cars on the track before pointing a finger, apparently at Stewart. A car . swerves to avoid him, but when Stewart's car passes close to Ward, his . right rear tire apparently hits him, and Ward was pulled beneath the car . and thrown in the air. Mr . Ward said it was the first time his son had ever climbed out of his car . during a race, and believes he reacted that way is because of 'who put . him into the wall'. Questions: Mr Ward said that all the other drivers managed to see his son walking on the track on Saturday night but for some reason, NASCAR star Tony Stewart (pictured) failed to see him . Proud: The devastated parents said they do not want their son to be remembered for his death . 'Tony Stewart was the best damn driver by . far on the track that night,' he said. 'Why he had to go up as high as he did and . hog my son, there's no reason for it.' He said that all the other drivers on the track saw the young man walking - but Stewart still hit him. Kevin Ward, Sr. 'Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,' he said. But Mr Ward did not see his son get hit because he was riding a four-wheeler over to where the car had crashed. As he headed over there, someone told him Kevin had been hit. The couple . watched for 45 minutes as emergency workers performed CPR and traveled . with their son to the hospital. There, they received the call from their . daughter. Kevin Ward Jr will be remembered at a funeral service on Thursday. Ontario . County sheriff's deputies, who have met twice with the Ward family, are . still investigating the crash and are looking at another video of the . incident. Confrontation: Ward Jr was hit after he was nudged off the course and walked on the track, pointing his finger angrily at Stewart. Stewart's car then fatally hit him when it came around the track . Sheriff Philip Povero has said that his . initial findings have turned up nothing that would indicate criminal . intent in the crash - but legal experts agree that does not mean Stewart . is in the clear. He could be charged with second-degree manslaughter under New York law if prosecutors believe he 'recklessly caused the death of another person,' with negligent homicide another possibility, criminal law professor Corey Rayburn Yung of the Kansas University School of Law told the Associated Press. 'The question over whether someone was reckless is a factual one, and one a prosecutor might let a jury decide,' said Yung, who also posts at the Concurring Opinion blog. Stewart would not expect to be charged for the car-on-car bump that sent Ward spinning into the wall. But if, for example, he were to tell police he saw Ward on the track and tried to shower him with dirt or send him a message, a first-degree manslaughter charge could be a possibility, Yung said. In a 1949 . case that Yung uses in his class, midget car racer Joseph Sostilio was . found guilty of manslaughter after he tried to squeeze a four foot-wide . vehicle through a two-foot opening at 40 mph, crashing into another car . and sending it into the one driven by Stephen D. Bishop. Bishop's car . flipped three times and he was killed. Missed: A makeshift memorial can be seen for Kevin Ward, Jr. at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in New York, where he was fatally hit on August 9. Ward Jr will be remembered at a funeral on Thursday . Sostilio's conviction was upheld on appeal by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Noting that a violent or aggressive act on a football field or in a boxing ring is not necessarily a crime, Justice Henry Tilton Lummus wrote: 'In the present case physical contact was not an essential part of the racing of automobiles.' Povero would not say how Stewart described the accident, but he said he has reviewed two videos and spoken to Stewart. There is no video or audio from Stewart's vehicle. 'The worst thing that could happen for Stewart is if his story doesn't seem to match other evidence,' Yung said. 'Because then it might call into question his own story.' After the investigation is completed, Povero said, the evidence will be turned over to the district attorney. Even if he is cleared by prosecutors, though, Stewart could face a civil suit.","Kevin Ward Sr and his wife Pam were in the hospital on Saturday when their daughter called them and said she'd read about the death online .

"By . David Martosko . President Obama is directing federal employees to rat out their co-workers in a program designed to spot former Bradley Mannings and Ed Snowdens, but experts doubt whether the program is wise or effective . The familiar command 'If you see something, say something' has been moved into the federal government's workplaces, according to a new report. The government's Insider Threat Program, a comprehensive initiative that stretches across 5 million security-cleared employees of all federal agencies and their contractors, was brought to life following an executive order from President Obama in 2011. He issued the directive after Army Private Bradley Manning sent untold numbers of classified documents to the anti-secrecy WikiLeaks website. The initiative asks federal government employees to spy on their co-workers, reporting to program agents on their unusual behaviors, strange attitudes, financial troubles and unprecedented travel - all indicators that a 'high-risk' person might be engaged in espionage or other leaking of secret materials in a way that might cause 'harm to the United States.' In particular, it seeks to identify threats from federal employees who might cause 'damage to the United States through espionage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure of national security information or through the loss or degradation of departmental resources or capabilities,' according to a secret government document prepared by a task force headed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Attorney General Eric Holder. The program was highlighted in a lengthy report from the McClatchy News Service, whose reporters explored how psychological profiling of former computer hackers and espionage offenders revealed patterns and traits that spy experts believed could be identified pre-emptively. Naysayers point to the TSA's screening program as an indicator that federal government efforts to profile potential threats are far off the mark . White House press secretary Jay Carney was caught flat-footed during his briefing with reporters Wednesday, admitting that a question about the Insider Threat Program 'stumped' him.\ . 'I confess that I did not go read the McClatchy story,' he said. The government's own experts are questioning whether the program has value, and if it could be sacrificing personal civil liberties on the altar of enhanced security. Eric Feldman, a former National Reconnaissance Office inspector general who oversaw spy satellite programs, said the program could create 'a repressive kind of culture.' He told McClatchy that the answer to spotting potential leakers shouldn't be 'to have a Stasi-like response,' referringto the feared East German communists' secret police. A Quinnipiac University Poll released Wednesday found that for the first time, a plurality of Americans believe government efforts to crack down on terrorism through surveillance of ordinary Americans has gone too far. A strong majority said they see NSA leaker Edward Snowden as a 'whistle-blower,' rather than as a 'traitor.' Fancy yourself a James Bond wannabee? Your Defense Department co-workers could rat you out as a reckless future secret-leaker . A task force headed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Attorney General Eric Holder (R) set the standards for the Insider Threat Program . A 2008 National Research Council report on detecting terrorists concluded that '[t]here is no consensus in the relevant scientific community ... regarding whether any behavioral surveillance or physiological monitoring techniques are ready for use at all.' And 'doing something similar about predicting future leakers seems even more speculative,' Stephen Fienberg, a statistics and social science professor at Carnegie Mellon University told McClatchy. Caitlin Hayden, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement that the Insider Threat Program includes provisions to protect 'civil rights, civil liberties and privacy,' but McClatchy reported that she didn't identify any of them. The Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive oversees government programs that aim to detect secretive threats to national security. Its spokesman Gene Barlow said that in the past, co-workers of eventual leakers saw patterns of behavior that they never reported to anyone. 'The awareness effort of the program is to teach people not only what types of activity to report,' Barlow said, 'but how to report it and why it is so important to report it.' But he cautioned that the program 'does not mandate' that employees report anything to their supervisors. “It simply educates employees about basic activities or behavior that might suggest a person is up to improper activity,” he said. The government has been stung by leaks from Edward Snowden, a fugutive former NSA contractor's employee who absconded with state secrets and leaked them to The Guardian, a British newspaper . 'If you see someone reading classified documents they should not be reading, especially if this happens multiple times and the person appears nervous that you saw him, that is activity that is suspicious and should be reported, Barlow told McClatchy. 'The insider threat team then looks at the surrounding facts and draws the conclusions about the activity.' Some agencies, however, have taken the program further than merely looking for deviations from normal work patterns. The FBI is asking private security personnel to be on the lookout for employees with 'a desire to help the ""underdog"" or a particular cause,' those who are 'James Bond Wannabe[s], and anyone with a 'divided loyalty: allegiance to another person or company or to a country besides the United States.' The Pentagon is reportedly implementing a system-wide training program whose goal is to set up Insider Threat Program offices with access to every security official and contractor manager. 'What we really point out is if you’re in doubt, report, because that’s what the investigative personnel are there to do, is to get the bottom of ""is this just noise or is this something that is really going on?""' a senior Army counterintelligence and security official named Larry Gillis told McClatchy. White House press secretary Jay Carney admitted Wednesday that a question about the Insider Threat Program 'stumped' him. 'I confess that I did not go read the McClatchy story,' he said . The program has become the subject of ridicule among some experts who say noticing odd behaviors isn't an effective tool for identifying future espionage suspects. Thomas Fingar, a former State Department intelligence chief who chaired the National Intelligence Council, said that 'an amateur' like a typical federal employee would have little success. He also said employees should be oriented toward helping their co-workers, not toward reporting them for internal discipline. But the Obama administration is poised to implement the program fully, following Edward Snowden's disclosures about NSA programs that scoop up communications data from ordinary Americans on the strength of directives from secretive courts. 'Leaks related to national security can put people at risk,' the president said just weeks ago. 'They can put men and women in uniform that I’ve sent into the battlefield at risk. They can put some of our intelligence officers, who are in various, dangerous situations that are easily compromised, at risk. ... So I make no apologies, and I don’t think the American people would expect me as commander in chief not to be concerned about information that might compromise their missions or might get them killed.'","Reporter's question about the secret program has Obama press secretary Jay Carney 'stumped' during White House briefing .

Just when you thought Gene Simmons couldn’t get any more outrageous - the KISS rocker has said people who battle with depression should kill themselves prompting an Australian radio station to boycott the band’s music. Simmons’ shocking remarks were made in an interview when asked if he still got along with the original band members. ‘No, I don't get along with anybody who's a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their head and sees themselves as a victim,’ Simmons said to music website Songfacts. His astounding rant, which included the harsh words: ‘F***you, then kill yourself’ when talking about people who suffer from mental health issues, has prompted the Triple M radio station pull all KISS tracks from playlists across the country. Scroll down for video . Gene Simmons told people who battled with depression: ‘F***you, then kill yourself’ The outspoken rocker commented that drug addicts and alcoholics always have the attitude of ‘the world is a harsh place.’ ‘My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don't want to hear f*** all about ""the world as a harsh place. She gets up every day, smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say, ""I'm depressed, I live in Seattle."" F*** you, then kill yourself.’ 'I never understand, because I always call them on their bluff. I'm the guy who says 'Jump!' when there's a guy on top of a building who says, ""That's it, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to jump."" Simmons then went on to imply that people with suicidal tendencies were attention seekers. ‘Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the f*** up, have some dignity and jump! You've got the crowd. ‘ . ‘By the way, you walk up to the same guy on a ledge who threatens to jump and put a gun to his head, ""I'm going to blow your f***in' head off!"" He'll go, ""Please don't!""

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has suggested one of his drivers will require psychological counselling should they lose this year's Formula One world title by the controversial double-points system. For the final race of the campaign, which this year will be in Abu Dhabi in November, the top 10 drivers will collect twice the normal amount of points for a race, with the winner enjoying 50. When announced in December, fans worldwide vehemently criticised F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone's plan, believing it to be too artificial and a disservice to the sport. Unfair: Toto Wolff has condemned the controversial double-points system . Wolff has never been a fan either, and with it now becoming patently obvious either Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg will win the crown, he has openly joined the chorus of condemnation. Following a German Grand Prix won by Rosberg, with Hamilton a superb third after starting from 20th on the grid to limit the damage to his team-mate, the gap between the two is now 14 points. With it likely to remain nip and tuck between them over the second half of the season, Wolff said: 'I would be very surprised if it didn't come down to Abu Dhabi, to the very famous double points. 'It means even if you're 30 points behind then you can turn it around in Abu Dhabi if the leading guy retires. 'So maybe Bernie was right, that double points is going to keep the championship open until the last race. Jubilant: Nico Rosberg celebrates his German Grand Prix win with Mercedes . 'But I don't think it's fair. I don't think we should have done it. 'The reason we did was because the commercial rights holder is head of sponsorship and he cares about the TV audience and the need to keep the excitement until the end, the last race. 'As I said, it looks like he might be right, that the last race is going to be the decisive one, and I would be very surprised if the audiences weren't considerably higher than they would normally be.' Should a driver lose by such a system, Wolff believes it would be hard for that man to bear. 'Neither of them will care if they won it that way,' added Wolff. 'But the one who loses on double points will need some psychological treatment - although we're not there yet.' Winner: Nico Rosberg drives during the German Grand Prix at Hockenheimring on Sunday . VIDEO Rosberg signs Mercedes extensionÂ . From Hamilton's perspective, to claim via double points what would be his second world title is irrelevant in his eyes. 'I want to win it,' said Hamilton. 'I'm not going to get to the end of the season, and if I won it that way, say I didn't want to win it that way. I just want to win the world championship. 'It's not just that one race that will decide it, but all the races before and how I performed before that will characterise the way I feel about it.'","Mercedes boss claims one of his drivers with need psychological treatment' if they lose thanks to the double-points system .

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Emily Crane . Australian fashion designer Ruth Tarvydas, pictured at her catwalk show in Perth Fashion Week in 2010,  has been found dead outside her East Perth apartment . Australian fashion designer Ruth Tarvydas had faced financial woes in the years leading up to her death on Friday and reportedly owed the bank almost $1million. Ms Tarvydas was found dead outside her East Perth apartment at 8am on Friday morning. The designer, aged in her late 60s, had become increasingly reclusive after her label RTI was liquidated last August, according to Sydney Confidential. Ms Tarvydas was forced to close the doors of her high-profile King Street boutique in Perth’s CBD in 2012 after it went into administration – leaving her with as little as $200 in the bank. The designer owed ANZ Banking Group nearly $1million, which the bank sought following the store’s closure, Perth Now reports. She told Perth radio station 92.9 back in 2012 that she had to sell her house and blamed high rent, roadworks and a sluggish retail sector for sending her business into administration after her bank withdrew financial support. The collapse of her business was the subject of a six-part ABC documentary, Boomtown, in December. She said at the time she wanted to use her appearance in the documentary to show off her designs to new audiences in the hope it would encourage them to buy her $500 to $1000 dresses. Ms Tarvydas said she was trying to pull her head in financially and started renting back her East Perth apartment late last year. Scroll down for video . The fashion star was last seen alive on the 14th floor of the City Towers building, pictured, on Forrest Avenue in East Perth . Shocked: An employee of Ruth Tarvydas meets with a Tarvydas family member outside the City Towers building . She was able to keep one of her stores open in Claremont, in Perth’s western suburbs, because her landlord John Bond offered her a special lease. He said the designer had been under 'enormous economic pressure' and that she experienced a massive blow at the closure of her King Street store. 'She was and remains a founder of high end fashion within Western Australia, and her work has been embraced worldwide,' Mr Bond said. Ms Tarvydas counted high-profile celebrities among her clients and her pieces have been sold in high-fashion London stores including Selfridges and Harrods in the UK. Her clients included Jennifer Hawkins, Rihanna, Emma Watson, Amy Winehouse, Jodie Kidd and Rachel Hunter. One of most well-known designs was the red backless gown Rebecca Judd wore to the 2004 AFL Brownlow Medal awards with her footballer husband Chris Judd. The dress sparked controversy for its revealing neckline plunging to the navel. Mrs Judd posted a tribute to the designer on social media on Friday night with a picture of herself wearing the iconic gown. 'You changed my life with your red dress Ruth. RIP beautiful lady x,' she posted on Twitter and Instagram. That red dress: Ms Tarvydas designed the gown worn by Rebecca Judd, pictured at the Brownlow Medal ceremony in 2004, with now-husband Chris Judd . News of the shock death spread quickly as people took to social media to offer their condolences . A colleague arrives at the residential tower following Ms Tarvydas' sudden death. The designer was considered a pioneer of Australian fashion . Police found the body of Ms Tarvydas outside on the ground floor of her Forrest Avenue apartment. 'There was no criminal suggestion,' a police spokeswoman said. 'She was seen by someone on the 14th floor of an apartment building and the police discovered her on the street (Forrest Avenue) at about 8.30am. 'A report will be prepared by the coroner.' Grief-stricken friends and family arrived at Ms Tarvydas' home throughout the day and her death has sent shock waves through Perth's fashion community . In 2012, the Lithuanian-born designer revealed she was forced to sell her home due to mounting financial struggles faced by her business . Tribute: Rebecca Judd took to Instagram to express her grief at the loss of Western Australian fashion designer, who helped the model become a household name . In one of her final interviews with Hello Darlink!, which took place last year, the designer described herself as a 'survivor'. 'I think the real Ruth is just a survivor,' she said. 'The real Ruth is somebody who loves to support people.' She went on to say she had assisted charities, her staff over the years and even the tax department. Ms Tarvydas also spoke about her brother Harvey, who died in 2012. The pair opened House of Tarvydas together in 1968, while he was a medical student. The fashion star described herself as a 'survivor' and said she loved to support others in one of her final interviews . The designer candidly opened up about her life in the fashion business some of her career highlights . The interview concluded with the designer talking about the future. 'We're just starting,' she said. 'We have huge plans for Paris for next year (2014) and then of course I thought maybe the moon... Big plans.' The Perth fashion community has been rocked by the news, taking to social media to express shock and pain at the loss. Australian Designer Aurelio Costarella wrote on Twitter that he was 'devastated' by the sudden death. Mr Costarella knew the fashion starlet for 25 years and said she 'really paved the way for all of us,' reported ABC TV. 'I really looked up to Ruth in so many ways, and it's just such a sad loss for the industry. Ruth really was the first West Australian designer to go out there and make her mark internationally,' he said. 'I mean she's part of West Australian history as far as I'm concerned.' Former Miss Universe contestant Scherri-Lee Biggs also expressed her grief at the news posting 'what a sad day' on Twitter. Trendsetter: The industry icon, pictured with a friend in March, was the first Australian to export her fashion label overseas . Shocked: Australian designer Aurelio Costarella took to Twitter to pay tribute to Ms Tarvydas . Scherri-Lee Biggs said on Twitter that the designer would be remember for her work and 'beautiful soul' The Perth designer was born in Lithuania and arrived with her family in Fremantle as a two-year old after they fled post-WWII Germany. Designing clothes as a teenager, Ms Tarvydas opened her first store with her brother in Hay Street, Perth in 1969 while still in her teens. As her success grew, she expanded her business internationally with boutiques in Paris and Malaysia and also Sydney. She was the first Australian fashion designer to export overseas and the first to be stocked at Selfridges in 1983. The designer opened her King Street store in 2008 and was commissioned to design the national costume for 2009 Miss Universe contestant Rachael Finch. Ms Tarvydas was set to make her Paris Fashion Week debut next month. The fashion star is not survived by any children and previously said while she loved kids, she was not born to be a mother, according to Perth Now. Opening her first store as a teenager in 1969, Ms Tarvydas's career flourished and she was reportedly due to make her Paris Fashion Week debut in May this year . The fashion designer, pictured with a friend in February and wearing her signature pilot hat, was known for producing edgy and sexy collections . In recent years the designer's business struggled and she was forced to close her flagship store in Perth CBD in 2012 . Looking forward: The designer, pictured with models, recently spoke to her business partner about what the future held . Ms Tarvydas’ business partner Jeremy Balius spoke to TV crews outside the her apartment on Friday. 'When I spoke with her yesterday we laughed and talked at length about what the future holds and the bright horizon we could see,' he said. 'Our final words to each other were that we felt blessed to have each other in our lives. I’m thankful of the time we had together.' Producer Roz Silvestrin was part of the team who followed the designer for a year while filming her highs and lows for the Boomtown documentary. Toast of the town: The Fashion doyenne is being remember for her positive personality as well as her designs . Despite facing 'enormous' financial difficulties, the designer's landlord said she remained positive and determined . 'She was such a positive person, even when the chips were down she always said ""we'll come out of this"". She was such a survivor,' Mr Silvestrin said. Telstra Perth Fashion Festival director Mariella Harvey-Hanrahan said the death was a very sad day for fashion and described her as a hallmark Western Australian designer with a genuine heart. Condolences also came from Perth Lord Mayor Lisa Scaffidi, who said Ms Tarvydas was a Perth treasure. 'And I’m sure she still had a lot of designs still in her. It is a tragic loss for the industry, for our city and for everyone that knows her,' Ms Scaffidi said. There are several similarities between Ms Tarvydas' death and that of American fashion designer L'Wren Scott, pictured with partner Mick Jagger in December 2013, who died in March. Ms Tarvydas' shock death has sparked comparisions the recent death of American fashion designer L'Wren Scott on March 17. The 49-year-old fashion designer was $6 million in debt to her creditors when she died and was distraught and 'embarrassed' over her failing business. The former model's body was discovered in her Manhattan apartment while her longtime partner, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, was in Australia for an upcoming tour, which had to be postponed.

If this week’s USPGA Championship represents the last chance saloon as far as Lee Westwood’s Ryder Cup hopes are concerned, then at least he is heading there with his glass half-full rather than half-empty. The Englishman shrugged off months of indifferent form on Sunday with a brilliant final round 63 in the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational to give himself a wonderful confidence boost heading to the season’s final major at Valhalla. ‘I felt like it was coming all week but I just kept making silly mistakes over the first three rounds,’ he said. ‘This was a lot more like me, though. I hit the ball really well and now I’ve got some momentum heading to the USPGA.’ Aiming high: Lee Westwood is still confident of making Europe's Ryder Cup team .

The bigger picture, of course, is that the USPGA is the last big one with regard to automatic qualifying for the Ryder Cup.

"By . Mike Dawes . Angel Cabrera claimed his first PGA Tour win outside of the major championships with a final-round 64 at the Greenbrier Classic. The Argentinian, who won the 2007 US Open and 2009 Masters, finished 16 under par at White Sulphur Springs to hold off the emotional charge of George McNeill, whose 61 included a hole in one at the eighth. McNeill’s consolation is a qualifying place for the Open Championship - though it remains to be seen if he will make the trip to Royal Liverpool, having already pulled out of next week’s John Deere Classic due to a family illness. Champion: Argentine Angel Cabrera won the Greenbrier Classic in White Sulphur Springs . Success: It was the Argentine's first career PGA Tour win outside of the majors . Pedigree: Cabrera has won two major championships, the 2009 Masters and the 2007 US Open . His ace was one of two on the day, emulated by Bud Cauley at the 18th. Cabrera produced the next best thing by holing his 175-yard approach for an eagle two at the 14th and - despite a pair of bogeys after that - he held his nerve to complete a two-stroke victory. He told Sky Sports 4 afterwards:'I needed this, I’ve been working really hard and I’m really happy I won. 'I hit it very solidly, I was under control and the work we’ve been doing paid off.' McNeill is joined by Chris Stroud, Cameron Tringale and overnight leader Billy Hurley III in qualifying for the Open, with four places available to the top finishers not already exempt. The latter trio actually shared fourth place on nine under par with Cauley and Will Wilcox, but got the nod due to their superior world rankings. A post on the official Open Championship Twitter feed shortly after the end of the round read: ""Congratulations to George McNeill, @ChrisStroudPGA , @CamTringalePGA, and @BillyHurley3 on qualifying for £TheOpen. See you at @RLGCHoylake!"" Ace: George McNeill was one of two golfers on the final day to shoot hole in ones . A long . putt for birdie at the third set the wheels in motion for Cabrera, who . picked up further shots with pin-high approaches at the fifth and . seventh seeing him out in 31. He . knocked in a good 20-foot putt at the 11th, calmly holed out for birdie . at the next and punched the air as his perfect iron into the next . checked left and rolled into the hole. With . a three-shot lead, it seemed the tournament was wrapped up - but he . misjudged his chips at the next two holes and was unable to save par on . either occasion. Par . at 16 and birdie at the long 17th steadied the ship and victory was . completed with a tap-in after an excellent first putt along the side of . the huge ridge running across the final green. McNeill . produced a spectacular front nine of 28, with his 219-yard hole in one . following four straight birdies for a run of three-three-three-three-one . from the fourth.

'It's hard. 'I played good today, it was a good middle part of the round but like I said, golf doesn't mean all that much.' His 61 equalled the best round of the week, matching Troy Matteson's effort on day two.Webb Simpson, the 2012 US Open champion, finished third on his own at 10 under par after a bogey-free, seven-under-par 63.

"By . Nick Purewal . Simon Easterby has been confirmed as Ireland's new forwards coach. The former Ireland captain will replace John Plumtree in head coach Joe Schmidt's back-room set-up, with the New Zealander returning home for family reasons. Easterby will assume his new role in October, in time for Ireland's autumn international Guinness Series of Tests against South Africa, Georgia and Australia. Going green: Simon Easterby (C) has left Scarlets to become Ireland's new forwards coach . Experience: Simon Easterby, pictured tackling Jonny Wilkinson, was a former captain of his country . Easterby will leave the Scarlets after two years as head coach of the club where he plied his back-row trade for seven years. 'Simon has tremendous Test match experience combined with an in-depth knowledge of the current national squad players,' said Ireland boss Schmidt. 'He is well-known to Irish rugby supporters, and to many of the players, and his knowledge and experience will help drive the team forward.' Easterby won 65 Ireland caps between 2000 and 2008, touring New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions in 2005. The 38-year-old's departure adds another further blow to the beleaguered Welsh rugby set-up, with the union and regions still continuing their civil war. Blues and Wales captain Sam Warburton remains the only international star to have signed a central contract, and he is still awaiting final confirmation of his club commitments for the new campaign. Easterby will bolster Ireland's ranks, with David Nucifora now in place as high performance manager and Les Kiss continuing as defence coach - despite taking on the caretaker rugby director role at Ulster. Kiss has stepped into the breach following David Humphreys' move to Aviva Premiership club Gloucester. Good time to come: Ireland celebrate winning the RBS Six Nations at the Stade de France, 2014 . Easterby admitted he is relishing his impending move, with Ireland heading into the new campaign as the reigning RBS 6 Nations champions. 'It's an exciting time to be involved in Irish rugby and I am looking forward to helping the team continue to be as competitive as possible,' he said. Easterby will have his work cut out to match Plumtree's impact, with the Kiwi having transformed Ireland's pack into a hard-nosed, unforgiving unit. Plumtree's legacy will include turning Ireland's driving line-out into one of the side's chief weapons, and Easterby will know he must sustain the high levels of intensity Ireland showed in the tight last season.","Simon Easterby has been confirmed as Ireland's new forwards coach .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Ask Ian Poulter about the fact virtually everyone thinks him a racing certainty for a wild card for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next month, and he smiles knowingly. ‘That would be a lovely little story for you if I start agreeing with all that, wouldn’t it?’ he said. ‘You’re not having that. What can I say? It’s hardly for me to say I should be getting a wildcard.’ Every two years the tasty sub-plot at the USPGA Championship is the pivotal role it plays in deciding the last spots for the two Ryder Cup teams, and this year’s promises to be a belter. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it: Justin Rose and Ian Poulter practised together at Valhalla . Playing to the galleries: Poulter engages with the crowd on his way round Valhalla six years ago . Basically, as far as Europe are concerned, there are seven players whom you could throw a blanket over chasing two spots plus three wildcards, with an eighth, Lee Westwood, somewhat adrift but a definite contender for the latter. As things stand, Graeme McDowell’s top 10 at the Bridgestone Invitational last week has taken him into eighth place, with Jamie Donaldson now clinging to the last automatic spot over Luke Donald by the skin of his teeth. The men who can breathe easily are Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Henrik Stenson, Victor Dubuisson, Thomas Bjorn, Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer. Just behind Donald and the Scot Stephen Gallacher in 12th spot, and just ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Francesco Molinari, comes Poulter. Adding to the fascination for him is the season’s final major taking place at Valhalla, where his Ryder Cup reputation took off in 2008 despite the fact he finished on the losing side. It all came flooding back as he made his way off the tee at the par-three 14th. ‘I can certainly remember what happened here on the Sunday because it was the most disappointed I have ever felt on a golf course,’ he said. ‘I was winning my match comfortably but the news had just filtered through that we had lost. It’s hard to describe what that is like other than to say you just feel horribly empty. So I played well. What did that matter? ‘You’re judged on how you perform as a team and you can hardly feel personally satisfied in those circumstances.’ Putting in the hard yards: Poulter chips onto the green under the watchful eye of caddie Terry Mundy . Lucky strike: Poulter tees off at Valhalla, aware that a good performance could earn him a Ryder Cup spot . It is a fact Europe have won both matches since while Poulter has not dropped so much as a single half-point in his last seven games. It is the reason why ‘the Poults Clause,’ as Lee Westwood wittily described how a place had to be found for Poulter following his miracles at Medinah, will be activated if necessary, despite the fact the man in question has not had a top 10 all summer. Will a return to Valhalla bring about a welcome change of fortune? ‘It will probably look silly from the outside given my results but I am feeling good about my game,’ he said. ‘I did play well here in 2008 and I need to make plenty of birdies as I did then. As for the Ryder Cup, I’m fully aware I am not in the team but close enough that one good week can do it for me. So let’s get out there and concentrate on playing well.’ Alongside him, just as he was during that Ryder Cup six years ago, was his old mucker Justin Rose. ‘Never a dull moment with Poults, is there?’ said Rose, laughing. Like most people, the Englishman thinks Poulter, McDowell and Donald will get in either automatically or through a wildcard, leaving two spots to fill. Rose thinks Westwood a slight favourite for one via a wildcard but Donaldson and Gallacher look in the box seats to me. This week, however, could change all that. ‘You wouldn’t be surprised if something dramatic happened, would you?’ said Rose. Great drama: Europe celebrate as Poulter and McDowell in their fourballs match on the 18th in 2008 . Popular support: Poulter and Rose sign assorted golf paraphernalia ahead of the USPGA . Then there is the American team, with 11 places all but sorted: Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Jason Dufner, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley. Who gets the last one? Surely not Tiger Woods, from whom there was still no word, at the time of writing, as to whether he will make the starting line-up. What will Rory do next? Will Rose, Adam Scott, Stenson or Garcia knock him off his No 1 perch with a win? As if the battle for the season’s final major was not enough, there is an obvious chance for others to have the final word regarding a Ryder Cup place. It should be some week. Just the way Poulter likes it.","Poulter could be chosen by captain Paul McGinley as one of his two wild card picks .

"By . Matt Barlow for Daily Mail . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Alan Shearer has launched a ferocious critique of modern English footballers ahead of the new season, claiming they are 'overpaid' in a 'too-much-too-young' industry and lack the 'hunger' and 'desire' to resist the glut of foreign imports. Shearer also admitted he feared England were doomed to fail at Euro 2016 with no quick exit from the mess in evidence at the World Cup in Brazil and blamed Roy Hodgson for repeating the mistakes he made at Euro 2012. 'We were hopeless,' fumed the former England captain. 'No-one can argue with that. No-one can say we were great, can they? Roy can’t sit there and say we played some good football and we were unlucky. We weren’t. We weren’t good enough.' Opinionated: Alan Shearer was far from happy with England's World Cup performances in Brazil . World Cup pundit: Shearer was part of the BBC's punditry team in Brazil along with the likes of Rio Ferdinand . Shearer, who scored 30 goals in 63 games for his country, delivered his gloomy forecast at a preview screening of the BBC documentary 'Match of the Day at 50' which celebrates the flagship football show. 'It is worrying,' he said. 'There’s so many reasons, not one. There’s too many foreign players and English players are not getting a chance, absolutely. They’ re paid too much too young, not enough hunger, without a doubt, desire, being put on a pedestal too quickly. 'Put all those together and it’s the reason why we put in another poor performance at a World Cup. Can I see it changing? I desperately hope so, but I don’t see it changing in the near future. I see it changing in six-eight-10 years. 'I don’t see it changing at the next tournament. I hope I’m wrong.' England returned with only one point from three games in Brazil, finishing bottom of a group won by Costa Rica, but the performances of young players like Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley seemed to offer encouragement. 'We keep on throwing young names forward every two or four years, to say: ""these are the ones"" but there’s not many keep coming through,' said Shearer. 'I was one of the few who stuck with Roy after the tournament and said he should be in charge. Public backing: Shearer believes Hodgson is the right man for the job despite England's World Cup failure . Too much, too soon: Shearer believes England's young starlets are picking up huge wage cheques . 'I still say that but, on the other hand, when you look at teams like Costa Rica, you can’t say they had more ability than us but they were better organised and they got further in the tournament than us and there has to be a big question mark. 'We made the same mistakes in this tournament we made in the last tournaments, two years ago and four years ago. Two years ago we couldn’t get hold of Pirlo. This tournament we still couldn’t get hold of Pirlo. It doesn’t take a genius to work that out, does it?' Shearer, who admits he no longer has an appetite to be a manager, wants to see a return to a tougher apprenticeship but young English players are so prized by clubs that they can demand inflated transfer fees and wages. Jose Mourinho revealed that Luke Shaw, 19, wanted more than £100,000 a week to join Chelsea from Southampton this summer. Barkley has signed a new contract at the Everton since the World Cup thought to be worth £65,000-a-week. Liverpool are keen to offer Sterling, also 19, a pay-rise to his £30,000-a-week deal after a good season. 'I don’t want to sound like an old f**t but they get paid too much too soon,' said Shearer. 'It has to have an effect. I got paid £27-a-week when I was 17 on a youth training scheme at Southampton. Did I like it? No, I didn’t but looking back it did me the world of good.

"By . Phil Casey . Graeme McDowell was full of admiration for Rory McIlroy's Open victory on Sunday, but does not believe his fellow Northern Irishman can go on to dominate the game. McIlroy's two shot-win over Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler at Royal Liverpool made him just the third player after Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus to have won three majors by the age of 25. However, McDowell feels the talented new generation in the game will make it impossible for McIlroy to match Woods at his prime, the former world number one winning seven of his 14 major titles between August 1999 and June 2002. Champion: Rory McIlroy holds the Claret Jug after winning the 2014 British Open Golf Championship . On top of the world: McIlroy's hitting the ball as well as anyone could, but fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell believes there are too many great players for him to dominate . VIDEO The Open Championship: Final RoundÂ Â . 'I don't think we'll ever see the dominance of Tiger Woods in the late '90s, early 2000s. I don't think we're ever going to see that again,' said McDowell who proved his own point as one of 15 different winners of the 16 majors played between 2009 and 2012. 'For every Rory there's an Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia and a Tiger and a Phil (Mickelson). There's too many good players now. It's so deep. It's so strong. Everyone is so good. 'I don't think we're going to see that dominance again for a while unless somebody comes out who has perfected the imperfectable. I think these guys, the best players in the world, are playing pretty close to as good as you can play, really. This game is hard. Out with a bang: McDowell had his own moment of brilliance, an eagle on the 18th for a 67-shot fourth round . Never again: McDowell doesn't think any player will dominate the way Tiger Woods did in his pomp . 'You can't play much better than Rory is . hitting the ball. That's as good as it gets. Unfortunately you can't . hole every putt, or else you'd be shooting 58 every day. It's just not . happening.' Phil Mickelson, who McIlroy succeeded as Open champion, agreed with McDowell's assessment, adding: ""We used to say there will never be another Nicklaus, and then along came Tiger. You never want to discount the possibility of someone coming along and dominating. 'But nobody has really asserted themselves week in and week out the way Tiger did for such a long period of time. We'll have great performances, like Rory this week. Like (Martin) Kaymer at the US Open and so forth. But it's very hard to do that week in and week out the way Tiger did. That's why it was so impressive what he did.' Podium: McIlroy (right) stands with (from left) Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler, second and third at the Open . McIlroy's previous two major wins had both been by eight shots, but McDowell feels his Ryder Cup team-mate could benefit from having to work hard to hold off Garcia's challenge on the final day at Hoylake. 'I think he's learning all the time,"" added McDowell, who finished joint ninth. ""Rory gets it done from the fairway, 370 yards down the middle of it. It's easy to get it done from there. I say it's easy, I'd like to have a go at it.'Tiger had that capability of getting it done ugly. Perhaps Rory has to prove that he's got that side to him.'","Rory Mcllroy won the Open Championship on Sunday .

Former referees chief Keith Hackett has criticised the decision that could see the Premier League's oldest ever referee take charge of a game on opening weekend. Nigel Miller has been appointed as fourth official for Sunderland's visit to West Brom on Saturday, despite being 51 years old - and could find himself as the man in the middle if Neil Swarbrick gets injured. And Hackett says that Professional Game Match Officials Limited, who choose the officials for each top flight game, are taking big risks with referees more likely to pick up injuries at the start of the new season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch top referee Howard Webb retire at the age of 43 . Too old? Keith Hackett has raised concerns about the appointment of Nigel Miller as fourth official . Unconvinced:  Hackett used to be head of referees and has criticised the PGMOL ahead of the new season . 'The Premier League throws up that danger more than any other due to the speed and intensity of the games, which will expose any pull or strain that a referee might be carrying,' Hackett said in his You are the ref column. 'I believe too much risk is being taken by the PGMOL management team.' All Premier League refs have to pass an intensive fitness test to take charge of top flight matches - and Miller is not one of the 17 members of the FA's Select Group of Referees. '(Miller) will in my opinion have difficulty in meeting the minimum 1000m at 7m per second sprint values or even get anywhere near the thirty plus sprints required to be produced to maintain contact with a Premier League game,' Hackett added. 'Why is the PGMOL not appointing its select group referees to all double up over the opening weekend? 'Will Mr Miller, born in 1960, be able to cope with the speed and intensity requirements of a Premier League game should he have to come on? 'I have my doubts…. so why expose the Premier League games to such a high-risk strategy by not getting the select group Referees to double up?'

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Alan Pardew admits there are no more excuses after persuading owner Mike Ashley to invest £40million in his Newcastle squad this summer. The United manager signed off from last season with supporters calling for him to be sacked after a horrendous run of 15 defeats in 21 from Christmas onwards. That led to a frank discussion between Pardew and his billionaire boss and the upshot was nine new players, headed by £12m France playmaker Remy Cabella. Ready to go: Newcastle players train ahead of their season opener against Manchester City . Good business: Jamaal Lascelles (left) and Karl Darlow (right) are among the players signed by Alan Pardew . Top acquisition: Summer signing Remy Cabella is expected to play a major role for Newcastle this season . And, ahead of Sunday's opener at home to champions Manchester City, Pardew said: ‘It was fairly obvious that he (Ashley) listened to me at the back end of last year and the support I’ve had in terms of the new signings is exactly what was needed. ‘I’ve nothing to moan about now in terms of what’s happened this summer. We’ve got a strong squad, perhaps the biggest and best I’ve ever had in terms of options, so we’re in a great position.’ He went on: ‘When I signed the new (eight-year) contract, Mike always knew there would be ups and downs for both of us. ‘He stood by me and this feels like an up time for me. He’s armed me again. Stand by me: Pardew is delighted with the way Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has backed him this summer . ‘One thing I can always give him is an honesty of where we are and he listens – that’s why so many players have entered the building, we needed them. ‘It’s that kind of relationship you can only hope for as a Premier League manager and I’m lucky enough to have it. I hope I can repay him this season.’ Pardew, then, is under pressure to deliver from the off and fans, disillusioned at the manner in which last season fell away, are also demanding an instant return. ‘I have to live with (the pressure) constantly because I live in the city, I’m surrounded by fans and they remind me constantly,’ he said. ‘I have to shield myself a little bit and almost put myself in a bubble, of trying to do the job to the best of my ability.’","Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has made nine signings so far this summer .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has dedicated the forthcoming season to the two fans who died in the Malaysian Airlines tragedy. John Alder and Liam Sweeney were killed when flight MH17 came down in eastern Ukraine last week as they travelled to New Zealand to watch the Magpies play. The club paid its own tribute to the pair at the Sir Bobby Robson statue at St James' Park, and members of the public have added their own in the days since. Tragic: John Alder and Liam Sweeney were travelling out to New Zealand watch their beloved team . Respect: Fans paid tribute to Alder and Sweeney outside St James Park . However, Pardew is hoping his team can produce the kind of performances on the pitch next season to give their grieving families something to remember them by. He told a press conference: 'None of us would be sitting here without the fans. 'Owners and managers come and go, as do players, but the fans are always there, and these two guys in particular, to go to the lengths that they did to get out here, has brought home just how important supporters are to us. 'Sometimes when you lose lives in that manner, it puts into context what we do. 'This season we want to give their families something to remember them by, by having a successful season.' Newcastle face Sydney FC on Tuesday in their opening fixture in the southern hemisphere, and Pardew has vowed to play a strong team. Never forgotten: A badge titled Toon forever is left by the Sir Bobby Robson statue . Classy: Over 24,000 has been raised in memory of the duo after Sunderland fan Gary Ferguson set up a memorial page . He said: 'It's important we represent ourselves in the right manner, especially after losing John and Liam - our supporters who were travelling out here. 'We have to conduct ourselves well on and off the pitch and get some strong results. 'That is what they would have wanted and that is what we want, so in memory of those guys in particular, we want this to be a successful tour. 'We have to honour these guys in the right manner because it does mean a lot to us. Their tragic loss has hurt the group. 'On Tuesday, I will be playing a very strong side. That is only right and fair in light of what's happened.' The tragedy, in which a total of 298 people died, prompted Sunderland fan Gary Ferguson to set up a fund with the intention of raising money to buy flowers to lay at St James'. Kind words: Pardew wants Newcastle to make sure they have a good season in memory of the late duo . His £100 target was reached within minutes as fellow Black Cats supporters answered his call, and with fans of other clubs also becoming involved, the total had reached in excess of £22,000 by Monday morning. Pardew added: 'A lot is made of the rivalry between the two cities, and of course that is there. 'But I would like to thank all the Sunderland fans who have paid tribute and helped raise a staggering amount already. 'I am very proud of Sunderland Football Club for the way they have conducted themselves and I want to thank them.'","Alan Pardew wants the Toon to have a season to remember in memory of the late duo John Alder and Liam Sweeney .

Rory McIlroy wants to use his Open triumph as a springboard to further success this season, but insists he has never thought about matching Jack Nicklaus' record haul of major titles. McIlroy's win at Royal Liverpool earlier this month made him just the third player after Nicklaus and Tiger Woods to win three majors by the age of 25. And although the Northern Irishman would love to win a second US PGA title next week before trying to complete a career Grand Slam in next year's Masters, Nicklaus' tally of 18 major titles is not on his mind.

McIlroy can reclaim top spot in the world rankings for the first time since March last year with a victory at Firestone Country Club, before turning his attention to the final major of the year at Valhalla. 'This course is going to set up well for me this week,' added McIlroy, who revealed he had taken pictures of the Claret Jug in various places, even 'on top of the toilet.' 'It's a long course anyway and it's playing just that bit longer with all the rain they've had. It's a course that I've done pretty well on before and I feel comfortable on. Valhalla should set up well for me so I can definitely have a chance. Disaster! Rory McIlroy should have won his fist major at the 2011 Masters but for a final day meltdown . 'World number one is a big goal of mine and I've never won a World Golf Championship. That's another thing I'd like to knock off the list. 'I think every time you have success you have to reassess your goals. It's two-thirds through the season and a lot of the goals I set for myself at the start of the year I have already achieved so that's when you have to reassess, celebrate that for a couple of days but then move on, keep moving forward and thinking about what you want to achieve. 'At the end of the year you can really reflect on everything you've done and enjoy it. I feel like I have a lot of momentum and I can carry that through to the end of the year and hopefully ride that and play some golf similar to what you saw at Hoylake.' Help the aged? Rory McIlroy is against Bernard Langer being included in the Ryder Cup team . Victory at Hoylake also took McIlroy top of the Ryder Cup qualification standings, but the 25-year-old does not think his Senior Open counterpart should join him on the team at Gleneagles. Bernhard Langer's record 13-shot win at Royal Porthcawl has led to speculation the 56-year-old could be considered as a wild card by captain Paul McGinley, but McIlroy said: 'I think the team dynamic is pretty good at the minute with the mix that we've got and to bring someone in that hasn't spent much time around us mightn't be the best. 'He's not playing against the regular guys week in and week out but he's playing great golf obviously and what he's done this year, and Monty (Colin Montgomerie, who has won two senior majors in 2014) as well has been fantastic.
