"(CNN) -- Red Bull's appeal against Daniel Ricciardo's disqualification at last month's Australian Grand Prix has been rejected by the International Automobile Federation (FIA). The Australian driver finished the race in second place but was later disqualified after it was found that his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate. A meeting of the FIA's International Court of Appeal heard evidence from all parties on Monday before announcing their decision on Tuesday morning. Ricciardo, who was making his debut for Red Bull, finished the opening race of the Formula One season behind Mercedes' Nico Rosberg only for stewards to later rule that his car had broken the sport's new fuel regulations. The rule, which states that each car is limited to 100kg of fuel per race, was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient. Following the race in Melbourne, Red Bull argued that there had been inconsistencies with the FIA's fuel flow meter throughout the weekend, but motorsport's governing body did not agree. In a statement released Tuesday, Red Bull said: ""We always believed we adhered to the technical regulations throughout the 2014 Australian Grand Prix. We are sorry for Daniel that he will not be awarded the 18 points from the event, which we think he deserved. ""We will continue to work very hard to amass as many points as possible for the team, Daniel and Sebastian (Vettel) throughout the season. ""We will now move on from this and concentrate on this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix."" Ricciardo, understandably, was also disappointed, but said the ruling had made him hungrier than ever. ""It's disappointing not to get the 18 points from Australia, but if anything it gives me more motivation to get back on the podium as soon as possible,"" Ricciardo said in a statement released on the Red Bull Racing website. ""I've had a few set-backs in the first couple of races this year, but in Bahrain I demonstrated that, if anything, I'm stronger for it and hungrier than ever to get back on the podium. Not that I need any more motivation, I'm pumped!"" The unsuccessful appeal means that the standings in both the constructors' and drivers' championship remain the same with the reigning world champions staying in fourth place with 35 points and Ricciardo 10th with 12 points. NASCAR's Haas mulls F1 entry date . Meanwhile, NASCAR team owner Gene Haas says he will make a decision over the next few weeks as to when his proposed U.S. F1 team will make its debut in the sport. Haas learned last week that the FIA had granted an application for the new team to enter the F1 championship. Initially, Haas hoped to line up on the grid next season, but that may be too early, he says. ""I think 2015 is too close and 2016 is too far,"" Haas said, Formula1.com reported. ""If we wait we'll end up spending even more money because we'll just be in a neutral position. We need to come up with a plan where we can arrive with a car, based on our partners' technology, within the rules of the FIA."" Haas has appointed Gunther Steiner, previously a technical director at Red Bull and Jaguar, as his team principal. ""We will announce in six to eight weeks what we are doing,"" Steiner said, Formula1.com reported. ""We want to make the right decision; we don't want to jump and say 'wow, we got this wrong' and fail. We have an option to start in 2016, so we will speak with people and make a qualified decision.""

"(CNN) -- Formula One may be entering a new era in 2014 but the Mercedes and Ferrari teams chose to pay homage to the man who remains the benchmark for the sport on the first day of pre-season testing. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who finished his career with Mercedes in 2012, remains in hospital in a medically-induced coma after a skiing accident at the end of December. The new Mercedes car -- the first 2014 car out on track Tuesday at the Jerez circuit in Spain -- ran with the message ""Keep Fighting Michael,"" on its silver livery. The Ferrari team, who Schumacher raced for between 1996 and 2006, also showed their support for their five-time world champion in Spain. On the eve of the first day of winter testing, the team's crew posed with a pit board showing the message ""Forza Michael"" while the new F14-T scarlet racer made its track debut in Jerez with the same words of encouragement. Ferrari plan to post 72 messages of support for Schumacher on their website to represent each of his wins with the Italian team. On Tuesday, the team published a note from Niki Lauda, who won two world championships for Ferrari in the 1970s, which read: ""Michael, every day I follow your improvements and every day I am close to you. I hope I can speak to you very, very soon!"" Schumacher is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury, sustained in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. His family have said the messages of support have given them strength but they have also asked for privacy from the clamoring media interest in his condition. Many dedicated motorsport journalists have turned their attention to Jerez, where 10 of the 11 F1 teams are due to trial their new look cars on track and put this season's major rule changes to the test. Sebastian Vettel, with the help of new Australian teammate Daniel Ricciardo, unveiled the new Red Bull that he hopes will power him to a fifth straight world title. ""The car looks very different,"" Vettel told reporters. ""There's a lot going on, the technology behind it is very complex."" F1 has ripped up the rulebook for the 2014 season, which opens with the Australian Grand Prix on 16 March. The 2014 F1 rule changes explained . The cars are now powered by 1.6-liter V6 turbo engines which also rely on a greater use of hybrid energy -- recovered through braking and from the car's exhaust gases. The unveiling of thinner, lower nose cones and narrower front wings, to comply with new design rules, has also raised eyebrows. With so many major changes, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, speaking to the media in Spain, warned: ""I think it's dangerous sometimes to be over confident that you have all the elements in place for the start of any season. ""We've enjoyed great continuity over the last few years - we've got a strong driver lineup, we've got a strong tech lineup, we've got great strength in depth. ""But you can't take anything for granted - Formula One, like any sport, can be unpredictable at times."" At the end of the opening day of the test, Vettel had ticked off just three laps in his brand new Red Bull and did not set a fastest time. ""It was difficult to get an impression of what the new car is like,"" Vettel told reporters. ""We weren't quite ready this morning and things took a little bit longer than expected. It was impossible to get a feeling for it today."" Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, didn't get to take his McLaren out of the garage for a spin after the team's progress was hampered by electrical issues. Ferrari set the fastest time of the day with their returning 2007 world champion, Kimi Raikkonen, at the helm just outpacing the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton, who set a lap time of one minute 27.80 seconds. ""From a driving point of view, I didn't feel any amazing difference, although it's much too early to give an opinion on this,"" Raikkonen told the Ferrari website. ""Overall, we can say it was a good start."" Hamilton was also pleased with his first day at work, despite crashing his Mercedes after just 18 laps. The team later explained that the car had a front wing problem.","Mercedes and Ferrari show support for Michael Schumacher on first day of testing .

"(Wired) -- Like a professional location scout for Grimm fairy tale movies, photographer Kilian Schönberger seeks out and explores the less-traveled regions of Europe, searching for places that test the boundaries of fantasy and reality. The results are haunting photographs that look like they were smuggled out of a dream. ""Tolkien's books, like Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, were inspired by the old European myths, legends and fairy tales,"" says Schönberger. ""The movies featured the wild landscapes of New Zealand -- but I wanted to find out if there are similar wild landscapes left in the populous region of Middle Europe, too. Therefore, I visited places in Germany, Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Austria."" The resulting series is called Brothers Grimm Homeland, for which Schönberger expertly uses framing, fog and lighting to subtly suggest the fairy tales of The Brothers Grimm. He lets our imaginations do the rest. Beginning with Children's and Household Tales, published in 1812, Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm collected and published folklore; specifically the stories that they believed reflected and preserved aspects of their own Germanic culture and faith. Stories such as Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty all originated in European folk tales. Thanks to their research, these fables held enough appeal to survive the centuries. ""As a kid I was deeply fascinated by the magic of those stories,"" says Schönberger. ""Now -- grown up and living in a rather big city (Cologne) -- this magic has disappeared in my everyday life ... I try to restore this world in my pictures."" Schönberger is a geographer as well as a photographer, and he combines both disciplines to communicate more than just the scenic beauty of a landscape. He does a considerable amount of research both ahead of time and in the field, taking into account landscape genesis, culture, and history. The locations he seeks are often rural and remote, and he uses fables and local fairy tales as a source when searching for new and lesser-known photo locations in Europe. Once he's finally found the right spot, the weather conditions have to match up perfectly. ""Fog is an essential ingredient for the otherworldly look I am searching for,"" Schönberger says. ""I would say I have 'mastered' my personal 'fog forecast' abilities, but it's still more often than not a game of pure chance whether the fog has the right density or not. Sometimes it lasts years until you'll get the desired conditions."" Schönberger actively began pursuing photography in 2003, starting with a compact Ricoh Caplio RR30. The following year, he spent his alternative service (Germany's version of mandatory military service) near the Alps, which took him to some amazing landscapes. ""This was the time I started to reflect on composition and light control,"" he says. ""One year later I unfortunately dropped the Ricoh camera down a waterfall -- seems like my photographic passion for landscapes was present from the beginning."" The sudden loss of his only camera eventually pushed him to purchase a DSLR in 2006, but his work didn't become what he considers truly ambitious for another three years. While on a six-month trip in Norway, he became drawn to scenes that characterize what he now describes as the ""melancholic and harsh beauty"" of his remote surroundings. ""In technology-driven urban environments, it's principally hard to find resting places untouched by disturbing visual, olfactory, or audible noise,"" Schönberger says. ""These kinds of places are endangered in today's world."" Along with the long hikes and inclement weather, Schönberger has the added challenge of being colorblind. The blindness affects several tones, rendering him incapable of distinguishing green from red, magenta from grey, or violet from blue. Rather than be detrimental to his work, over the years he's learned to transform it into a source of strength. By ignoring color, he's free to focus more on the composition, which can be difficult to tame in chaotic forest environments. Ultimately it's Schönberger's instincts, vision and editing that infuse his photos with fantasy and elevate them above simply beautiful landscapes. ""I don't want to show just portrayals of natural scenes,"" Schönberger says. ""I want to create visually accessible places where the visitor can put his mind at rest and make up his own stories.""

"(CNN) -- Let's give praise where praise is due. Invisible Children's Kony 2012 viral video campaign has done what no other advocacy organization has been able to do until now: capture 29 minutes worth of attention from over 50 million people worldwide. No amount of advertising genius from ""Mad Men"" could create that kind of buzz in a few days. In less than a week, Invisible Children (IC) has cemented the legitimacy of social media for global engagement if the Arab Spring hadn't already. But the problem is, as many have pointed out, it is the wrong conversation and wrong buzz. Which is just too bad because this campaign has the makings of what could have been a truly transformational development communication experiment. In two weeks, IC will have millions of dollars; you will have a t-shirt and bracelet; and Uganda and Central Africa will be left wondering what just happened. As we saw in the case of the Arab Spring social media-accelerated uprising, the agents of the conversation were those directly affected by the cause du jour - which at the time was to oust decades-long dictatorial rule. Instead, what we have here is a narrowly-focused fund-raising campaign where one organization inserts itself as the agent of change to a foreign travesty against humanity. Once again, let me be clear, there's nothing wrong with bringing attention to the issue. It's how it was done that I lament. In a few weeks, this breathless enthusiasm will be for naught. Read also: 'Kony 2012' viral video raises questions about filmmakers . Had we all more compassion, more empathy for global atrocities, the daily videos of sniper fire and innocents being killed from Syria would have moved us by now to say ""do something."" But they haven't. Why? Because no one has invaded our Facebook time line demanding we watch a 30-minute Hollywood production simplifying the issue for us. It is an indictment on what moves us to act. What does it say about our capacity to care when we are barely moved by video shot on shaky cellphone cameras of innocent people being slaughtered, but we suddenly get a collective conscious because of a slick Hollywood production documenting a 25-year-old issue on the decline. More children die of malaria, diarrhea, and nodding disease in northern Uganda on a daily basis than the monthly average of Kony's 25 years of killing. Where's the slick viral video for those children? The advent of social media brought so many unheard voices to the fore, and with that voice came self-actualization. Many communities realized that they have inherent agency to be their own saviors. Kony 2012 missed a grand opportunity to empower these voices to realize the power within themselves to change their situation and surroundings. Instead, it trotted out the same tired line about Africa. Torture, rape, conscription; tent poles for the single, sad story on Africa that Western society has come to accept. But by God we are so much more than the sum of our failures. Profile: Joseph Kony: Brutal warlord who shocked world . The charity missed an opportunity to empower the many Ugandan and Central African voices newly visible with the advent of mobile technology and social media tools on the continent. Instead of enjoining us to work together to amplify pressure on our governing bodies to address security and development holes, IC has taken the initiative to proposition an outside agency to do it for us. How are we ever going to awaken to our civil responsibility to demand more from our sitting governments if we are lulled into a dependency state for every civil service we should rightly expect from our governments? The attention is on the wrong audience, for the wrong message, using the wrong messenger. I would have welcomed an opportunity for IC to partner with those of us visible and empowered to drive the conversation to its rightful audience, therein instilling a permanent sense of strong civic responsibility that is the basis of all modern societies. If I can take anything good from this, it is that I hope this visibility provided by IC will usher those of us Ugandans engaged in this conversation to realize we have a right to exercise our agency when we are called to do so. And when we do galvanize around an agenda that we set, that we are wise enough to partner with individuals that can accelerate that message. The opinions expressed are solely those of TMS Ruge.","Invisible Children's ""Kony 2012"" cemented the legitimacy of social media for global engagement, says TMS Ruge .
But the World Bank social media strategist says the film created ""wrong conversation and wrong buzz"".

"(CNN) -- One of the two U.S. states that separates its HIV-infected inmates from its general prison population says it plans to stop doing so. The South Carolina Department of Corrections said Wednesday it intends to stop housing its HIV-positive inmates in facilities separate from the rest of its prisoners, as it has done since 1998. The state currently houses 366 HIV-positive inmates at two different institutions in Columbia. No date for the policy change is set, but officials hope it will happen in the next six months, department spokesman Clark Newsom said. ""Our medical staff has examined all the facets of this issue, and we believe it is safe to make a change in our current policy,"" department Director William Byars Jr. said. Alabama also separates its HIV-positive inmates from the rest of its prisoners, though a federal judge ordered it to end the practice in December following a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. Litigation in that case continues. Mississippi dropped a similar policy in 2010. The ACLU, which has campaigned to end such policies, hailed South Carolina's decision. ""Ending a long outdated policy that stigmatized human beings and ignored modern medical information is a tremendous victory for human rights,"" Susan K. Dunn, legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina, said in a news release. ""While the segregation of HIV-positive prisoners has long been an unnecessary and ineffective tool for preventing the transmission of HIV, it has had the profound effect of humiliating and isolating prisoners living with the disease.""

"(CNN) -- The feds call industrial hemp a controlled substance -- the same as pot, heroin, LSD -- but advocates say a sober analysis reveals a harmless, renewable cash crop with thousands of applications that are good for the environment. Industrial hemp, left, looks a lot like its cousin in the cannabis family, marijuana. Two North Dakota farmers are taking that argument to federal court, where a November 14 hearing is scheduled in a lawsuit to determine if the Drug Enforcement Administration is stifling the farmers' efforts to grow industrial hemp. The DEA says it's merely enforcing the law. Marijuana and industrial hemp are members of the Cannabis sativa L. species and have similar characteristics. One major difference: Hemp won't get you high. Hemp contains only traces of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the compound that gets pot smokers stoned. However, the Controlled Substances Act makes little distinction, banning the species almost outright. Marijuana, which has only recreational and limited medical uses, is the shiftless counterpart to the go-getter hemp, which has a centuries-old history of handiness. The February 1938 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine heralded hemp as the ""new billion-dollar crop,"" saying it had 25,000 uses. Today, it is a base element for textiles, paper, construction materials, car parts, food and body care products. It's not a panacea for health and environmental problems, advocates concede, but it's not the menace the Controlled Substances Act makes it out to be.  Watch why a North Dakota official thinks the U.S. should be in the hemp business » . ""This is actually an anti-drug. It's a healthy food,"" explained Adam Eidinger of the Washington advocacy group Vote Hemp. ""We're not using this as a statement to end the drug war."" Rather, Eidinger said, Vote Hemp wants to vindicate a plant that has been falsely accused because of its mischievous cousin. North Dakota farmers Wayne Hauge and Dave Monson say comparing industrial hemp to marijuana is like comparing pop guns and M-16s. They've successfully petitioned the state Legislature -- of which Monson is a member -- to authorize the farming of industrial hemp. They've applied for federal permits and submitted a collective $5,733 in nonrefundable fees, to no avail, so they're suing the DEA. North Dakota is one of seven states to OK hemp production or research. California would have made eight until Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last week vetoed the California Industrial Hemp Farming Act, citing the burden on law enforcement which would have to inspect hemp fields to make sure they were marijuana-free. Administration skeptical of initiatives . The DEA claims the farmers' lawsuit is misguided because the agency is obligated to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. ""Hemp comes from cannabis. It's kind of a Catch 22 there,"" said DEA spokesman Michael Sanders. ""Until Congress does something, we have to enforce the laws.""  The difference between marijuana, industrial hemp » . Asked if the DEA opposes the stalled House Resolution 1009, which would nix industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana, Sanders said the Justice Department and President Bush would make that call. ""When it comes to laws, we don't have a dog in that fight,"" he said. The Justice Department has no position yet on the resolution, said spokesman Erik Ablin. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, however, is skeptical because of the burden hemp would place on law enforcement resources. Also, hemp advocates are regularly backed -- sometimes surreptitiously -- by the pro-marijuana movement, the office alleges. ""ONDCP cautions that, historically, the hemp movement has been almost entirely funded by the well-organized and well-funded marijuana legalization lobby,"" said spokesman Tom Riley. ""All we do is ask people not to be naive about what's really going on here."" Often, the hemp movement -- like hemp legislation -- is inextricably tied to marijuana. Pot advocates like actor Woody Harrelson and activist Jack Herer have double or ulterior agendas when they expound the virtues of hemp. Not so with Monson, 57. The assistant GOP leader in the state House, who returned to the family farm where he was reared in 1975, said he became interested in hemp in 1993 when scab, or Fusarium head blight, devastated his wheat and barley crops. Monson grows canola, too, but wants another crop in his rotation. Soybeans are too finicky for the weather and rocky soil. Monson also tried pinto beans, fava beans and buckwheat with no luck. ""None of them seemed to really be a surefire thing,"" he said. ""We were looking for anything that was potentially able to make us some money."" Hemp, said the lifelong farmer, seemed an apt fit. It likes the climate, its deep roots irrigate soil, it doesn't need herbicides because it grows tall quickly and it breaks the disease cycles in other crops, Monson said. States follow Canada's lead . About 20 miles north of Monson's Osnabrock farm lies the Canadian border, the hemp dividing line. Just over the border in Manitoba, farmers have been reaping the benefits of hemp since 1998, when Health Canada reversed a longtime ban. In a Vote Hemp video, Shaun Crew, president of Hemp Oil Canada Inc., a processing company in Sainte-Agathe, praised Canada's foresight in differentiating between hemp and marijuana. While marijuana THC levels can range between 3 and 20 percent, Canada demands its hemp contain no more than 0.3 percent. In some hemp, the THC levels can sink as low as one part per million, Crew said. ""There's probably more arsenic in your red wine, there's more mercury in your water and there's definitely more opiates in the poppy seed bagel you ate this morning,"" Crew said on the video. The North Dakota Legislature is convinced, as are the general assemblies in Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Montana and West Virginia. With his state's blessing, North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson is backing the farmers and has proposed modeling North Dakota's hemp laws after Canada's strict regulations. ""We weren't just going to tell the DEA to take a hike,"" Johnson said. ""We're serious about this, and we want to do it in concert with the DEA."" In a March 27 letter to Johnson, Joseph Rannazzisi of the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, said the permits were denied because the state hadn't satisfied the agency's security and logistical requirements. Security aspects require careful evaluation because ""the substance at issue is marijuana -- the most widely abused controlled substance in the United States,"" Rannazzisi wrote. ""We've been terribly brainwashed"" Hemp wasn't always banned in the U.S. Jamestown Colony required farmers to grow it in 1619. Even after Congress cracked down on marijuana in 1937, farmers were encouraged to grow the crop for rope, sails and parachutes during World War II's ""Hemp for Victory"" campaign. Jake Graves, 81, heeded the call. Graves, whose father grew hemp in both world wars and whose grandfather grew it during the Civil War, was a teen when his father died in 1942. At the time, Graves' family was growing hemp for the Army. The Graveses continued growing hemp on their 500-acre Kentucky farm until 1945, when the market dried up after the advent of synthetic fabrics and the post-war reinvigoration of international trade. But Graves stands by the crop and its versatility and says that by lumping hemp in with marijuana, lawmakers ""threw the baby out with the wash."" ""We've been terribly brainwashed as a society,"" Graves said. ""Man didn't use it for all those hundreds and hundreds of years without knowing what they were doing."" In the U.S., tapping hemp's versatility relies on imports. The DEA clamped down on most hemp imports in 1999 and 2001, but relented after a Canadian company sued, saying the ban violated its rights under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Though advocates considered it a victory, Johnson said hemp won't be fully utilized until it can be grown and researched stateside. ""For us to grow it isn't enough. You have to build that infrastructure,"" Johnson said. ""None of those uses is really going to develop to any great degree until we're able to grow this commodity."" Johnson said the farmers' Vote Hemp-funded lawsuit has no hidden agenda. It's aimed solely at allowing farmers to grow hemp -- without going to jail because federal law says hemp and marijuana are the same. ""I've got a state Legislature saying they aren't and the entire world saying they aren't. This is about a crop that is a legitimate crop every place else in the world,"" Johnson said. ""It's not a crusade thing. It's a crop. Let farmers grow it. We don't want anyone to be growing drugs."" E-mail to a friend .","Fast-growing hemp used for food, paper, textiles and car parts .

"(CNN) -- News that a 16-year-old boy from California survived a five-hour flight in the wheel well of a Hawaii-bound Boeing 767 has shocked and impressed the world. Forgetting, for the moment, his ability to slip through numerous security checks, he had to avoid getting crushed by the wheel apparatus as it folded up and down, as well as survive oxygen deprivation and temperatures of below -45 degrees Celsius (-49 degrees Fahrenheit) at altitudes up to 38,000 feet. Little surprise then that survival rates for this kind of stowaway are pegged at around 24%, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Stowing away is also an illegal act, and of course should never be attempted by anyone. For those that do survive, there's a risk of brain damage and other health complications as a result of the extreme conditions endured. But survival has happened -- here are some of the more notable examples of the last century. Note: While the term ""stowaway"" is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""someone who hides on a ship, airplane, etc., in order to travel without paying or being seen,"" a couple of our inclusions did not directly hide, but surreptitiously boarded planes. 1. Hate shopping, prefer Rome . In 2012, 11-year-old Liam Corcoran, from Manchester, UK, went to extreme measures to escape a shopping trip with his mother. Having given her the slip in a shopping center, Corcoran headed for Manchester Airport where, without a passport, ticket or boarding pass, he evaded security checks, metal detectors and gate control to board a Jet2 flight bound for Rome. He was only noticed halfway through the flight and was returned home when the plane flew back to the UK. 2. Dublin to New York, courtesy the gab . In 1985, two young boys from Dublin nearly pulled off the runaway of the century. Keith Byrne (10) and Noel Murray (13) ran away from their homes in north Dublin and stowed away or hitchhiked on a boat, a bus, a train and a car to get to Heathrow Airport, nearly 600 kilometers (372 miles) away in London. And that was just the start. In Heathrow they evaded security and passport checks to board an Air India flight bound for New York. They were only caught when a wily police officer in JFK International Airport spotted them looking lost and disheveled on a sidewalk. They eventually confessed and were put on a return flight to Dublin, having spent a free night in a hotel, again courtesy Air India. 3. World's first aerial stowaway . In 1928, 19-year-old Clarence Terhune became a sensation in Germany, after stowing away on the return leg of the maiden flight of the Graf Zeppelin, flying from Lakehurst, New Jersey to Friedrichshafen, Germany. Terhune, a golf caddy from St. Louis, Missouri, who had already established a habit of stowing away on trains and ships and of crashing major sports events, made a bet with his brother-in-law that he could trump all previous stowaways with the Zeppelin. And he did. He snuck aboard while the dirigible was in its hangar and made his big reveal once over the Atlantic Ocean. Though made to work in the kitchen for the remainder of the journey and arrested on landing, he was hailed as a hero by the German people, sent telegrams, invited to dinners and was even offered a job, it was reported. 4. Miracle survivor . In 1996, 23-year-old Pardeep Saini survived a ten-hour-flight from New Delhi to London Heathrow in the wheel well of a British Airways Boeing 747. Saini's 19-year-old brother Vijay died on the same attempt, exposed to temperatures of -60 degrees Celsius (-76 degrees Fahrenheit). Saini's survival was likely the result of hypoxia combined with hypothermia, essentially putting him into a state of suspended animation, doctors said. Found wandering the tarmac at Heathrow, Saini said he and his brother had fled India after being accused of having links to Sikh militants. He described how they'd paid a man for information about how to escape the country by getting into the baggage hold of a plane through the wheel bay. But there is no access to the baggage hold from the wheel bay, and moments after entering the wheel well the plane took off and he passed out. His application for asylum was refused. 5. Cuba to Paris, via nosebleed . In 2000, 24-year-old Roberto Viza EgÃ¼es survived 14 hours as a stowaway inside a cargo container on an Air France flight from Havana, Cuba to Paris. He was exposed to freezing temperatures and low oxygen levels and a few hours in suffered an extreme nosebleed. When two Parisian grocers to whom the container had been sent discovered him, he was covered in blood. He'd fled Cuba after fearing his membership of a dissident group was likely to cause him and his family problems. His request for asylum was denied the same year and he was returned to Cuba.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Kate Sweeney first met Oana Hogrefe over coffee at an Atlanta strip mall. They talked about horrible things. About babies who die in utero and the mother who must go through labor anyway. Or those born with genetic disorders whose parents live through a cruel countdown to the day they will have to disconnect the tubes. They also spoke about how Hogrefe points her camera at these children and clicks. As a memorial photographer, she volunteers to take photos in hospitals under the most trying circumstances. Sometimes the images she creates are the only tangible thing parents have left of a child who died at birth or soon after. Hotel Death: Where dying guests are promised salvation . Sweeney learned Hogrefe took a photo one time of twin girls -- one born healthy, the other sick. The healthy twin was crying inconsolably so the nurses laid her next to her sister, who had little time to live. Hogrefe took out her camera. Later in life, she thought, the surviving sibling could look at this picture and see: "" 'Here we are, close together.' At least that makes it real."" Sweeney, a journalist, had begun researching a book on memorials when she first spoke with Hogrefe. The Atlanta writer had thought of memorial photography as a macabre practice left over from another era when people were obsessed with death. She didn't understand why anyone would want such photos. But after meeting Hogrefe, Sweeney saw things another way. These photos were often the only evidence of lives lost so young. They said these tender lives mattered. The memorial photos led Sweeney to ask a deeper question: What is our relationship to death now? Are we, as a society, alienated from something that is inevitable? The answers are complicated but death, it seems, is starting to come out of its cold, hard shell. Sweeney's book, ""American Afterlife: Encounters in the Customs of Mourning,"" looks at how certain people process death and why they choose certain rituals and memorials. There is a chapter about green burials or internments that are completely biodegradable. Others examine roadside memorials, a cemetery that was built to be a hang-out, obituary writing and underwater graves. Like the television show ""Six Feet Under"" that piqued her curiosity in the first place, Sweeney's book puts death front and center in a form that is digestible, poignant and, at times, entertaining. ""Death is not something we talk about,"" she tells me, as we, too, meet in an Atlanta coffee shop to talk about horrible things. Americans, she says, are so obsessed with youth and triumphing over every challenge they face that they become afraid of aging and death, often seen as life's ultimate defeat. Taboo talk . The Victorians did not speak openly about sex but they were far ahead of us when it came to the much more difficult matter of death. Perhaps it was because they were accustomed to seeing death all around them. Disease was rampant and life spans shorter -- the average American died at 47, Sweeney writes. Infant mortality was so high that parents did not name their babies until after a first birthday. Most people died at home; bodies were often laid out for viewing in front parlors. But modern medicine changed all that. Over the years, public displays of grief became unfashionable. ""Mourning,"" writes Sweeney,"" retreated from public rite to private practice. It went underground."" Over time, death surged ahead of sex in the forbidden quotient. Americans increasingly felt uneasy dealing with the inevitable end of life. Death equaled discomfort. ""We want never to age. We have become a death-denying culture,"" says Mark LaRocca-Pitts, a chaplain with Crossroad Hospice. LaRocca-Pitts started the first Death CafÃ© in the Southeast. The idea, he says, is to bring strangers together, offer tea and cake and discuss the end of life. About 40 people come and split up into smaller groups and carry on confidential conversations on everything from terminal illness to funerals they've attended and what they might want for their own. ""Now there's a movement to talk more about death, to become more friendly with it,"" he says. The Conversation Project, co-founded by columnist Ellen Goodman, aims to get people to share the way they want to live at the end of their lives. ""It's time to transform our culture so we shift from not talking about dying to talking about it,"" says the Conversation Project website. ""It's time to communicate about the kind of care we want and don't want for ourselves."" LaRocca-Pitts credits the growth of palliative care and the hospice movement with making people realize there can be death with dignity. He also chalks it up partly to aging take-control baby boomers who are facing their own mortality. ""If we are able to talk about death, we might be able to live fuller lives,"" he says. ""There's a lot less anxiety because you've befriended death."" Undoubtedly, the conversation has been helped by television -- with shows such as the HBO hit series ""Six Feet Under"" that inspired Sweeney -- and social media. Last summer, NPR host Scott Simon's tweets from his mother's deathbed went viral. And now, there's Sweeney's book, which is sure to get people talking about death. 'American Afterlife' Sweeney has never suffered catastrophic loss, a fact that might strike her readers as rather strange. More often than not, stories about death arise from the pen of someone who has been touched by loss. ""I am still freaked out by the prospect of losing people I love,"" she says. The book prompted her to think about how she would memorialize her loved ones -- her mother, for instance, loves gardening and wants her ashes to be turned into mulch. Sweeney discussed with her husband her own wishes, though she wouldn't share what they are. ""Most of the time we don't think about these things until we have to,"" she says. ""I think you should do what feels right."" She brings up a family she encountered who has a weenie roast each year at a green burial cemetery. Yes, a weenie roast. Traditional funerals are profitable in America. The average cost of a burial in 2012 was $7,045, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. But increasingly, Americans are leaning toward cremation. In 2012, 43.2% of America's dead were cremated. By 2017, that number is expected to rise to almost 50%. The ways Americans are memorializing loved ones has diversified greatly in the past few years. Many, such as Oana Hogrefe's memorial photography of infants, are helping bringing death and dying back into the public realm. Reefs, ink and roads . Sweeney went out with Eternal Reefs, a company that mixes ashes with a compound to transforms them into an artificial coral reef. She watched as seven families put the ashes of their loved ones in natural cast concrete and lowered them to into the Atlantic off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. ""Military veterans, environmentalists, fishermen, sailors, divers and people who have been active all their lives or whose lives has been cut short, are comforted by the thought of being surrounded by all that life and action going on around them,"" the Eternal Reefs website says. Their families loved the idea of a living legacy on the ocean floor. ""In a way, these survivors are interacting directly with the bodies of the people they loved in life, although most probably prefer not to think of it that way,"" Sweeney writes. On the day she went out with Eternal Reefs, the ashes being memorialized at sea included those of a cat named Mistofeles -- his family had traveled all the way from California. The reefs are part of a trend to scatter ashes in places of natural beauty. The National Park Service, writes Sweeney, even has an application. The one at the Grand Canyon forbids teeth, bone fragments or parts that are recognizable as human remains. Others choose to remember the dead in a much more personal way. There's nothing more permanent than to etch a memorial into your own skin, tattoo artist Sarah Peacock tells Sweeney. She inked a man whose wife died of a fluke illness at 38. When the portrait was finished, the man cried. He told her the tattoo was his last stage of letting go. Mary Wilsey chose to remember her daughter Brittany, who died in a car accident near Wilmington, North Carolina, with a roadside memorial of a cross and a wreath of fake flowers. ""People drive down the roads,"" Wilsey tells Sweeney, ""and death never even crosses anybody's mind if they don't see one. But when you see one, it brings death to your attention."" But a lot of people think Wilsey's grief shouldn't be their commute. Or they say such memorials are dangerous because they are distracting. Sweeney explores the controversy. ""It comes down to where does grief belong?"" Sweeney tells me. ""I don't think we are super comfortable with another person's grief."" What happens after someone dies is personal, she says. But it's also a reflection on how we, as a society, handle it. Ultimately, it's about how we bring death to life.

"Editor's Note: James Carville, a Democratic strategist who serves as a political contributor for CNN, was the Clinton-Gore campaign manager in 1992 and political adviser to President Clinton. He is active in Democratic politics and a party fundraiser. James Carville says Rush Limbaugh's new bipartisan strategy could have served the country well in 2000. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On Thursday, Rush Limbaugh, the moral and intellectual leader and most influential person in the Republican Party in the United States, wrote in the august op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal, the acknowledged epicenter of right-wing thought, that President Obama should adopt a bipartisan solution to address the president's economic stimulus plan -- or as Limbaugh refers to it, ""porkulus."" Limbaugh proposes that because the Democrats got roughly 54 percent of the votes to the Republicans' 46 percent, the stimulus package should be allocated along his definition of ideological lines, i.e. 54 percent towards infrastructure improvement and 46 percent toward tax breaks for Limbaugh and his friends. He writes, ""Fifty-three percent of American voters voted for Barack Obama; 46% voted for John McCain, and 1% voted for wackos. Give that 1% to President Obama. Let's say the vote was 54% to 46%. ""As a way to bring the country together and at the same time determine the most effective way to deal with recessions, under the Obama-Limbaugh Stimulus Plan of 2009: 54% of the $900 billion -- $486 billion -- will be spent on infrastructure and pork as defined by Mr. Obama and the Democrats; 46% -- $414 billion -- will be directed toward tax cuts, as determined by me."" And he is serious. However much one may disagree with the current ""daddy"" of all Republicans (Beg to differ? See Rep. Phil Gingrey, who apologized last week for doubting Rush), you have to admire El Rushbo's principled stance and his well-known consistent ideology. Why surely it seems like just yesterday that Al Gore won the national popular vote in 2000 (and arguably won the popular vote in Florida too). Limbaugh must have called for the incoming Bush administration to allocate ideas based on the proportion of election returns. I'm sure President Bush and the Republicans in Congress graciously accepted their 49.5 percent share of everything. (Note: We would be much better off right now had this actually happened.) With 50 percent of the federal government during President Bush's term, Democrats might have reduced the deficit (a truly Clintonista idea). Wall Street might have been more heavily regulated and K Street's lobbyists might not have been running the Capitol. Democrats might have invested money into infrastructure improvements so that bridges didn't collapse or entire cities flood. We wouldn't have spent $350 million per day in Iraq. Heck, had Democrats been able to control 50 percent of the government from 2000 to 2004, we wouldn't have even gone into Iraq in the first place. There might have been more spending on education and a fully funded No Child Left Behind Act. It is a remarkable time in American politics when a respected ideologue like Limbaugh can take to a hyperpartisan place like the pages of The Wall Street Journal, and deliver such a consistent message. We Democrats should congratulate Rush on the purity, intellectual integrity, and consistency of his positions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville: Rush Limbaugh is now an advocate of bipartisan government .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova continued her run of tough three-set victories Thursday while Simona Halep maintained her flawless record of not dropping a set as the contrasting pair made it through to the title match at the French Open. The statuesque 1.88 meter Sharapova took two hours and 40 minutes to see off the semifinal challenge of Eugenie Bouchard, who came close to upsetting a player she idolized as a youngster growing up in Canada. Fourth seed Halep, a bundle of pugnacious energy at just 1.68 meters, was merely detained for 90 minutes in dispatching Germany's Andrea Petkovic 6-2 7-6 on the same Philippe Chatrier Court. The 22-year-old Halep is the first Romanian to reach a grand slam final in 34 years. Russia's Sharapova will be playing in her eighth, including her third in a row at the French Open, having won the title in 2012 and lost to Serena Williams last year. Sharapova has beaten Halep on the three occasions they have played, including the final on clay in Madrid earlier this year, but she will need to avoid the slow starts that have made her passage to the final so testing. Bouchard, just a few centimeters shorter than Sharapova and with the same powerful ground strokes, looked set to cause an upset when she achieved two breaks of service to take the opener 6-4. Seventh seed Sharapova steadied her nerves by taking an early break in the second set, but when Bouchard hit back to level at 5-5 it might have raised doubts for a lesser player than the four-time grand slam winner. She responded in the style of a champion by breaking Bouchard again to win the second set 7-5 before racing into a lead she never surrendered in the decider. Bouchard, who was playing in her second straight grand slam semifinal -- losing to eventual winner Li Na in Australia -- bravely saved four match points at 2-5 down but succumbed on the fifth. Sharapova had repeated her feat of her previous two matches against Samantha Stosur and then Garbine Muguruza, who shocked title holder Williams in the second round, by coming back from a set down to prevail. After her victory, the 27-year-old Sharapova paid tribute to her 18th-seeded opponent. ""She played an unbelievable match. Her level was extremely high today and I am just fortunate to be the winner,"" Sharapova said in her court side interview. ""I would prefer to win in two sets, but she started so well. It was tough losing the first set, but that's not when the match is over."" Halep, whose manager Virginia Ruzici was champion at Roland Garros in 1978 and runner-up two years later to Chris Evert, was never seriously troubled against the German 28th seed Petkovic. She raced to a 4-1 lead in just 14 minutes with two breaks of service and quickly closed out the opener. Petkovic rallied to lead 3-1 in the set but gave up the advantage immediately and always trailed in the tiebreak, which she lost 7-4. ""It's very emotional to win and reach my first grand slam final,"" said Halep. ""Andrea's a great player but I think I was a little bit stronger. I tried my best and did everything I could to win the match."" Halep has risen swiftly through the ranks and won sixth titles in 2013 to be named the WTA's most improved player. A promising junior, her career stalled until she had breast reduction surgery four years ago, helping her to increase her athleticism around the court, much in evidence on her favorite surface of clay.","Maria Sharapova into French Open final in Paris .

"(CNN) -- The parents of missing English toddler Madeleine McCann on Friday unveiled a digitally enhanced picture showing what she might look like today if she is still alive. Madeleine McCann was 3 when she disappeared in 2007; this photo shows what she may look like at 6. Madeleine was 3 years old when she disappeared during a family vacation in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 4, 2007. Portuguese police closed the case last July without a resolution. The picture, which her parents revealed in an interview on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" airing Monday, is a school-style photo showing Madeleine at 6 years old, with a pink headband and shoulder-length hair. An expert at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created the image using photographs of Madeleine's parents, a spokesman for the center told Guardian.co.uk. Kate and Gerry McCann also discussed how they're coping with the disappearance of their daughter. ""Child abduction, I think, could destroy any family.

"(CNN) -- Over the summer, veteran porn producer Tristan Taormino was looking for performers for her new movie. A casting agent recommended a woman named Cameron Bay, and Taormino put her on her short list. Less than two weeks later, Taormino found out Bay had HIV. It shook her up -- imagine if Bay had been on her set, she thought to herself, possibly transmitting the disease to the other performers. That was the moment, Taormino says, that she decided to make a fundamental change in the way she does business and become one of the few straight porn producers to require condoms on her set. ""It just struck me we need to take a step back and look at how we can give people the safest work experience possible,"" she says. ""I can no longer roll the dice on my set."" Taormino knows she's going to get heat for her decision from within her own industry. Even with three recent cases of HIV among performers (Bay is one of them) many porn producers and performers are still fighting against mandatory condom use. According to the Free Speech Coalition, which represents the adult entertainment industry, when they tried using condoms nine years ago after another HIV outbreak, the $14 billion-a-year business saw revenue decline as much as 30%. The industry group says in the recent cases, the performers did not contract the virus at work and didn't transmit it to any other performers. After the HIV cases were revealed, the industry shut itself down temporarily and required all performers to be re-tested for sexually transmitted infections. The moratorium ended Friday and performers went back to work. Porn producers say performers are protected on the job because they have the option of using condoms if they want to. Plus, performers are tested for sexually transmitted infections every two weeks, and producers have access to the testing service's database that says whether performers are clear to work. In November, Los Angeles County passed an ordinance requiring condom use on porn sets, but industry insiders say the rule is not well enforced and often ignored. Council votes for condom mandate in adult films . ""We support choice for performers, as well as the successful testing system that has been in place since 1998, which have resulted in no on-set transmission of HIV in nine years, nationwide,"" Diane Duke, the coalition's CEO says on the group's website. Many performers agree. ""We all take a risk going to work every day,"" performer Danny Wylde wrote in a blog post. ""It's a managed risk. And it's something I choose to participate in so that I can get a paycheck at the end of my day."" But Taormino worries that the risk is perhaps not so well managed. She points out that the HIV cases, plus some recent cases of syphilis and hepatitis, show testing isn't foolproof. First, performers can become infected during the two week window between tests. Second, because of the nature of the HIV test, a person can become infected with the virus and still test negative for 7-10 days, according to the Free Speech Coalition. Taormino says she'll require condoms even if she loses some viewers -- but she's not so sure she will. ""I know there's a lot of talk about how porn watchers don't want to see condoms and sales will plummet and everyone's going to be miserable,"" says Taormino. ""But I'm not buying it."" Taormino, co-editor of ""The Feminist Porn Book: The Politics of Producing Pleasure,"" does however, buy a different argument: some female performers say condoms are irritating and after a full day on the set they end up with abrasions inside their vaginas, and bacteria and viruses could find their way into the tiny cuts. Dr. J. Craig Strafford says he's heard about this from many of his female patients -- he calls it ""floor burn."" ""This complaint is legitimate. It's a real physiological problem,"" says Strafford, a past vice president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who runs reproductive health and sexually transmitted disease clinics in Ohio. ""It's like when you fall off a bike and get a scraped knee. It could get infected if you don't clean it up,"" he says. He says one solution might be to use a condom that's not made of latex, since some people find those irritating and abrasive, but non-latex condoms are often not available in the larger sizes male performers need. But Strafford is clear: Even with the ""floor burn"" concern, it's still safer to use a condom. ""Not using condoms is not an option,"" he says. Taormino agrees there's no easy solution for ""floor burn,"" but condoms are still a must. ""I know it feels like I'm going out on a limb, but I hope that others will join me,"" she says. They may already be joining her. While Wylde, who's acted in some of Taormino's productions, says he prefers to perform without a condom, he won't say no to a condom-only offer. ""If a porn producer is confident that he/she is able to maintain a viable business and provide the extra safety of barrier protection for performers, I'm 100% on board,"" he wrote in an email to CNN.

"(CNN) -- Demonstrators stormed a provincial administration building in eastern Ukraine on Sunday and raised the Russian flag atop it, demanding the release of riot police accused of killing protesters in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in February. Police were negotiating with the demonstrators, who have called for supporters to rally around the Regional Security Administration building in Donetsk, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the Russian border. Video of the negotiations was being streamed live online by local news outlets. The protest is the latest challenge to Ukraine's embattled new government, which took power after a revolt that toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February. There was no immediate response to the seizure from top officials in Kiev, where the jailed police are accused of killing protesters during the uprising against Yanukovych. The separatists inside the building used a loudspeaker to call for formation of a ""people's city council"" for Donetsk. A similar demonstration took place in Lugansk, according to Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. Protesters stormed a Security Service office there, demanding the release of a leader. ""The Russians are trying to destabilize the situation in the country,"" Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said in a post on his Facebook page Sunday. ""Putin and Yanukovich have ordered and paid for another round of separatist disturbances in the East of the country, Lugansk, Donetsk, Kharkov."" The pro-Russian ""paid provocateurs"" were trying to ""bring blood and victims,"" but Ukrainian police have been ordered to ""take the situation under control without spilling blood,"" Avakov said. ""The police will not shoot people due to a bunch of paid provocateurs,"" the interior minister said. ""There are people who were deceived and who were paid among the protestors."" The protests led Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchinov to cancel a trip to Lithuania Sunday, his spokesman said. Turchinov, who also serves as parliament speaker, was scheduled to travel there to meet with speakers from European Union states. Turchinov will instead meet with law enforcement chiefs and take ""personal control"" of the response to the protests, the spokesman said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced on live television Sunday evening that he would travel to his country's eastern regions ""to dismiss their fears."" Yatsenyuk said he would offer to decentralize power and state financial support for local businesses. In mid-March, Ukraine's new government warned that pro-Russian forces in other regions might attempt to follow the model used to wrest the Crimea region from Ukraine. Yatsenyuk said demonstrations by what he called ""political tourists"" with foreign passports were already under way; Andrii Parubii, the secretary of the Ukrainian parliament's National Security and Defense Council, said protesters included ""elite special units that are trying to arrive to Ukraine with weapons."" The Donetsk protest comes more than a month after pro-Russian forces seized government headquarters in Ukraine's semi-autonomous, Russian-majority Crimea region. A new administration was quickly put in place, backed by Russian troops and local militias. A hastily called referendum on independence, condemned as unconstitutional by Ukraine's government and the West, led to the territory's swift annexation by Moscow, a process completed by March 20. CNN's Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","NEW: Pro-Russian protests also take place in Lugansk .

"(CNN) -- An airplane baggage screener faces dismissal for leaving a note in a passenger's bag that said ""Get Your Freak On, Girl"" after discovering a vibrator.

""Like all federal employees, this individual is entitled to due process and protected by the Privacy Act. During the removal action process, the employee will not perform any screening duties."" The agency randomly selects checked baggage for screening on flights originating in the United States. Lawyer and writer Jill Filipovic tweeted a picture of the note Monday and later blogged about it on Feministe. ""This is what TSA will do when they inspect a bag you checked and find a, um, 'personal item,' "" she wrote. ""Total violation of privacy, wildly inappropriate and clearly not OK, but I also just died laughing in my hotel room."" The TSA identified and removed the employee from screening operations, the TSA said Wednesday on its blog. After completing an investigation, action was initiated to remove the individual from federal service. ""TSA views the handwritten note to be highly inappropriate and unprofessional and apologizes for this unfortunate incident,"" the spokesperson said. ""TSA has zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior by our employees as occurred in this instance. When this is brought to our attention TSA takes swift and appropriate action."" An agency official reached out to Filipovic to apologize personally, the agency said. At this point, though, she said she wishes the story would go away. ""It's easy to scapegoat one individual here, but the problem with the note is that it's representative of the bigger privacy intrusions that the U.S. government, through the TSA and other sources, levels every day,"" she wrote Wednesday after learning of the employee's suspension. ""As much as this is a funny and titillating story, when I put the note on Twitter for what I thought was a relatively limited audience, I was hoping it would open up a bigger conversation about privacy rights (or lack thereof) in post-9/11 America. It unfortunately hasn't done that, and instead has turned into a media circus,"" she said. ""The note was inappropriate, the agent in question acted unprofessionally when s/he put in my bag, there should be consequences and I'm glad the TSA takes these things seriously. But I get no satisfaction in hearing that someone may be in danger of losing their job over this.

"(CNN)  -- The New Orleans Saints won the Super Bowl for the first time in their 43-year history with a 31-17 victory over the Indianapolis Colts at the Sun Life Arena in Miami on Sunday night. The NFC champions recovered from a slow start to deny Indianapolis a repeat of their Super Bowl success against Chicago Bears in the same stadium three years ago. Inspired by MVP Drew Brees, who won his head-to-head with fellow star quarterback Peyton Manning, the Saints took command after trailing 17-16 going into the final quarter. Jeremy Shockey bulldozed over for a touchdown to give them a lead they never relinquished, increased by a two-point conversion after another crucial call by coach Sean Payton. Trailing 24-17, the Colts needed a touchdown to force overtime, but Manning saw his pass intercepted by Tracy Porter, who returned for a 74-yard touchdown which all but sealed their fate. It proved a sweet triumph for perennial underdogs New Orleans, coming five years after the city was decimated by Hurricane Katrina. Thousands of fans in New Orleans took to the street as it became clear that their side was finally going to triumph. What does the Saints' win mean to you? Share your story . In a game initially dominated by defenses, the Colts followed an early field goal from Matt Strover by ending the first quarter with a Super Bowl record-equaling 96-yard drive with quarterback Manning at the heart. He eventually threw for Pierre Garcon to go over in the right of the end zone and give his side a 10-0 lead. Saints gained more momentum in the second quarter, but even with Brees finding his range could not secure a touchdown. But they did score through two field goals by kicker Garrett Hartley, the hero of the NFC Championship victory over Minnesota. Trailing 10-6 at the half, Saints coach Payton called for an audacious onside kick, the first in Super Bowl history outside of the fourth quarter. Under massive pressure Saints claimed the first down from a advantageous field position and soon afterwards Pierre Thomas was celebrating his side's first touchdown as they claimed a 13-10 lead. Manning had not completed a pass for 70 minutes but on the next set of drives by the Colts found Joseph Addai who put them 17-13 ahead with their second touchdown of the night. Hartley kicked another long range field goal to keep his side within a point at the third quarter. Brees was starting to dominate for the Saints and in the final quarter tied the previous record for completions in a Super Bowl held by Tom Brady with his 32nd. Two unanswered touchdowns left favorites and AFC champions Indianapolis well beaten and it was New Orleans who lifted the Vince Lombardi trophy in their first appearance in a Super Bowl. An emotional Brees captured the mood of the moment in his post-match comments. ""We just believed in ourselves. We knew we had the entire city and maybe the entire country behind us. Mardi Gras may never end. The celebrations may never end,"" he said.","New Orleans Saints win Super Bowl XLIV with 31-17 win over Indianapolis Colts .

"(CNN) -- Kei Nishikori won a bruising three-hour contest against David Ferrer at the Miami Masters on Tuesday. He had plenty left in the tank when he faced a surging Roger Federer. He didn't have to save any match points against the Swiss great -- the Japanese No. 1 fended off four of them to oust Ferrer, last year's finalist in Miami -- but Nishikori rallied to beat Federer 36 75 64 under the lights on Stadium court Wednesday. The 21st-ranked Nishikori has now eliminated Federer twice in a row after upsetting the 32-year-old at the Madrid Masters in three sets last year. ""Feeling good, of course, to beat Roger,"" Nishikori told the ATP's website. ""I thought I really played well, especially in the third. I was hitting both deep and striking well. ""Everything was going well. There (were a) couple of tough moments, but I was fighting through."" Federer entered the match as the substantial favorite despite the defeat in the Spanish capital, having returned to full fitness and finding his old form after a back injury hindered him for much of 2013. He reached the final at the Indian Wells Masters earlier this month and there was a real possibility of the 17-time grand slam champion making the Indian Wells and Miami finals in the same year for the first time since claiming both titles in 2006. ""I could never really get my service games going,"" Federer told the ATP's website. ""On the return, as the match went on, I think it was that Kei started to serve a bit better, which made it more difficult."" Nishikori became the first man to break Federer in this year's tournament, perhaps not a surprise since he is second only to Ferrer in percentage of return games won in 2014. Still, Federer led by a break twice in the second set, only to see Nishikori -- whose career has been interrupted by arm and abdominal injuries -- break immediately back. The lone break of the third set came in the final game. ""I think Kei does really well controlling the ball,"" said Federer.

"(CNN) -- It is another chance for Benfica to stare down the curse of Bela Guttmann. Seven times they have been European finalists since their former manager laid down his hex in 1962, and seven times they have lost. Refused a pay rise after leading Benfica to a second successive European Cup triumph, the Jewish Hungarian declared the club would not succeed on the continent for 100 years. It has held firm ever since, but perhaps on May 14, the spell will finally be laid to rest. Benfica's modern stars battled and scrapped their way to a 0-0 draw at Juventus to book a Europa League final at the same venue next month with Spanish side Sevilla, who held off a valiant fightback from Valencia. Perhaps it is Juventus who will now feel cursed. The Old Lady were supposed to book a European coronation at their own footballing fortress, and while they remain unbeaten there all season that will come as little consolation. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Lisbon, the best chance of a tight first half fell to Arturo Vidal, whose back post header was looping into the net before an intervention from Benfica center-back Luisao. Juventus piled on the pressure in the second half, veteran midfielder Andrea Pirlo forcing Benfica goalkeeper Jan Oblak into a fine save. The Old Lady's task got a tad easier with a little over 20 minutes to go when Enzo Perez picked up a second yellow card in the space of six minutes and was dismissed. Two more red cards were shown, to unused Juventus substitute Mirko Vucinic and Benfica's Lazar Markovic, who had not long been replaced, as tempers flared on the bench. Juve continued to pile forward but Benfica held on, Oblak denying former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez, while Daniel Osvaldo had a goal rightly ruled out for offside. After seven long minutes of injury time the final whistle sounded and Benfica booked their final berth for a second successive season. The Guttmann curse reared its head again in 2013 when they lost the final to a header from Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic with practically the last touch of the match. That heartbreak was added to a long list of losing finals in 1963, 1965, 1968, 1983, 1988 and 1990. But on May 14, it can be laid to rest once and for all. Sevilla will have plenty to say about that though, after they booked their place in a nerve shredding encounter with La Liga cousins Valencia. Valencia wiped out their 2-0 deficit from the first leg inside 25 minutes at the famous Mestalla stadium. Sofiane Feghouli's slaloming run ended with a powerful shot that deflected past Sevilla goalkeeper Beto and into the net with just 14 minutes on the clock. Less than 10 minutes later, Jonas' bullet header from a left wing cross hit the bar but bounced in off the unfortunate Beto. Stung into action, Sevilla hit back, former Arsenal striker Jose Reyes forcing Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves into a point blank save when it looked easier to score. Valencia maintained the same high-pitched pace of attack in the second half and got their reward with 20 minutes to go as defender Jérémy Mathieu stabbed a corner into the roof of the net. But with seconds remaining, Stephane Mbia -- on loan from English second tier club Queens Park Rangers -- nodded home to spark wild scenes of celebration. Sevilla won successive titles in the UEFA Cup, the forerunner of the Europa League, in 2006 and 2007 and only got their place in this year's competition after Malaga and Rayo Vallecano were forbidden from taking part. It is now their task to ensure the curse of Bela Guttman lives on.","Benfica draw 0-0 at Juventus to seal a place in the Europa League final .

"(CNN) -- A south Georgia banker accused of embezzling millions by defrauding scores of investors was captured Tuesday after one and a half years on the run, authorities said. The FBI indicated online that 47-year-old Aubrey ""Lee"" Price -- whom it characterized as an investment adviser and former minister -- had been captured. That agency website didn't provide further details, including how Price was detained or what he has been doing since June 2012. Yet a Glynn County, Georgia, sheriff's office website showed that he was booked Tuesday and is being ""held for federal authorities on a charge of giving a false name, address or birth date to a law enforcement officer."" Officer Kay Jones said that Price was being held for federal marshals. His capture ends a law enforcement saga that started in the town of Ailey, a community of about 430 people, and stretched to include parts of Florida, Latin America and the vast waters that separate them. In late 2010, Price was being celebrated by his peers and written up in newspaper articles after a company that he controlled bought a controlling portion of the troubled Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey, which is located some 170 miles southeast of Atlanta. He was supposed to invest the bank's capital. Instead, prosecutors say, Price used a New York-based ""clearing firm"" -- a dummy company set up to hide money -- to cover up fraudulent wire transfers and investments. A complaint filed in federal court on July 2, 2012, claimed that Price and others ""raised approximately $40 million from approximately 115 investors,"" mostly in Georgia and Florida, beginning in 2009, then committed fraud at the expense of those investors. ""The complaint alleges that, instead of investing the money as promised, Price fraudulently wired the bank's funds to accounts that he personally controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank management with altered documents to make it appear as if he had invested the bank's money in (U.S.) Treasury securities,"" the U.S. attorney's office for eastern New York said then. In sum, the complaint alleges that Price hid the embezzlement by falsely stating that about $17 million had been deposited in the bank's name at a New York financial services firm. By the time these charges came out, Price had been missing for several weeks, having told friends he had lost ""a large sum of money through his trading activities,"" according to the complaint. In the letter he'd purportedly written to acquaintances and business associates that June, Price indicated that he planned to kill himself by ""jumping off a ferry boat"" off Florida's coast, the complaint stated. He was spotted -- alive -- in Key West, Florida, in the middle of that month, and the U.S. Coast Guard's subsequent search for his body found nothing. By then, authorities hinted they believed Price was on the lam. He owns properties in Venezuela and Guatemala, and the FBI's wanted poster for him indicated that he also has a 17-foot boat. The federal agency offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest; it wasn't immediately clear if anyone will recoup that reward, nor was it known how Price was taken into custody. A federal grand jury in New York indicted him on wire fraud and securities fraud charges earlier this year. A conviction on the wire fraud charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 years, with a 25-year maximum for the other charge. The bank Price took over -- which had been in operation for nearly 90 years -- was closed in summer 2012 by the state of Georgia, with the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation named as its receiver. Price's family members have been quiet publicly since news of the charges came out. And it was not immediately clear if he has legal representation following his detention. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Aubrey 'Lee' Price is captured in southern Georgia, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have launched an investigation into how dispatchers handled 911 calls from those seeking help before, they say, Josh Powell killed his sons and himself in his Washington home. Critics have said it took too long for dispatchers to grasp the danger of the situation and alert police. ""We will investigate all aspects of this incident, and if there is a need to refine our processes, (as we do continually) we will do so,"" said Tom Orr, director of the Law Enforcement Support Agency, which operates the 911 call center. ""If there is a need to investigate from a disciplinary perspective and assign individual responsibility, we will do that as well."" Call center records show that it took eight minutes for the dispatcher to send a police car, and it took an additional 13 minutes for a police car to get to Powell's home, CNN affiliate KCPQ reported. Orr's comments come as the community come to grips with Sunday's murder-suicide at Powell's Graham, Washington home. Powell is accused of snatching his young sons from a social worker who was delivering them for a supervised visit, locking the door, hacking the kids with a hatchet and starting an explosive fire in the home. Tapes of 911 conversations, released this week, detail the frantic social worker trying to get help. After tragedy, Erin Burnett reflects on the difficult job of the social worker . But even after she told a dispatcher that she smelled gasoline and Powell would not let her in the home, a dispatcher continued to ask questions about her job and says ""life-threatening situations come first."" ""This could be life-threatening,"" the social worker pleads. ""He was in court on Wednesday and he didn't get his kids back and this is really ... I`m afraid for their lives."" The social worker's husband said she was badly shaken up. ""She's very upset and traumatized. She has said that she thinks this is something that is going to be a life-changing event,"" the husband told KCPQ. There has been some criticism of the 911 operator's responses to the social worker. Ed Troyer, spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, said he wished the operator's ""etiquette"" would have been different, but information gathering on such calls can take time. ""We try to get it right every single time. With humans here sometimes, there are mistakes made. I can`t tell you whether that was the case here until the investigation is complete,"" Orr told the affiliate. Services for Charlie, 7, and Braden Powell, 5, will be held Saturday. Family members said they were having a hard time dealing with their grief. ""How could you do that to your children?"" their grandfather, Chuck Cox, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday night. Cox said the social worker should not have been taking the boys to Powell's residence alone. ""I'm glad she is safe,"" he said. ""She could very well have been in that house. He could have closed the door behind her."" Powell was embroiled in an ugly custody dispute with the Cox family that stems back to the 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell. According to investigators, Powell had said the last time he saw his wife was the night he and his sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left to go camping after midnight in freezing weather. Police have said they will continue to investigate her disappearance despite the deaths. Chuck Cox said he tried to prevent the visitation. ""We had warned the police ... everybody, that he (Josh Powell) was capable of hurting those children and we were very concerned,"" he said. But, apparently, the law allowed for it, according to Cox. ""I don't think we could have done anything more,"" he said. The grandfather restated his belief that his son-in-law, whom he described as very controlling and unlikeable, is responsible for Susan Cox-Powell's disappearance. According to Chuck Cox, Josh Powell bristled when he heard or saw evidence that the boys were close to their grandparents. The Coxes said the boys at first would not talk about their missing mother, but they then opened up a little bit. One said he last saw her on a camping trip, Chuck Cox told HLN. But then they would forget details or not want to talk about her. ""They went back to a trained and coached response,"" the grandfather said. ""Josh didn't want them saying anything about it."" CNN's Thelma Gutierrez, Ashley Hayes, Tina Burnside, Sara Weisfeldt and HLN's Alexis Weed and Phil Rosenbaum contributed to this report.","Critics have said it took too long for dispatchers to alert police .

"New York (CNN) -- Talk about the catch of your life. Fishermen hooked a senior citizen who was drowning near a New York pier Saturday, keeping the man above water and close to the pier long enough for rescuers to reach him, according to a fire department spokesperson. ""They played a major role in helping with this person's survival,"" FDNY spokesman Khalid Baylor told CNN. ""It was a joint functional operation between uniform and civilians."" Shortly after noon, FDNY and NYPD officials jointly responded to reports of a man in Jamaica Bay at Brooklyn's Canarsie Pier, according to Baylor. They observed a male in his 60s unconscious and floating in the water, Baylor said. Witnesses later told police they saw the victim sitting on the pier railing, then falling into the water, according to NYPD's Detective Michael DeBonis. Civilians, who happened to be fishing at the pier and saw the man, were able to use a fishing gaff to hook his clothing, keeping the man from drifting away or sinking completely until officials were able to rescue him, Baylor said. A fishing gaff is a long pole with a hook used to haul in fish. When officials reached the man in the water, he was unresponsive, not breathing and ""turning blue,"" said DeBonis. According to Baylor, FDNY personnel placed a sling over the victim in the water and swam him to an NYPD boat, where both firefighters and police performed rescue breathing, bringing back a pulse. Prior to being transported from the boat to land, the man began to breathe on his own, DeBonis said. The victim was transported to Brookdale Hospital; he is expected to survive, authorities said Saturday. The identities of the fishermen who helped save the man's life are unknown. Officials have not released the name of the victim.","Fishermen notice older man who fell from Brooklyn pier .

"Farnborough, England (CNN) -- It was only a matter of time before someone shrunk the dazzling computer wizardry used to pilot a fighter jet into a device the size of an iPhone. We're not there just yet, but aviation engineers have unveiled a semi-working prototype they say will soon allow pilots to carry cockpit technology in their flight suit. The Aviation Warrior, created by U.S. defense contractor Raytheon, was among a raft of new aircraft gadgets on display at the UK's Farnborough Airshow that appear to be adapting technology popularized by phones and tablet computer devices to fly modern jets. CNN was given a first glimpse of Raytheon's revolutionary system on the sidelines of the event. If it proves successful, it could mean the difference between life and death for a pilot downed behind enemy lines. Read more: Flypasts and spaceships: Farnborough 2012 takes off . The Aviation Warrior uses a rugged processor the size of a chunky smart phone which is said to be as powerful as a laptop. This powers a heads-up display on the pilot's helmet and a small screen on their wrist. Using these, a pilot can view full-color terrain maps and virtual images of the landscape around them on displays that adjust as they move their heads. Their helmets also relay surround-sound audio alerts, giving directional warnings of incoming missiles. Already an advance on current in-cockpit systems, the Warrior technology will enable pilots to navigate through ""brown out"" conditions when dust or bad weather obscure land and hazardous buildings. It will also pinpoint enemy and friendly positions. But whereas existing equipment must be left behind if the aircraft goes down and the pilot becomes separated -- now they can take the technology on the hoof. ""All the information they would typically have in a cockpit, with this new system they have it on their person, so when they leave the aircraft, they still have it with them,"" John D. Harris, president of Raytheon Technical Services, told CNN. Infographic: Up in the air: Aviation industry in numbers . Theoretically, the Warrior system could have been utilized in situations such as the notorious MrkonjiÄ‡ Grad incident during the 1990s Balkans conflict. U.S. Air Force pilot Scott O'Grady spent six days on the run from Serb patrols, eating grass and grubs to survive, after ejecting over Serb territory in June 1995. His ordeal was loosely adapted into the Hollywood movie ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" starring Owen Wilson. ""Instead of the hide and seek of previous conflicts, particularly the Vietnam war, where a pilot would hunker down and wait for rescue, they now know how to get (to) safety,"" said Harris. The Warrior system's wrist display uses the same ""pinch-to-zoom"" touch screens found on iPhones -- something its manufacturers believe will make it popular with pilots. Touch screens are becoming increasingly popular in cockpits, replacing the enormous banks of complicated dials and switches used to control some modern aircraft. French aerospace company Thales used Farnborough to unveil a programmable touch screen that allows pilots to customize and upgrade controls.So far, investment in the experimental Warrior system is relatively small. The U.S. military has awarded Raytheon a $4.7 million research and development contract. But if rolled out across helicopter and fixed-wing fleets, it could prove big business. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit . Harris refuses to discuss Warrior's battery life -- an issue that blights user of many modern smart phones fitted with satellite tracking and other power-draining apps -- saying only that it meets military operational requirements. He also declines to reveal its price, but Raytheon Tech's chief engineer Todd Lovell insists its use of commercially-available components makes it relatively low cost. ""We're using off-the-shelf items that are cheap and simple to upgrade,"" he said. Added Harris: ""It's about leveraging what's commercially available. We're introducing this in an austere environment and we're acutely aware of that.""","Future military tech may include the ability to pilot a fighter jet using an iphone-sized device .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- In 2009, bottled water company Evian decided to focus its advertising strategy on an association with youth. It took almost a year for Mercedes Erra to convince the company that a commercial featuring babies roller skating to hip hop classic ""Rapper's Delight"" was the best way to get that message across. But happily for advertising guru Erra, ""Roller Babies"" became the world's most-viewed brand video. It was viewed online more than 75 million times and shared almost 2.2 million times -- a Guinness world record. Erra founded ad agency BETC Euro RSCG in 1995 with three others. Today, she is also managing director of communications group Havas and executive president of its marketing arm Euro RSCG Worldwide. BETC is now one of the largest and most awarded agencies in France, with a client roster that includes more than 80 of the world's top 100 largest advertisers, including Coca Cola, IBM, Volvo, Disney, LVMH and McDonalds. See more: Building an empire from chocolate . Erra is a progressive and, at times, challenging force in French life: A mother to five sons campaigning for greater participation by women, she is on the board of the Elle Foundation, the Committee on the Image of Women in the Media, and Force Femmes, and is president of the Women's Forum for the Economy and Society. A Spanish-born Officier of the Legion d'Honneur (motto: ""Honour and Fatherland""), Erra is pushing for diversity in a society not always famed for its racial tolerance. She is on the board of the French Immigration Museum, and is a member of Human Rights Watch and UNICEF. Erra began her career in advertising in 1981, as an intern at Saatchi & Saatchi. She believes she distinguished herself there by seeking out more and more responsibility, ultimately becoming managing director. ""I think when people want responsibility, they can have it immediately because (most) people don't want responsibility,"" she said. Although she disavows any particular skill other than taking responsibility, colleagues say Erra has a rare combination of rigorous business analytics, and a strong intuition about how consumers will react. Here she talks to CNN's Leading Women about immigration, the glass ceiling and what's most important in life and in work. On being a migrant ... I was born in Barcelona. I arrived in France when I was six years old. I lost my country and quality of life. We had a little money in Spain, but nothing in France. Those two changes were difficult but at the same time very positive. When you are six, you learn a lot if you change your country. You learn relativity; you learn the world is complicated. You become more mature. I experienced that life is not easy -- I think today sometimes life is too easy -- and I never forget this. On ""women's work"" ... When I was young, my mother was at home and my father worked and it was not easy. By the end of the day, she would dream of working outside the home, and my father would arrive and say, 'I am so tired.' I remember her saying, 'Nobody wants to do housework, nobody says thanks, nobody gives me money,' and she's right. In my mind, my mother was doing a job, and I said to myself, 'I don't want that job.' When I began working, it was a pleasure. And sometimes when I have meetings with very important men, and they say 'I am tired,' I say, 'We get money; it's very interesting. Stop. Please, stop.' On the glass ceiling ... More than a glass ceiling, the obstacle for women is their own minds. I get the feeling that if a woman is very clear, it's very difficult to prohibit something. It was impossible to stop me. Many things have to change. But first, it's very simple: Girls need to think about having a good job and doing the same kind of studies as boys. In France, we have the Baccalaureate (high school diploma). In mathematics, the best results? The girls. And when they choose (further) studies? No girls in mathematics. Why? Because they think they are not the best. I think we have to be clear, the objective is not to be the best, it's to do what they want -- but they can want everything. On work-life balance ... I don't want all women to do what I do. I have a lot of energy -- not a normal amount, I know. I sleep very few hours and not all women can get by on three hours a night. I am not balanced -- I have more energy than balance. Some people have their work and their home life and don't want interaction between them. I don't have two lives. I have no problem having people come to my house to work, because I like these people. It's difficult for me to have different relations with people who I work closely with. These are very important people to me. On working with big-name clients ... With people who are important, I am more difficult to work with, because I am not impressed (by their reputation). I am impressed when people are very clever or very nice or have a very strong heart or a strong intuition. On doing what you love ... Do things well, and do what you like to do. It's bad to do something because you think other people will consider you clever. I have strong views on this because when I speak with my gardener, she is so clever, but it's a different kind of clever. It's not the same as my way of being clever, but it's still clever. Do what you think is right for you, and remember: Don't lose half your life to things that are not interesting to you. I am disturbed by what people will accept. Some people have less opportunity, but if you can choose what you do, you are a winner.","Mercedes Erra is managing director of Havas, the fifth largest communications group in the world .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- The smartphones and tablets debuting at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week share one very important ingredient that has allowed Apple's iPad and iPhone devices to become mainstream cash cows: videogames. ""Gaming is now a 'need to have' category, not a 'nice to have' category for mobile devices, whether they be tablets or phones,"" said PJ McNealy, videogame analyst at Digital World Research. ""The days of a single-function mobile device are long gone."" Raj Talluri, vice president of product management at Qualcomm, said that with more than 60% of users regularly playing games on their mobile devices, games have clearly emerged as a core part of the mobile user experience. ""Gamers and games have also proven to drive technology adoption and are powerful influencers amongst consumers,"" Talluri said. ""Whether it be for the purpose of competitive gaming or just passing the time on flights or train rides, high-quality mobile gaming is not a luxury. It's now a necessity for any mobile device."" Read more: What will your next mobile phone look like? At the conference, Qualcomm is promoting upcoming portable games like ""The Ball,"" ""Fight Game Heroes"" and ""The Reem,"" which run on its Snapdragon processors. Talluri said this ""complete system-on-a-chip"" technology was designed to handle everything from online multiplayer gaming like AllJoyn over Wi-Fi and 3G/4G-LTE networks to the most advanced, console-quality games. The powerful new processors are built for seamlessly switching between multiple apps and the Internet, all while delivering longer battery life. Keita Iida, director of global content management at NVIDIA, said that while there will always be room for simple, casual games in mobile like ""Angry Birds,"" things are evolving quickly thanks to new chip technology like NVIDIA's Tegra 3 quad core processors. ""With the installed base of Android and Tegra already at critical mass, developers looking to have their games stand out have the promise of financial reward to invest in high-end content, not to mention the hardware processing that can power next-generation games,"" Iida said. ""Our heritage is in working with developers that are passionate about games with high production value."" One of the Tegra 3 games on display at Mobile World Congress is Sega's ""Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2,"" which will be released in May. David Zemke, director of mobile business at Sega of America, said the new game brings a console-quality experience to portable devices. ""You can now play Sonic on a small screen or a big HD TV, screen and this technology allows us to bring a totally reimagined Sonic with beautiful HD backgrounds, great character animation and all the speed console gamers are used to with this character,"" he said. ""Tegra represents a quantum leap in technology, allowing us to bring visual effects like god rays, light effects and realistic water effects to a portable device for the first time."" Intel Graphics Planner Matt Ployhar, who also serves as the president of the PC Gaming Alliance, has seen more gamers gravitate toward mobile devices. Intel has invested in the booming mobile sector with technology like its 1.66Ghz Intel Atom processor and Intel XMM 6260 Wireless platform with fast HSPA+. ""The role of video games is incredibly important for mobile and tablet devices,"" Ployhar said. ""They're all experiencing and seeing an incredible amount of growth ... across the various form factors.  Mobile platform choices are as varied as the smartphone to the PlayStation Vita to slates and iPads. Games tend to be the number one downloaded and used software application for these devices, according to sources like Nielsen, Forrester and Screen Digest."" Read more: Are our mobiles monsters? Mobile graphics technology has come a long way in a short period of time, and it's continuing to evolve. Sony Computer Entertainment has sold 1.2 million PlayStation Vita portable gaming devices since launch last year, but those numbers could have been much higher without increased competition from smartphones and tablets. ""I think that the smartphone and tablet market is cannibalizing the dedicated handheld market, especially for non-core gamers,"" said Michael Pachter, videogame analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities. ""The casual games offered on smartphones and tablets are good enough for a large minority of people who play games, and the large number of free-to-play casual games on smartphones and tablets will keep most casual gamers occupied. I think that limits the attractiveness of dedicated handheld gaming devices and limits their market share."" Talluri believes that smartphones and tablets will emerge as all-in-one entertainment devices, encompassing the qualities of several gaming console experiences in a portable package. Prices are already dropping for quad core tablets. Asus is shipping its Tegra 3 Eee Pad Transformer Prime for $250, which will offer games on par with the visuals of consoles. But Pachter believes it will be a while before the depth of console games, or even PS Vita games, migrate to smartphones and tablets. Looking ahead, Plohar said, new mobile gaming technology that will further alter the way games are played on the go includes Siri-like voice interaction in gaming, more cross-platform cloud gaming experiences and smarter sharing and pairing between devices. McNealy believes the roles of key tech companies like Google, Intel, NVIDIA and Qualcomm are more important than they were 10 years ago, when there were only game consoles and PCs for gaming. ""The number of viable platforms for consuming media such as games has exploded, and the tech infrastructure companies now need to be more agile, more responsive, and more diversified than any other point in their histories,"" McNealy said. ""It's a fun time to be a tech company, albeit a bit frenzied and insane by all the new product cycles."" It's also a fun time to be a gamer, as there are more games available for more devices than ever before. And the quality of these experiences, especially in the portable space, appears to be getting better all the time.","Mobile gaming is a big focus of mobile-tech trade show in Barcelona .

"Sao Paulo (CNN) -- Protesters burned barricades and police blocked streets as clashes flared in Rio de Janeiro's beachside neighborhood of Copacabana on Tuesday night. One person was killed. Residents from the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela took to the streets of Copacabana after a young male dancer was found dead, state-run Agencia Brasil said. The residents told Brazilian media they blame the police for the death, accusing authorities of mistaking the dancer for a criminal. The injuries the dancer sustained appear to be consistent with a fall, Rio de Janeiro's State Security Secretariat said in a Twitter post, adding that his death is still being investigated. The clashes are sure to alarm authorities who are stepping up security ahead of the World Cup, which begins on June 12. Police, backed by the Army, have stormed dozens of favelas, squeezing out drug gangs, since Rio de Janeiro launched a ""pacification"" program in 2008. They initially focused their efforts on the slums in the hills above the city's famous beaches, setting up permanent police posts. The Pavao-Pavaozinho slum clings to the hills dividing Copacabana from the elite beach of Ipanema. Rio's slums the hot World Cup destination? Protests started, according to Agencia Brasil, because residents believe police caused the death Douglas Rafael da Silva Pareira. His body was found Tuesday morning. According to Brazilian media, shots were heard during the standoff with police on Tuesday evening. Globo TV reported that a resident was killed during the shootouts. Hundreds of people participated in the protest, according to Brazilian media. Shootouts are still relatively common in Rio's favelas, and clashes with police, even in slums that have already been ""pacified,"" have increased in recent months. Earlier this month, Rio requested help from the Brazilian Army. More than 2,000 soldiers and marines moved into the sprawling Complexo da Mare shantytown in the industrial north zone. The occupation will persist until the end of July, two months after the World Cup ends. Rio will host a series of games, including the final match, during the Cup. It will also be the destination of choice for many of the 600,000 foreign fans expected to fly into Brazil for the major sporting event.

"(CNN) -- South African President Jacob Zuma has been admitted to the hospital for tests, his spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement Saturday. ""Yesterday President Zuma was advised to rest following a demanding election and transition programme to the new administration,"" Maharaj said. ""Doctors are satisfied with his condition,"" the statement read. Zuma was re-elected to a second term last month despite economic woes, deadly mining protests and corruption allegations. His party, the African National Congress, won the general election with 62% of the vote, which was lower than the previous election. After a turbulent first term, Zuma said during his inaugural address that his government will perform better this time around and take responsibility for any shortcomings. ""We will ... ensure much tighter accountability, with firm consequences where there is a failure to deliver services to our people,"" he promised.","South African President Jacob Zuma went to the hospital for tests, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A rogue militant group formerly allied with al Qaeda kidnapped more than a 150 teenage Kurdish students in Syria and forced them to take Islamic training, a monitoring group and Kurdish officials told CNN on Friday. Radical fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are holding the boys ranging in age from 15 to 18 at a Sharia law school in the northern town of Manbij, Nouri Mahmoud, a member of the local Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) in the Syrian city of Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, told CNN. ""They are training them in Islam and prayer, but we are afraid that they are teaching them to carry out operations in Kobani. We are very concerned that they will use the children for their terrorism,"" Mahmoud said. The Syrian government refused to set up testing centers in the Kurdish-controlled city of Kobani, forcing nearly 1,500 students to travel to the flashpoint city of Aleppo for year-end exams, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""These students are from the Kurdish people, which are a part of the Syrian people. All they wanted was their diplomas from school. There was no reason for them to go to Aleppo and risk their lives."" Mahmoud said. Last week, ISIS stopped the buses driving students back from exams to their hometown of Kobani and abducted the boys despite an agreement with the local community to allow the Kurdish students safe passage, Mahmoud said. The People's Protection Unit (YPG), a Kurdish militia, rules the city of Kobani, but ISIS controls much of the surrounding area, effectively imposing a siege on residents. ""We do not know their fate and the only solution we have is to appeal to the United Nations and to the international community. They must intervene in this issue,"" Mahmoud said. Syria's scattered and long-oppressed Kurdish community fought and won its local autonomy but distanced itself from the armed rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. The YPG, which defends and administers the ethnic minority's strongholds, predominately in the north, often faces armed attacks by anti-government groups vying for resources and control. ISIS is believed to have been involved in the killings of 15 civilians, including seven children, last month in the northeast village of al-Tleiliye, Amnesty International said in a report issued Thursday. ""ISIS wants to break the will of the Kurdish people so they can order them as they wish,"" Mahmoud said. ""The community just wants to defend its freedom and dignity.""","Teen boys reportedly held at school for Sharia law .

"(CNN) -- Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II are to be made into saints this weekend in an unprecedented double papal canonization. While millions across the world remember John Paul II affectionately, John XXIII -- known as ""The Good Pope"" -- may not be as familiar. Here are five things you need to know about the much-loved pontiff. 1. He was born in poverty -- and proud of it . Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the man who would become Pope John XXIII, was the third of 13 surviving children born to a family of farmers in the tiny village of Sotto il Monte, near Bergamo, northern Italy in November 1881. Roncalli left home to study for the priesthood at the age of 11, but even after he became Pope in 1958 at the age of 76 he eschewed the trappings of his position, and refused to take advantage of it either for himself or his family. In his last will and testament, Pope John XXIII wrote: ""Born poor, but of humble and respected folk, I am particularly happy to die poor. ""I thank God for this grace of poverty to which I vowed fidelity in my youth... which has strengthened me in my resolve never to ask for anything -- positions, money or favors -- never either for myself of for my relations and friends."" When John XXIII died in June 1963 he was mourned around the world as ""Il Papa Buono"" (""The Good Pope""). He left his personal ""fortune"" to the surviving members of his family -- they each received less than $20. 2. He saved the lives of Jews fleeing the Nazis . Roncalli broke off from his religious training during the First World War to serve as a medical orderly and later as a military chaplain. During the Second World War Roncalli, by then an archbishop, was serving as head of the Vatican's diplomatic mission to Turkey, and as a Vatican diplomat in Greece. While there, he helped saved the lives of many Jews fleeing the Holocaust, providing them with transit visas and other vital paperwork which allowed them to leave Europe. In recognition of his efforts, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation has petitioned Yad Vashem, the official memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, to name John XXIII as one of the ""Righteous Among Nations,"" non-Jews formally recognized for risking their lives to save Jews. Once he became Pope, John XXIII worked to improve relations between Roman Catholics and other faiths; one of his reforms was to have the phrase ""perfidious Jews"" removed from the traditional Good Friday prayer. 3. Strictly speaking, he wasn't the first Pope John XXIII . That honor belongs to Cardinal Baldassare Cossa, one of a series of claimants to the papal throne during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, when the Roman Catholic church was bitterly divided by the Western Schism. The split, which lasted from 1378 till 1418, saw rival Popes elected by separate factions of the church. Cossa was named Pope John XXIII in 1410, but he was forced to abdicate -- alongside Popes Gregory XII and Benedict XIII -- five years later to heal the divide. Today, Pope Gregory XII is considered the only true pontiff from that period: Benedict XIII, John XXIII and his predecessor Alexander V are all regarded as ""Antipopes,"" which is why Roncalli became John XXIII, and not John XXIV when he was elected pope. 4. Pope John XXIII played a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis . In October 1962, with the U.S. and Russia teetering on the brink of nuclear war, Pope John XXIII helped to bring both countries back from the edge, urging President John F. Kennedy and Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev to exercise restraint. During a message broadcast on Vatican Radio at the height of the crisis, the pontiff pleaded: ""We beg heads of state not to remain deaf to the cry of humanity: 'Peace, peace!'"" ""I've heard that it [the message] got to Khrushchev,"" Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, former Archbishop of Washington, told CNN. ""The Pope is looking for peace, and why don't you be the man of peace? And he said 'OK, I'll be the man of peace.'"" Days after the Pope's address, Khrushchev began withdrawing Russian missiles from Cuba, defusing the crisis. Months later, John XXIII published the encyclical ""Pacem in Terris"" (""Peace on Earth""), addressed ""to all men of good will"" and calling on the world's populations to coexist in harmony. WATCH: When JFK called on the Pope for help . 5. Unlike other saints, Pope John XXIII only performed one miracle . Under the normal beatification and canonization process, a person who has lived a holy and virtuous life is first declared ""venerable,"" then ""blessed"" and finally named as a saint. Candidates for sainthood must be shown to have performed two miracles. Pope John Paul II, who is to be canonized at the same time as John XXIII, is said to have cured a French nun of Parkinson's disease, and a Costa Rican woman of a cerebral aneurism. However, John XXIII has only been credited with one miracle. Instead, the decision to canonize him is based on his huge popularity, and on his role as the ""founder"" of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), according to experts. ""There already was one miracle certified for his beatification in 2000,"" Vatican analyst John Allen explained to CNN in September 2013. ""Pope Francis has decided he doesn't have to pass go, doesn't have to collect $200, he can go directly to sainthood."" Indeed, some would say that his canonization is already long overdue. In its entry on ""the roly-poly pontiff... [who] became a kind of father figure for the world,"" the Encyclopaedia Britannica notes that ""had the ancient custom of popular canonization still been in effect in 1963... that favour would probably have been given to him immediately by the tearful crowd who were gathered in St Peter's Square when his death was announced.""","Pope John XXIII is to be canonized, or made into a saint, in the Vatican on Sunday .
Known as ""The Good Pope,"" he reigned from 1958 until his death in 1963 .
He was born in poverty and said he was happy to die poor; he left relatives $20 in his will .
Elected as an ""interim"" pope, he instead proved the most daring pontiff in decades ."
"(CNN) -- For the last 10 years, people have blithely commented, ""Mobile is really changing our world."" The use of mobile and wireless technologies has thrust people into a permanent technology age with the kind of warp speed that author Alvin Toffler predicted in his groundbreaking book ""Future Shock"" some 40 years ago. As a result, we now live in a time of profound social upheaval equivalent to the Industrial Revolution. It seems we have little choice but to embrace our techno-driven reality. While countless individuals and corporations race to create bigger-better-smaller-faster hardware and software, the rest of the world struggles to keep up. This struggle takes many forms: learning new gadgets and systems; successfully integrating into the workplace different competencies with digital technology; and somehow being able financially to keep up. It also includes asking, ""How, exactly, is mobile changing our world, and is it all for good? How can we incorporate more and more technology without losing our humanity?"" Many people understand the need for addressing the ""human cost"" of digital device mobility. Recently, the Wall Street Journal dedicated two pages of its Weekend Review section to an article entitled, ""The Perils of Texting While Parenting."" The article addressed whether or not the increase in childhood injuries could be directly attributed to mobile device distraction of supervising adults. Fortunately, international thought leaders and scholars have begun to examine mobile and wireless for their effects on a wide variety of areas in our lives. I have coined a single word -- Mobilology [mobile + ology] -- to describe and give context to the study of mobile and wireless usage specifically as it relates to human behavior; community (formation, building and abandonment); culture; economics; education; entertainment; healthcare; and international relations. Since 2009, I have lectured around the world advocating for the creation of mobilology as a new and formal social science at university level. Since mobile affects nearly every established academic discipline, acknowledging its importance, independently, as a pivotal change agent in a rapidly evolving world makes good sense educationally, can cost very little to implement, and will prove invaluable. By establishing mobilology as a bonafide field of study, universities can remain at the cutting edge of education by offering course work with clear relevancy to incoming and interested students. The first university to do so will get permanent bragging rights. Furthermore, it will foster the development of future scholars and leaders in an ever-expanding field that heretofore has simply lacked a unifying name. Students will learn about the effects of mobile and wireless use as it relates to human behavior in their psychology classes. They will gain insight to the effects of mobile on community building (e.g. through mobile gaming), community sustenance (Facebook continues to grow at an unprecedented pace), and community abandonment (remember MySpace?) through their sociology courses. Similarly, they will learn about the effects of mobile as it relates to culture, economics, education, entertainment, healthcare (which itself is a dynamic growth industry as a direct result of what can be achieved through mobile and wireless devices), and international relations. Many developing nations are far more innovative and advanced than the U.S. in their uses of mobile. If we are to remain competitive internationally, we must take the lead educationally. The creation of a distinct mobilology discipline will benefit everyone by identifying those academics and students doing cutting-edge and thought-provoking research that can be applied to almost any industry. It will allow mobile- and wireless-based enterprise to connect with top minds to share existing information, with the possibility of funding future research that would otherwise not be sustainable. As for the argument that some companies have in-house R&D and this would cut out independent research companies, I say ""no."" Major companies will always need commissioned research. This will increase the pool of experts available to glean the truest, most current information for a client. Right now, hundreds of academics are involved in research either directly or tangentially related to mobilology. But finding these people is not easy. They identify primarily with the schools or departments in which they normally work. One reason may be that within today's university system, no matrix exists to provide the cohesion necessary for examining a growing cache of independent and/or university-acquired metadata that can reveal profound global trends and potential pitfalls. Without a formalized matrix to provide global context to their work, and encourage connectivity with other like-minded academics, we will continue to have a disarticulated population of individual experts in the effects of mobile and wireless use. Today we have the means to connect these individuals to each other, as well as to the global mobile industry, for cross-pollination of ideas, funding, research, manufacturing, and responsible forward growth that advances by incorporating the fascinating and sometimes unexpected effects of mobilology.","Florie Brizel is advocating for the creation of ""Mobilology"" as a new social science .

"(CNN) -- An Army veteran credited with trying to save the lives of fellow soldiers during a firefight in Afghanistan will be awarded the nation's highest military award, the White House said on Tuesday. President Barack Obama will bestow the Medal of Honor on May 13 to former Sgt. Kyle White for heroics stemming from the 2007 battle during which his only cover from enemy fire was a single tree jutting from a mountain cliff. Six Americans were killed and several others in the group, including White, were wounded in the four-hour attack. The Medal of Honor is received for conspicuous gallantry on the battlefield above and beyond the call of duty. White will be the seventh living recipient for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. He left the military in 2011 and is now an investment analyst in Charlotte. White was a platoon radio telephone operator and among 14 American troops and Afghan soldiers ambushed while on patrol on November 8, 2007, in eastern Afghanistan. He quickly returned insurgent fire and was knocked unconscious by a rocket-propelled grenade as he tried to reload his weapon. When he came to, his face was hit with shrapnel. White and four others were cut off from the other soldiers, who jumped from a cliff. He applied first aid to a wounded soldier and they both moved to the only cover they had: a single tree on the mountain. His radio not working, White moved into the open to try to reach a Marine about 30 feet away who was so severely wounded he could not move. He braved enemy fire, moving back and forth several times to drag him to the tree although he died of his wounds. White then exposed himself to withering fire again, crawling into the open to try to recover the platoon leader. When he reached him, the man was already dead. By this time, the soldier White initially brought to the tree had been hit again, this time in the leg. White applied first aid by using his own belt as a tourniquet. He then located a working radio and called for mortar, artillery, air strikes and helicopter gunships. But a friendly mortar round landed near him, resulting in a concussion. After nightfall, White established a security perimeter and ensured that no U.S. military equipment fell into the hands of enemy forces. The impact of multiple concussions was now causing his own condition to deteriorate, so he called for a medevac. He knew if he passed out, no one there could work the radio and guide the rescuers. When help arrived, White refused assistance until the other Americans and Afghans were aboard the helicopter.","Former Sgt. Kyle White and comrades were ambushed in 2007 in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- It was a case of déjà vu at Cheltenham on Wednesday as Ruby Walsh and Willie Mullins took the opening race for a second day in a row. Favorite Faugheen proved too classy for rivals in the Novices' Hurdle, powering away from Ballyalton and Rathvinden to land another win for flamboyant American owner Rich Ricci. ""Gosh, that was magic wasn't it?"" former banker Ricci told reporters. ""He was just brilliant. He's been a very hard horse to keep right but Willie and Ruby have done a fantastic job with him."" Sprinter Sacre, one of the brightest stars of National Hunt racing, is sadly absent from this year's Festival as vets continue to ponder his irregular heartbeat, but the magnificent Selle Francais did have a representative in the winners' enclosure in the shape of jockey Nico de Boinville. Sprinter Sacre's regular work rider got up on Whisper to deny AP McCoy on Get Me Out of Here in a photo finish in the day's main handicap. Beating perennial Champion jockey McCoy added to the pleasure for amateur De Boinville, who said:""I was very, very worried when I could see him coming up to me, but it's such a great feeling when they jump and travel as well as my horse did. I didn't have a clue that I'd won -- you don't dream this sort of thing happens."" In the day's feature race, the Queen Mother Champion Chase, Sire de Grugy produced the fairytale ending that connections and neutrals were hoping for by running away with the title by six lengths from Somersby and Module. Purchased for £35,000 as a 50th birthday present for businessman Steve Preston by 50 of his friends and family, Sire de Grugy runs in silks inspired by Preston's other passion, Crystal Palace football club. It was not just the Preston family who were celebrating the win; the horse is trained by Gary Moore, who also owns a 25% share, and ridden by his son Jamie. It was Jamie, in fact, who discovered the horse at a small French breeding operation and persuaded his father to take the plunge. His insistence resulted in his first Cheltenham winner. ""This means so much to me and my family,"" said trainer Gary. ""It's something I thought could happen but these things don't happen very often. I suppose I'm very lucky to have such a great family. I'm proud of all of them."" First to congratulate the Preston family was Ricci himself, whose own representative in the race, Arvika Legionnierre, was pulled up before the finish. There could scarcely be a greater contrast between first-time owner Preston and Ricci, one of the sport's most prominent figures. Ricci, of course, also owns Annie Power, one of the revelations of this jumps season. The super mare puts her undefeated record on the line in Thursday's feature race, the World Hurdle, where she will face four-time winner Big Buck's. Meanwhile, former footballer Michael Owen may not want to give up the day job just yet. On the opening day of the festival he successfully tipped three winners in a row. But on Wednesday he was notably less successful. Only one of his three fancied horses ran a place -- Shaneshill in the 5:15. Unfortunately Owen had tipped it to win.","Day Two of the Cheltenham Festival took place Wednesday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Retired NFL player Keyshawn Johnson was jailed briefly after an argument with his girlfriend Monday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Deputies were called to Johnson's Calabasas, California, home early Monday ""regarding a possible spousal assault,"" a sheriff's statement said. ""When deputies arrived, it was determined that the resident and his ex-girlfriend were involved in a domestic dispute,"" the statement said. ""The ensuing investigation resulted in the arrest of the resident for misdemeanor domestic battery."" Johnson was released from the Lost Hills sheriff's station after posting a $20,000 bond, sheriff's spokesman Chad Watters said. Johnson, 41, became an ESPN sports analyst after his career as a wide receiver ended in 2007. More recently, he was a contestant on ""Dancing With the Stars"" last year. He was the first person eliminated in the 17th season of the ABC show. Johnson also made news because of his feud with former neighbor Justin Bieber last May. Johnson went to Bieber's home to counsel him about the dangers of going too fast on residential streets, but Bieber wouldn't speak to him, Johnson's rep said. Both Bieber and Johnson have moved from that Calabasas neighborhood. CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this report.","Deputies respond to ""spousal assault"" call, sheriff's department says .

"Bensalem, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- About 100 vehicles were involved in a series of wrecks on the eastbound Pennsylvania Turnpike just north of Philadelphia on Friday morning, injuring at least 30 people and causing a traffic backup for hours over parts of two counties, officials said. Glare from the rising sun and ice -- left over from a storm that dropped snow and freezing rain in the Philadelphia area -- might have been factors, state police Trooper Adam Reed said. The wrecks started around 8:25 a.m. ET with a 14- or 15-vehicle collision in southern Bucks County, not far from New Jersey state line, said Bill Capone, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. About 20 more sets of wrecks stretching for miles occurred on the turnpike, said Pat Ponticelli, Bensalem Township's deputy director of public safety. Each apparently happeed as traffic slowed for crashes ahead. In a number of areas, smashed vehicles were piled into each other with their front ends pointing in different directions, aerial video from CNN affiliate WPVI showed. In one spot, at least nine vehicles appeared to be crunched in a jumbled group behind a tractor-trailer. In another, a couple of vehicles had come to rest against a jackknifed truck. Thirty people were hurt, including five with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries, Reed said. More than half of those injured were taken to Abington Memorial Hospital, where they were diagnosed with minor to moderate injuries, Dr. John J. Kelly, the chief of staff, said. ""I think we really saw mostly what we would call soft-tissue injuries, bumps and scrapes type of injuries,"" he said. Traffic was moving again in one affected section of the turnpike by 2 p.m., video from CNN affiliate KYW showed. Pennsylvania State Police said it hoped to have the road fully open by 5 p.m. Heather Pasco, a driver involved in one of the crashes, told KYW that she thought she was a goner. Pasco said she had stopped her car after she saw ""cars bouncing off of the center divider."" Although she stopped, a truck behind her didn't, she said. ""I looked in my rearview mirror, and there was a big ... truck right behind me, and he was trying to stop, but he was sliding and he slammed right into the back of me, which then made me slam into the car in front of me,"" she told KYW. ""I saw him (in the mirror), and I thought I was done,"" Pasco added. ""The entire back end of my car is gone."" Police told her that her wreck was about 3.5 miles behind the initial crash, she said. She said the road, after snow and freezing rain had fallen in the area, wasn't ""really plowed very well."" Traffic was backed up for miles, stretching west into adjacent Montgomery County. CNN's John Newsome, Lena Jakobsson and John Fricke contributed to this report.","NEW: A number of the victims suffered soft-tissue injuries, a doctor says .

"(CNN) -- Al Feldstein, who guided Mad magazine for almost three decades as its editor, has died, according to a Montana funeral home. He was 88. He died Tuesday in his home in Livingston, Montana, Franzen-Davis Funeral Home & Crematory's website said. Feldstein edited Mad from 1955 to 1984 when the magazine was the most widely read satirical publication in America. He was responsible for bringing on some of the ""Usual Gang of Idiots"" -- the Mad staffers and freelancers who filled its pages with their caricatures, puns and general wackiness. ""We were all saddened to see Al's passing,"" said John Ficarra, Mad's current editor-in-chief, in a statement. ""It's impossible to overstate his importance to Mad. He took over Mad when it was transitioning from comic book to magazine and much of what the nation knows to be as Mad. He attracted many of the talents that went on to become legends -- Don Martin, Al Jaffee, Mort Drucker, Sergio Aragones ... to list just a few of the many. The result of his work in Mad can be seen in a lot of comedy media today."" Mad, which was started by writer Harvey Kurtzman and part of the EC Comics stable of William M. ""Bill"" Gaines,"" was successful because it called out society's hypocrisy, Feldstein told the Onion A.V. Club in 2007. ""When Mad came about, it was the reaffirmation of those feelings in print. We were saying, 'Kids, Madison Avenue is lying to you. Your parents are lying to you. The president is lying to you,'"" he said. Kurtzman left Mad in 1955, and Feldstein took over. Under his guidance, the magazine was a no-holds-barred repository of movie parodies, witty verse, advertising take-offs, loopy comics and Al Jaffee's indescribable Mad Fold-In. Nothing was sacred. ""Mad was wide open. Bill loved it, and he was a capitalist Republican. I loved it, and I was a liberal Democrat,"" Feldstein said. ""That went for the writers, too; they all had their own political leanings, and everybody had a voice."" Feldstein was born in 1925 and began his career as an artist as a teenager. He joined EC in the late 1940s. Its founder (and the inventor of the comic book), Max Gaines, had just been killed in an accident, and the struggling company was in the hands of his son, William. ""I went down to meet this nerd with horn-rimmed glasses and a crew-cut named Bill Gaines. And I was with him for 35 years after that,"" Feldstein told the A.V. Club. At the time, EC generally did romance and crime stories. (Originally, the company aspired to uplift -- the ""EC"" initially stood for ""Educational Comics."") Feldstein, looking for an angle, suggested to Gaines that the company introduce a line of horror comics. They were known for their graphic art, witty writing and shock endings. The first, ""Tales from the Crypt,"" was an immediate hit and EC added a number in the same vein. But the powers that be of the time -- notably fearful politicians and a psychiatrist named Fredric Wertham -- lashed out at EC's comics and succeeded in having them shut down. Gaines, however, had protected Mad, his humor comic, and changed it to a magazine to keep it out of the claws of the Comics Code Authority. After leaving Mad, Feldstein returned to his first love, art. For decades he lived in Montana, specializing in the images and wildlife of the American West. Mad was sold in the early 1960s to what eventually became Warner Communications. Today the title is part of the DC Comics group owned by Time Warner, CNN's parent company. Feldstein is survived by his wife; a stepdaughter; and two grandsons, the funeral home's website said.

The second term of a presidency often follows an arc. As Lyndon Johnson told his aides after his landslide victory in 1964, you've got about a year to get things done at home. And second-term presidents have often seized on those early months for domestic accomplishments. After that, Washington becomes mired in midterm politicking, and in your third year, people start looking over your shoulder at who is coming next. With power seeping away at home, second-termers increasingly turn their attention overseas, where they can still get big things done as commander in chief of the most powerful nation in history. That's why presidents spend so much time on the road in their final years. Obama's second term is a total aberration. Resisted by obstructionists among Republicans and plagued by his own mistakes, the first 12 months after re-election were a bust. Why he and his team didn't take more care in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act website will remain one of the great mysteries for historians. But it has now become equally puzzling why he has not become more sure-footed in foreign affairs. He is one of the brightest men ever to occupy the office, and yet his learning curve has been among the flattest. Talking to players on the world stage -- most of whom still want him to succeed -- one finds them genuinely rattled, worried about a lack of national will and operational competence. On the tail end of his Asia trip, Obama told the press that in foreign policy, he thinks a president hits mostly singles and doubles and an occasional home run. It was odd enough that given his huge power and influence, he thinks small ball. But he also raised the question: Why so long between home runs? When was the last one? Three years ago with Osama bin Laden? Not to overdo his analogy, but the years since have brought a notable string of strikeouts. The administration would vigorously disagree, but just how much success can it genuinely claim in Syria, Egypt, Libya or even Iraq? Or the Russian reset? Or Ukraine? The administration's increasing focus on Asia is a welcome move, but it too has gone less well than expected. Experts have long said that much of the success of the famous ""pivot"" will depend upon completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the most important trade agreement in decades. To its credit, the administration has aggressively pursued the deal but to little avail. The President's trip to Tokyo revealed that the partnership is in serious trouble, mired down by domestic politics in both the U.S. and Japan. Obama did provide much-needed assurances to Japan about American credibility as a military ally. Still, the facts remain that even as the U.S. cuts defense spending, China is boosting its defense budget by 12% and flexing its muscles off its shores. With nationalism on the rise across Asia and sparks starting to fly, who can be certain that America will be there to put out a fire? The net result is of a president who sadly seems diminished both at home and abroad. He appears to have only minimal objectives with the current Congress -- passage of a higher minimum wage and pieces of an immigration bill -- and may not get either. Most Americans still want him to succeed, but when television executives put him on the air, audiences often melt away. Even before the midterms, voters are looking over his shoulder at who comes next. ""Waiting for Hillary"" is a bigger story than ""What Happened to Obama?"" And there are few prospects for home runs overseas. This is bad news and not just for the President's personal fortunes. America needs a strong, effective president year in, year out, to help propel us forward. Our success as a people has depended on our capacity to solve the problems of today so we can move on to tomorrow. The endless evasions and diversions are tying us in knots and draining our spirits. The world needs strong, effective American leadership as well; for all our mistakes like Iraq, the U.S. is the one nation that still has the power to keep world order. But in the twinkle of an eye, we have gone from being indispensable to indisposed. There is no obvious game plan for Obama to bounce back. It would help if he and his team promised less and delivered more. It would help if more Republicans put the country first. The White House must also avoid the clear danger of so eagerly wanting a big breakthrough -- say, in negotiations with Iran -- that it weakens our security. No deal is always better than a bad deal. But mostly, the Obama team probably has to be patient. Fresh opportunities for leadership will come; they always do at the White House. And for all his troubles, the President retains enormous powers and public good will. It is in not in our national interest to have a lame duck for 33 months.","David Gergen: Obama is experiencing another low point in his presidency .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- One of two men set to go on trial for homosexual acts in Uganda has been granted bail in the first case since the nation adopted tough anti-gay laws. After almost five months without trial, Jackson Mukasa, 26, a market vendor, received bail Wednesday after fulfilling conditions for his release. His co-defendant, Hakim Mukisa, 19, a student, is still in jail because he's not met residency conditions for bail. Mukisa has yet to get his passport stamped by authorities in his suburb of Kampala. The stamp is a court requirement to verify his residence because he does not have an identification card. Their trial is set to start on June 12 before a court in the capital, Kampala. ""They are being accused of carnal knowledge against the order of nature. It is the law of sodomy under Section 145 of the penal code,"" said their lawyer, Ladislaus Rwakafuzi. ""We will be contesting the charges because a similar law is being contested in the Constitutional Court,"" Rwakafuzi said, referring to a petition seeking to nullify the anti-gay law that President Yoweri Museveni signed in February. The law toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison. The law's harsh punishment for gays and lesbians has drawn international attention to Uganda. The men are not being charged under that law because it's under appeal, said Adrian Jjuuko, executive director of the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, a Ugandan human rights group. Instead, they're being prosecuted under a 1950 law. ""We will also ask the magistrates court to dismiss the matter, for there is no complainant. These are grounds we will be putting forward for the accused to be set free,"" Rwakafuzi told journalists shortly after securing their long-awaited bail. The case attracted attention from the media and local gay community, which found lawyers for the men jailed since December. Their relatives and friends were part of crowd in the small courtroom Wednesday afternoon. Another suspect, Chris Mubiru, awaits trial for allegedly possessing video showing him in homosexual acts with young men. The former manager of the Cranes national football team was granted bail in February. His trial will be held in the same courtroom.

"(CNN) -- The seizure of Crimea has boosted the domestic popularity of Russian President Vladimir Putin to an unprecedented 82%. In the long run, however, the invasion could be the death knell of the Putin regime. Starting a war to solve a domestic problem is now a Russian tradition. The first and second Chechen wars had political motives. Both were intended to distract attention from the consequences of privatization, and the second brought Putin to power. The 2008 invasion of Georgia sharply increased the popularity of Dmitry Medvedev, who was filling in as president for Putin. The earlier acts of aggression, however, did not evoke a strong international response. This time, Russia faces full-scale war if it invades eastern Ukraine and, at the very least, sanctions if it does not withdraw from Crimea. It is ill-equipped to handle either of these challenges. Putin has used rhetoric reminiscent of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, insisting in his speech on March 18 that ""Russia was not simply robbed, it was plundered"" and denouncing ""national traitors."" The regime he heads, however, is tied to the West inextricably. Russia's wealthy, who are dependent on connections to the regime, keep their money, families and assets abroad. They avoid Russian taxes with the help of businesses registered in offshore zones and acquire foreign passports and buy private planes in part so that they can leave Russia quickly and discreetly if that becomes necessary. One foreign lawyer in Moscow with experience of the elite told me, ""Their lack of patriotism is astounding."" Russia's businessmen depend on the West because the lawlessness inside Russia allows for assets to be seized by anyone who has political power. Large companies can be seized by state enterprises and small and medium-sized companies by persons connected to the security services. Businessmen make far more money than they could in a comparable situation in the West because most significant Russian businesses are protected monopolies. The ability to dispense with competition, however, is the result of political patronage that can be affected by the slightest change in the balance of power. Under these circumstances, Russia's businessmen do not keep capital in Russia and panic at the slightest threat. Western sanctions against Russian were relatively tepid, but for the Russian elite, the precedent was unnerving. Capital flight, which had been running at about $8 billion a month, is now expected to amount to $70 billion for the first quarter. The conditions in Russia also undermine the ties to their country of persons who are not rich. According to a poll by the Levada Center in 2013, nearly half of all Russian students said that they wanted to emigrate. ""Everyone feels slightly handicapped,"" said Yelena Panfilov, the head of Transparency International. ""You cannot do what you want, invest where you want, say what you want. A journalist cannot write what he wants. Everywhere, there is the need for political protection and the necessity of being subject to control. The more capable a person, the more he chafes under the restrictions."" So far, Russians have not paid a price for their government's acts of aggression. The fall in the value of the ruble and the reduction in the real income of the population began this year independent of the events in Crimea. But these tendencies are now set to continue and accelerate. This is a potential threat to Putin's political base. Since the beginning of the year, the cost of food products in Russia has risen by 25%. The impending economic crisis will be explained to the Russian population as the result of foreign sabotage. The propaganda in the official press that equates the Ukrainians with Nazis and treats the West as aggressors has been accompanied by the blocking of the critical websites grani.ru, yezhednevny zhurnal.ru and kasparov.ru and actions against the radio station Ekho Moskvy and the Internet television station TV Rain. Putin will seek to unite the country around him and in opposition to the outside world, as was done in the Soviet Union during the 1930s. Russia today, however, is nowhere near as isolated as the totalitarian Soviet Union, and Russians have much less to believe in. The educated part of the population will not be impressed by the increasingly grotesque distortions of official propaganda. At the same time, average citizens, witnessing the fall in their living standard and the likely increase in the corrupt machinations of those with connections to power, may finally realize that the anti-criminal revolution in Ukraine has relevance for their future, too.

"(CNN) -- Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal are looking at six more cases where a male intruder entered holiday villas where children were staying, police said Wednesday. The development means there are now 18 potentially linked crimes at resorts near where the 3-year-old vanished in June 2007, London's Metropolitan Police said. Children were sexually assaulted by the intruder in half of those cases. Madeleine's disappearance while on a family vacation in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz prompted headlines worldwide -- and remains a mystery. The six new cases have come to light thanks to an appeal for information last month that prompted more than 500 calls from the public, a police statement said. ""Five involve sexual assaults on children and one was a 'near miss,' "" it said. ""Of particular interest to the team is that one of the new sexual assaults took place in Praia da Luz in 2005."" All but one of the six offenses had been reported to the Portuguese police at the time of the Madeleine's disappearance, the Metropolitan Police said. ""These new cases are similar to a number of the originally identified (12 offenses) whereby a male intruder has gained access to holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Western Algarve,"" the force said. Investigators request Portugal interviews . Of the 18 potentially linked incidents, five were in Carvoeiro, nine in the Albufeira district, three in Praia da Luz and one in Vilamoura. The offenses in Praia da Luz occurred between 2005 and 2010. When police appealed for information last month, they said witnesses described the intruder as being tanned with short, dark, unkempt hair. The man was said to have spoken in English with an accent, and his voice was described as slow, or possibly slurred. No new information about the suspect was given Wednesday. In October, new police sketches were released of potential suspects in the case, and UK police appeared in a television appeal for information. The program prompted a flurry of tips, and police in Portugal announced they would reopen the case. Since then, the Portuguese investigation has run parallel to the British one. Detectives previously said they were investigating a spike in break-ins in the area in the weeks before Madeleine disappeared, two in the same block where her family was staying. Neither her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","UK police say six new cases have come to light of a male intruder targeting children .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Tania Nava has one piece of advice for anyone seeking to come out of the shadows and pursue a path to U.S. citizenship: don't do it. She says her decision to become a legal citizen is one of the reasons her husband was murdered. ""I should've stayed illegal this whole time,"" the 21-year old widow said. ""Jake would still be here."" Jake Reyes-Neal, an American citizen, had traveled to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, last year to protect his wife as she waited for the long, complicated process to attain U.S. citizenship. Instead, Reyes-Neal -- who had never been to Mexico and didn't speak Spanish -- became one of the thousands of homicide victims in Juarez as his family watched helplessly. Nava and Reyes-Neal were high school sweethearts in Aurora, Colorado, and they got married at 18 after she gave birth to their son, Anthony.  Nava decided that the next step to build her new life with her husband and child was to apply for U.S. citizenship. Her parents had brought her to the United States illegally at the age of 7. Although Reyes-Neal was an American citizen, their marriage didn't automatically give Nava legal status, so she still faced possible deportation. So the 18-year-old couple began navigating the intricate U.S. citizenship laws and regulations without the help of a costly lawyer. When Nava tried to apply for citizenship, she learned that federal law said she had to leave the United States and barred her from returning for up to 10 years because she had resided in the country illegally. She could apply for a hardship waiver requesting that U.S. immigration officials not separate her from her husband and child, both American citizens. But she had to file that waiver in her birth country, and that meant packing up and moving to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Every year, more than 100,000 people travel to the U.S. consulate in Juarez to attain legal status. The consulate was set up to handle the permanent immigration visas years ago before the city became so violent. Immigration attorney Shawn Mead calls the policy a perfect catch-22. ""It's an impossible situation: They have the option of staying here unlawfully, not being able to get their residence now or ever, or going and living in the city of Juarez, a place where people do get murdered all the time,"" Mead said. Nava left her husband and young son in Aurora and attempted to live in her native Mexico, where she felt like a foreigner. She lived with her grandmother in Juarez, where more than 3,000 people were murdered in 2010. Last year, that number fell to just below 2,000 -- the first time the murder rate has dropped in four years. ""We were aware of everything,"" Nava said of the dangers in Juarez. ""I mean, where we lived was a really bad neighborhood. We would drive by, and there were a couple shootings, and they had the bodies right there and everything."" Meanwhile, back in Aurora, the separation was proving even more difficult for Anthony, and it wasn't long before Reyes-Neal packed up and moved to Juarez to keep his family together. In a letter to the consulate, Jake pleaded for a hardship waiver allowing his wife to live in the United States while awaiting permanent legal residency. ""I am living with my wife and son in perilous and very dangerous conditions in Juarez, Mexico. We live with fear of our lives on a daily basis,"" he wrote. ""As U.S Citizens, my son and I are facing extreme danger everyday we wake up in one of the most violent cities in the world."" His plea went unanswered, and within six months, Reyes-Neal's fear proved prophetic. He was shot more than 80 times outside the family's home. Nava's uncle was also killed in the attack. The motive was unclear, although the family suspects robbery. ""The last thing I heard was him saying, 'I don't speak Spanish,' 'No hablo espaÃ±ol,' and that's it. And then I just heard the shots, and then I waited for a little bit because I was scared to go down there. I just went down there with Anthony and my grandma, and they were right there on the floor, on the ground,"" Nava said. Nava was covered in her husband's blood before she realized she was still holding their 2-year-old son. That night still haunts her. ""It's hard to sleep at night, because every time I think about them, the image pops in my head of them, they're on the ground. And as much as I try to block it out of my head, I can't,"" she said, wiping away tears. Today, Nava and her son live in Aurora, where she has a green card and is awaiting awaiting a path to permanent citizenship. ""The tragedy that this family has suffered is most unfortunate, most tragic,"" said Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""What we can do within the current laws is develop process improvements that mitigate the dangers and hopefully avoid tragedies to the best of our abilities."" Immigration Services has recently proposed a rule change aimed at reducing the time U.S. citizens are separated from their spouses and children during the process of becoming legal immigrants. The proposal would streamline the process of obtaining hardship waivers by allowing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to process certain waiver applications in the United States before an applicant departs for an immigrant visa interview with a U.S. consular officer abroad. In other words, it would reduce both the time the family spends apart and the time spent in harm's way in places like Juarez. Mayorkas says that as it stands, the immigration system punishes those who, like Nava, attempt to obey the law. ""I have been working in the immigration system now for almost two and a half years. As a federal prosecutor, I worked in enforcing immigration laws throughout the 1990s for approximately 12 years. Working in the system now, it is evident to me that the concern about a broken immigration system is indeed warranted and well grounded,"" Mayorkas said. The proposed rule change still has to go through several steps including a period of public comment before becoming official. But whenever it happens, it will be too late for families such as those of Jake Reyes-Neal. CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.","Tania Nava was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child .

"(CNN) -- One thing fans of the TV series ""Veronica Mars"" -- sometimes called ""marshmallows"" -- hope to see in the movie ""Veronica Mars"" is a resolution to the ongoing debate: Team Logan or Team Piz? When last we left the young detective, it seemed Veronica had finally settled down with Piz -- something that still seems to be the case in the trailer for the movie, which was funded entirely by legions of devoted fans. ""I know people were pissed off the way it did end, mostly because it was unknown,"" Jason Dohring (Logan) told CNN Thursday at the PaleyFest event for ""Veronica Mars,"" out this weekend. ""We give it some resolution in the film, but playing it back and forth is what makes the drama in the show. "" Logan was never supposed to be coupled with Veronica originally, show creator Rob Thomas revealed at the PaleyFest panel. But he grew on the writers when they saw Dohring's chemistry with star Kristen Bell. That chemistry came back right away when he did his first scene with Bell on set, Dohring told CNN. ""I think Kristen is amazing, and when she smiles at me I kind of go, 'holy s--- what do I do?' I smile back, and it just comes right back."" Meanwhile, Chris Lowell offered ""Team Piz"" fans this hint about his character's chances of being the one to end up with Veronica. ""I think Rob likes to not put a period on the end of every sentence when he finishes something,"" he said. ""The show ended on a cliffhanger note. I believe in a way he did a similar thing here."" Thomas said the resolution might still be debated in fan circles even after they see the movie. ""I think that fans will understand why Veronica makes the decisions she makes,"" he said. ""It's a fun predicament to put Veronica in -- will she go with her good sense or her passions?"" One thing Thomas did make clear is that he made the final call on how things ended up. Five ways the show made its mark on TV . ""It was not up for a vote. Certainly I had a way I wanted it to go and that's how it went, but we'll let the fans decide if they're happy with how it ended up."" Of course, none of this would have been possible without the crowdfunding from Kickstarter, which gave the movie its budget of well over $5 million. ""It's been a roller coaster ride for me in terms of hope,"" he said. ""There were moments where I felt optimistic and bullish about our chances, and others where I felt so low, I thought it wouldn't happen. Kristen Bell has this confidence and optimism that kept it going. It was like a mini-miracle when it came together."" Thomas thinks this could potentially be something we see more and more, especially when it comes to Warner Bros., the studio that owns ""Veronica Mars"" and gave Thomas the opportunity to try crowdfunding. (Warner Bros. Pictures is owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN.) ""The next few weeks will tell. If the movie makes money then I think there's an opportunity for more movies like ours to be made,"" he said. ""If we find this model that can support $5 or $10 million, I think [Warner Bros.] would be thrilled, and I'd be proud if we got more $5 to 10 million movies [based on existing series or properties] because of this."" So might we get more ""Veronica Mars"" after this? There's already a CW Web series based on Ryan Hansen's character Dick Casablancas set to shoot in July. Thomas told the fans at PaleyFest that the idea of a Netflix or Amazon season of ""Veronica Mars"" excites him to no end. ""I would love to be able to do the R-rated version of 'Veronica Mars.' I would love to tell some darker stories."" In the meantime, fans can hope that Thomas' TV adaptation of the comic book ""iZombie"" starring Rose McIver (""Once Upon a Time,"" ""Masters of Sex"") gets picked up by the CW. ""They said they wanted a kick-ass female centric show like 'Buffy' and 'Veronica,' and I think it's a fun show in that vein,"" he told CNN. ""I think we jump off the comic book [storylines] quite a bit, but we keep the basic idea that our young female zombies have to eat brains to survive, and she gets the memories of the people whose brains she's consuming."" Well, we can see one big difference right away.

But a 1944 operation that led to the capture of the German submarine U-505 -- the first open sea capture by the U.S. Navy of an enemy warship since the War of 1812 -- was led by Chicago native Capt. Daniel Gallery. Years after the war, when the sub was going to be scrapped, Gallery stepped forward and helped facilitate a move to the Museum of Science and Industry in his hometown. Since Chicago is absolutely devoid of oceanside property, it took five months for the U-505 to be towed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1954.

Probably not, but there may have been trade between eastern native tribes that brought the coin south.

A carpenter disassembled the 60-foot windmill and built a matching 6-foot scale model. The model was used as a guide for the 300 volunteers who helped reconstruct the full-size mill on American soil. While it was a delight to many Iowans, the moving of the mill wasn't as popular in Denmark, where a law was passed to prevent the exportation of its windmills shortly afterward.

With the prince's survival in question, the king prayed for a miracle with the promise that he'd repay it with a wonder of his own. When the prince recovered, the miracle was attributed to San Diego de Alcalá, a monk who'd died 99 years earlier. The king employed a clock maker to fashion a 15-inch-tall mechanical version of the monk that moved, nodded its head, genuflected and more. To put that in perspective, the 452-year-old automaton monk was created two years before the invention of the pencil. Smithsonian Institution, 1000 Jefferson Drive SW, Washington; 202-633-1000 .

Originally erected in Poprad, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), the statue had a short pedestal life. It stood for only a year, before being taken down in 1989. An American named Lewis Carpenter saw the bronze statue in a scrapyard and figured he could make money on it. After Carpenter mortgaged his house to pay for it, the statue was cut into three pieces to facilitate travel. Carpenter never profited -- he died soon afterward. His family agreed to move the statue to Seattle's quirky Fremont neighborhood, where the former revolutionary now joins a troll sculpture, a chocolate factory and, during the Solstice Parade, naked bicyclists.

From her maiden voyage in the 1930s, the RMS Queen Mary was one of the fastest ocean liners of the era, being the 14-year holder of the Blue Riband for the fastest liner on the Atlantic. It was this speed, some 30-plus knots, that best served the ship during her time as a troop carrier in World War II. The ""Grey Ghost,"" as she was known, was too fast for German U-boats to catch. At the conclusion of the Queen Mary's 1,000th Atlantic crossing, the ship was retired from service and moved to Long Beach, California, where she now houses a hotel, restaurants and an amateur radio station.

"(CNN) -- Retired Army Gen. David Petraeus resigned from his CIA director post last week after an FBI investigation revealed he had an extramarital affair, an investigation that also prompted questions about whether his paramour had inappropriate access to classified information. The scandal also has sparked an investigation into whether Marine Corps Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, sent inappropriate messages to a different woman, leading President Obama to put Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied chief on hold. The FBI uncovered the Petraeus affair while it investigated e-mails that his paramour, Paula Broadwell, allegedly sent to a Petraeus family friend, Jill Kelley, according to a U.S. official. Kelley, meanwhile, is the woman to whom Allen allegedly sent inappropriate e-mails, according to the Defense Department. Below is a summary of what we know about the situation. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . New developments . -- Despite his resignation as CIA director last week, Petraeus is scheduled to testify Friday before the House Intelligence Committee about the September 11 attack that killed four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the committee said in a news release. -- Petraeus has not been following media reports about his resignation, a former aide said Wednesday. ""He wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family at this time,"" said retired Col. Peter Mansoor, who added that he had spoken earlier in the day with Petraeus. ""He realizes it was a severe and morally reprehensible action, but he violated no laws."" -- A senior law enforcement official close to the Broadwell investigation said Wednesday night that it appeared unlikely she would be prosecuted for any unauthorized release of classified information. The official told CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend that investigators were reviewing materials taken Monday from Broadwell's home, but that the information in question did not appear to be substantial. The official stressed the decision whether to prosecute rests with the Justice Department. Opinion: 5 things we've learned from Petraeus scandal . The Petraeus affair . -- The FBI uncovered the affair between Petraeus, 60, and his biographer, Broadwell, 40, after Broadwell allegedly sent anonymous, harassing e-mails to Kelley in May, a U.S. official says. A senior official close to Allen says Allen received an anonymous e-mail about Kelley, and tipped Kelley off that someone was threatening her. -- A source familiar with Kelley's version of events said the anonymous e-mails later traced to Broadwell -- which led to the discovery of Petraeus' affair -- began in June. It wasn't until two months later that the FBI told Kelley who had sent the e-mails, said the source, adding that Kelley does not know Broadwell and has never met her. -- Kelley, 37, says she and her husband are friends of Petraeus and his family. Media reports have described her as a liaison at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, where the U.S. Central Command is headquartered. Petraeus and Allen were previously stationed there. A Central Command spokesman said she is a volunteer with no official position. -- Investigators eventually traced the e-mails to Broadwell, a U.S. official said. The messages were along the lines of ""stay away from my guy,"" but not explicitly threatening, according to a U.S. official. -- During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two living in North Carolina, an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London. CIA vs. FBI in Petraeus scandal . -- Broadwell, a West Point graduate, had written a biography of Petraeus, published in January, called ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."" Having met Petraeus in 2006 when he spoke at Harvard, where she was a graduate student, she wrote the book after researching Petraeus for her Ph.D. dissertation on his leadership skills and visiting him and his team in Afghanistan, where he became top U.S. commander in 2010. -- Petraeus and Broadwell began their affair in fall 2011, a few months after he returned to the United States, retired from the Army and took over at the CIA, according to a Petraeus friend. They ended it in summer 2012, Petraeus' friend said. -- FBI investigators, following up on the anonymous e-mails to Kelley, discovered on Broadwell's computer e-mails that turned out to be from Petraeus, a U.S. official said. -- On Election Day, November 6, Petraeus told Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the affair, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. Clapper advised Petraeus to resign, the official said. -- On November 9, Petraeus quit the CIA, admitting to the affair. The House and Senate intelligence committees were informed of the FBI investigation the same day. -- Petraeus' resignation came just days before he was scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the September 11 attack that killed four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Will national security scandal create national security risk? The Allen allegations . -- The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating allegations that Allen sent inappropriate messages to Kelley, the department said on Tuesday. The FBI told the department about the allegations on Sunday. -- Allen has denied wrongdoing, a senior defense official said. Sources familiar with Kelley have said the relationship between the two was not sexual. Authorities are looking at the e-mails. -- ""There is no affair"" between Allen and Kelley, a senior official close to Kelley said. ""She is a bored rich socialite involved with every single senior commander at CENTCOM, because she worked as an honorary ambassador."" -- A U.S. official familiar with the e-mails Allen sent to Kelley described them as warranting the investigation. ""If they got out, John Allen would be very embarrassed by them,"" said the official, who added that there was no evidence of physical contact between the two. A second U.S. official, who has had the e-mails described to him, characterized their content as ""sexy,"" but could not say whether they ""crossed the line."" Investigations and fallout . -- Broadwell, an Army Reserve officer, has had her government security clearance suspended pending the outcome of ongoing investigations, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge told CNN's Barbara Starr on Wednesday. -- Broadwell's affair with Petraeus has raised questions about whether the affair gave her access to national security information that she shouldn't have. The allegedly harassing e-mails that the FBI allegedly tracked to Broadwell detailed the ""comings and goings of the generals and Ms. Kelley,"" according to a source. Among those believed to be referenced in the e-mails was Petraeus. Because parts of Petraeus' schedule were not public, the e-mails raised questions about whether the sender had access to sensitive information. -- In a speech at the University of Denver at the end of October, Broadwell suggested the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi took place because the United States was housing Libyan prisoners there -- a theory, she noted, that had not been vetted yet. The claim has since been discounted by administration officials. Broadwell's source for that previously unpublished information remains unclear, and there's no evidence that it came from Petraeus. -- Investigators have found classified information on a computer belonging to Broadwell, a law enforcement source told CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend on Wednesday. It was not clear if this was a computer seized at her home Monday night or one she had previously given to authorities when she cooperated in September. -- On Tuesday, John Nagl, a retired military officer who worked for Petraeus for years, said that Petraeus insists he never shared classified information with Broadwell. He spoke to him via e-mail on Monday and is authorized by Petraeus to talk. -- Obama said Wednesday that he has seen no evidence of a potentially damaging breach in national security stemming from the affair involving Petraeus. No sex required for unfaithfulness to begin . -- Obama also said Wednesday that Petraeus served his country with ""great distinction,"" and he hoped that Petraeus' affair and resignation are ""a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career."" ""By his own assessment, he did not meet the standards that he felt were necessary as director of the CIA with respect to his personal matter that he is dealing with. ... It was on that basis that he tendered his resignation, and it was on that basis that I accepted it,"" Obama said. -- Kelley's access to Florida's MacDill Air Force Base without an escort has been suspended, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. Kelley had been given special access to the base because of her position as a booster and promoter of programs to help U.S. troops, the official said. -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she would investigate why the FBI did not notify congressional oversight committees about its investigation into Petraeus after the bureau determined he was having a secret extramarital affair. -- While the nature of the relationship between Allen and Kelley, if any, is unclear, evidence of an affair could subject the general to military prosecution. Adultery is a violation of military law. -- Obama has put Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied commander on hold pending the outcome of the investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday.","NEW: Petraeus to testify Friday before congressional panel about Benghazi attack .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obamacare enrollment is 8 million strong and growing. Polls have shown that voters love popular provisions calling for mandatory coverage for maternity care and extending coverage for young people up to age 26 to stay on their parents' health insurance policies. And recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office show that Obamacare will cost about $5 billion less to implement in 2014 than originally estimated. Still, some Democrats have run from the President's signature health care reform law so fast, they've practically left skid marks. The question is: Will they run back? ""I don't think we should apologize for it. I don't think we should be defensive about it. I think there is a strong, good, right story to tell,"" President Barack Obama said in a rare appearance Thursday at the daily White House news briefing. Obama: Republicans 'were wrong' about Obamacare . A Democratic strategist and pollster thinks some Democrats will follow that advice. ""I think it's easier to talk about issues like equal pay or an increase in the minimum wage,"" said Margie Omero, president of Momentum Analysis LLC, a public opinion research firm in Washington, and a Huffington Post contributor. ""Obamacare has always been less popular. ... I think we're going to see some of these impressions change. But for some members, they look at one poll number and they think maybe I should speak about something else."" 2014 Midterm Elections . Obamacare a tough sell for embattled Democrats . Singing Obamacare's praises is especially tough for politically vulnerable Democrats. So tough, in fact, that a Democratic super PAC, the House Majority PAC, ran ads for Reps. Joe Garcia of Florida and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona highlighting the lawmakers' efforts in bucking the administration on some aspects of Obamacare. The ads credit the lawmakers for ""blowing the whistle"" on the botched rollout of the HealthCare.gov website. Republican groups and some wealthy donors are pouring millions of dollars into ad campaigns targeting Garcia, Kirkpatrick and other vulnerable Democrats and trying to tie Obamacare to them. Democratic super PAC praises Democrat for blasting Obamacare rollout . The ads then go on to credit Garcia and Kirkpatrick for supporting provisions to block insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions or dropping patients when they become ill. The ads do not, however, make clear that these popular provisions are a key part of Obamacare. The House Majority PAC says their ads address Republican criticisms over Obamacare. ""Vilifying Obamacare may make good sound bites for the Republican base, but candidates will be forced to answer tough questions about what dismantling the ACA really means for voters,"" said Matt Thornton, the organization's communication director. ""Poll after poll shows that people approve of the constituent parts of the legislation -- popular provisions Republicans have vowed to repeal."" Garcia was elected in 2012 and has voted numerous times against a full Obamacare repeal and for measures aimed at changing provisions in the law. Kirkpatrick voted for Obamacare in 2010, lost a re-election bid that year, and then won back her seat in 2012. Democrats like Garcia and Kirkpatrick are trying to find artful ways to run on Obamacare, said Omero, the Democratic strategist. Those techniques include pointing out, "" 'Here are some things I might change or disagree with but it's starting to work' and talk about going forward how it's going to work,"" she said. Treading lightly on Obamacare . To be sure, there are reasons why some Democrats feel skittish boasting about Obamacare. From its inception, the partisan bickering over the law was acrimonious and led, in part, to the tea party-backed uprising that saw a number of Democrats unseated and control of that chamber go to Republicans. Despite a victory in 2012, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled core provisions of the law constitutional, Democrats still found themselves on the ropes as Republicans hammered them on the law's failings and voted in the House for repeal ""more than 50 times,"" Obama pointed out Thursday. Last November, the Obama administration struggled to recover from the rocky rollout of the health care website and explain why the President broke a promise that people who prefer their insurance could keep it under the law. On the campaign trail, vulnerable Democrats are dogged by questions about Obamacare. Republicans hit a nerve when it comes to Obamacare . As he made his way this week through the chill and crowds at a southeastern Virginia political gathering, Sen. Mark Warner was asked several times about the health care reform law. One man wearing an NRA sticker asked: ""Senator, did you read the Affordable Care Act before you voted for it?"" Warner told the man: ""I've outlined a series of changes to it. Five separate bills."" And in March, when Democrat Alex Sink lost by less than 2% of the vote to Republican David Jolly in Florida's special election for the 13th Congressional District, the GOP said Sink was defeated in part by Obamacare. ""His (Jolly's) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day said in an e-mail to reporters after the candidate's win. It is worth pointing out, though, that the seat has been held by Republicans since the early 1980s. 'This thing is working' The President is aware that he is partly to blame for the nervousness surrounding running on Obamacare. ""There is no doubt that our failure to roll out the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin,"" Obama said at Thursday's news briefing. He added that he feels ""deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier for them."" But, Democratic strategists and political analysts say, it's time for that party's members to stop running from Obamacare and start proudly touting the law's successes. Failing to do so could cost the party in the long run, said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""The party could make a collective mistake in continuing down this path,"" he said. ""Generally, for most Democrats, they need a message from the top saying they should not be responding to Republican attacks by saying 'we agree with you.' They need to point out the numbers and say we have some successes."" The President agrees, and he said as much on Thursday: ""This thing is working."" ""I find it strange that the Republican position on this law is still stuck in the same place that it has always been. They still can't bring themselves to admit that the Affordable Care Act is working,"" Obama said Thursday. ""They said nobody would sign up; they were wrong about that,"" he continued. ""They said it would be unaffordable for the country; they were wrong about that."" CNN's Leigh Ann Caldwell and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","Despite Obamacare's successes, some Democrats are avoiding being tied to the law .
Obama, Democratic leaders and party strategists say they think this is a mistake .
Politically vulnerable Democrats are in an especially tough position on Obamacare .
More Democrats might be willing to embrace the law's wins in time, strategists say ."
"(CNN) -- Let's get real. The Republicans have a problem attracting African-American voters. And Cliven Bundy made it worse. Period. Not just because Bundy turned out to express racist views, but because of what he initially, falsely symbolized for some conservative Republicans: a humble, hard-working rancher who despises federal government overreach. The fact that armed militia turned up to protect Bundy's cattle only made it worse, because it fit ever more neatly into the kind of extremist narrative that frightens many people, including many African-Americans. They don't feel comfortable when conservatives, like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, call the nation's first black President ""the most lawless President in the nation's history."" And they especially don't care for the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that kind of characterization invites. Example: ""These are dangerous times because this is a lawless presidency and a pliant Congress. The President's willingness to violate the Constitution publicly calls into question his fitness for office. And that deafening silence from Capitol Hill manifests a spineless refusal to preserve constitutional government."" That was written by Andrew Napolitano, who works for Fox News. The same Fox News that repeatedly validated Bundy and the armed men who chased the feds from government-owned land. The Republican National Committee loves to blame the ""mainstream media"" for its woes, but if it actually criticized right-wing media when it is clearly in the wrong, it would have more credibility with the very constituents it strives to attract. The Rev. Tony Minor, who heads People For the American Way's African American Ministers in Action, told me he doesn't believe mainstream Republicans buy what Napolitano is selling, but says, ""what frightens me is when those Republicans who know those kind of statements are absurd, when they don't speak against it, their silence betrays us from thinking there's any hope of any partnership with them."" In fairness, many conservatives did criticize Fox for its support of Cliven Bundy, but other Republicans, like Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, called Bundy ""a patriot"" and only backed away from him when it became clear Bundy was racist. But when the Republican National Committee's Sean Spicer appeared on my show, CNN's ""Newsroom,"" on Friday, he chose to attack me for not sufficiently covering Democrats who make horribly offensive remarks. Except we weren't talking about Democrats, a party already backed by minority voters, but Republicans and their worthy efforts to attract a broader base. The GOP is fighting an uphill battle and it knows it. In 2012, 93% of African-Americans voted for Barack Obama. As Larry Sabato, political scientist from the University of Virginia says, ""Republicans belong to a party that desperately needs to deliver good news and appealing personalities to all minority voters."" He adds, ""Every move that is viewed as an insult is going to make it difficult for the Republican Party to make up ground it needs to win."" In other words, Cliven Bundy: bad, bad, bad. Marc Lamont Hill of HuffPost Live agrees. He says if you take away Bundy's comments about slavery and focus on what he says about blacks and entitlements: ""In many ways what he's saying isn't that different than mainstream Republican ideology and policy. Republicans in so many ways have codified those beliefs through policy or policy initiatives that aren't outliers -- that are part of the mainstream."" Crystal Wright, a conservative Republican who edits the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com, says she is disgusted by the Bundy affair. She told me if the Republican plan to ""widen the tent"" included more than community outreach, Mr. Bundy might never have become a ""folk hero."" ""What they (Republicans) need to do is stop looking at black people as this other kind of group,"" Wright said. ""We (African-Americans) need to be brought into the party at all levels. I think if they would include more minorities and women at the table for strategic discussions, you wouldn't have these kind of missteps because somebody would say, hey, guys, I don't think we should embrace Mr. Bundy. Let's do our homework here."" Other black Republicans disagree with Wright. Tara Wall, who is a senior staff member for the RNC, took exception to Wright's assessment of the Republican Party and to my asking Spicer to address Wright's concerns and name some African-American senior staff members. Tara Wall: Media's coverage of Bundy, race and GOP a disservice . Why is it beneath the dignity of the RNC to reveal the results of its much publicized ""autopsy"" of its defeat in 2012 or its subsequent plan to attract more African-Americans? One of its stated goals is to ""...improve on promoting African-American staff and candidates within the party. The GOP should utilize African-American elected officials as surrogates both in their communities and with the national media. At the staff level, the personnel should be visible and involved in senior political and budget decisions and not be limited to demographic outreach."" Hello! This is politics, not the closed-door deliberations of the Federal Reserve Board. Visibility is part of the game, and transparency is an increasing necessity for the American voter. So, let's get real. The Republicans have a problem attracting African-American voters. And Cliven Bundy made it worse. Period.","Carol Costello says it's not a secret that the GOP lacks strong African-American support .
She says the party acknowledges that it needs to do better .

"(CNN) -- The son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor Sr. was sentenced Friday to 97 years in prison for charges including torture and conspiracy, according to a federal court in Florida. The U.S.-born son of Charles Taylor Sr., pictured, moved to Liberia when his father became president. U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga sentenced Charles ""Chuckie"" Taylor Jr., 31, in a Friday morning session that lasted four hours, according to a court document. Altonaga cited Taylor's ""sadistic, cruel and atrocious past,"" saying it ""constituted unacceptable, universally condemned torture,"" The Miami Herald reported. ""The lengthy prison term handed down today justly reflects the horror and torture that Taylor Jr. visited upon his victims,"" said Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general of the criminal division. Taylor, also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel, was convicted October 30 of torture, conspiracy to commit torture and firearm charges. His case, tried in Miami, was the first brought under a 1994 U.S. law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court, as long as the person is a U.S. national or is present in the United States, regardless of nationality. Calls to Taylor's defense attorneys were not immediately returned. Prosecutors had asked for Taylor to be sentenced to 147 years. Taylor was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but he moved to Liberia when his father was named president. Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president. The two groups are accused of abducting, torturing and killing people. From 1999 to 2002, Taylor committed torture and allowed others to commit torture, prosecutors said. Taylor and his associated burned victims with molten plastic, lighted cigarettes, candle wax and an iron. Some were severely beaten with firearms, cut and stabbed and shocked with an electric device, prosecutors said in an indictment that superseded the initial indictment from 2006. In the initial indictment, Taylor was charged with one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The superseding September 2007 indictment -- which incorporated the initial charges -- included five counts of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture, one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The defense had said the U.S. government had little or no evidence to back up its claims. Also Friday, the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a civil class action suit against Taylor on behalf of a group of people who are said to have been subjected to torture and other human rights abuses by Taylor or his subordinates, according to the organization. The suit seeks declaratory relief and general, compensatory and punitive damages, the organization said in a written statement. ""This civil suit aims to address Defendant Taylor's wrongs on a much greater scale"" than the criminal trial, the organization said. Taylor's father, Charles Taylor Sr., is standing trial in The Hague, Netherlands, on war crimes charges. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","NEW: Sentence reflects ""horror and torture"" visited upon victims, state official says .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Crowds of mourners gathered Sunday to bury a young man in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir after clashes the previous day between Kurdish protesters and Turkish security forces turned deadly. A member of parliament from a pro-Kurdish political party told CNN at least two people were shot dead in Saturday's clashes, with at least two more in critical condition. The violence unsettled a peace process between the Turkish government and Kurdish rebels, who have been waging a guerrilla war in the predominantly Kurdish southeast for 30 years. The Diyarbakir governor's office put the blame for the unrest squarely on what it described as ""attackers,"" according to a statement released online Saturday. ""As a result of an armed attack on security forces ensuring security on the Diyarbakir-Bingol road, two attackers were injured. One attacker was airlifted to Dicle University by military helicopter but lost his life despite all efforts,"" the governor's office said. But Sebahat Tuncel, a parliament member from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, blamed the deaths on the Turkish government. Tuncel told CNN that locals had been demonstrating for more than two weeks against the construction of new outposts for Turkish security forces near Lice. ""A week ago I was there and what the people there were telling me is 'We don't believe they (the government) are earnest about the peace process. People who are honest about the peace process would not be building more outposts,' "" said Tuncel, speaking by phone from the funeral of Ramazan Baran. Baran, 24, died in Saturday's clashes. For more than a year, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in negotiations with Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The Turkish state, as well as the United States and the European Union, have long designated the PKK a terrorist organization. The negotiations brought a relative lull to violence that has claimed the lives of more than 30,000 people in southeastern Turkey over the last three decades. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority. They were long the target of discriminatory policies, which banned the use of the Kurdish language and even Kurdish names. Since his party was first elected to power in 2002, Erdogan has implemented a number of reforms, including creating a Kurdish-language state TV channel, removing the ban on the Kurdish letters ""q,"" ""x"" and ""w,"" and allowing Kurdish-language education in some private schools.","At least two people shot dead in Saturday clashes, lawmaker from pro-Kurdish party says .

"Rome (CNN) -- It is one of a handful global landmarks that needs no introduction. The Colosseum in Rome is an Italian icon and a relic that dates back to the first century A.D. -- lions, gladiators, chariots and all. But with so many historic landmarks to care for -- like the Colosseum, the Spanish Steps and the Leaning Tower of Pisa -- Italy is beginning to struggle to manage its vast portfolio alone. This is a fact now readily acknowledged by the country's political hierarchy, with new methods to pay for the upkeep of these magnificent structures being sought. ""To me, this belongs to the entire mankind,"" Rome mayor Ignazio Marino told CNN as he looked out over the Italian capital from a balcony at City Hall. ""We have to share projects and ideas but we have to the share responsibility to maintain these for the generations to come,"" he added. The Colosseum brings in nearly $50 million every year but much of this money now goes to pay for the upkeep of less visited treasures across the city. Problems regarding funding started during the global financial crisis a little over five years ago. In 2014 alone, the city of Rome ran a deficit of over $1 billion dollars and required a federal decree to bail it out. These budgetary issues are complicated further by social and professional movements pressuring their representatives elected representatives on a number of issues such as pay and public services. On the sprightly spring day that CNN visited the Eternal City, junior doctors were on the streets seeking a pay hike. There are some, however, who say that if there is any hope of bringing back the days of ""La Dolce Vita,"" Italy needs to bundle its history with what the world sees as the Italian lifestyle. It is here that the private sector has begun to play its part. According to Diego Della Valle, owner of high end shoemaker, Tod's, the nation's biggest companies have a responsibility to maintain Italian monuments as they are all part of the same brand experience. DDV, as he is known, is spending $34 million on a five year scrubbing of the travertine marble front of the Colosseum. ""The most important things is the tourist project ... (or) if you want we call it the Made in Italy project,"" Della Valle said. Elsewhere, Bulgari is putting $2 million into the Spanish Steps while fashion house Fendi has offered up nearly $3 million for the equally famous Trevi Fountain. Rome's mayor himself has even ventured to Saudi Arabia seeking patrons from the energy rich state. It's a cap in hand call to action that the founders of this once mighty empire would have never considered. While Rome wasn't built in a day, it may also take a little longer find the coin required to preserve its finest and most treasured monuments. See also: From racecourse to mini-city .

But while the British public are accustomed to antipodean sporting success on their shores, in this case, Australia has a pedigree that's a little closer to home. The oft-quoted English horseracing authority James Weatherby once said, ""Fortunately, nobody knows how to breed a Derby winner. If they did, it would take all the fun out of it."" Australia's breeder may disagree. By 2001 Derby winner Galileo, prepotent sire of, among others, Frankel, and out of 2004 Oaks winner Ouija Board, Australia was bred by Lord Derby himself, whose ancestor gave this race its name. Legend has it the decision to name the race after the 12th Earl of Derby was made on the basis of a coin toss in 1779. Seven generations later, the present Earl was taking no such chances. If ever there was a colt bred to the task of winning the Epsom Derby, Australia is it. There is a theory about thoroughbred breeding which states: ""Breed the best to the best and hope for the best."" Australia, described by his trainer as the best he's ever trained, carried this hope along with no small measure of expectation. Sent off as a well backed 11-8 favorite, Australia ultimately lived up his billing as a horse worthy of adding his name to a roster of champions that includes the likes of Nijinsky, Mill Reef and Sea the Stars. Under a masterful ride from Joseph O'Brien, riding his second Derby winner after Camelot in 2012, the chestnut colt glided home comfortably to win by one-and-half lengths. Valiant runner-up Kingston Hill, a previous Group 1 winner himself, rallied bravely before being outclassed in the final stages, while a fast finishing Romsdal completed the placings. For O'Brien, it represented a unique hat trick -- no trainer has previously won the Derby three times in a row. It takes the Irish trainer's overall record to five wins in this race. ""We are in a very privileged position to have the horses we have,"" the master trainer told reporters after the race. ""We always said that he was very special and to have the pace that he has for a Galileo is incredible."" His son Joseph added, ""I had a grand position and I was going easy coming down the hill. There's no easier horse to ride than him. He is the best."" For Lord Derby he became the first member of his family to breed the winner since the 1933 champion Hyperion .","Favorite Australia wins the Epsom Derby, the Blue Riband of English racing .

"London (CNN) -- Built on a temporary site and made entirely from recycled shipping containers, London's latest retail park lays claim to be the world's first ever ""pop-up"" shopping mall. The aptly-named ""Boxpark"" opened for business today along a vacant strip of east London's fashionable Shoreditch High Street. It is composed of 60 standard-size shipping containers, stacked two stories high and five rows wide. The park, which has taken a year to complete, is the brainchild of British entrepreneur Roger Wade, who made his fortune in the 1990s with another box-themed venture -- the urban fashion label ""Boxfresh."" ""These containers have a strong symbolism for me,"" says Wade, during an interview inside one of the site's impressively refitted ""shoebox"" shops. ""When I first started out selling clothes on a market stall, I dreamed of the day I'd be shipping my wares off to Hong Kong inside one of these,"" he remarks. ""Now I think it's fitting that something so closely associated with global trade has ended up itself as a shop."" But while Wade spends time enthusing about his love of the iconic sea cans' ""industrial aesthetic""-- he's also keen to stress that the Boxpark, which has a temporary lease of five years, is more than just a hip new retail experience. ""This is probably the most environmentally friendly shopping mall ever built,"" he says. Despite the fact that the park does not boast sophisticated insulating technology or even a small array of solar panels, the simple fact that it's made from recycled materials adds credibility to Wade's claim. ""When people talk about the energy efficiency of buildings, they tend to focus on operational carbon emissions. That is to say, how much energy the building consumes once it's up and running,"" says Anna Surgenor, senior technical adviser at the UK's Green Building Council. ""But what often gets overlooked are the 'embodied' carbon emissions -- all the carbon released into the atmosphere when the building materials were manufactured in the first place,"" she adds. Surgenor illustrates her point by way of the Angel Building in London which, she says, saved 7,400 tons of embodied CO2 by retaining and adapting the existing concrete structure of the site's previous building. ""This saving is equal to approximately 13 years of operational energy use,"" she notes. According to a 2008 UK government report on low-carbon construction, the manufacture of building materials for use in the UK creates 45.2 million tons of CO2 emissions a year, equal to roughly 7% of the country's total emissions. And carbon's not the only thing to impact the environment when it comes to the sourcing and manufacture of building materials. ""Chopping down timber, polluting water streams, degrading the landscape by digging up mines ... all these things affect biodiversity and harm the environment,"" says Surgenor. ""This is why it's so important architects think about how they can use recycled materials during the design process."" Back at the park, a frenzy of journalists are sampling tasters from rows of boutique eateries, coffee shops and a juice bar, each with colorfully decorated interiors that belie their miniature scale. ""The great thing is, if one of these shops doesn't feel it's getting the most out of this location, they can potentially move to another part of the country with a vacant bit of land, without having to close down or dismantle a thing,"" says Wade. For him, the park represents a convenient alliance of economy and ecology, providing a cheap exciting retail space without extensive plundering of resources. ""Also, after five years, we'll return the land back to its owners in exactly the same condition as we got it, and then the community can decide if it wants a more permanent retail space there,"" he says. While the Boxpark may be the first ""pop-up"" shopping mall made from shipping containers, it's certainly not the first building project to capitalize on their structural appeal. ""There are about 400 established architectural projects making use of shipping containers around the world,"" says Slovenian architect Jure Kotnik, who has written two books on the subject and is curating an international exhibition on ""container architecture"" currently on display at the AIA in Seattle. ""From Volvo, Puma, Rolex, Nike to Ikea -- loads of big names have been turning shipping containers into shops or spaces that they think will enhance their brand image,"" says Kotnik. ""I think in part because it is a universal symbol ... it's also become increasingly cool."" The 31-year-old architect believes that the containers have an inherently strong associated link with architecture. ""They resemble building blocks, and when they're stacked up along the port in little towers, it creates a neighborhood feel."" According to Kotnik, containers have been used for decades as makeshift residences and market shops in places like Africa, but it's only in the last 10 years that architects have ""added value"" by creating high concept designs out of them. ""In some ways I'm surprised it's taken the mainstream architectural community so long to utilize containers in this way -- as their modular, standardized shape lends itself so well for creating interesting buildings,"" he says. Kotnik imagines that there will soon be more sustainable building materials available on the market and that this may ultimately diminish the popularity or need for his beloved containers. But at least for now, he says, ""if you need a strong, relatively cheap, easily mobile structure, there's few things better.""","London's ""Boxpark"" shopping mall has been built from 60 shipping containers .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In January 2010 a seven-point magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti, killing more than 250,000 people and damaging its infrastructure, including some water systems. Even before the quake, Haiti's water systems were fragile, and just months after the quake the country was hit with a devastating cholera outbreak -- the first in nearly a century. By the time the outbreak subsided, more than 8,000 people had died and hundreds of thousands more had become sick. Independent studies suggest the outbreak was caused by U.N. peacekeepers who improperly disposed of fecal matter that ended up in Haiti's Artibonite River, a main tributary, where people bathe. In its own report, the U.N. concluded that the outbreak was ""the result of bacteria introduced into Haiti as a result of human activity"" -- but the organization says water and sanitation and healthcare system deficiencies allowed the bacteria to spread. ""A cholera patient excretes the cholera bacteria in huge numbers and, if that excreta gets into the water or the food supply and other people consume it, they too will become ill and they'll amplify that by contaminating more water and more food,"" explains Dr. Eric Mintz, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. ""That's where you see these incredibly rapid epidemics of cholera, and that tells you that the water is unsafe."" Today, Haiti's Mirebalais University Hospital is training new doctors for another cholera outbreak. ""That could happen again, particularly in parts of the country where people have not had a lot of cholera,"" says Mintz. ""They may not have the experience to recognize it. They may not know what to do in terms of treatment. We certainly can't stop now and declare victory.""

"London (CNN) -- The attack on a soldier hacked to death on a London street has echoes of other plots on British soil in recent years. The victim of Wednesday's attack in Woolwich was a serving soldier based at a nearby barracks, London police say, and the UK government is treating it as a suspected terrorist attack. In 2007 four men were imprisoned over a plot to kidnap and kill a British Muslim soldier on leave and behead him in a Birmingham garage. The group's ringleader Parviz Khan intended to behead the soldier ""like a pig"" and release footage of the killing on the internet. Khan was later imprisoned for life and must serve a minimum of 14 years before he will be considered for release. Three other men, Basiru Gassama, Mohammed Irfan, and Hamid Elasmar, were handed down sentences of between two and seven years for their roles in the plot. High Court judge Mr Justice Henriques said Khan's aim was to deter any Muslim from joining the British army. ""So rampant are your views, so excitable your temperament, so persuasive your tongue and so imbued with energy are you, it's quite impossible to predict when, if ever, it will be safe for you to be released into the public,"" the Guardian quoted the judge as saying. ""It was a plot whose purpose was to undermine democratic government, to demoralize the British army and to destabilize recruitment, and to cause anguish to the then prime minister of the day and the loyal citizens of the country,"" the judge said. Prosecutors said Khan hoped to kidnap the Muslim soldier in Birmingham's Broad Street entertainment quarter with the help of drug dealers. This is not the only recent example of serving soldiers being the targets of terrorist attacks. Last month three British-born men were imprisoned for between four and nine years for preparing acts of terrorism. The men, who pleaded guilty had discussed targeting Royal Wootton Bassett, a town that became a focal point for parades by UK troops returning from service in Afghanistan. The judge, Mr. Justice Simon, said they had shown themselves to be ""committed fundamentalists"" ready to kill. Muslim convert Richard Dart, a former BBC security guard, and co-defandant Imran Mahmood had discussed how to make explosives, with the western English town as a potential bombing target.","A serving British soldier is killed in London by two armed men .

"(CNN) -- In some corners of the Internet, Kim Kardashian is already Mrs. Kanye West. The 33-year-old reality star isn't expected to marry West until May 24, but a May 4 report from Life & Style Weekly stirred speculation that the couple have already obtained a marriage license in California. Whether or not that's true is up for debate. Both People magazine and E! News cite sources who say that Kardashian and West, 36, haven't yet made their impending union official. A rep for the reality star isn't commenting on the reports and Kardashian hasn't spoken on them either, but she has let a few details slip about her upcoming nuptials. ""We will be getting married ... in Paris,"" Kardashian told Jimmy Kimmel earlier this year. ""We love it there. It's like our second home, we spend so much time there."" And according to the ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star, her husband-to-be has been hands-on with the planning process. ""I know they think or they say that the guy usually doesn't care and just shows up, but Kanye really cares and is really passionate about it, so it makes my job so much easier,"" she said. ""I love it because he knows what he wants, and I love that about him."" West popped the question to Kardashian with an over-the-top proposal in October 2013, a few months after the couple welcomed their first child together, daughter North.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. Motherboard.tv is Vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- Geneva may have given the world precision watches, but its biggest contribution to humanity is a giant time machine. Buried beneath the Swiss countryside and stretching across the border to France, the Large Hadron Collider isn't just any science experiment. The underground particle racetrack is present-day summation of questions about matter -- really, our entire puzzle-like understanding of the natural world -- that humans began to ask over a millennia ago. But it goes back much further than that. As it smashes trillions of protons together at near the speed of light in the hopes of breaking them apart to see what they're made of, the LHC takes us back to the moments just after the birth of the universe. Nearly a year after the proton beams were successfully circulated in the main ring of the collider, the project's overseer, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, invited Motherboard.tv to come by for a visit. In interviews with the research students and their bosses, including Lyn Evans, the project manager, we learned all about the $9 billion machine that's 17 miles in circumference and straddles the border of Switzerland and France. It's arguably the fastest racetrack in the universe, able to create things like quark-gluon plasma and, if theory holds up, the Higgs boson, the so-called Holy Grail of particle physics. That might help explain why protons and neutrons weigh 100 times more than the quarks they're made of, what dark matter is, and how the universe came to exist. But we weren't satisfied with merely a visit to the most intricate machine ever built. We also wanted to clear the air about something that had been bothering us, in a few different ways -- the imminent collapse of Earth. That's at least the theory of people like Otto Rossler, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Tubigen. He argues that CERN's proton collisions could generate dangerous miniature black holes. These won't necessarily bring about the end of the world -- there's just a one-in-six chance. This kind of planetary Russian Roulette, Rossler says, ""is a risk you musn't take."" While at least two separate scientific panels have certified the safety of the project, the doomsday theory has gained traction on the Internet, where, laments CERN spokesman James Gillies, ""many sensible, intelligent and rational people have been unnecessarily worried by some some completely baseless speculation."" Rossler's theory, meanwhile, has been met in kind from another left field - Holger Bech Nielsen's simultaneously serious and funny proposition that the many technical problems that have plagued the LHC are the work of a time-traveling Higgs boson particle, hell-bent on preventing us from ever finding it, lest we say, opening up some sort of fundamental particle Pandora's Box. This wonderfully absurd theory doesn't stand up, according to CERN researchers, at least not since they observed cosmic rays with energies equal to and much higher than the LHC. Says Gillies, ""If he were right, we would not see such rays."" Watch ""Big Bangs and Black Holes"" at Motherboard.tv . Still, technical issues have dotted the project's history over its decades of construction and scant three years of operation. Everything from electrical failures to minor explosions have given the project's leaders, not to mention thousands of scientists around the world, a bit of indigestion. At the end of 2012, the experiment will be shut down for a 15-month upgrade, which became necessary after a nearly catastrophic accident in 2008 that cut the collider's design energy in half. But the scientists have little to complain about. It's not often that the stars align to allow for a project of this magnitude, and nothing this complex has ever been built before. It could have happened here. During the 1980s, American physicists looked with a fevered hope to a giant construction site in Texas, where the Department of Energy was building the Superconducting Supercollider, a particle accelerator intended to be the last word, for a few years at least, on particle physics research. But funding for the project was cut in the early 1990s, and today the giant tunnels built for the project lie fallow. It was a missed opportunity for the United States, says physicist Neil de Grasse Tyson. ""Here's this huge project, and we would have led the field in this subject, and now we just stand on the shores looking across the pond to Switzerland as Europe leads the way."" Scientific competitiveness aside, the Large Hadron Collider is a truly international project, built in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries. To process the data collected by the collider's six particle detectors and distribute it to researchers around the world, CERN relies on another of its inventions. In 1990, CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee, created the World Wide Web. Today, the lab is developing a new approach to distributed computing it calls the Grid. (No relation to ""Tron"" -- yet.) The aim is to make internet access to computing resources -- CPU and storage -- as accessible to users as the Web makes access to information. The Web has also been crucial in generating public interest in the Large Hadron Collider, with an assist, of course, from a strong marketing push. CERN has sought connections with Hollywood (the collider played a starring role in Ron Howard's version of Dan Brown's ""Angels and Demons"") and the arts (the lab has established an artist-in-residence program). ""We have been working for many years to build up CERN's public profile,"" says Gillies, ""seeing the LHC as a unique opportunity to raise the profile of science in general."" As for the absurd theories, he says, ""we've had to build the buzz surrounding the more fanciful ideas into our communication strategies."" Even if the popular fascination with the collider may sometimes stray into science fiction, it has made made its research not only the object of popular fascination, but a cause of inspiration too. In that way, the project isn't just looking for the Higgs. It's helping humanity examine practically everything.","2011 marks 100th anniversary of discovery of atomic nucleus .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sanctions. International monitors. Increased jet fighters in the region. Trying to figure out how the United States and its European allies will respond to Russia's Crimea incursion gets confusing. The tense showdown over Ukrainian sovereignty offers few easy answers, with differing priorities between Washington and the European Union adding to the confusion. Here is a look at where Western allies stand: . Military . United States -- It is hard to imagine a scenario that would cause U.S. troops to get involved in Ukraine. At the same time, the Obama administration can't rule out any option as it pushes for direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine aimed at de-escalating the current crisis and laying the groundwork for peaceful coexistence going forward. The Pentagon has announced the addition of six F-15 fighter planes to the four currently on a NATO mission in the Baltics. Previously, Washington halted ongoing military cooperation with Russia. After a series meetings Wednesday with European, Ukrainian and Russian counterparts in Paris, Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters that ""all parties agreed today that it is important to try to resolve the issues through dialogue."" He added: ""They don't believe that any of us are served by greater or further confrontation."" Europe -- The last thing the European Union wants is an armed conflict in its backyard. Only if Russian forces moved into eastern Ukraine would consideration be given to bolstering NATO forces in neighboring countries. While no obligation exists for NATO to militarily defend Ukraine against Russian aggression, the United States and Britain -- along with Russia -- committed to protecting Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity in 1994 when Kiev gave up its nuclear arsenal that dated back to the Soviet era. What happens now to Ukraine will have an impact on nuclear nonproliferation programs elsewhere, Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned Thursday. His implication was clear: failure to effectively respond to Russia's aggression in Crimea would embolden North Korea and Iran to further resist Western efforts to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons. Sanctions . The United States -- President Barack Obama said Thursday that he signed an executive order that laid the groundwork for sanctions against people and entities deemed responsible for the crisis. The executive order provides the legal basis for sanctions against specific people and entities, but White House spokesman Jay Carney later told reporters no individuals were specifically targeted. Visa bans are already in effect for some Russian and Ukrainian officials, and the freezing of assets and property could be forthcoming. The moves fall short of broader economic sanctions aimed at Russia's state-owned banks and energy industry sought by some in Congress. ""This action by Russia cannot go unchallenged,"" Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thursday at a hearing where the panel approved a non-binding resolution backing sanctions. Europe -- Closer proximity to Russia and crucial economic ties make the issue of sanctions more difficult for European countries. Already, Russia threatens to retaliate with its own sanctions if the United States and Europe take such a step. Russia is the European Union's third-biggest trading partner after the United States and China, with goods and services worth more than $500 billion exchanged in 2012. About 75% of all foreign direct investment in Russia originates in EU member states, according to the European Commission. In addition, Russia is the single biggest supplier of energy to the European Union. British energy firm BP is the second-largest shareholder in Russia's leading oil producer Rosneft, and some of the biggest energy companies in Germany, the Netherlands and France are invested in a joint venture with Russian gas giant Gazprom. ""If and when any sanctions are placed on Russia, they are likely to be targeted on key officials rather than on the wider economy,"" said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. ""Europe is too dependent on Russian energy to countenance full-blown trade restrictions."" On Thursday, the European Union threatened limited steps if no substantive negotiations between Russia and Ukraine start in coming days. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters in Brussels that ""in any absence of results, the EU will decide on additional measures such as travel bans, asset freezes, and cancellation of the EU-Russia summit."" Later, Kerry told reporters that no serious gap existed between the U.S. and EU approaches, adding that "" there may be some differences of opinion about timing or about one choice over another."" Aid . United States -- Kerry announced $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine this week as part of the Obama administration's effort to publicly support the interim government and provide incentive for Ukraine to continue to align itself with the West through the European Union instead of Russia. Obama called Thursday for Congress to support assistance for the Ukrainian government from both the United States and the International Monetary Fund. A few hours later, the Republican-led House overwhelmingly approved an aid package to authorize the previously announced loan guarantees. Such support offers a trifecta of being unilateral, enjoying political support at home and backing the goal of bolstering Ukraine. Europe -- The European Union announced Wednesday it will offer Ukraine at least $15 billion in aid as the country struggles with dwindling cash and the military standoff with Russia. The package would provide Ukraine with assistance over the next few years, said Jose Manuel Barroso, the head of the EU's executive body, the European Commission. On Wednesday, Ukraine said it would be unable to pay its February natural gas bill to Gazprom. European aid is the easiest way to show immediate support for Ukraine while avoiding risks of counter-sanctions and other retaliation. Diplomacy . United States -- The United States is working with European allies to create an ""exit ramp"" for Putin to be able to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis. Their plan would call for Russian troops in Crimea to return to their barracks, and international observers to come to Ukraine to monitor the situation on the ground, where Russia complains of persecution against ethnic Russians. In addition, the United States seeks to isolate Russia diplomatically, joining other members of the G8 group of industrial powers in pulling out of preparatory meetings for the scheduled June summit in Sochi, Russia. The foundation of the U.S. stance is for Ukraine to maintain its independence and territorial integrity, while also recognizing Russia's historical and economic ties to Ukraine. Obama said Thursday he was ""confident"" that the international community was ""moving forward together"" in responding to what he called the Russian intervention. Europe -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Obama on Tuesday about the diplomatic exit ramp, but initial indications Thursday showed little progress with Russia on agreement. Reflecting the standoff, Merkel said Thursday that the European Union wants to do everything it can to settle the Ukraine crisis diplomatically, but she warned that without any ""diplomatic possibility,"" steps such as asset freezing and visa limitations would be options. CNNMoney's Mark Thompson, Alanna Petroff and Charles Riley and CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Where do Washington and the European Union stand on the Ukraine crisis?

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Senate agreed Wednesday to soften a ""Buy American"" provision in its economic stimulus package, clarifying that the clause will not override existing U.S. trade treaties. The ""Buy American"" provision in a proposed stimulus plan has raised the ire of lawmakers and business groups. The so-called ""Buy American"" provision in the $900 billion stimulus plan would have mandated that only U.S.-made goods be used in projects funded by the bill. Lawmakers who supported the provision said it would help jump-start the economy because it would help American companies. At the same time, however, senators rejected a proposal by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona to strip the ""Buy American"" language completely from the bill. Both moves on Wednesday mean that senators will keep the provision in place while ensuring it respects international treaties. Last week, the House of Representatives passed its own stimulus bill, which ensured that, with some notable exceptions, only U.S.-produced iron and steel be used for construction. The White House and many U.S. trading partners -- including its largest, Canada -- want lawmakers to craft their bills in a way that they don't run afoul of international trade agreements. They worry that such restrictions would spark a trade war and exacerbate the economic downturn. President Obama ""wants to ensure that any legislation that passes is consistent with trade agreements and doesn't signal a change in our overall stance on trade,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a briefing Wednesday. The European Commission said last week it might challenge such a move if it were signed into law. Canadian officials, for example, said the exclusion of non-U.S. steel would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lowered trade barriers among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Furthermore, many economists and business groups argue that a ""Buy American"" provision could backfire, slowing economic growth instead of helping expand the American job market.  Watch how ""Buy American"" provisions could affect U.S., global economy » . ""It's not a good time to initiate protectionist measures in any shape or form,"" said Kurt Karl, head of economic research at Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurer. ""It hurts growth, because if you force one side to go with domestic production only, then that precludes them from getting less expensive materials from overseas."" Thomas Donohue, head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added, ""If we refuse to buy foreign-made goods, then our trading partners will refuse to buy from us. And since we are the world's largest exporter, who will be hurt more?"" Previous efforts have misfired. For instance, from 2001 to 2003, the Bush administration imposed so-called safeguard tariffs on certain steel products from various countries in an attempt to prevent U.S. steel mills from closing. Foreign steel makers found other markets during that span, namely China and Middle Eastern countries. As a result, when U.S. demand for steel heated up again in 2004, steel prices skyrocketed by 48 percent in a year, according to the Labor Department. On the other hand, a host of politicians think the ""Buy American"" provisions have appropriate safeguards to ensure stimulus spending is not wasted on expensive materials and the U.S. economy does not suffer long-term consequences. For instance, the bills both stipulate that if construction costs would rise by 25 percent or more due to the purchase of American-made materials, contractors could receive a waiver to purchase foreign materials. The bills also allow for a waiver if buying American were not in the best interest of the economy or taxpayers. ""It's not protectionist -- there are no tariffs or barriers being created,"" said a spokesman for Rep. Peter Visclosky, D-Indiana, who introduced the House's ""Buy American"" amendment, which won unanimous support. ""It's about the U.S. steel industry running at or below 45 percent capacity, and the objective is creating jobs.""","Senate agrees to soften stance on ""Buy American"" provision in stimulus plan .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has made his proverbial bed. And, oh, is he lying in it now. The ugly comments about blacks and Latinos attributed to him have hit struck another nerve -- this time with players, fans and most decent-thinking Americans. NBA players protest racist talk attributed to L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling . The tape released a few days ago reportedly shows that the person identified as Sterling can profess his own kind of love for a woman who's black and Latina but refuses to ""allow"" her to befriend her own kind: blacks and Latinos. Sterling allegedly says his girlfriend (whom he at one point on the tape calls ""stupid"") can meet with blacks and sleep with blacks but not take pictures with them (in this case former Lakers star turned entrepreneur Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson) or bring them to Clippers games. Like some slave owners who kept their mixed-race female slaves in better living conditions and bestowed privileges upon them, Sterling can allegedly be heard telling a woman identified as V. Stiviano that he doesn't have a problem with her or her race but that she shouldn't fraternize with blacks and Latinos because it disturbs him. He selected her. So that makes her ""special."" She's not really black. It sounds like Sterling, who has been married for nearly 50 years, shared a rarely heard perspective that his lover/girlfriend/mistress can mitigate the ""inferiority"" (my term) of her racial mixture by spending more time with him. Oh, yeah, Sterling is white. The man on the recording appears to admonish and belittle her for posting photos on Instagram and calling attention to her willingness to interact with blacks -- and he holds particular distaste for Johnson, a man who is seen as a true ""good guy"" by many Angelenos. Sterling and his reported racist thoughts are not unique. What is unusual is that the sentiments were made public. Sterling is the lead news story now, just days after another big news story focused on conservative hero rancher Cliven Bundy, who pondered whether blacks should have remained slaves. ""And I've often wondered,"" Bundy said, ""are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy?"" How many times and in how many ways do we see the impact of this kind of racist thinking by people holding powerful positions in our country's institutions and businesses? How many times do we have to hear proclaim ""I'm not a racist"" and think they can get away with it? I'd love to hear their reaction to the Clippers' decision to wear their warmup shirts inside-out and toss their warmups in a pile at center court just before Sunday's Game 4. Would they ask, ""how dare they?"" Reaction: 'Disturbing and offensive' So thank goodness for the tape. California is a two-party consent recording state, meaning you cannot record a person's comments -- on the phone or in person -- without his/her permission. However, Sterling seems to have consented to being recorded. A TMZ report alleges that his girlfriend routinely recorded their calls at his request because he sometimes forgot what he'd said to her, and she even played this recording back to him after he denied to her he made the racist statements. Now, I don't understand what that's about, but I pray for a public outcry should Stiviano face any charges for recording Sterling's racist remarks. As for what punishment Sterling might face, if the authentication process identifies the speaker as Sterling, there can be only one outcome: loss of his team ownership. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is a decent man. I know him from my days as majority owner of the WNBA L.A. Sparks. Silver is measured and thorough, and I, like most of the basketball world, eagerly await his decision on Sterling's discipline. As a matter of course, a person, even a person with immense wealth, can't decide to own a team and then just buy one. NBA lawyers and financial folks pore through your background, including the source of your funds, your tax status, your character and community standing, etc. Then the Board of Governors has to vote you in as a member/owner. And if, in the league's estimation, your status becomes a negative, the same Board of Governors can vote you out as a member/owner. It will be Silver's decision to take it to the board, but any board member can initiate a motion to terminate an owner's right to own the franchise. So I await two things: verification that Donald Sterling is the person on the tape and the NBA's termination of his ownership of the L.A. Clippers. Let's not let history repeat itself, again. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Paula Madison, former WNBA owner, outraged by comments linked to Donald Sterling .

"(CNN) -- Bernie Ecclestone had called it ""unacceptable,"" while Ferrari's president chimed in on the lack of engine noise and apparent ""taxi driving"" enforced by fuel restrictions -- but Formula One delivered what its fans most want on Sunday. Pure racing. The exhilarating sight -- if not sound -- of drivers overtaking and pushing the limits. While, like last season, there is clearly one dominant team -- this time Mercedes -- the introduction of new design rules and the smaller, yet seemingly more powerful turbo engines has added an element that had been lacking when Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull dominated so comprehensively in 2013. ""I strongly dislike coming second to Lewis, but on the other hand that was the most exciting race I've ever had in my career,"" Mercedes' championship leader Nico Rosberg said after being beaten into second place in Bahrain by Englishman Hamilton. ""Today was a great day for the sport, and hopefully you had a lot of fun watching on television."" Hamilton triumphed by just over three seconds, having overtaken pole-sitting teammate Rosberg at the start but then being hauled back by the safety car following a collision between Lotus' Pastor Maldonado and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez. The Mexican escaped unscathed despite his car's spectacular somersault. ""It was exciting. Nico drove fantastically well, very fair, and it was hard to keep him behind at the end,"" said 2008 world champion Hamilton, who moved up to equal 10th on the all-time victories list with the 24th checkered flag of his career. ""I was on a knife edge the whole time. It was a relief when I crossed the line."" The childhood friends and rivals have dominated this season, winning all three races and claiming all three pole positions -- Rosberg now has an 11-point advantage at the top, with Nico Hulkenberg a further 22 back from Hamilton in third. It has been a big turnaround for Mercedes, which finished second in last year's constructors' standings -- a massive 236 points behind Red Bull. But the German manufacturer has adapted best to the new rules -- reflected in the Mercedes-powered Force India claiming a surprise podium placing at Sakhir as Hulkenberg's teammate Sergio Perez came in third, some 23 seconds behind Rosberg. Red Bull, struggling this season with its Renault engines, did manage fourth place as Daniel Ricciardo upstaged Vettel by overcoming the 10-place penalty that put him 13th on the start grid. Hulkenberg was fifth in a notable double for Force India, ahead of his fellow German and four-time world champion Vettel -- winner of the past two races in Bahrain. Mercedes-powered Williams took seventh and eighth through Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas respectively. Massa's former Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso came home in a disappointing ninth, disconsolately punching the air in irony as he crossed the line ahead of new colleague Kimi Raikkonen. McLaren, also powered by Mercedes, had a disappointing outing as 2009 world champion Jenson Button retired two laps from the end in his 250th race while rookie Kevin Magnussen -- second in the season opener and ninth in Malaysia -- quit after 40 of the 57 laps. Maldonado was given a five-place penalty for the next race in China and three points against his Super Licence after hitting Gutierrez on lap 41. Marussia's Jules Bianchi was given two penalty points -- a total of 12 means a one-race ban -- for ending the race of Gutierrez's Sauber teammate Adrian Sutil, who has a five-place penalty for China after an infringement in Saturday's qualifying. The F1 caravan will head to Shanghai in two weeks with the sport's chief executive Ecclestone demanding changes after criticisms over the perceived lack of atmosphere at races. ""People buying tickets are expecting to see what Formula One used to be, and as I've mentioned before, I've had letters from promoters,"" the 83-year-old told reporters in the paddock before the Bahrain race, which was celebrating its 10th anniversary. ""They're all worried if they lose spectators then they are going to be in trouble. ""What is important is that the teams know the problem, the engine manufacturers know the problem, and they're trying to sort it."" Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo also voiced his concerns. ""I don't want to think of the decline of Formula One, and if we look at it today, we have a race that is no longer Formula One,"" the Italian said before the GP. ""We have to give back to Formula One its characteristics. We cannot have an economy formula. It has to be extreme, with racing from the first lap to the last. ""Formula One is also about the engine music -- not noise -- and we also have to make sure it is not too complicated with regard to the rules."" However, the head of motorsport's governing body said the 2014 changes had been necessary due to ""environment legislation"" which was restricting the use of circuits for F1, and said teams had to adapt to the new challenges. ""If you ask Hamilton and Rosberg if they are driving like taxi drivers ... if you have an efficient car you don't have any problem,"" said FIA president Jean Todt, formerly team boss at Ferrari when Michael Schumacher was the dominant force of F1. ""It seems Mercedes is stronger. I don't have the power to say 'Let's slow them down.' If they are quicker than the others I think it is a challenge for the other teams to catch them. ""It is completely unfair to punish a team who has been doing a better job.""","Nico Rosberg retains F1 championship lead after finishing second in Bahrain .

"(CNN) -- Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt made headlines after snapping a selfie of herself nestled in between UK Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama at Mandela's memorial service on Tuesday. The ""selfie"" went viral online almost immediately. But you could be forgiven for not knowing who this blonde beauty taking a photo with a smartphone of herself with two political power houses is, unless you are Danish, like myself, or up to date on your current affairs. Many newspapers are calling into question whether it was appropriate for ""Gucci Helle,"" as she is called by many Danes for her sense of style, to take a ""selfie"" during Tuesday's memorial service. The Times wrote that Obama tested the limits of ""funeral etiquette"" (despite the memorial not being a funeral) with the self-portrait. Although they may have been acting less than gracefully at the moment the snap was taken, they did seem to be enjoying each other's company and Thorning-Schmidt just couldn't resist the urge to document the moment for herself. She may after all never have the opportunity again. Many Danes seem not to have taken the whole thing as seriously as some of the newspapers in Britain. As fellow Scandinavian Yerco Sanchez put it when reacting to the photo: ""More Scandi style in politics would do the world a lot of good."" Some Danes are bemused by the global reaction to the selfie -- as it hasn't hit their front pages yet -- perhaps reflecting a more laid-back approach in general, as was displayed by their PM in Johannesburg. The general consensus seems to be among Danes that the leaders were serious when they needed to be, and the brief moment of levity was unrepresentative of their behavior throughout the whole ceremony. Danish media has commented on the attention the selfie has drawn in the British media, where its appropriateness has been questioned. The Danes after all are known for being down to earth and their country is one of the most equal societies in the world. And it seems that Thorning-Schmidt was far from being intimidated by the power couple she was seated between, and seemed to be enjoying their company: Maybe doing her bit for transatlantic relations? Those people shocked at politicians having fun in a situation like a memorial should remember the leaders were not the only ones taking selfies at the memorial. And some have even said that it shows a human side to our leaders, who after all are not robots. This was not the Danish leader's first meeting with the U.S. president: Obama welcomed Thorning-Schmidt to the White House in February 2012 and she met him again in Stockholm while Obama was on a trip there. At the time of her visit to Washington she had only been prime minister for four months; the first woman to hold the post. So who says you can't have it all? Thorning-Schmidt certainly seems to: Beauty, brains, family, power and she seems to be enjoying it at the same time. Thorning-Schmidt is married to Briton Stephen Kinnock, son of the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. The couple met while she was studying at the European College in Bruges. They wed in 2006 and have two daughters together. They were investigated in 2010 over allegations of tax avoidance, but were both later cleared. No one has yet seen a copy of the ""selfie"" taken by the PM. Maybe it was sent to Snapchat -- a photo-messaging app in which photos self-destruct after a certain period -- or maybe it's one for her personal album. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Antonia Mortensen.","Danish PM makes headlines after snapping selfie at Mandela memorial .

"Antrim, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A judge Friday granted police in Northern Ireland permission to hold and question Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for another two days, authorities said. Adams surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday evening in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army. Under UK law, the police would have had to release him from Antrim police station Friday evening if a court hadn't granted the extension. Adams has long denied having any role in the death of Jean McConville, a widow who was reportedly killed by the IRA because the group believed she was a spy for the British army. His arrest threatens the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, a peace Adams is in part credited with bringing about after decades of sectarian tensions. Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness said Thursday in Belfast that Adams' arrest was unnecessary, unjustified and politically motivated. He said that he had seen the ""dark side"" of Northern Ireland policing ""flex its muscles in the course of the past couple of days"" and that the arrest was a ""'deliberate attempt to influence the elections that are due to take place in three weeks' time."" McGuinness said he was confident that Adams would be able to rejoin election campaigning shortly and would ""continue to lead our party in a very positive way."" The head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland insisted that the police would ""conduct a thorough and professional investigation into the murder of Jean McConville,"" according to a statement from the force Thursday. ""This will be subject to the full rigors of scrutiny provided in the criminal justice system,"" the statement said. McConville's family welcomed news of Adams' arrest. Her daughter, Helen McKendry, said, ""I can only do like everyone else in my case and hope that he will be brought to a court of law and be charged with my mother's murder, so my family can get truth and justice for my mother."" In a statement released shortly before Adams surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday, the 65-year-old vehemently denied any involvement in the killing. ""I believe that the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice,"" Adams said in the statement posted on his party website. ""Malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these."" The questioning of Adams was not unexpected. Adams said he told authorities last month that he was willing to meet with investigators. ""While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs. McConville,"" Adams said. Long associated with the IRA, once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein, Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. Today, Sinn Fein is Ireland's second-largest opposition party. A number of other people have been arrested and questioned in connection with the investigation into McConville's abduction and killing. One man has been charged with aiding and abetting the crime. He denies wrongdoing. The IRA admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as ""The Disappeared,"" those who vanished during the so-called Troubles, a 30-year conflict between Protestant loyalists who wanted to stay part of the United Kingdom and and Catholic nationalists who wanted to see the north united with Ireland. Among the victims was McConville, 37, whose remains were found partially buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003. She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.

Equally unfortunate is that no continental African country made it onto our 2014 list; Ghana was removed because of its declining human rights record this year."" Choosing the top 10 . Ethical Traveler's research focuses on three categories: environmental protection, social welfare and human rights. ""For each of these categories we look at information past and present so that we understand not only the current state of a country, but how it has changed over time,"" says Ethical Traveler. ""This helps us select nations that are actively improving the state of their people, government and environment."" Information sources include Freedom House, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Reporters Without Borders, UNICEF, GLBT resources and the World Bank. ""After identifying about two dozen 'short list' performers, we turn to detailed case research, focusing on actions these governments have taken over the year to improve (or in some cases, weaken) practices and circumstances in the countries,"" says the report. The list has to have something to offer tourists. Each ""best ethical destination"" offers opportunities to check out incredible natural beauty and interactions with local people and cultures in a meaningful, mutually enriching way, says Ethical Traveler. Researchers stressed that just because these destinations made the list, none scored perfect marks. ""This year, the most prevalent bottleneck issues were the treatment of indigenous populations and of gay citizens,"" says the report. ""In particular, Chile and Dominica need to increase their efforts to respect the rights of their indigenous citizens."" Criticisms include outdated laws criminalizing homosexuality, which are on the books in some of this year's countries, including Barbados, Dominica and Mauritius. ""However, anti-homosexual laws are laxly enforced in these countries,"" says Ethical Traveler. ""In Dominica, rights groups feel encouraged that the country has started a dialogue on this issue and, while homosexuality is still illegal in Mauritius, recent steps point to positive change.

"London (CNN) -- Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe, the Kentucky Derby, the Melbourne Cup ... the leading horse-racing nations of the world all have a showpiece event that makes aficionados and casual observers alike stop in their tracks for 10 short minutes as a nation collectively bates its breath over the winner. But few sporting venues can match the rich history and heritage of Britain's Royal Ascot. The English racecourse celebrates its tri-centenary this year -- it was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne -- with its 300 years of pageantry, fashion and traditions firmly intact. As well as being one of the most important elite race meetings in the world, this week's Royal Ascot is the jewel in the crown of the English ""summer season"" -- a whirl of society events in the warmest months of the year that includes the likes of rowing's Henley Royal Regatta and the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. ""To our mind, since the middle of the 19th century Royal Ascot has always been the pinnacle of the whole season,"" explains Charles Barnett, chief executive of Ascot Racecourse. ""People like to come out, see their friends, dress up and enjoy a great day at the races."" King Edward VI famously described the races as ""a garden party with racing tacked on."" In fact, many of the classical social occasions that make up the English season are, first and foremost, world-class sporting events. The English season traces its origins back to the 17th century, although its heyday arguably came in the Victorian era. Originally devised to keep everyone entertained while Parliament was still sitting, the season has not only survived into the 21st century, but the events that make up the season are, for the most part, more popular than ever. Purists cite the duration of the season as running from Easter to August 12, when grouse shooting begins. But it is with Royal Ascot, a perennial favorite of the current Queen Elizabeth II, that the season seems properly to get underway each year. Ascot occupies a distinctive place in British popular culture: it's no coincidence that Audrey Hepburn's character in the film ""My Fair Lady"" was unveiled as a fully paid-up member of the upper classes at Royal Ascot. The mystique lies in its long association with Britain's royal family. Nestled in the English countryside just six miles from Windsor Castle, on land still owned by the Crown Estate, successive generations of royal patronage have endowed Ascot with many of its unique traditions. Not least of which is the Queen's arrival each day by horse-drawn carriage. ""Because it's effectively an event which is royal, the royal family arrives by carriage,"" Barnett says. ""The Queen says 'hello' to a few people then she goes up into her private box, where she watches racing all day. ""Sometimes she'll come down and see horses in the parade ring, some days she'll present prizes, and if she's got a runner she'll go down to the pre-parade ring to see them saddled."" Queen Elizabeth has a well-documented interest in all things equestrian, and has been attending Royal Ascot since before her reign began in 1952. ""The industry's tremendously pleased that we have a monarch who's so keen,"" Barnett says. ""She's probably been coming to Royal Ascot more than anybody else!"" Known for her love of racing, the Queen has enjoyed more than 20 winners at the Berkshire course's blue riband event -- a streak that began with her first victory in the Royal Hunt Cup with Choir Boy in 1952. The real spectacle of Royal Ascot, however, is arguably the fashion -- in particular the hats. The wearing of hats is another tradition that traces its origins to the royals: it was not considered respectful to have one's head uncovered in the presence of the monarch. The Queen is often at the center of feverish speculation as to what color and style of hat she will wear on a given day. On Ladies' Day, the hats often range from the exquisite to the eccentric. As one of the few remaining social occasions that requires ladies to wear hats, in recent years fashionistas have raised the bar with sculptural designs that are works of art in their own right. As the celebrated course celebrates the busiest week of its 300-year history, Barnett knows the eyes of the world will be on Ascot from June 14-18. ""It's this fantastic pageant: amazing carriages, wonderful colors, the best thoroughbred horses flashing past, an opportunity for people to dress up in top hat and tails and lovely hats. To me, it is just the best race meeting in the world.""","Britain's most glamorous horse-racing event celebrates its tri-centenary this week .

"(CNN) -- Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI will attend the Mass of canonization of John Paul II and John XXIII, the Holy See confirmed Saturday, according to Vatican Radio. Benedict XVI, who will be attending at the invitation of Pope Francis, will not be at the altar, but will figure among the cardinals and bishops. It won't be the first time Benedict has made a public appearance since taking the almost unprecedented step of resigning the papacy. He was also present for a ceremony in February in which Francis created 19 new cardinals. Since a new pope usually takes the reins only following the death of his predecessor, seeing both him and Francis together remains a highly unusual event. The two canonization candidates share an improbable path to sainthood: they both rose from very humble beginnings to lead the Roman Catholic Church. John XXIII (1881-1963) -- known as Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli before he became Pope -- was one of 13 children born into a family of Italian peasants, farmers from a tiny village in the country's north, before being sent away to study for the priesthood at age 11. John Paul II (1920-2005), born Karol Jozef Wojtyla, was brought up in a grimy industrial town in Poland and raised by his soldier father after his mother died when he was just 8-years-old. He spent his formative years living under first Nazis, then Communists. His beatification is the quickest in modern times, made possible because Benedict -- who succeeded John Paul in 2005 -- waived the normal five-year waiting period after death to get someone's beatification rolling. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said as many as 150 cardinals and 1,000 bishops would attend the canonization ceremony, as well as 24 heads of state, Vatican Radio reported. The ceremony is also expected to draw upward of a million pilgrims, who will gather in St. Peter's Square to witness the two former popes enter the celestial community of Catholic saints. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, John L. Allen, Jr. and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.","Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI will attend the canonization of John Paul II and John XXIII .

"(CNN) -- A Catholic priest, a rabbi, an evangelical minister, a Sikh, a Greek Orthodox archbishop and two Mormon leaders walk into the Republican National Convention. It sounds like the beginning of a joke. But the Republican Party's decision to invite representatives from all of these faiths to speak at this week's convention, but to exclude a Muslim-American imam, is anything but funny. The Republican Party has a problem with Muslims. Of course, American Muslims can take some solace in the fact that we are not the only minority group that the Republican Party hardly welcomes. Let's be honest, if you don't like Muslims, blacks, gays, immigrants or other minorities, which political party would make you feel most comfortable? Sure, some Republican officials are minorities, but a recent Galllup survey found that 89% of the Republican Party is white. To be clear, I don't believe that most rank-and-file members of the Republican Party hate Muslims. The problem is that certain Republican leaders have stoked the flames of hate toward American Muslims, and other minorities, as a political tool to motivate people to support their cause. For example, recently Rep. Michele Bachmann -- along with four other Republican House members -- asserted that the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated the U.S. government. Bachmann, who is in a tough re-election battle in her redrawn congressional district, even ""named names"" by claiming that Secretary Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, and Rep. Keith Ellison were connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. Although Republican Sen. John McCain publicly denounced Bachmann's baseless allegations, just a few weeks later, Republican Rep. Joe Walsh escalated the fear-mongering. Walsh, who is in a tight race with Democratic opponent Tammy Duckworth, told constituents at a town hall meeting in the Chicago suburbs that there are radical Muslims living among them who are plotting to kill them: ""One thing I'm sure of is that there are people in this country -- there is a radical strain of Islam in this country -- it's not just over there -- trying to kill Americans every week."" Walsh even claimed that this Muslim radical was in his district: ""It's in Elk Grove. It's in Addison. It's in Elgin. It's here."" And let's not forget that during this year's Republican presidential primaries, Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain told voters that American Muslims want to impose Islamic law in America. It's a truly astounding task when you consider that this would require the 2.6 million Muslims in the U.S. to overpower the other 300 million Americans and implement an Islamic legal system. Obviously, this assertion is not based on facts, but to politicians desperate for votes, facts don't matter. This type of rhetoric has yielded two distinct consequences. First, it can be seen in the attitudes of Republicans who have been poisoned by the anti-Muslim voices in their party. A recent poll found that 62% of Obama voters view American Muslims favorably, but only 34% of Romney voters shared that positive outlook. Even more alarming is that fear-mongering by politicians can create an environment that inspires violence against the people being demonized. It sends a message that these people are ""others"" and not truly Americans like the rest of us. For example, within a few weeks of Bachmann's comments, a suspicious fire destroyed a mosque in Missouri. And days after Walsh's warnings that Muslim terrorists were living in the Chicago suburbs, a homemade acid bomb was thrown at an Islamic school, pellet gunshots were fired at a mosque, and Muslim headstones at a cemetery were defaced with anti-Muslim graffiti, all in the Chicago area. It's impossible to know whether these hateful acts were related to the remarks, but the climate created by fear-mongering does not encourage tolerance. Getting back to this week's Republican Convention: The Republican Party should be applauded for including so many faiths, especially the Sikhs, who number about 200,000 Americans and whose community was targeted by a hate-filled gunman who killed six people in a place of worship. But excluding Muslims sends a message that American Muslims are not part of the fabric of this country. That is wrong. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus still has time to correct this mistake. He could invite a Muslim-American imam to be a part of this week's convention. That would send a clear message that the Republican Party is truly welcoming of all major religions practiced in the U.S. It also would send a message that there is no place for hate in the GOP against any American minority group. It's now up to Preibus to show whether the Republican Party stands for inclusiveness or division. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Leaders of many faiths to speak at RNC, except, glaringly, an imam .

"(CNN) -- The Sudan government is targeting a border region with airstrikes -- forcing residents to live in caves and under the bushes to avoid the ""indiscriminate"" bombardments, according to international rights groups. At least 26 people have died and dozens wounded in the airstrikes in the Nuba Mountain areas of South Kordofan state, rights groups said. The attacks started in June, and have forced more than 150,000 people to flee their homes, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday. ""Displaced communities forced out of their homes by the repeated bombing live in harsh conditions in caves, on mountaintops, under trees, and in the bush far from towns."" Displaced families told researchers from the rights groups they were eating berries and leaves to survive, Amnesty said. The researchers, who were on the ground, witnessed some of the attacks, according to rights groups. ""Antonov aircraft dropped bombs over farmlands and villages on a near-daily basis while researchers were on the ground from August 14-21,"" Amnesty said. Aid groups, including the United Nations, have warned that the state is at risk of high levels of malnutrition and mortality because the government has restricted access to the area. The reports come a week after a U.S. satellite project said it has found evidence of additional mass graves in the state capital of Kadugli . That same week, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir called for a unilateral cease-fire in the state. The Satellite Sentinel Project said it has evidence of a total of eight mass graves in the area since June, citing witness accounts and images of what it says are body bags. Al-Bashir rejected the findings of mass graves as propaganda from the west and called for a two-week, unilateral cease-fire in the state, saying the government would assess the situation after that period. Government officials were not immediately available for comment on the new report Wednesday. In the past, the government has said rebels are to blame for the violence in the region, and has been engaged in a fierce campaign to battle what it says are militia in the area. Nuba fighters helped South Sudan during the civil war with Sudan, which raged for decades and left millions dead. South Sudan became an independent nation in July. South Kordofan remains a territory of the Sudanese government in the north, but borders South Sudan.","Rights groups: At least 26 people have died in the airstrikes in the South Kordofan state .

"(Budget Travel) -- If you're planning a cruise in 2012, chances are high that you'll be traveling to the Caribbean. According to CruiseCompete.com's annual report, nine of the ten most popular cruise ports in the world are in the Caribbean (or close enough to count). The website's list, which is compiled from cruise quotes requested by potential customers, shows that Alaska is also a perennial favorite for cruisers. Several Inside Passage ports made the cut, with Juneau coming out as the most requested cruise stop in the 50 states. With so many people wanting to go to the same places, you might worry about crowds -- but you don't need to. It turns out that even the hottest port has a few places where you can get off the beaten path. Here are some recommendations that will make you feel like you're in the know, before you get off the ship. Budget Travel gallery: See the cruise ports . #1 Nassau, Bahamas . Just 180 miles from Miami, the Bahamas are usually the first or last stop on an eastern Caribbean cruise (even though the archipelago is technically in the Atlantic). People love the islands -- there are approximately 700 in all -- for first-class snorkeling, casinos and fine dining, and it's top four ports are Nassau, Princess Cays, Great Stirrup Cay and Half Moon Cay, it's the most requested country in the world for cruising, according to CruiseCompete. Two of them made the list for the top ten most visited ports in 2011, including the capital, Nassau, which is a major shopping center. Secret: If you'd rather mingle with locals than join the crowd heading to Senor Frog's, take the Number 10 Jitney to Arawak Cay, where you'll find several stands serving up fried seafood. Go to Goldie's, and order a cold Kalik beer with some conch fritters; if you go to the back porch, sometimes you'll see workers pulling up the conch from the water. #2 Cozumel, Mexico . Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula continues to draw sun seekers who want some culture with their cruise, particularly this year when the Mayan calendar predicts the end of days. But there's plenty of room for fun, too. Cozumel, an island off the coast, offers countless snorkeling and water-based activities, as well as gorgeous beaches: Corona ads are often shot here. Secret: Can you stand the heat? If so, the Mayan Steam Lodge/Temazcal experience -- a spiritual sauna-like ceremony that includes native rituals -- may be for you. Afterward, you'll jump into the property's freshwater cenote (underground spring) to cool off (there are also showers, if you'd prefer to rinse off there). The four-hour excursion costs $80 per person, and includes transportation to and from the ship. Budget Travel: 10 most beautiful churches . #3 Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands . If you're on an eastern Caribbean cruise, you'll probably stop in St. Thomas, as it's one of the world's busiest cruise ports. A Mecca for duty-free shopping, the Charlotte Amalie port has plenty of jewelry, perfume, and electronics stores; check prices at a few shops before you buy to ensure the best deal. St. Thomas can also be a good place to unwind on a beach or provide a good jumping-off point for exploring the nearby island St. John, which is quieter and less developed. Secret: While everyone else on your ship heads for the famed Magens Bay beach, pick up some groceries at Crown Bay Marina for a picnic lunch and catch a ferry to Water Island, sometimes considered the fourth Virgin Island. Not only is the sea at the island's palm-lined Honeymoon Beach calm, the cove is quiet -- you won't find the shops or tour operators here that you see on other St. Thomas beaches. #4 Philipsburg, St. Maarten / St. Martin . One island, two cultures: With portions settled by the French and the Dutch, the island is one of the smallest to be governed by two countries (don't worry, though, almost everyone speaks English). Philipsburg, on the Dutch side, rivals St. Thomas for duty-free shopping, while the towns of Marigot and Grand Case on the French side are filled withÂ  fine and casual restaurants with French flair where you can find dishes like escargot (snails) or bouillabaisse (fish soup). Secret: If you don't want to join the crowds breathing jet fumes at Maho Beach, take a short cab ride to French Cul-de-Sac, where you can catch a ferry to Pinel Island (regular service starts around 9 a.m.). The uninhabited island off St. Martin has several restaurants where you can rent beach chairs, have drinks and go snorkeling; there's a designated snorkel trail in a protected marine reserve on the island's south side, where you can spot sea fans, urchins, turtle and rays among the coral. Budget Travel: 15 things you didn't know about New Orleans . #5 Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands . Known for offshore banking, the Cayman Islands have a natural side beyond the shops of George Town. Grand Cayman is one of the few places where you can see the world's most endangered iguana, the blue iguana, and thousands of tourists converge on Stingray City to watch the sea animals. Seven Mile Beach offers an uninterrupted view of the Caribbean that seems like a postcard come to life. Secret: If you like Jimmy Buffet music, catch the Grand Cayman's resident beach bum, the Barefoot Man (in real life, George Nowak). He plays most Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Reef Resort on the island's East End. If you don't have time to catch a show, pick up a CD for $16 in one of the souvenir shops in George Town. #6 San Juan, Puerto Rico . It's hard to escape history in Puerto Rico; its capital, San Juan, dates back to the 16th century. The immense San Felipe del Morro fortress anchors Old San Juan and Ponce de Leon, the island's first governor, is buried at the Cathedral of San Juan. If you venture off into the countryside, you'll find beaches, rain forests and a bioluminescent bay where you can kayak. Secret: Puerto Rico's cuisine is infused with unique Latin flavors that you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in the Caribbean. Why not spend a few hours learning how to duplicate the recipes at home? Flavors of San Juan teaches you how to make either tapas or Puerto Rican food in two-hour group classes that include a full meal and a recipe book that you can bring home. SanJuanfoodtours.com, advanced reservations required, $98 per person for a 2-hour group class . Budget Travel: 5 Caribbean Islands to discover now . #7 Grand Turk, Turks & Caicos . Although technically in the Atlantic Ocean instead of the Caribbean, the island chain of Turks & Caicos has the glorious, talcum-powder-soft sand beaches and turquoise skies that make the region famous. While luxury vacationers flock to Providenciales and celebrities such as Bruce Willis, Christie Brinkley, and Keith Richards have homes on Parrot Cay, Grand Turk has become the country's main cruising center, with a large terminal and new shops. Secret: If you love stamps (or love someone who does), make a stop at the Philatelic Bureau, located on Church Folly street. The island is known for its colorful and unusual issues, which are prized by collectors. #8 Juneau, Alaska . An Inside Passage cruise appears on many bucket lists, and no wonder. The state's scenery, particularly its magnificent glacier- and wildlife-viewing opportunities, are unparalleled. Surrounded by mountains and the sea, Juneau, the state's capital, is accessible only by water or air. Nature is all around you: Look for bears fishing in the streams near Mendenhall Glacier, and eagles nesting on the slopes of Mount Roberts. Secret: Once you get out of downtown, cruise ship crowds disappear, or at least it feels that way; Alaska's vastness has a way of making people seem insignificant. With hiking trails and a stone labyrinth garden, the Shrine of St. Therese, on a peninsula about a 20-minute drive from Juneau (take a taxi), is a reflective place to commune with nature. Visitors often spot seals, whales, and otters nearby. Budget Travel: 40 unbelievable underwater snapshots . #9 Roatan, Honduras . The Bay Islands, which lie about an hour north of the Honduras mainland, have become a major attraction for cruise ships, which come for the area's colorful fish and clear, warm waters. Roatan has become the center of commercial development for the islands, and you'll find countless opportunities for snorkeling, diving, and interacting with marine life such as grouper, moray eels, turtles, and rays. Secret: Give your tastebuds a charge with a jam and jelly tasting at Marble Hill Farms on the East End of the island. Sample flavors include hibiscus jelly, mutton pepper jelly (made with chili cabro, this one has quite a kick) and island plum jelly made from fruit grown on the property. You'll need to take a taxi to get to The Farm; once you're there, have spiny lobster for lunch at their restaurant, the Crow's Nest. #10 Princess Cays, Bahamas . Eleuthera, one of the Out Islands is the other Bahamas port that made the top ten. Here, you can swim and sunbathe at private beaches and resorts without safety concerns (the U.S. State Department does warn about the possibility of muggings and other crime occurring on New Providence Island, where Nassau is located). Secret: Located on the island of Eleuthera, the private beach resort owned by Princess gives you a glimpse of how laid back life on the Out Islands can be. Most people spend their time on Princess Cays either on the beach or in the water (head to the sand early to corner a lounge chair and bring your snorkel gear to get up close and personal with the colorful corals, fish, and sponges that blanket the ocean floor). If you want to do some exploring, there's a small local cemetery that contains the graves of some of the island's early 1900's residents. The cemetery is walking distance from the beach -- just make sure you wear bug spray and solid shoes for the mile-long trek. Budget Travel: To go or not to go: 11 places with a bad rap .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Police were searching Tuesday for a gun used in the fatal shooting of a top regional politician, killed in a brazen attack in broad daylight that has shaken Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy went to the northern city of Leon to attend the funeral of the politician, Isabel Carrasco, 59, who had held various regional posts in Rajoy's ruling conservative Popular Party. Officials say two women, a mother, 55, and her daughter, 35, were arrested soon after the shooting Monday in Leon, and the suspected motive is revenge. The daughter was let go in 2011 from a provincial government office headed by the slain politician, and she recently had pay disputes with the office while working as an outside contractor, officials said. In addition, the two suspects are the wife and daughter of a senior national police officer in the small nearby city of Astorga. He told investigators that he was in possession of his police-issued firearm, and it was not thought to have been used in the shooting, officials said. Carrasco was walking on a pedestrian footbridge around 5 p.m. local time when shot. She collapsed and died at the scene. Other people were in the area, including a retired national police officer, who helped lead police quickly to the suspects, who had fled, and by some accounts, threw the gun into the river below. The search for the gun includes the river and other areas, officials said. Tests on the hands of the two suspects have not revealed who may have fired the weapon. Officials did not immediately say what caliber or type it was. Carrasco was walking to the Popular Party's provincial headquarters and was due to attend a campaign rally that day for the European Union parliamentary elections on May 25. Campaigning across Spain for that election was suspended Monday and the only face-to-face debate between the conservative and opposition Socialist Party candidates was postponed from its scheduled time on Tuesday evening. Firearms are difficult to obtain legally in Spain, and fatal shootings are uncommon. In the northwest town of Vilagarcia de Arousa, a Socialist councilman was forced to resign late Monday after posting a comment to her Facebook page regarding the death of Carrasco that was widely deemed inappropriate, a town spokeswoman said.","Popular Party politician Isabel Carrasco, 59, was shot and killed Monday in Leon .

"London (CNN) -- A Turkish government ban on Twitter has provoked widespread fury in Turkey, and condemnation around the world, with the country's own president taking to the social media website to condemn Ankara's actions. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who blames social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric, threatened to ""eradicate"" Twitter at a campaign rally in the city of Bursa on Thursday. Within hours Turkish Internet users were reporting widespread disruptions to the service, and hashtags including #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #DictatorErdogan were trending worldwide. Freedom of expression campaign group Index on Censorship said the ban, which it called ""censorship of which the worst authoritarian regimes would be proud"" was ""emblematic of the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan."" Millions of Twitter users from across Turkey quickly found ways to circumvent the blockade -- with help from Twitter itself -- and voice their anger and frustration at the government's move. Others posted satirical pictures and cartoons. Twitter ban batters Turkey's image, but does Erdogan care? Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul, defied the ban to send out a series of messages questioning the government's actions. ""One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,"" he posted. ""It is not possible technically to completely block access to platforms like Twitter... I hope this implementation does not last long."" But Turkey analyst Fadi Hakura, from international think-tank Chatham House, said the President's tweets should be taken with a pinch of salt. ""The President has very little credibility on this issue, since he approved the law which allowed this ban to happen; it seems he and the Prime Minister are playing a good cop/bad cop routine."" Hakura said Twitter had been targeted as a way of blocking the public's access to information amid a government corruption scandal and in the run-up to key local elections at the end of March. ""The government of Prime Minister Erdogan has restricted the flow of information through traditional media -- newspapers and television news -- and so the Internet has become the last preserve of freedom of information in Turkey,"" he told CNN. ""When you restrict the traditional media, people will resort to alternatives."" Hakura said social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube had also proved extremely effective in mobilizing the opposition and in facilitating protests in Turkey in the past 18 months. Stefan Fule, the European Union's commissioner for enlargement, said the ban ""raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards."" ""Freedom of expression, a fundamental right in any democratic society, includes the right to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority,"" he said in a statement. ""Citizens must be free to communicate and choose freely the means to do it. This obviously includes access to the internet."" A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office also suggested that blocking access to Twitter may harm Turkey's long-held hope of becoming a member of the EU. Twitter ban is the least of Turkey's woes . ""Social media has a vital role to play in a modern democracy, and helps to promote transparency and vibrant public debate,"" he said in a statement. ""We have long supported Turkey's accession to the EU. As a candidate country, it is important for Turkey to promote the EU's core values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law."" But even before the ban came into effect, Erdogan had insisted he did not care what the international community had to say about it, and Hakura said the criticism was unlikely to change his stand against social media. ""Europe's influence on Turkey is tied to the hope of accession to the EU, and since there is a stalemate on that, Europe has lost its influence,"" he explained. Instead, he said, Erdogan's priorities lay closer to home. ""The Prime Minister's top priority is to win the elections, and to stamp his authority on Turkish politics, rather than to react to the views of European leaders."" Professor Ilter Turan, from the political science department at Bilgi University in Istanbul said that while this month's votes are, in theory, local elections, in practice they may act as something of a referendum on Erdogan's rule, ahead of presidential elections later in the year. ""Depending on what happens in these elections, probably the PM will decide to run or not to run for president,"" Turan said. ""There is a general feeling that maybe conditions have already worked against him, that maybe his candidacy is not particularly powerful, but that decision is not yet final."" Hakura said that although the core of Erdogan's conservative, religious supporters were unlikely to care about the Twitter ban, it may yet come to damage the Prime Minister, politically. ""Turks who oppose the government will oppose the ban, but it is the bread-and-butter issue of the economy that concerns his supporters,"" he said. ""The economy is what underpins Erdogan's popularity, and the Twitter ban could come back to bite him if his capricious misuse of this law scares off foreign investors and undermines confidence in the Turkish economy."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Ivan Watson and Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report.","Turkish users of Twitter report disruption prompting #TwitterisblockedinTurkey to trend .

"(CNN) -- ""War! What is it good for?"" sings Edwin Starr in his 1970 song, before giving an unambiguous answer: ""absolutely nothing."" History, archaeology, and anthropology, however, suggest that the story is not so simple. In the Stone Age, humans were a rough lot. When people 10,000 years ago disagreed, they usually solved their arguments without violence; but when they did decide to use force, they faced far fewer constraints than the citizens of functioning modern states. Violence was normally on a small scale, in homicides, vendettas, and raids, but because populations were also tiny, the steady drip of killing took an appalling toll. By many estimates, 10 to 20% of Stone Age humans died at other people's hands. If we fast-forward to the 20th century, we see a stunning contrast. The century suffered world wars, genocides, and nuclear attacks, not to mention civil strife, riots, and murders. Altogether, we killed a staggering 100-200 million of our own kind. But between 1900 and 2000, roughly 10 billion lives were lived -- meaning that just 1-2% of the world's population died violently. So if you were lucky enough to be born in the 20th century, your risk of dying violently was just one-tenth of that in the Stone Age; and since 2000, the United Nations tells us, the risk of violent death has fallen even further, to 0.7%. These are astonishing statistics, but the explanation is more astonishing still. In perhaps the greatest paradox in history, what made the world safer was war itself. What happened, it seems, is that starting about 10,000 years ago, the winners of wars began incorporating the losers into larger societies. The victors then found that the only way to make these larger societies work was by developing stronger governments; and one of the first things these governments had to do, if they wanted to stay in power, was suppress violence among their subjects. The men who ran these governments cracked down on killing not because they were saints, but because well-behaved subjects were easier to govern and tax than angry, murderous ones. States that suppressed violence within their borders tended to grow; those that did not, tended to fail. War is surely the worst possible way to create larger, more peaceful societies, but the depressing truth is that it seems to be pretty much the only way people have found. If Rome could have been built without killing millions of Gauls and Greeks, or the USA without killing millions of Native Americans -- in these and countless other cases, if conflicts could have been resolved by reason instead of force, the world would have reaped the benefits without paying such costs. But that did not happen. The reality is that people hardly ever give up their freedoms, including their freedom to kill and impoverish each other, unless forced to do so, and virtually the only force strong enough to scare people straight has been strong government. Back in the 1600s the philosopher Thomas Hobbes nicknamed this ""Leviathan,"" after the terrifying monster of the Old Testament. The process of making Leviathan was not pretty. Whether it was the Romans in Britain or the British in India, pacification could be just as bloody as the savagery it stamped out. Nor were all governments equally good Leviathans. Democracies, whatever their other faults, tend to value life more than dictatorships. Nor did Leviathan always work the same way. In ancient times, the only way to run large, peaceful societies was by incorporating the conquered into empires, but in the last 200 years, the greatest powers -- Britain in the 1800s, the U.S. since the late 1900s -- have worked best by leaving other countries formally independent while incorporating them into globalized economies. Nor, finally, was the making of Leviathan smooth. Some wars killed people without creating bigger, safer societies; some even broke such societies down. But across 10,000 years, enough wars did create these bigger, better-governed groups that rates of violent death fell by 90%. The 21st-century world does not have a global government enforcing peace, and far from producing such a government, another great-power war could potentially destroy humanity altogether. The world does, however, have a single great power -- the United States -- capable of acting as a globocop, deterring other governments from using force. The United Nations, European Union, the peace movement, and soft power generally have all done much to make the world a safer place since 1945, but the lesson of history is clear. At the end of the day, in answer to the song's question -- what has war been good for? -- is that war created Leviathan, and Leviathan made the world safer. Like it or not, the ultimate guarantee of peace is the order the United States has created.","Since 2000, U.N. says the risk of violent death has fallen to 0.7% .

"(CNN) -- Six Americans imprisoned in Honduras for nearly a month, accused of trying to smuggle weapons into the country, will have a new hearing to determine their fate, the ship's captain said. Robert Mayne and his crew were arrested on May 5 after Honduran authorities boarded their ship and discovered a couple of handguns, two shotguns and a semiautomatic rifle. Mayne said the weapons are for his crew's protection against would-be pirates on the high seas. He said judicial officials in rural eastern Honduras, where their ship entered the country, disagree. The case is being transferred to an appellate court, Mayne told CNN by phone from a prison in Puerto Lempira. The court will decide whether to throw out the case or hear arguments from both sides. ""Everyone tells us this would never happen in any other port in Honduras,"" he said Sunday, expressing his frustration with the judge's and state prosecutor's interpretation of the law. ""We have the right to do it (carry arms) for protection on the high seas,"" he added. Dangerous detention for six Americans in Honduras after weapons charges . Mayne and his crew are treasure hunters for Florida-based Aqua Quest International. He said they always carry arms when sailing international waters and made clear to Honduran officials before their arrival that they would have weapons on their ship. They were in Honduras to work with local officials in the country's impoverished, rural municipality of Ahuas to remove valuable mahogany logs from a nearby riverbed, remnants of decades of logging. He said profits from the sale of the recovered logs would be split between the salvage company and the municipality for a social project there.","Six Americans are accused of trying to smuggle weapons into Honduras on their ship .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council has condemned the killing of a French journalist who was reporting from the violence-racked Central African Republic. French troops found the body of Camille Lepage during the search of a vigilante group's vehicle in a western region of the country, French authorities said Tuesday. ""All necessary means will be employed to shed light on the circumstances of this assassination and to find our compatriot's murderers,"" the office of French President Francois Hollande said. The U.N. Security Council said that ""those responsible for the killing shall be held accountable."" Widespread unrest . Sectarian violence has killed thousands of people and displaced many more in the Central African Republic since a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels deposed President Francois Bozize in March 2013. The rebels have since been forced from power, but Christian and Muslim militias have continued to clash despite the presence of French and African peacekeepers in the country. Vigilante groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to anti-machete, were formed to counter attacks on Christian communities by Seleka groups. But the anti-balaka have carried out deadly reprisals on Muslim communities. Humanitarian groups have warned that the country risks descending into genocide. Lepage's body was found in an anti-balaka vehicle in the region of the western town of Bouar. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius described Lepage as a ""journalist and photographer of great courage."" U.S. sanctions . News of her killing came on the same day that the White House announced that President Barack Obama had issued an executive order declaring an emergency in the Central African Republic and authorizing the use of sanctions to deal with the crisis. The order also imposed sanctions on five individuals involved in the unrest. The U.N. Security Council had in January unanimously voted to set up a sanctions regime against the people responsible for instability and atrocities in the country, putting three people on a sanctions committee list. More than 2.5 million of the country's roughly 5 million inhabitants are in need of humanitarian assistance and approximately one million people have been displaced, according to the White House.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis sent shock waves around the globe last July when in addressing the issue of gays in the church, he opted not to remind his 1.6 billion followers about the fiery pits of hell but instead posed a question: ""Who am I to judge?"" Not exactly a ringing endorsement for equality, but the rhetorical question was light years away from what we have grown accustomed to hearing from his predecessors. And because of that, we felt a glimmer of hope that maybe the needle within the larger Christian community had moved from hostile rhetoric to civil engagement. Maybe even tolerance. In their nearly one-hour meeting this week, Pope Francis and President Barack Obama reportedly spent the bulk of their time discussing empathy. ""It's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars,"" the President said afterwards. Presumably he was referring to military wars, though that sentiment is obviously applicable to the culture war as well. For only a lack of empathy could prompt officials at a Christian school in Virginia to suggest an 8-year-old girl attend a different school because she wasn't behaving in a feminine enough way to stay at theirs. (The school says it can't provide details because of confidentiality, but ""this matter is far beyond a simple 'hairstyle and tomboy issue' as inaccurately portrayed."") Only a lack of empathy could lead Catholic school officials to fire a beloved teacher for planning to marry the love of his life. Lack of empathy explains how ""The ""700 Club's"" Pat Robertson can be flippant about stoning gay people to death in the days of Jesus, or how Franklin Graham -- Billy Graham's son -- can suggest that LGBT people might adopt children in order to ""recruit."" All of these incidents occurred after Pope Francis asked ""who am I to judge?"" as if ostracizing an elementary school tomboy was the best answer some of the Christian faith had to that question. On the day the story of the little girl made national headlines, Dan Haseltine, lead singer for the Christian band Jars of Clay, tweeted, ""why do I find myself regularly shaking my head, or rolling my eyes at supposed Christian leaders."" He followed with, ""I am learning that love's most potent manifestation happens when we make room at the table for everyone."" Haseltine's remarks were refreshing, because many Christians in his position prefer silent disapproval in response to over-the-top quotes and head-scratching stories like the one involving the little girl. If you're curious why more and more people are leaving the church, maybe it's because they hear ""love the sinner but hate the sin"" from the pulpit -- and then see so many followers go about their day as if simply saying the word ""love"" excused them from actually having to show any. Many followers of Christ may find silence on this topic easier, not noticing silence is being interpreted as endorsement -- whether they agree with the anti-gay rhetoric or not. For each time ""Who am I to judge?"" is asked, an anti-gay quote from the Catholic League's Bill Donahue is there to answer. To move Pope Francis' question from a global headline to global change, Christians must stop allowing silence to be the de facto weapon of choice against the senseless persecution of gay people. Forty percent of the country's homeless youth identify as LGBT, with nearly half kicked out of their homes by those who are supposed to love and care for them. There's a sermon topic we don't hear every week -- but we should. Slave owners used to start and end each service on the plantation with Ephesians 6:5 -- ""Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ."" ""Who am I to judge?"" was not enough to change that. Women were once compelled to stay with abusive husbands with the words ""wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."" ""Who am I to judge?"" was not enough to empower women and get the legal system to prosecute their assailants. It was in such silence that laws in Uganda were originally drafted to make being gay punishable by death. Laws that found validation from the ties some Ugandan politicians had to well-known U.S. evangelicals who regularly visited the country. The evangelicals have since distanced themselves from the anti-gay politics of Uganda. Not because of some moral stirring within their soul but because they were called out on it. Because the silence ended. Cardinal Timothy Dolan -- when asked about NFL prospect Michael Sam coming out of the closet -- said on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" ""The same Bible that tells us -- that teaches us well about the virtues of chastity and the virtue of fidelity and marriage also tells us not to judge people."" It's a truism ignored way too often by anti-gay Christian leaders. A truism that isn't reiterated enough by those who follow them.","Pope Francis and President Obama discussed the importance of empathy .

"(CNN) -- Blood and urine transported from Rio de Janeiro to Lausanne. It is a 5,000-mile transatlantic commute, but that's the anti-doping plan FIFA will implement to ensure a clean World Cup in 2014. Football's global governing body was forced to take the step after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suspended testing at a laboratory in Rio. The LADETEC laboratory had its accreditation to conduct anti-doping tests taken away by WADA in August after failing to meet the organization's International Standard for Laboratories (ISL). ""Following the recent decision by WADA to revoke the accreditation of the LADETEC laboratory in Rio de Janeiro ... FIFA has decided to use the WADA accredited laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland,"" read a FIFA statement. ""As WADA confirmed that following due process the LADETEC laboratory would not be able to achieve re-accreditation in time for the World Cup, FIFA has no other option but to handle the analysis of samples abroad."" The facility in Lausanne was used following the 2013 Confederations Cup, a World Cup warm-up tournament held in Brazil earlier this year, for processing data on the biological profiles of players. WADA president John Fahey accepted that flying samples across the Atlantic Ocean is not ideal, but insisted the logistical hurdles were ""not insurmountable."" ""It's almost certain it won't happen before the World Football Cup next year,"" Fahey said at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in Johannesburg. ""Clearly that will involve using another laboratory ... You can move the samples these days with aircrafts and regular flights."" The WADA president cited an example from February this year, when drug testers successful took samples from over 40 Kenyan athletes before transporting them to Lausanne for analysis. ""FIFA is now taking the necessary logistical steps for the shipment of samples overseas,"" continued FIFA's statement. ""FIFA and WADA will ensure the best possible analysis of urine and blood samples and the proper implementation of the new strategy in the fight against doping by means of the steroid module of the Athlete Biological Passport."" Biological passports collate an athlete's drug test results over time, making it easier to detect differences which could indicate the use of a banned substance. Brazil, and Rio in particular, is set to be firmly in the global spotlight over the next few years. Two years after the World Cup, which will run through June and July, Rio will host the 2016 Olympic Games. A total of 552 blood and urine tests conducted during the South Africa World Cup in 2010 returned zero positive results. FIFA doubled the number of precompetition tests conducted compared to the World Cup in Germany in 2006. The LADETEC laboratory was not immediately available for comment.","FIFA will transport samples taken at Brazil 2014 to a lab in Switzerland .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Hall of Fame football player and actor Merlin Olsen, a giant man who friends say had an even larger heart, died Thursday after a long battle with cancer, football and university officials said. He was 69. Known as much for his brain as his brawn, the 6-foot-5, 270-pound defensive tackle also graduated summa cum laude and Phi Kappa Phi from Utah State University in 1962 and earned a master's degree in economics in the off-season during his 15-year professional career. ""Merlin Olsen was a coach's player. Punctual, steady, gifted, a quiet leader, a player you could always count on,"" says his biography on the National Football League Hall of Fame Web site. ""He was a standout as a rookie and thereafter stood out in every game he played for the Rams in a 15-year career. Every game. Fifteen years."" There may be no better evidence of Olsen's strength than his feat of playing in 208 professional games, the last 198 in a row. At Utah State University from 1959-1961, Olsen earned All-American honors during his junior and senior years. As a senior, he won the 1961 Outland Trophy as the nation's outstanding interior defensive lineman. After being drafted by the Rams with a No. 1 pick in 1962, Olsen was voted into the Pro Bowl as a rookie, the first of his 14 Pro Bowl appearances. He also made two All-Decade teams and was a six-time All-Pro. Olsen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982, his first year of eligibility. He accomplished all those feats while playing for a sometimes less-than-stellar Los Angeles Rams team before its move to St. Louis in 1995. ""It was Olsen's hard luck to perform for many mediocre teams in Los Angeles -- he never won a Super Bowl -- but he had as much to do as any other individual with glamorizing defensive football in the NFL,"" his NFL biography says. For many years, Olsen was a member of the Rams' renowned ""Fearsome Foursome"" defensive line that included Deacon Jones, Roosevelt Grier and Lamar Lundy. After his professional playing career ended in 1976, Olsen turned to acting, appearing in movies and more than 100 TV episodes. He also worked as a television sports commentator. On TV, he may best be remembered for portraying the gentle Jonathan Garvey opposite Michael Landon on ""Little House on the Prairie"" from 1977 to 1981 and the lead role in ""Father Murphy"" from 1981 to 1983. In addition, Olsen did voice-overs in commercials for the floral delivery company FTD as well as commercials for syndicated airings of ""The X-Files"" TV program. He was remembered Thursday for his character and how he excelled in so many endeavors. ""I can't think of anyone who has graduated from Utah State University who has accomplished more in a broader array of fields than Merlin Olsen,"" said Utah State University President Stan Albrecht. ""His distinctive and powerful voice will be remembered for the breadth of its influence and by the impact it has had in so many different facets of our lives."" The university also said Olsen will be recalled ""as a tireless philanthropist, giving enormous amounts of time, talent and financial resources to numerous causes across the country."" As a broadcaster, Olsen was partnered for years at NBC Sports with Dick Enberg, who recently described him as ""the complete man."" In a letter to Olsen, Utah State revealed Thursday, Enberg lauded Olsen's commitment to their weekly NFL telecasts. Enberg wrote of his partner's ""uncommon willingness to prepare."" ""I'd often feel that I had given an 'A' effort in our broadcasts, only to recognize you earned the 'A-plus,' "" Enberg wrote. Enberg said he also was struck by Olsen's inner self -- ""a man of goodness, eager to consciously do the right thing for yourself, while helping others."" Carroll Rosenbloom, owner of the Rams during Olsen's playing days, also spoke to Olsen's unblemished character. SI Vault: Read about Merlin Olsen's start in show business after 15 seasons with the Rams . ""The thing about him that I find remarkable is never once have I ever heard him say a negative word about anybody, in any circumstance,"" Rosenbloom said. ""I just remember having a lot of admiration and respect for him, because he was a unique guy on the team, just the kind of person he is -- gentle and wonderful, and treated everybody so well."" Rosenbloom's son Chip, majority owner of the St. Louis Rams, said Olsen will never be forgotten in team history. The Rams last honored him at a December 20 game in St. Louis. ""In Rams history, there are maybe 10 guys who are iconic, and he's one of them,"" Rosenbloom said. ""There's nobody who is more important."" Olsen's alma mater likewise honored him in December, announcing at a basketball game half-time ceremony the naming of Merlin Olsen Field at Romney Stadium, a statue on the facility's southeast plaza and a scholarship endowment.","""Little House on the Prairie"" actor dies of cancer at 69 .

"(CNN) -- Welcome to bug season, when mosquitoes, ticks and other creepy crawlers make even the bravest mom or dad hesitant to let the kids go outside. Not only are insects annoying, they can carry diseases such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease. But what's the best way to ward off these pests? A new report, released Wednesday by the Environmental Working Group, finds that no one bug repellent works against every insect, but your best bets are those products made with active ingredients registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientific tests have shown that four registered chemicals provide a high level of protection from a number of bug bites, according to the EWG report: Picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (and its synthetic derivative known as p-Menthane-3,8-diol, or PMD) and DEET. These chemicals are found in many of the popular products on your drugstore shelves. Despite DEET's reputation as a harmful substance, the EWG researchers found it to be one of the most effective chemicals against the risks of West Nile virus and Lyme disease. ""We found them all to be safe, especially if people don't overdose on the product,"" said David Andrews, lead author on the study and a researcher with EWG. ""And these chemicals do protect people against a lot of rather nasty insects."" And that's important because insect-borne illnesses are on the rise. The West Nile virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, infected more than 5,600 Americans last year, and 286 people died from the virus, according to the CDC. A report this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted that the virus, which had been declining over the past few years, spiked in 2012, especially in Texas. By analyzing the epidemic in Dallas County, Texas, researchers found serious West Nile outbreaks begin early, after unusually warm winters. They also seem to be concentrated in one area every year. The virus migrates around the country, so health officials say it's very important to be aware if your area is being affected. Same goes for Lyme disease. Incidences of the tick-borne illness have more than doubled over the last 15 years, according to the CDC. Although the disease is transferred to humans through the bite of a deer tick, that tick is only found in 13 Northeastern states from Virginia to Maine, and in the upper Midwest, mostly in Wisconsin and Minnesota. If you live in those states, it's best to take precautions. ""You need to know the insects that exist where you live and what works best against them,"" Andrews said. ""No need to spray repellents for, let's say, ticks, if they're not prevalent in your area."" Although these four chemical repellents are effective, they need to be used correctly, the EWG warns. Consumers must follow the basic instructions to make sure that they don't overexpose their skin. For instance DEET, when used correctly, is an excellent repellent, but overuse has been found to cause neurological problems in some people. Health experts suggest sticking with a 30% concentration, a number that can be found on the repellent's label. Researchers say anything more concentrated isn't necessary unless you are working outside for a long period of time. ""The concentration level doesn't mean how much it protects,"" Andrews said. ""It means how long it protects. So if you are out for a few hours, 30% is just fine."" The EWG also notes that repellents should be a last resort when warding off insects. The organization recommends covering up with clothing, like long pants and long sleeves, socks and shoes. And be aware of the environment around you. Draining standing water -- where mosquitoes breed -- from your yard will keep populations low. ""We realize during the summer people aren't going to be wearing heavy clothing, or worrying about bugs as they enjoy the outdoors, "" Andrews said. ""So that's why we made this list. These products are out there, they are safe, and people should be using them to protect themselves."" Picaridin . Developed by Bayer AG in the 1980s, Picaridin is not known to irritate skin and eyes and does not have a bad odor. It may also repel bugs for longer periods of time than other chemicals. Products that have Picaridin: Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard; Cutter; OFF! Active; OFF! FamilyCare; Walgreens Light and Clean . IR3535 . IR3535 has been used in Europe for years. It can be irritating to the eyes but poses few other safety risks. Merck, the manufacturer, recommends formulas with 10% to 30% concentration to repel biting insects and ticks. Products that have IR3535: Coleman Skin Smart . DEET . Approved for public use since 1957, DEET is the most common mosquito and tick repellent. Products that have DEET: Bug Off; Buzz Off; OFF! Active; OFF! FamilyCare; OFF! Deep Woods; Repel; Ultrathon . Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus/PMD . Oil of lemon eucalyptus is the trade name for a repellent that originated as an extract of the eucalyptus tree, which is native to Australia. Because the dangers to children have not been thoroughly investigated, products with oil of lemon eucalyptus or PMD have warning labels that say, ""Don't use on children under the age of 3."" Most oil of lemon eucalyptus products are sold under the name Repel or Cutter.","Four chemicals provide protection from biting bugs: Picaridin, IR3535, PMD, DEET .
Despite negative reputation, DEET was found to be most effective and least toxic .

"(EW.com) -- Why did Sienna Miller fall off Hollywood's radar shortly after the 2009 release of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra? The answer's simple, according to Miller herself: ""I sabotaged things,"" she says. ""I burnt a lot of bridges."" There's more blunt honesty where that came from in Miller's big Esquire UK interview, the magazine's latest cover story. (And yes, the article also includes a very tasteful, black-and-white topless photoshoot.) In between a fair amount of purple prose (""[we] talked to each other, and at each other, and occasionally over each other about feminism and social media and the press and public morality and twerking, obviously...Some of this into my voice recorder, some of it into the wind""), Miller gives a lot of insight into her rocky career, which started to slump when her private life became more interesting than her professional life — and Miller freely admits that she's got nobody to blame for that but herself. (Although according to interviewer Alex Bilmes, Miller does concede ""that she certainly wouldn't have been treated in this way were she a man."" Maybe there's a Katherine Heigl comparison to be made here?) The trouble began when 2004′s Alfie remake was released — and 22-year-old Miller suddenly skyrocketed to fame, due to her roles as both the film's costar and Jude Law's girlfriend. ""I was really naive,"" she recalls to Bilmes. ""Not green as grass — I was by no means an innocent — but I had faith in the goodness of everyone. I was very open. And that led me into all sorts of situations that backfired."" Namely, Miller never really learned how to play the PR game: ""I was English. I was, 'Let's be who we are! I'm not going to have my hair done every morning and yes: I smell of fags!' And so I would walk into studio heads' offices and we'd crack up laughing."" And while she claims that she was always ""totally professional"" on movie sets, offset, the actress ""had no business sense whatsoever"": ""I never read a review or paid any mind to what anyone said,"" Miller admits. She also ruffled feathers with her off-the-cuff remarks, as when she memorably called Pennsylvania's second-largest city ""Sh--sburgh."" And of course, she got caught in one tabloid scandal after another, first due to her tumultuous relationship with Law and later when she had an affair with the married actor Balthazar Getty. As a result, Miller says roles dried up — because ""people don't want to see films with people they don't approve of in them."" (You know, unless they're men.) So Miller ""deliberately disappeared"" from the spotlight, and from the nasty reputation she'd developed. ""I was sick of myself, to be honest, or sick of that perception of me,"" she says. ""It all felt so f—ing dirty."" Since Miller's now doing a huge confessional interview in a big glossy magazine, it's safe to say that things are looking up for her. After the disaster that was G.I. Joe, she found refuge on the stage and with a well-received turn as Tippi Hedren in the 2012 TV movie The Girl. Two years later, Miller is staging something of a film comeback with roles in three movies, including the Vince Vaughn comedy Business Trip (which... maybe she shouldn't get too excited about) and the true crime drama Foxcatcher (which was originally set to open Dec. 20 but has been pushed to an unspecified date this year). Her personal life, too, is finally stable: Miller and fiance Tom Sturridge welcomed their first daughter in July 2012. And maybe most importantly, the tumult of the past 10 years has helped Miller understand what really matters — or, more specifically, what doesn't. (Hint: Everything.) Take it away, Sienna: . ""When you're in some massive crisis and you look at yourself in a close-up and then if you visualize pulling back and seeing England and then pulling back and seeing the world, you realize how f—ing insignificant you are. I think that's really the greatest thing I've learned recently: that I don't matter. Nothing matters. It's such a relief to know that. I didn't get that job -- it doesn't f—ing matter. Whatever I achieve, or don't, will be forgotten, it's not important."" Read the full interview at Esquire UK. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- In-vitro fertilization is growing fast in Nigeria, a country where childlessness can be seen as a social failure, especially for women. Nigeria's first in-vitro fertilization clinic was only opened in 1999, but there are now around 16 in the country. Dr Richard Ajayi, director of the Lagos-based Bridge Clinic, says he has a vision of making the treatment easily accessible. ""Where you have a marriage that's not blessed with children there's a lot of stigmatization,"" says Ajayi. ""In fact, some people say infertility is a justifiable reason for divorce and a lot of marriages break up where there's infertility,"" he adds. Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation with some 150 million people, but it has a large fertility problem. The prevalence of infertility in Nigeria is about 25%, compared to 10 to 15% in the U.S. and UK, according to Friday Okonofua, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of Benin, in Nigeria. IVF, the assisted reproductive technology that has helped countless couples around the world, is often unavailable or unaffordable in many developing countries. Ajayi, who used to live in the UK, says that for many years the only option for childless Nigerian couples was to travel abroad to get treatment. ""I was surprised by the large number of Nigerians that were constantly coming to the UK for treatment and after a few years of watching them, my entrepreneurial nerve started to twitch and I thought to myself there's a major opportunity in Nigeria,"" he says. Ajayi returned to Nigeria to help set up its first IVF treatment clinic in 1999 and he now runs four IVF treatment clinics across the country. Each of his clinics treats up to 700 patients a year, with what he says is a success rate of over 30% for women under 36 years old. But overcoming these biological realities ultimately helps couples overcome the enormous social pressure as well. Marcia Inhorn, professor of anthropology and international affairs at Yale University, says that in many developing nations the greatest social burden of infertility rests on the shoulders of married women, who are expected to become pregnant. They can experience ""social scrutiny and ostracism"" if they don't have children, she says. ""This is especially true in 'high-fertility' societies of sub-Saharan Africa, where infertile women suffer from 'barrenness amidst plenty,'"" explains Inhorn, who is co-author of ""Infertility Around the Globe."" She says the social suffering associated with infertility seems to be worse when women are expected to have many children, and can lead to depression, despair, and threats of divorce. In sub-Saharan Africa, many infertility problems in women are related to untreated or poorly treated reproductive tract infections, which could easily be prevented with early detection. However, Inhorn says most of the world's infertility cases involve male infertility, which is a ""hidden"" and neglected reproductive health problem. ""Women often carry the burden of their husband's infertility, even when they themselves are healthy and fertile,"" she says. The Bridge Clinic claims to have had 1,253 live births since 2000. Treatment can cost up to $5,000, since maintaining a professional standard in a country with a lack of trained IVF staff is not cheap. But healthcare, Ajayi says, is not about numbers. ""It's not just about making money, it's about actually doing something worthwhile and having a clear vision to solve a problem that the country needs solving and at the same time building a institution that outlives me,"" he says.","In Nigeria there can be a stigma attached to childless marriage .

"(CNN) -- If you're looking for a little black box to put under your TV set and devices like the Roku, Apple TV, or any of the many Google TV boxes aren't doing it for you, Jeff Bezos may have your hookup. Bloomberg Businessweek is reporting that Amazon is working on its own set-top box centered on its services, and the company will apparently introduce the box in the fall. Other details about the box itself are light on the ground. All we know for now is that it may share the Kindle branding with the Amazon's line of e-readers and Fire tablets, and that the device is being developed by the company's Lab126 division. (This group is also responsible for the rest of the Kindle hardware.) As with the Kindle e-book library, you don't actually need to own one of Amazon's devices to access Amazon's video contentâ€”you can already play Instant Video on consoles like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 just as you can get Kindle books on your iPad or Android tablet. Amazon's strategy with the Kindle Fire tablets has been to price them attractively and put its own content front-and-center, as well as give its users special perks like the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. A theoretical Amazon set-top box would likely take a similar approach to distinguish itself from the other little-boxes-with-HDMI-ports that crowd this market. Amazon's last major hardware announcement was the Kindle Fire HD reveal back in September of 2012. If the company has a similar event around in the fall this year, that's when we'd expect this box to be introduced.

"(CNN) -- Thomas Beatie, known as ""the pregnant man,"" was interviewed Monday by CNN's Larry King. Joining Thomas was his wife, Nancy. Thomas gave birth in July to the couple's first child, Susan, and now they're expecting again. Larry King interviews the Beatie family -- Thomas, Nancy and their daughter, Susan. Thomas' new book is titled ""Labor of Love: The Story of One Man's Extraordinary Pregnancy."" The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Larry King: Thomas and Nancy, welcome. Congratulations. How is it going? Thomas Beatie: Good, thank you. King: Are you surprised at all of this attention, or did you expect it? Thomas: Honestly, we are quite surprised. We naively thought that we were going to be able to get away with me giving birth without anyone knowing.  Watch the couple's interview with Larry King » . King: Let's break it down so we understand the story. You were a woman, right? You were a woman? You now call yourself a man. You were born a female? Thomas: Yes. King: How did you two meet? Thomas: We met at a gym 18 years ago, at a gym in Hawaii. Almost 18 years ago. King: How long have you been together? Nancy: Eleven, going on 12. Thomas: Yes, going on 11. We've been married for going on six. King: Obviously, you look like a man. You are a man. Did you go through surgeries? Thomas: Chest reconstruction surgery. And I've had hormone treatment. King: So you are a man to yourself? Thomas: Yes. King: How did the idea come about that he/she should get pregnant? Nancy: Well, we both wanted to start a family. I had a hysterectomy. So we thought about adopting and all of these other options, but who better to carry our baby than him?  Hear Larry King's take on this show » . King: So how did it -- how was it done? Nancy: Well, we had to get -- we got a donor. And we did it at home. I did it. King: You did it? The donor denotes the sperm? Nancy: Right. We ordered the sperm and it came to our house. I put it in a syringe without a needle. King: And injected it? Nancy: Yes. King: So you never had any work done in the lower parts that would change that part? Thomas: Just from what testosterone does naturally. King: Did he get pregnant right out of the box? Nancy: Right. Basically. King: He's pregnant now, right? How did you know how to do that? Thomas: We had to look that stuff up online. We had a difficult time finding a physician to help us. We found a physician to finally sign for a sperm bank, and that's how we could do it at home. But we did look the stuff up online. King: Why didn't you adopt?  Thomas: That's a viable option and we did consider it. I have a very real need to pass down my genes, so we were going to try that first and then look into surrogacy. But we would have had a lot of problems with surrogacy, because we would need fertility endocrinologists to help out. Nancy: We wanted to have our baby. King: What was it like giving birth, Thomas? Thomas: Wow. It's an experience you can't quite -- you just can't describe it to someone else who hasn't gone through it. It's a life-changing experience for sure. King: Did you run into legal problems at all? Thomas: We have actually with her birth certificate. King: What does it say? Thomas: Well, I filled it out as me father, Nancy mother, and they changed it last minute, and they put her as father and me as mother. And then they changed it again and put us as parents. That's fine and dandy, but we don't have a domestic partnership. We're not a same-sex marriage. We're legal man and wife. King: That's a big difference. Thomas: Yes. One part of the government recognizes me as male and, now with our baby's birth certificate, there's a conflict. So we're really concerned that it's going to jeopardize our future. King: What would happen if, God forbid, you pass away? Would somebody fight over this baby? Thomas: It's very likely. That's what I'm very afraid of and that's why we need help. We need an attorney to help us make it right. King: When you met, were you -- what kind of couple were you? Thomas: A normal couple. King: What I meant was did you consider yourself gay? Thomas: No. We -- I lived my life as a woman at that point. Legally, I was female. But inside I still felt male. So the way other people perceived us, they saw us as a lesbian couple. King: Do you feel gay? Nancy: I don't feel gay. King: So you feel you're married to a man? Nancy: Yes. King: Completely? Nancy: Yes. Even when he was pregnant, he was still a man to me. King: What kind of birth was it? Thomas: It was natural birth. King: Not Cesarean? Thomas: No, it was rumored that it was. But it wasn't. King: You looking forward to the next one? How far along are you now? Thomas: I am ten weeks. King: Same donor? Thomas: Same donor. King: Where did you learn how to do this? From the Internet, you said, right. You can't have the normal kind of intercourse, right? Thomas: We can. King: Oh. Nancy: Not to make a baby. Thomas: Because of hormones, my -- my clitoris has enlarged and it looks like a penis. I can have intercourse with my wife. King: That's fascinating to me. I didn't know that. So you have a clitoris that looks likes a penis so it can fit into having love relations? Thomas: Basically. Nancy: I'm the mother. Thomas: I'm the father. King: Is this the end of the baby sphere? This baby going to be the last? Nancy: We don't know yet. We haven't decided. King: The two of you, really, I think you're terrific. I think what you've done is not the easiest thing in the world and especially to come forward. You have a beautiful little daughter. I wish you nothing but the best. All right. That's Thomas Beatie and his wife, Nancy Beatie, and the book is ""Labor of Love, the Story of One Man's Extraordinary Pregnancy."" That it is.

"London (CNN) -- The ex-wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood said the precarious finances of L'Wren Scott's fashion business may have played a role in the late designer's apparent suicide. ""I think it might have been, for her, a question of losing face,"" 59-year-old Wood told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""She was such a proud woman that, I think, to face that, well maybe that was the trigger."" Wood admitted she was ""surprised as much as everyone else"" to learn of the death of Scott, the longtime partner of her ex-husband Ronnie's band mate Mick Jagger. Scott, 49, was found dead in her Manhattan apartment on Monday; she appears to have taken her own life. READ MORE: L'Wren Scott's business was in trouble . Wood said she had been in contact with Ronnie who reported that Jagger was ""devastated"" by the news. ""The band is rallying around Mick,"" said Wood. ""This will have hit him at the worst possible time, when he's away on tour. And she questioned the future of the Rolling Stones in the wake of the news: ""Where they go from here I just don't know,"" she said. Asked whether this would spark the end of the band's 50-year career in rock music, Wood said: ""I don't know. ""Mick's devastated -- to have a girlfriend commit suicide -- he always looked after the women in his life. This will have hit him very hard.'' Scott, a former model and entrepreneur, was also a well-known celebrity stylist, having dressed scores of high profile clients for red carpet events like the Oscars and Golden Globes. She incorporated her clothing line in the UK in 2006 under the name LS Fashions Ltd., but six years later the firm was trading heavily in the red. Accounts filed with the UK's Companies House show that by the end of 2012 it had racked up debts of $7.6 million, and was burning though cash at a rapid rate. In the last year of its submissions, official paperwork showed the company's liquid reserves had plummeted to just a tenth of their value in 2011. In a statement issued Friday, a spokesperson for Scott said, ""The long-term prospects for the business were encouraging. Ms. Scott was very focused on doing what was right for her global business and for the support of her team."" Scott had been due to hold a show at London Fashion Week on February 16, but the event was cancelled, the British Fashion Council confirmed. Mick Jagger, who had shared his life with Scott for 13 years, took to his official site MickJagger.com and to Facebook to express his grief. ""I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,"" he wrote. ""We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me. ""I have been touched by the tributes that people have paid to her, and also the personal messages of support that I have received,"" he wrote, adding: ""I will never forget her."" Wood, who had spent time with Scott while on tour with the band, described her as ""a bit aloof"" and ""hard to get close to,"" but always courteous and kind. Scott's relationship with Jagger, she said, seemed ""close"" and ""warm."" ""I always thought they were very happy. I never saw any kind of argument. She was always very supportive of him."" Following news of Scott's death, the Rolling Stones postponed the rest of their tour of Australia and New Zealand until further notice. In a statement explaining the decision, the band said: ""Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood wish to thank all of their fans for their support at this difficult time and hope that they will fully understand the reason for this announcement.""

"(CNN) -- The argument that led to country singer Billy Currington's indictment on terroristic threat charges involved a a charter boat captain who the performer thought sped too fast by his dock, the police report says. A grand jury in Savannah, Georgia, handed up a two-count indictment Wednesday accusing Currington, 39, of threatening bodily harm against Charles Harvey Ferrelle last week. An elder abuse charge was included because Farrell is 70 years old. The police report, obtained by CNN affiliate WSAV, says Ferrelle filed a criminal complaint saying ""he feared for his life"" after Currington screamed at him and followed him in a boat. Ferrelle, a charter boat captain, was giving a boat tour around Tybee Island, Georgia, when he passed by Currington's property on April 15, the report said. Currington yelled at the boat from shore and then jumped in his own boat and followed as Ferrelle went to his slip at a nearby dock, it said. Currington threatened that ""he was going to f--k Mr. Ferrelle up,"" the police report said. ""If I hadn't gotten into my slip fast enough, I believe he would have run me over,"" Ferrelle told an investigator. A Savannah judge issued a bench warrant for Currington's arrest after the indictment was handed up by the Chatham County grand jury Wednesday, District Attorney Meg Heap said Wednesday. Currington and his representatives did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. But the singer posted a message to fans through his Twitter account: ""hey guys, I wanted to thank everyone for the huge amount of support that I have received already. Unfortunately, I can't comment on this situation as this is an ongoing legal matter. It means a lot to me to have your support during this time."" While it is unclear if there is a connection, two days after the alleged incident Currington tweeted: ""harrassing artists often at their home by boat should be illegal. thas all i know."" Although Currington resides primarily in Nashville, he is a native of Rincon, Georgia, which is about 35 miles inland from Tybee Island. Currington's hit country songs include ""Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right,"" ""Good Directions,"" ""People Are Crazy,"" ""That's How Country Boys Roll,"" ""Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer,"" and ""Let Me Down Easy."" CNN's Denise Quan and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","NEW: The 70-year-old boat captain told police he feared for his life after the incident .

"(CNN) -- Our nightmare began in 1993 after we moved from the city to a house down a winding country road abutting a spruce forest in Chappaqua, New York. Our little woods were home to mice, deer and ticks harboring the infectious agent of Lyme disease. We weren't especially concerned. As seasoned science journalists, my husband and I had researched the risk of tick-borne disease by reading medical journals, finding a raft of articles on a wave of ""Lyme hysteria"" sweeping the Northeast suburbs; the disease, some of the authors said, was mild and benign. Perhaps that's why, as one of our sons and then the other got sick, our pediatrician resisted testing for Lyme disease. When my older son, Jason, 14, developed a mottled rash spreading over his torso in 1998, our doctor's office told us that because it wasn't a literal bull's eye -- believed to be the classic indication of Lyme -- it couldn't be Lyme (a misconception still common today despite voluminous research to the contrary). By 2000, Jason suffered aversion to light, profound fatigue and shooting pain throughout his arms and legs. Mostly to placate me, our pediatrician finally ordered a Lyme disease test. It came back positive. But our doctor still rejected Lyme disease as the cause, instead proposing a psychiatric disorder. The university-based psychiatrist we then consulted called the pediatrician a quack. Our older son, he said, was physically ill. My family would spend the next decade struggling to get well. Along the way, we had to navigate one of the most vitriolic fights in medicine. As the scientific community fought over the very nature of Lyme disease, debating everything from who actually had it to what treatment worked best, misdiagnosed patients were left to wander the medical outback without a compass or any clear path back to health. Caused by the spirochete--a coiled bacterium such as the one that causes syphilis-- Borrelia burgdorferi, Lyme is the most frequently reported tick-borne disease in the United States. In 2011, some 33,000 cases met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition. But there are far more patients with the infection since only a fraction of cases are reported. When doctors attuned to the CDC's rigorous definition resist diagnosing any but the most classic patients -- those with an obvious Lyme rash or highly positive test -- it means patients are left to advance to later, harder-to-treat stages of the disease. Adding to the mess, physicians frequently fail to test for other, often-debilitating infections from the same black-legged ticks: Babesia, the cause of a malaria-like illness; Anaplasma, an intracellular bacterium; and another spirochete, Borrelia miyamotoi, recently documented as the cause of a relapsing-remitting Lyme-like disease. In fact, there is a lot of confusion over what may or may not be causing Lyme and other tick-borne diseases around the United States. In California, scientists have found several new spirochetes yet to be vetted as sources of Lyme-like illness, and researchers in Florida just isolated Lyme spirochetes from ticks despite CDC's website saying not to worry. Then there's the smackdown over chronic Lyme: Do Lyme patients stay sick following treatment because the infection is still there? In the 1990s, the National Institutes of Health sought to answer the question by funding a series of studies, the first of which has informed the treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America ever since. That study monitored 136 Lyme patients who remained chronically ill after antibiotic therapy. In other words, they still showed symptoms of the illness. And yet some 700 blood and spinal fluid samples taken from them yielded no hint of the spirochete. On one side, experts embraced this small study as proof that chronic Lyme was a myth. They believed the sickness had to be caused by something else since patients showed no sign of the spirochete. But patients and their doctors were unconvinced. Spirochetes leave body fluids for tissue early in the course of disease, after all, explaining lack of evidence in blood. And researchers had reported persistent spirochetes in the tissue of treated mammals for years. To resolve the mystery, the NIH commissioned similar experiments with rhesus monkeys. Instead of searching monkey blood for DNA after antibiotic treatment, the researchers would sacrifice the animals and scour their tissue for signs of the Lyme spirochete, including the RNA that is a surer sign of active disease. The monkey studies, published in 2012 by scientists at Tulane, document the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA and RNA following aggressive antibiotic treatment. When uninfected ticks fed on those treated monkeys, they literally ingested intact spirochetes -- proof that the organism remained. Are small numbers of living spirochetes driving persistent symptoms? Scientific resolution has yet to come, but even the NIH has seen fit to ask the question, launching an ongoing study that tests the ability of treated patients to transmit living Lyme spirochetes to biting ticks. Despite so many unknowns, continued insistence that Lyme patients are mentally ill has been a drumbeat in our Lymelands, creating a stigma that hampers treatment or the chance of getting well. What we need here, the Institute of Medicine has suggested, is a ""process of conflict resolution"" to create ""a new environment of trust."" Progress in research can only happen if the key stakeholders -- the patients -- are included in the work. Some groups have tried: In June, the National Institute of Standards and Technology held a meeting to help develop better tests. This is a crucial endeavor since standard tests based on legacy technology pick up real patients between just 45% and 75% of the time, especially in the early phase of the disease. Patients and scientists worked together on the NIST event, but collaboration has often been difficult if not impossible to achieve. For instance, a group of scientists has lobbied against federal legislation to increase funding for Lyme disease research. Why? That's just counterproductive. Powerful 21st-century technologies can help us, but first we've got to admit that waters are muddy and urgent questions remain. Calling patients ""Lyme-loonies"" or ""part of an anti-science movement that denies both the viral cause of AIDS and the benefits of vaccines,"" is hurtful and untrue. After all, questioning the value of research that keeps one locked in illness is hardly on par with denying HIV. The real science deniers are those circling the wagons around outdated studies, leaving patients desperate and sick while protecting their academic turf. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pamela Weintraub.","Pamela Weintraub: Her family went through nightmare in grappling with Lyme disease .

"(CNN) -- This year around 300,000 visitors are expected to attend the Milan's Salone del Mobile, the world's largest and most important furniture fair. At the moment it seems like half of them are trying to get into the lavish exhibition space set up by Fendi. The men guarding the entrance resemble bouncers, albeit with smaller necks, better fitting suits, and a habit of calling strangers sir or madam. After I flash my press credentials they let me beyond the velvet rope. Apparently CNN is on the list. Every year the good and the great of the furniture world descend on Milan for its Salone, an extravaganza of design and a focal point of the design calendar. Retailers come to decide which pieces they will stock for the following year, and journalists arrive en masse to get ideas for features and editorial spreads. Designers and their teams come for a bit of inspiration—and to eye up the competition. This year 1,400 exhibitors—including furniture heavyweights like Fendi, Moroso, and Minotti, and kitchen experts like Bosch, Gaggenau, and Miele—are displaying their latest designs and innovations. Their various booths, which sometimes resemble free-standing stores, stretch out over 152,300 square meters of exhibition space. That's equivalent to 27 football fields filled with sofas, armchairs, carpets and ovens. This year's exhibition, which concludes on April 13, is the most extravagant yet. ""Over the past few years the mood at the fair has been quite subdued and there haven't been that many notable launches,"" says Talib Choudhry, editor-at-large for Elle Décor UK. ""But there seems to be renewed confidence in the global economy. This year the pace is more upbeat, frenetic and it's all about the sell."" Inside Casa de Fendi . Fendi's booth resembles a Fendi store with its dark wood floors and black-and-gold wall hangings. ""The shops stay in place for four or five years, but the booth is here for just five days,"" says Raffaella Vignatelli, the vice-president of the Luxury Living Group, the Italian lifestyle brand that produces furniture for Fendi Casa, Bentley Home, Trussardi Casa and Heritage Collection. ""Inside this box we're not only showing furniture. We're showing a lifestyle."" And what a glamorous lifestyle it is. An attractive public relations manager guides me through the showroom to a high-back cocoon sofa, created by guest designer Toan Nguyen, which retails from $25,000. Then there's a 13-ft. mirror, which includes a built-in 30-inch or 42-inch television set. It starts from $20,000 and can climb to $35,000. Eventually we reach the ""cat pouf"" ottoman. It's covered in leather with a stained wengé base. Her eyes light up when she tells me it was inspired by a Fendi handbag, . Party, party everywhere . Later that evening I follow the masses to Milan's Palazzo Morando, a 16th century palace that has been converted into an exhibition and party space by designjunction, a group that showcases the latest furniture, lighting and product design from around the world. If the walls could talk they would likely whisper about the eccentric personalities downing champagne and ogling over Afghan carpets and pot scrubbers made from watermelon rinds. In the courtyard I interrupt a conversation between a Macedonian furniture enthusiast and an Indonesian interior designer. ""I don't keep a schedule—I just run from one place to another and then when someone calls me I run to another show or party,"" says Hendra Gustari, the chief executive and creative director of Designclopedia, a leading home interiors and furniture retailer in Jakarta. He describes his annual journey to Milan as a ""design pilgrimage"" and says the fair presents an unparalleled opportunity to connect with his far-flung business contacts. It's also a chance to spot the pieces that will appeal to his well-heeled customers in Indonesia. ""When it comes to fashion you can choose between London fashion, Paris fashion, New York fashion, Tokyo fashion,"" Gustari says. ""When it comes to furniture you've got Italian, Italian, Italian and maybe the fourth is from somewhere else."" Welcome to the club . For up and coming designers, the Salone is an essential way to get your name out there. ""Personal relationships are everything in this business,"" says Choudhry of Elle Décor. ""It may look like a series of parties but it's actually big business. Designers will often secure a huge commission or brand partnership over a drink at Bar Basso. It's the place where everyone goes."" Designer Brodie Neill set up his label Made in Ratio last year. He debuted five new pieces in Milan this week. But rather than setting up inside designjunction or another collective space, he chose to rent out a trendy café and bar in Milan's Brera Design District and stocked it with his own furniture. ""We want it to be a social space where people can feel comfortable, have a coffee and interact with the pieces,"" he says. ""The pieces are very tactile."" So visitors eat spaghetti at his supernova trestle table, cast entirely from recycled aluminum. They also sit on his Pik stackable stools, which are made from recycled drinking bottles. He's less concerned with securing orders than he is with making new contacts. ""We've already had architects, retailers, and distributors come through the space,"" Neill says. ""This is where those important connections are made. We'll start imagining what we'll do next year before we even leave Milan.""","Around 300,000 furniture enthusiasts gather in Milan for Salone del Mobile .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is acknowledging publicly the key role a Pakistani doctor who assisted the United States ahead of the strike on Osama bin Laden's compound last May that killed the terrorism mastermind. The doctor who provided key information ought to be released, Panetta told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in a segment set to air Sunday. ""I'm very concerned about what the Pakistanis did with this individual,"" Panetta told CBS. ""This was an individual who in fact helped provide intelligence that was very helpful with regards to this operation. And he was not in any way treasonous towards Pakistan."" Dr. Shakeel Afridi helped the CIA use a vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples from residents of bin Laden's to verify the terror leader's presence there. Pakistan, which expressed its anger over the raid without consulting Pakistani authorities, has charged Afridi with treason. ""Pakistan and the United States have a common cause here against terrorism, have a common cause against al Qaeda,"" Panetta said. ""And for them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism, I just think is a real mistake on their part."" Panetta said Pakistan can discipline Afridi in whatever manner it deems appropriate but the doctor should be released. Many analysts felt U.S. officials had kept quiet about Afridi so as to not implicate him. Panetta also told CBS that he remains convinced that someone in authority in Pakistan knew that bin Laden was hiding in the city of Abbottabad, a largely military community outside the capital, Islamabad. He said there were intelligence reports of Pakistani helicopters passing over the bin Laden compound. He also questioned why the Pakistanis would not notice the vast complex with 18-foot walls. ""So you would have thought that somebody would have asked the question, 'What the hell's going on there?'"" Panetta said. ""I personally have always felt that somebody must have had some sense of what was happening at this compound."" Panetta said the United States chose not to inform Pakistan of the raid due to security concerns. ""We had seen some military helicopters actually going over this compound. And for that reason, it concerned us that, if we, in fact, brought (Pakistan) into it, that they might ... give bin Laden a heads up.""","Defense chief Leon Panetta talks about the Osama bin Laden raid on ""60 Minutes""

"(CNN) -- A Chinese ship detects pulse signals deep in the Indian Ocean at the same frequency used by so-called black boxes like the one aboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370. After almost a month of fruitless searching, hopes mount for final answers about what happened to the plane carrying 239 people that disappeared almost a month ago. However, experts disagree whether Saturday's news is a breakthrough or another dead end, raising new questions about what the pulse signal means and what happens now. Is this it? Maybe. The signals reported -- 37.5 kHz -- ""is the standard beacon frequency"" for the plane's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, said Anish Patel, president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom. That frequency was chosen for use in the recorders ""to give that standout quality that does not get interfered with by the background noise that readily occurs in the ocean."" China's Xinhua news agency reported the detector deployed by the Haixun (pronounced ""high shuen"") 01 patrol ship picked up the first signal around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, adding ""it is yet to be established whether it is related to the missing jet."" That location is outside the previously announced search areas for the missing plane off the western coast of Australia in the Indian Ocean. A Chinese search plane also reported seeing white objects on the ocean surface, according to Xinhua. Later Saturday, the head of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in Australia that is overseeing the search said there was ""no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft."" The statement said the floating objects were 90 kilometers, or about 55 miles, from where the pulse signal was detected. Relatives react . What's the difference between the devices? The most recent finds came from a Chinese ship slowly moving through the southern Indian Ocean. So what was it doing? Video on Chinese state-run CCTV shot Saturday shows crew members from the Haixun 01 boarding a small yellow dinghy and using what appears to be a handheld hydrophone. The three men on board lower the device into the water on a pole. A CCTV correspondent aboard the Haixun 01 reported that the first 37.5 kh signal was detected for 90 seconds. CNN spoke to the U.S. company that makes such devices. Handheld pinger locating devices were first built for scuba use, said Justin E. Manley, senior director of business operations for Teledyne Benthos. The equipment starts at a list price of about $8,000; with all the options it costs about $16,000, according to the company. Manley said holding the device over the side of a vessel may not be the best option, but it should work. The handheld device used by the Chinese is much different from the U.S. Navy hydrophone -- or underwater microphone -- called a towed pinger locator. One is on board the Australian ship Ocean Shield, which recently joined the search for Flight 370. This high-tech listening device can glide along near the bottom of the sea. The towed pinger locator, or TPL, is 30 inches long and weighs just 70 pounds. It's towed behind the ship that generally moves at slow speeds, generally from 1 to 5 knots. The device can pick up the pinger sound in depths reaching 20,000 feet. A pinger can be detected at a range of 1 to 2 miles. The TPL is more sensitive, more expensive and, since it is towed in the ocean, will have a better detection range, said Tom W. Altshuler, vice president and group general manager for Teledyne Marine Systems. ""One is designed to find a pinger in deep water, the other is designed to find a pinger in shallow water,"" said Altshuler. What now? Searchers need more equipment in the area where the pulse signal was detected to determine if it comes from airplane wreckage. It is a race against time, because the batteries for the acoustic pingers on Flight 370 could run out soon. They are expected to last at least a month once a plane goes down, but would then begin to lose strength. According to Malaysian officials, the batteries on the missing plane were due to be replaced in June under a regular maintenance schedule. What happens after the pingers die? ""I'd like to see some additional assets on site quickly -- maybe some sonobuoys,"" Patel said, referring to 5-inch-long (13-centimeter) sonar systems that are dropped from aircraft or ships. Confirmation that the signal comes from the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 would mean ""the possibility of recovering the plane -- or at least the black boxes -- goes from being one in a million to almost certain,"" said Simon Boxall, a lecturer in ocean and earth science at the University of Southampton. Up to 10 military planes and three civilian aircraft -- in addition to 11 ships -- searched Saturday for any sign of Flight 370, according to Australian officials. The British submarine HMS Tireless was in the search area, Malaysia's acting transport minister said. Retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the chief coordinator of the JACC, said officials were considering deploying search assets to the specific area where the Chinese ship detected the pulse signal.

"(OPRAH.com) -- What do Pinocchio, Richard Nixon, and an ""O, The Oprah Magazine"" very inventive columnist all have in common?

The story goes that, as a child, George Washington chopped down the backyard cherry tree and then admitted the whole sordid affair to his beloved father: ""I cannot tell a lie,"" he is said to have said. ""It was I who chopped down your cherry tree."" This leads me to a couple of thoughts: First, what were the Washingtons thinking? Color me cautious, but I've never been a big believer in allowing children direct access to an ax. Ditto hatchets, swords, tomahawks, muskets, and Barbie. Second, I cannot tell a lie; had I been in that very same situation, there's no doubt in my mind that I'd have looked my beloved father straight in the eye and told a lie.

It's not that I don't love my friend, and it's not that I don't love ""Tartuffe"" (okay, that's a lie, nobody actually loves ""Tartuffe""). It's just that I reserve Saturday night for slathering my reptilelike feet in Vaseline Intensive Care as my daughter shampoos her Polly Pocket doll in the toilet. But try explaining that to a friend who has just spent $200 on a brocade bustle and is flying her parents in from Wisconsin for her off-off-off-Broadway debut. My choices? Well, I can sit through ""Tartuffe"" with a lovely couple from Racine and a running time of two hours and 46 minutes that I'll never get back. I can pray that one of my undermoisturized feet will suddenly fossilize so that I can use it to knock myself unconscious. Or I can say, ""Darn the luck, that's the night I have to...

And, yes, I know, this makes me sound kind of awful, but I ask that you refrain from judging me until you've endured an evening of musical theater based on the early years of Joseph Goebbels, courtesy of this same friend.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown's trip to face trial in Washington will be on the Justice Department's ""Con Air"" prisoner airline, not on a private jet or a first-class commercial ticket as the singer hoped. Brown, 24, was transferred into the custody of federal marshals after an extradition hearing Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles, according to U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman Laura Vega. Brown will be booked on a series of government planes that hopscotch across the country taking inmates from prison to prison, Vega said. The trip, with layovers in jails along the way, could take up to two weeks, she said. Unlike Brown's usual mode of touring in luxury, he will be wearing handcuffs and possibly chains on his legs. Brown has been confined to the Los Angeles County jail since being booted from a court-ordered rehab program three weeks ago. The U.S. attorney in Washington petitioned for Brown to be extradited from Los Angeles to Washington for his April 17 trial. Brown and his bodyguard are accused of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk in October. The singer is on probation for the 2009 felony assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna. Brown's attorney, Mark Geragos, tried to persuade Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin to release his client from jail so he could fly on his own to Washington. Prosecutors opposed that request and suggested the decision should be made by a federal judge. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat Rihanna as the two were in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community ""labor-oriented service."" The judge has revoked Brown's probation twice in the last year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. Brown proceeded ""to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked in November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. Although he completed that program last month, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu, California, treatment facility until another hearing April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in Washington on April 17. If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at an April 23 hearing if Brown should complete his probation in jail. He was sent to jail on March 14 after he was kicked out of the second rehab program for rules violations. The judge said he was concerned about a ""provocative"" statement counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center. ""I am good at using guns and knives,"" according to a document read in court. The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. Brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. Brown had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. With his community labor work now on hold, his probation is expected to extend into 2015.

"(CNN) -- Saturday's discovery of a pulse signal in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 marks yet another potential breakthrough in the mystery of the plane's disappearance. Officials hope this lead will be unlike the others -- which so far have yet to locate the aircraft, which is believed to be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. But all of the past month's leads, whether genuine or false, have made for a dramatic narrative in how a commercial airliner could vanish while carrying 239 people. March 8 . Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 takes off just after midnight from Kuala Lumpur International Airport for Beijing. The Boeing 777-200 disappears within an hour of takeoff, following verbal communication with air traffic controllers. Ground eyewitnesses, however, claim they saw the plane. They are an oil rig worker in the Gulf of Thailand, fishermen in Malaysia and Indonesia, and islanders in Maldives. But all those accounts are eventually proven to be false. March 9 . A Vietnamese reconnaissance plane spots oil slicks that stretch between six and nine miles in the Gulf of Thailand, the same body of water where Flight 370 dispatched its last communication from the cockpit within the first hour of its takeoff. The slick turned out to be fuel oil typically used in cargo ships. Meanwhile, other sightings of a plane door and its tail also prove untrue. March 14 . Citing ""satellite information"" and giving scant details, Malaysian officials say they are focusing their attention on two massive ""arcs"" on both sides of the equator. They release a map to the press and, suddenly, the search for the plane covers a vast canvas of the Earth. The plane could have taken either path -- which means the search area now blankets 2.97 million square miles, nearly equivalent to the size of the continental United States. The northern arc stretches over Cambodia, Laos, China, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Speculation turns toward whether the plane actually landed to the north, but officials later dismiss this arching route as the possible location of the plane. No crashes, or even a sighting of a wayward Boeing, have been reported. Moreover, this north corridor flies through tightly guarded airspace over India, Pakistan and even U.S. military installations in Afghanistan, and no one has reported a rogue plane. That leaves the southern arc: it stretches from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. This becomes a solid lead for investigators. But it raises a gargantuan question: How do you find a plane in an ocean? March 18 . The Thai military reveals the plane had virtually reversed course and took a sharp turn -- westward, toward the Strait of Malacca. The Malaysian government says evidence suggest the plane was deliberately flown off-course and traveled back over the Malay Peninsula and out into the Indian Ocean. It's another good lead in the hunt for the missing plane. The Thai information bolsters the search in the southern arc, over the Indian Ocean. But a search of the Strait of Malacca yields nothing. March 19 . A U.S. official familiar with the investigation tells CNN that based on present search patterns and available data, it's far more likely that the plane would be located in the southern arc. Based on U.S. data about the jet's fuel reserves, Australian authorities conduct a search about 1,600 miles off their western coast. In fact, investigators spot two objects in the Indian Ocean that could be related to the missing plane, Australian officials say. It's the best lead for the moment. The Royal Australian Air Force and U.S. aircraft are sent to investigate -- but the search area is so far from land, that the planes can only search for two to three hours before they have to return to land for refueling. Potential clues demand time. March 22 . Three days later, a land-and-sea search involving several countries continues for any sign of debris off Australia. The hunt is even taking place in outer space -- with satellite photos of the surface below. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says there's no shortage of leads -- just no results. He's optimistic, however. ""We have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope, no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,"" Abbott says. Still, there's no sight of the reported two parcels. Experts wonder whether the two objects were part of the junk swirling in a vast Indian Ocean gyre, or rotating currents. March 23 . France's Foreign Ministry cites radar data from a satellite showing material floating in the Indian Ocean about 1,430 miles off Perth, Australia. In all, the satellite images by a French defense firm show 122 floating objects. Could this be signs of the wreckage? The problem is, they're scattered over 154 square miles, about the size of Denver, Colorado. March 26 . Search aircraft spotted three objects drifting in the sea, Australia officials say. But search teams aren't able to locate them on subsequent passes, officials add. It's the same story with two objects spotted by a civil aircraft. And a blue object sighted by a New Zealand military plane. None could be found again on a second pass. If that's not enough, a Thai satellite locates 300 floating objects, including a big one measuring 50 feet by 6 feet, Thai officials say. They are just 125 miles from the French satellite's sighting of 122 objects. Then, the Japanese government says one of its intelligence satellites identified 10 floating objects, the largest of which is 13 feet by 26 feet. They're also floating near the other satellite sightings, some 1,550 miles off western Australia. There are so many leads, it's dizzying. Perhaps the day's most dispiriting news is that crews can't find a 75-foot-long object that was captured in satellite images provided by Airbus Defence and Space. Could it have been part of the plane's wing, experts asked? The only good news is there's no shortage of potential clues. The bad news is, nothing comes of them. March 27 . The search moves to a different patch of the ocean -- 680 miles northeast of the primary area of focus -- because of ""a new credible lead"" provided by Malaysian investigators, Australian officials say. The new information is based on an analysis of radar data on the day the plane disappeared and suggests the aircraft was traveling faster than previously estimated before it dropped off radar, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. This means the plane burned fuel faster, shortening its maximum possible distance over the southern Indian Ocean. The advantage is the search moves closer to the Australian coast, making the area easier for planes to reach. Jets can now spend more time searching. March 28 . Aircraft spot possible debris in the new search field. In fact, CNN's Kyung Lah is embedded aboard a New Zealand military plane that sights 11 small objects drifting at sea. ""At one point, sure, everybody on board got a little excited, but it's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is,"" she says. But it's the same story: a dead end. March 29 . A Chinese war ship and a second vessel retrieve objects from the ocean, Australian officials say. Also, a Chinese plane crew drops buoys to mark three suspected debris sites, China's state-run media reports. But they're all blind alleys leading to nowhere. Some of the objects retrieved by the ships were merely fishing gear. March 30 . Australian aircraft put an eye on four orange items bobbing in the water. Crews take photos and send back coordinates. One item is 6.5 feet long. The discovery become one of the ""most promising leads"" in the new search area, says Australian Flight Lt. Russell Adams. But it ends as a hope dashed. The promise doesn't deliver. Australian Prime Ministry Tony Abbott stands undaunted, however. ""We are searching a vast area of ocean, and we are working on quite limited information. Nevertheless, the best brains in the world are applying themselves to this task,"" Abbott says. ""If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it."" The search, however, is now approaching its fourth week. April 2 . Under growing criticism at home, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak pledges to get to the bottom of the plane mystery -- if not the ocean itself. ""We want to provide comfort to the families, and we will not rest until answers are indeed found,"" he says. The mission, however, could last longer than initially thought. ""We'll keep going til hell freezes over,"" Kim Beazley, Australia's former defense minister and current ambassador to the United States, tells CNN. ""It could take months, it could take years."" April 4 . Time is running out. The plane's black box -- the cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- has enough battery life to last 30 days, at most. After 30 days, the black box's locator beacons -- known as pingers -- will die. In other words, the plane will no longer be able to make an electronic cry for help. We're now on Day 28. Saturday, April 5 . Crews are now searching for the plane on a prayer that the pingers will last long enough for search teams to find them. Will that miracle arrive? As if a godsend, a pulse is heard rising from the Indian Ocean by a Chinese ship in the search area, Australian officials say. The pulse carries the same standard beacon frequency as the black box: 37.5 kHz, according to a China Central Television correspondent aboard the Haixun-01 (pronounced ""high shuen""). The Chinese ship heard it for a minute and a half but couldn't record it, a Shanghai-based Communist Party newspaper reports. After so many false starts, has the revelatory lead finally arrived? It's not out of the question, experts say.","The long list of leads in the search for Flight 370 spins a dramatic narrative .
All of the reported objects floating in the ocean have proven to be false leads .

"(CNN) -- Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell on Tuesday night tried to sell the American public on the virtues of having the GOP in charge of states. In a speech at the Republican National Convention, McDonnell said that unemployment was lower in states led by Republican governors than in those headed by Democrats. CNN Fact Check: Santorum misleads on 'dependence' The statement: . ""In states with Republican governors, the average unemployment rate is a full point lower than in states with Democratic governors. It makes a difference. Republican governors lead seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates. And 12 of the 15 states that have been ranked 'best for business' have Republican governors."" The facts: . A quick check of the governors' party affiliations shows 29 states with GOP governors, 20 states with Democratic governors, and one state headed by an independent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' preliminary, seasonally adjusted data for July 2012, 7.84% of the civilian labor in the 29 states with Republican governors were unemployed (6,680,400 out of 85,155,600). The same data set shows that 8.77% of the 20 states with Democratic governors were unemployed (6,032,500 out of 68,792,500). The national unemployment rate was 8.3%. CNN Fact Check: Obama and Romney's energy policies . The difference between 7.84% and 8.77% isn't a full point, though it is close. However, there's nothing in the data itself to show a causal relation. It's also worth noting that in 11 of the Republican-led states, the party has had control of the governorship for less than 19 months. It is true that, according to the July 2012 BLS data, seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates have Republican governors, led by North Dakota, with 3.0%.: . 1) North Dakota (R) 3% . 2) Nebraska (R) 4% . 3) South Dakota (R) 4.4% . 4) Oklahoma (R) 4.9% . 5) Vermont (D) 5% . 6) Iowa (R) 5.3% . 7) New Hampshire (D) 5.4% . 8) Wyoming (R) 5.6% . 9) Minnesota (D) 5.8% . 10) Virginia (R) 5.9% . In four of those Republican-led states (including McDonnell's Virginia), Republicans have held the governorship for less than 19 months. The same is true for two of the three Democrat-led states. As for the ""best for business"" claim, a McDonnell spokesman said the governor was referring to ""CNBC's America's Top States for Business 2012"" list. The criteria include rankings for workforce, quality of life, economy, infrastructure and transportation, access to capital and cost of living. We'll not go deeper into how CNBC arrived at its rankings, or how much governors' actions affected those rankings, but McDonnell's statement that 12 of the list's top 15 states have Republican governors is correct. In five of those states, Republicans have held the governorship for less than two years. The same was true for Democrats in one state. Verdict: True, but incomplete.

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. Marine who languished for more than four months in a Mexican prison on a questionable gun charge was on his way to spending Christmas with his family Friday after U.S. politicians intervened for his release. Jon Hammar, 27, was released from a facility in the border town of Matamoros, just across from Brownsville, Texas, said U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida. ""These past few months have been an absolute nightmare for Jon and his family, and I am so relieved that this whole ordeal will soon be over,"" the congresswoman said in a statement. She represents the family's South Florida district. U.S. consular officials met Hammar at the prison and escorted him to the border, where he was reunited with members of his family, U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said. It was August when Hammar, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, crossed the border on his way to Costa Rica. He was going to go surfing with a fellow veteran and stopped in Matamoros to get gas, his family said. Along with his surfboards, Hammar took an antique shotgun handed down from his great-grandfather. His parents said that Hammar intended to hunt with it, and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection told him he could bring the gun into Mexico if it was registered and a fee was paid. But after he drove his Winnebago to the Mexican side, authorities arrested him, saying the weapon did not comply with their gun laws. Olivia Hammar said her son was charged with possession of a weapon restricted for military use. A branch of the Mexican military said the gun is not on its ""forbidden list,"" she said, but her son remained incarcerated. A few nights after Hammar's arrest, his parents received the first of several threatening calls from behind bars, they said. ""He said: 'I have your son,' "" Olivia Hammar recalled, tearing up. ""I am going to f--- him up. I already have."" Then she heard her son's voice. ""He said: 'Mom, you've got to do what they say; they're really serious.' "" The voice at the other end of the line asked for $1,800. For the first few months, Hammar's family kept his plight out of the public eye, fearing media attention would cause him harm in prison. They finally came forward in hopes of getting Mexican authorities to act. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, stepped in on Hammar's behalf, speaking to Mexico's ambassador to the United States. They managed to get him out of the general prison population so he would be away from dangerous inmates. Hammar was moved to what Nelson said was like an administrative location. But because of the low security at the new facility, which Olivia Hammar described as a storage shed, officials periodically chained Hammar to his bed. The Hammars recently turned to Ros-Lehtinen, who heads the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. She called the situation ""outrageous"" and took up the matter with the State Department, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and the Mexican ambassador. ""I am overcome with joy knowing that Jon will be spending Christmas with his parents, family and friends,"" she said Friday night. A defense lawyer said it was determined Hammar had no intent to commit a crime, Nelson said Friday. ""No American should be in a Mexican jail for five months without being able to have his case in front of a judge,"" Nelson said in a statement. ""We're grateful; this is a good Christmas present."" The family said they will spend the holiday ""bathed in gratitude"" to all those who worked to free their son and gave them support while he was behind bars. They said they would give no interviews until after the holidays. ""The only expression that captures how we feel today is that 'our cup runneth over,'"" the family said. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Melissa Gray, and Foreign Affairs Reporter Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Hammar meets his family at the border .

"(CNN) -- UEFA's decision to fine Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner for revealing a sponsor's name on his underpants during a Euro 2012 game may have opened a can of worms for football's European governing body. Bendtner was fined $126,000 and banned from playing in Denmark's next competitive game for flashing his sponsored waistband as he celebrated a goal against Portugal. For Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, who has announced it will pay the fine on Bendtner's behalf, the hefty fee probably represents good value for the publicity the stunt has gained. Already, Paddy Power has announced on its website that Bendtner was wearing ""lucky pants."" But a leading expert in sports business has warned that any form of ""ambush marketing"" has a danger of backfiring. Ronaldo double dumps out Dutch, Danes also exit . ""For brands entering into sports sponsorship, it's all about eyeballs,"" said Simon Chadwick, professor in sports business strategy at England's Coventry University. ""It's likely Bendtner's celebration was seen by at least 100 million pairs of eyes worldwide so that represents a very cost-effective piece of sponsorship. ""The beauty of guerrilla sponsorship is not just in the execution but in the potential fallout and publicity that follows. The fact that Bendtner was fined and that we are all talking about it delivers value for money that other traditional methods could not provide."" But there are potential downsides too, Chadwick warns, not least the fact that Bendtner's fine eclipses the $31,000 UEFA fined the Croatian Football Federation for disturbances in their match against the Republic of Ireland. Recap 'Group of Death' dramatic finale . The Russian Football Federation was on Monday fined $37,000 after the setting off and throwing fireworks, displaying illicit banners and the invasion of the pitch by a supporter during the Group A match against Poland in Warsaw. That punishment followed a fine of $150,000 and a suspended six-point deduction for the improper behavior of Russia's fans during the match against the Czech Republic. Already, Denmark fans are questioning why their striker has been fined more for flashing his underpants than nations whose fans have been involved in serious crowd disturbances. Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, left out of England's squad for the tournament, weighed in on the matter on Twitter, accusing UEFA of not prioritizing tackling racism. ""UEFA are you for real??? £80,000 fine for Bendtner for underwear advertising....all of the racism fines together don't even add up to that?!"" the 33-year-old said via his official @rioferdy5 account. ""UEFA are not serious...Platini was a great player but him & his colleagues alienate themselves with exactly this type of rubbish #priorities. ""If racism made money for UEFA like advertising does do you think UEFA would take it as serious?? #priorities"" The Croatian Football Federation is also under investigation into alleged racist chanting by its fans in the match against Italy, and Chadwick warned: ""There is always a danger that people react adversely to a firm involved in ambush marketing and the real danger here is that the sponsor could become embroiled in a potential race row. ""The results of guerrilla marketing can be spectacular, but there is always the danger of becoming embroiled in a much broader agenda. In that sense, it is a bit of a gamble."" As one of Europe's fastest growing bookmakers, Paddy Power is well versed in what represents a worthwhile gamble. But it was quick to react to the punishment handed out, labeling it: ""A hysterical and deeply cynical move by UEFA dictated by pure commercialism."" Chadwick tweeted in response that those comments could equally have been made by UEFA towards Paddy Power. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body imposed the fine and suspension from the next competitive international match for which Bendtner is eligible, and has given the striker three days to appeal. But it's not just UEFA that Bendtner has offended by revealing his lucky pants -- Paddy Power's bookmaker rival Ladbrokes is an official sponsor of the Danish national team. One way or another, the story is unlikely to be over just yet -- and that is either good news or bad for the sponsor, depending on which way you look at it. ""As the reasoned decision concerning the Bendtner case has not been sent to the player yet, we are not in a position to comment on the matter,"" said UEFA in a statement.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't easy but Arsenal fans might not mind. Arsenal beat defending champion Wigan 4-2 on penalties at Wembley on Saturday to reach the FA Cup final and move a step closer to potentially ending a nine-year trophy drought. Having given away a penalty early in the second half -- converted by Jordi Gomez -- Arsenal's Per Mertesacker then atoned for his mistake by scoring to send the game to extra time. Backup Arsenal keeper Lukasz Fabianski shone in the shootout, saving Wigan's first two kicks. The win must have been a relief for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who is under pressure to deliver silverware after the Gunners faded badly in the Premier League title race. His contract is due to expire at the end of the campaign. For Wigan, it can now fully concentrate on earning promotion back to the Premier League, safely in a playoff spot in the second tier. Wenger raised eyebrows when he started 21-year-old Yaya Sanogo up front instead of top scorer Olivier Giroud, even though the French under-21 international hadn't found the back of the net in nine previous games this season. The gamble didn't pay off. Sanogo's header in the fifth minute from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's perfect cross -- Oxlade-Chamberlain sparkled in the first half -- was hit straight at Scott Carson and the striker's poor first touch when he was put through allowed the former England starter to make another save late in the half. The game opened up in the second half, with Arsenal doing the early pressing. But winger Callum McManaman, man of the match from last year's FA Cup final, burst into the box and went down under a challenge from Mertesacker to alter the momentum. Referee Michael Oliver paused before pointing to the spot and Gomez held his nerve to beat Fabianski in the 63rd minute, despite having to wait more than three minutes to take the penalty. Another upset -- Wigan ousted Manchester City in the quarterfinals -- was on the cards. Wenger responded by taking off German international Lukas Podolski -- one of Arsenal's liveliest players on the day -- for Giroud, a decision booed by some Arsenal supporters. A botched Wigan clearance allowed Oxlade-Chamberlain to deliver another cross in the 80th minute and fullback Bacary Sagna hit the post. Arsenal continued to press and only two minutes later Carson saved from Kieran Gibbs' header -- with Stephen Crainey clearing off the line as the ball went towards goal. The pressure paid off in the 82nd minute, however, Mertesacker heading home Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. Extra time proved to be less frenetic, although Oxlade-Chamberlain's swerving shot struck the woodwork and Wigan's Jack Collison sent his header from a good position in the box wide. Wigan manager Uwe Rosler elected to save Gomez for later in the penalty shootout and the move backfired. Fabianski stopped Gary Caldwell and Collison to put Wigan in an immediate hole and Santi Cazorla officially booked Arsenal's ticket to the final when he beat Carson. Arsenal faces either Hull City or third-tier Sheffield United -- they play Sunday -- in next month's final. But it wasn't all good news for Arsenal on Saturday. Everton overtook Arsenal for fourth in the Premier League -- the final Champions League spot -- after blanking last-place Sunderland 1-0 for a sixth consecutive victory. Wes Brown's own goal in the second half handed all three points to the visiting Toffees. With none of the title contenders playing until Sunday, attention mostly turned to the bottom of the table. Fulham beat Norwich 1-0 to move within two points of the road weary Canaries, who occupy the final safety spot. Crystal Palace boosted its survival hopes by topping struggling Aston Villa 1-0, Cardiff City got a much needed win by surprising Southampton 1-0 away and Newcastle lost a fourth straight, 1-0 at Stoke. For the second time in two weeks at home, West Bromwich Albion could only manage a 3-3 draw after taking an early 2-0 lead, this time against Tottenham. Dropped points for Spurs, though, dented their Champions League ambitions. League leader Liverpool hosts third-place Manchester City on Sunday while second-place Chelsea travels to Swansea.","Arsenal wins FA Cup semi to move a step closer to ending its nine-year title drought .

"(Health.com) -- People with chronic pain who aren't getting enough relief from medications may be able to ease their pain by smoking small amounts of marijuana, a new study suggests. Marijuana also helps pain patients fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly, according to the report, one of the first real-world studies to look at the medicinal use of smoked marijuana. Most previous research has used extracts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in the cannabis plant. ""This is the first time anyone has done a trial of smoked cannabis on an outpatient basis,"" says the lead researcher, Mark Ware, M.B.B.S., the director of clinical research at McGill University's Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain, in Montreal. Health.com: Medicinal marijuana, state by state . The study included 21 adults with nervous-system (neuropathic) pain stemming from surgery, accidents, or other trauma. Fourteen of the participants were on short-term disability or permanently disabled. All of them had tried marijuana before, but none were current or habitual smokers. ""They were not experienced marijuana users,"" Ware says. ""They came because they had severe pain that was not responding to any conventional treatment."" Each patient in the study smoked four different strengths of marijuana over a period of 56 days. The THC potency ranged from 9.4 percent -- the strongest dose the researchers could obtain legally -- to 0 percent, a ""placebo"" pot that looked and tasted like the real thing but was stripped of THC. (By comparison, the strongest marijuana available on the street has a THC potency of about 15 percent, Ware estimates.) Health.com: Medical marijuana may help fibromyalgia pain . The participants -- who weren't told which strength they were getting -- were instructed to smoke a thimbleful (25 milligrams) from a small pipe three times a day for five days. After a nine-day break, they switched to a different potency. The highest dose of THC yielded the best results. It lessened pain and improved sleep more effectively than the placebo and the two medium-strength doses (which produced no measurable relief), and it also reduced anxiety and depression. The effects lasted for about 90 minutes to two hours, according to the study. The results were published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Health.com: 8 natural remedies to help you sleep . Though small, the study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that cannabis has painkilling properties that may be useful in medicine, perhaps in addition to other treatments. THC extracts have been shown to help ease cancer pain and the nausea associated with chemotherapy, while a few small studies in hospital populations have found that smoked marijuana can help relieve neuropathic pain. But medical marijuana isn't ready to become a mainstream chronic pain treatment, says Andrew McDavid, M.D., director of the division of pain management at Scott & White Healthcare, in Temple, Texas. ""The studies out there show some decrease in pain, but it's not alarmingly or shockingly great,"" says McDavid, who was not involved in the new research. ""Although it may have some use, it's probably going to need to be used with something else, if it's approved."" As the study notes, the pain relief the patients experienced from marijuana was modest compared to that seen in studies of analgesic medications such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica). Health.com: 6 mistakes pain patients make . Christopher Gharibo, M.D., an anesthesiologist at the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, in New York City, points out that the study didn't address whether marijuana enabled the patients to perform everyday activities without pain -- the best test of a chronic pain treatment. ""I'm not convinced [marijuana] helps from a functional standpoint,"" he says. ""I'm not even impressed by the pain reduction. We have analgesics that do much better.""

"(CNN) -- Egypt's Tahrir Square was supposed to be a scene of celebration on Sunday, as Cairo marked the election of a new president. But it wasn't a joyous night for everyone: At least five women were sexually assaulted by mobs in the square, according to Egypt's campaign group I Saw Harassment. In India, meanwhile, politicians have downplayed rape, with one recently saying: ""Boys will be boys."" And of course, war has long been connected with the rape of women, men, boys and girls. Actress and activist Angelina Jolie is lending star power to the ""End Sexual Violence in Conflict"" conference organized by Britain's Foreign Office in London this week, highlighting a global problem. Worldwide: One in three women worldwide has experienced sexual abuse or violence; 150 million girls under the age of 18 have been sexually assaulted. Half were under 16 at the time. Democratic Republic of Congo: Nearly two out of three women (64%) say their first sexual experience was assault. Kenya: It's estimated that one in three women suffered sexual violence in childhood. (One-fifth of men are estimated to have been victims of sexual violence as children.) Bosnia-Herzegovina: Between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped during the war of 1992-1995.

"(CNN) -- The world's fastest man on a pair of skis just got faster. On Monday Italian Simone Origone broke his own speed skiing world record as he reached 252.4 kilometers per hour on the Chabrieres slopes in the French Alps -- an achievement confirmed by organizers France Ski de Vitesse. With a 1,220 m slope that has a maximum gradient of 98% and an average of 52.5%, Chabrieres is not for the faint-hearted. Traveling at over 250 km/h is a privilege usually reserved for Formula One drivers, yet speed skier Origone was equipped with just an aerodynamic helmet to increase streamlining and a ski suit made from air-tight latex to reduce wind resistance. Origone's one nod to safety was wearing a back protector in case of a crash as he threw himself down the one kilometer track. Origone has been the fastest speed skier on the globe since April 2006, having set a then-new world record of 251.4 km/h at Les Arcs. Bastien Montes of France was Origone's closest challenger on Monday, but even the Frenhcman's new personal best of 248.105 km/h was someway short of the Italian's 2006 world record, let alone his latest one. ""Simone Origone is the greatest champion of all time, he is the only person to hold the record for two ski speeds in France -- Les Arcs and Vars Chabrieres. This is a historic day,"" technical director of Speed Masters Philippe Billy told Vars.com. The 34-year-old Origone -- a ski instructor, mountain guide and rescuer by day -- only took up the discipline in 2003, having given up downhill skiing in 1999. ""Now that I have twice won the world record, I can say that I have made history,"" Origone told Vars.com.

"(CNN) -- American investigators reviewing a hard drive belonging to the captain of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have found that there were deletions of information even closer to the final flight than first indicated by Malaysian officials, U.S. law enforcement officials tell CNN. The forensic search of the computer files by government experts found files were removed even after February 3, the date Malaysian authorities have cited for when some data was cleared from the drive of the captain. Investigators are examining the contents of drives belonging to both pilots. Copies of the hard drives are at the FBI's forensics lab facilities in Quantico, Virginia, and one is being analyzed with the assistance of consultants the FBI uses to help analyze such electronic data. It's not clear why Malaysian officials cited the February 3 date and if they knew of the other deletions. The type of software used for flight simulation takes up a lot of room in hard drives and investigators believe that could be one reason for deletion of files. It's possible too that some damage could have been done during the first examinations done by Malaysian investigators. Law enforcement officials say that they aren't drawing any conclusions about the subsequent deletions, or the earlier ones, just two days into reviewing the hard drive contents, which officials described as a large volume of data. More couldn't be learned about the nature of the deletions, and who made them. Some senior U.S. counterterrorism officials say that an accident is the leading operative theory as cause for the disappearance of Flight 370. That's because there is no other information indicating foul play. ""Barring other information to suggest otherwise one has to first think this was a tragic accident,"" a U.S. law enforcement official said. But investigators have not ruled out terrorism or other theories. Investigators have focused on the pilots because of the lack of any other information. But there isn't proof that they did anything wrong. U.S. investigators have compiled profiles of the two pilots, based on interviews with friends, neighbors and family members conducted by Malaysian investigators, and on a search of their online activities, U.S. officials say. Those interviews haven't turned up anything that could suggest any explanations for the plane's disappearance. U.S. investigators also are concerned about the preservation of evidence in Malaysia. Malaysian authorities waited six days to search the pilots' homes. This was enough time, U.S. officials believe, for someone who had access to the homes perhaps to have tampered with evidence. They don't know if there was any tampering but it is a worry because Malaysian officials didn't appear to secure evidence immediately. U.S. officials say they understand that there are Malaysian legal restrictions and requirements for probable cause before such searches. The difference in procedures is a common issue in international investigations such as this.","U.S. investigators found evidence files deleted even after February 3 .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- To set foot on Mount Everest is to risk death. Mountaineering tourists and their native Nepali guides both have this on their minds, as they straddle cavernous ravines in the ice. But nothing could have prepared American climber Jon Reiter for last week's avalanche, the deadliest accident in the history of the world's highest peak. ""We've all seen death on the mountains,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Wednesday. But to see so many limp bodies hanging from cables as helicopters brought them down the mountain shocked him. Reiter was one of the fortunate ones. His Sherpa guide, Dawa, shoved him behind an ice block when the icy avalanche thundered down, killing 13 Sherpa guides Friday. Three more Sherpas are missing and feared dead. Buddhist clergy commended all 16 souls Monday in a religious ceremony. The search for those still missing has been suspended, and it is doubtful it will resume, Nepalese officials said. 'Get down!' ""Get down! Get down!"" Reiter heard Dawa Sherpa yell before the ice rushed past him. The moment was like a flash, but Reiter remembers it in detail. ""You're already in the icefall, which is a pretty sketchy place,"" he said. The possibility of danger in the shifting and changing ice masses riddled with fissures had his instincts on alert. ""You're crossing ladders and crevasses, and you're pretty aware of your surroundings,"" he said. Climbers are used to looking out to avoid getting hit by falling ice blocks, he said. But when the ice avalanche broke loose from the Khumbu Icefall, it sent his mind racing. ""You could see it. I heard it, and I looked up, and I saw it break off the side of a shoulder, and you heard it crash down."" Seconds later, the valley was full of ice boulders; the path up the mountain obscured. His Sherpa had saved his life. Then Reiter asked himself: Is anyone under the ice? Selfless Sherpas . Nearly a third of the group of 50 that had set out up the icefall was missing. Radios began squawking, and Reiter heard terror in the Sherpas' voices as they spoke. Dawa Sherpa was still standing. ""He did not dive himself,"" Reiter said. Dawa tended to Reiter first. Then, the guide with 24 years of experience embarked on the grimmest task of his career. ""He spent his whole day that day digging his friends out of the snow and hooking them up to cables and flying them down the mountain,"" Reiter said. At the end of a 16-hour day, Dawa Sherpa came by Reiter's tent before heading to bed to see if he was all right. ""These are such selfless people,"" Reiter said. Emotional rubble . The mountaineering group milled around base camp Wednesday with a lot on their minds -- especially the families of the Sherpas who died. ""All those kids, whose dads aren't coming home,"" he said. Many Sherpas left the camp to attend funerals and bury their dead friends. Most did not return, but Dawa came back to talk to Reiter. He told the American climber that he wanted to stand by his side but that he could not continue. ""Jon, I just can't go back up that hill"" were his words, Reiter said. Death has climbers taking inner inventory, Reiter said. ""Thinking, reassessing life, reassessing our values."" Lifeblood . But as the mountain can be deadly for the ethnic group indigenous to the cold peaks of the Himalayas, it is also the Sherpas' lifeblood. Leading expeditions is how they feed their families. For many, the guides are the only breadwinners. Ngima Sherpa, 26, for example, supported his three younger siblings and mother from the money he made taking foreign nationals around the mountain. He was among the 13 dead whose bodies were taken around Kathmandu in a funeral procession Monday. Ultimately, the guides may decide to forge ahead, but they may be out of business already. ""The major expeditions pulled the plug,"" Reiter said. He predicted Everest would close to climbers this year. At least six companies that lead Everest expeditions have called off their 2014 climbs. Emily Turner, a spokeswoman for Alpine Glow in California told CNN: ""This is completely unique. Nothing like this (number of cancellations) has ever happened."" And peak season is just beginning. Between May 15 and 30 is usually the best window for reaching the peak. Foreign climbers spend between $40,000 and $90,000 each in their attempt to scale the mountain. Nepal's government rakes in about $3 million from Everest climbers during the high season. Sherpas make up to $6,000 per season. They also usually get a summit bonus if their clients reach the top of the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain. Now they want to be paid in full even if the climbs are abandoned. Discovery calls off coverage of Everest wingsuit jump . Mounting deaths . The mountain guides are not looking to quit their work, but they feel more is due to them for the risk they take. They want to know that they're covered if something like this happens to them. They want higher life insurance payouts. ""It's overdue,"" Reiter said. Climbers want to see the Sherpas' demands met. Until the late 1970s, only a handful of climbers reached the top each year. The number topped 100 for the first time in 1993. By 2004, it was more than 300. In 2012, the number was more than 500. The deadliest year on Everest was 1996, when 15 people died. Another 12 climbers were killed in 2006. Reiter doesn't think any of the climbers at the base camp would be able to reach the top of Everest this year. The focus it takes to survive, he said, is gone.

"(CNN) -- The plight of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who could die within weeks without a lung transplant has sparked a fight for new rules governing organ donations. Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on Change.org, and a congressman has called on the Obama administration to take quick action. Sarah Murnaghan -- whose story CNN chronicled -- needs new lungs. She's been in a Philadelphia hospital for months due to the cystic fibrosis that she's had since birth. She's at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her region. She's been waiting for 18 months. None have come along. But doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often. That's where the rules becomes a problem. Kids under age 12 aren't prioritized for adult organs. So Sarah could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down. Sarah's mother, Janet Murnaghan, told CNN she was ""shocked"" when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) manages the nation's transplant system under contract with the Department of Health and Human Services. The network, established by Congress, is officially called the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). Lawmaker assails 'tragic unfairness' Rep. Patrick Meehan, a Republican who represents Sarah's district, sent a letter Tuesday to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, calling on her to convene a meeting of the network's leadership immediately ""to address this tragic unfairness and act to give Sarah a chance at life and an adult lung from the next available donor. Sarah's young life literally hangs in the balance."" It's a message echoed on the Change.org petition. ""This policy needs to change,"" it reads. ""The OPTN/UNOS Lung Review Board, a national group of transplant physicians and surgeons, can make an exceptional ruling for Sarah. And they can recommend new policies."" People posted heartfelt messages along with their signatures. ""Because my daughter had (cystic fibrosis) and a double lung transplant. Give this little girl the life she is entitled to!"" wrote Reyna Kosla. ""She has just as much right to have a transplant as any adult. She could have her whole life if given that chance and for the parents to enjoy what some waiting adults have already experienced,"" wrote Lorraine Husack. Organ network: Breaking the rules could hurt another patient . OPTN issued a statement noting that there is a separate policy for children because the ""biological needs and circumstances of candidates younger than age 12 are different from either adolescent or adult candidates. One key difference is the size and lung capacity of donors and patients among these age ranges."" Kids younger than age 12 are prioritized for donations from other kids of similar age and size within a 1,000-mile radius. Policies allow ""status adjustments for specifically defined groups of candidates with unique medical circumstances not addressed by the overall policy,"" the statement says. But, it adds, a ""request to adjust the status of a patient under age 12 so that they may be included in the allocation sequence for adolescents and adults is not within the scope of the existing lung allocation policy. OPTN cannot create a policy exemption on behalf of an individual patient, since giving an advantage to one patient may unduly disadvantage others."" The network routinely reviews policies and considers ""public input as well as medical data and experience,"" the statement said. Dr. Stuart Sweet, a board member at UNOS, helped develop the current policies. ""There is no perfect system,"" he told CNN. ""It's the best we can do right now."" Sweet said Sarah's story ""tugs at his heart"" but that if he changed the system for Sarah's advantage, ""there's another patient, very likely an adolescent, who gets a disadvantage."" ""We've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible."" CNN's Chris Welch, Zain Asher, and Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan could die within weeks if she doesn't get new lungs .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday denied the appeal of a New York Times journalist who has refused to testify about anonymous sources in a federal leak investigation. The justices refused to intervene in the case alleging that James Risen used classified information about efforts to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon in his 2006 book, ""State of War."" Last year, a federal court ruled that he would have to testify in the trial of a former CIA officer, Jeffrey Alexander Sterling, who faces criminal charges in the matter. Risen appealed and lost before asking the Supreme Court to weigh in. The justices issued their ruling without comment. He faces the possibility of fines or jail if his testimony is sought again and he refuses to comply. ""The ball is now in the government's court,"" said Risen's attorney, Joel Kurtzberg. ""The government can choose not to pursue Mr. Risen's testimony if it wants to. ""We can only hope now that the government will not seek to have him held in contempt for doing nothing more than reporting the news and keeping his promises,"" Kurtzberg said. Controversy over the Obama administration's aggressive pursuit of information from journalists in national security leak cases involving The Associated Press and Fox News made headlines last year. Attorney General Eric Holder met with media executives and later changed agency policy on when prosecutors can seek records or other information from journalists in leak investigations. For instance, the Justice Department can no longer pursue journalists in these matters unless a reporter is the subject of a criminal investigation for conduct unrelated to news gathering. The Supreme Court decision and what it may mean for Risen is troubling, said the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ""We are extremely disappointed that the Supreme Court declined this opportunity to uphold journalists' ability to protect confidential sources, which is an essential tool utilized by a free press in newsgathering for the public trust,"" the group said. ""The lower court's ruling sends an undeniable chill through current and future news sources who would want to come forward with information essential to the well-being of the community and the country."" It had organized a letter sent the to Justice Department that was signed by 46 news organizations, including CNN, . Reporters have pushed for a federal shield law for the press, and clear guidelines from the government. The federal appeals court panel that ruled against Risen said the First Amendment does not provide a shield from testimony about leaks of classified information. ""Indeed, he can provide the only first-hand account of the commission of a most serious crime indicted by the grand jury -- the illegal disclosure of classified, national security information by one who was entrusted by our government to protect national security, but who is charged with having endangered it instead,"" said the appeals court's majority. ""The subpoena for Risen's testimony was not issued in bad faith or for the purposes of harassment."" The indictment against Sterling was unsealed in January 2011. It included Espionage Act charges that he revealed national defense information. His case has not gone to trial and has been delayed while both sides waited for the pending appeal at the high court. Sterling, who is African American, resigned from the CIA in January 2002 and filed a suit against the agency, alleging racial discrimination. He had previously filed an administrative complaint that the CIA had not given him certain assignments due to his race. The complaint and the suit were both later dismissed. Prosecutors allege that Sterling leaked information to a reporter because he was unhappy about his treatment at the CIA. The case is Risen v. U.S. (13-1009). CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","New York Times journalist James Risen has refused to testify in leak case .

"(CNN) -- Philadelphia's 218 public schools may not open on time in September unless the district receives $50 million from the city by Friday, Superintendent William Hite says. Hite gave the city the ultimatum after the layoff of close to 3,800 employees this summer due to a ""drastic financial shortfall."" The massive layoffs included aides, assistant principals, social workers and arts teachers. If the city doesn't pay up by Friday, Hite says, the district may not be able to open all 218 schools for a full-day program on September 9. ""Without the funds to restore crucial staff members, we cannot open functional schools, run them responsibly or provide a quality education to students,"" Hite said. Mayor Michael Nutter called it one of ""the most chilling"" statements he had ever heard a superintendent make, but he said stands ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Hite and will not allow schools to open with the staff that he can currently afford. Hite and Nutter have urged the City Council to extend a 1% sales tax to make up the difference but -- despite approval from the General Assembly and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett -- City Council President Darrell L. Clarke says he would rather focus those funds on the city's critical pension problem. If the city does not solve the retirement fund issues, Clarke said, Philadelphia could quickly follow in the footsteps of other major cities with significant financial problems. As an alternative, Clarke proposed the city purchase the school district's surplus vacant real estate for $50 million and sell the property to developers who could turn it into potential job producers. Hite does not believe that will bring the district closer to financial stability, according to Fernando Gallard, spokesman for the school district. Hite and Nutter are also negotiating a contract with the local teachers' union, hoping to save money by asking teachers to make concessions on certain benefits. Because there has been no agreement with the union, $45 million in aid from the state previously allocated to the school district is being withheld. Once the negotiations are complete the funding will be released, Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said Tuesday. With Hite's Friday deadline looming, Mayor Nutter said he believes opening the school district without the necessary funding would be ""irresponsible."" ""We have what we have and we fight another day to get more,"" Nutter said.","The superintendent of Philadelphia public schools gives an ultimatum .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A bronze statue of Helen Keller was unveiled at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as lawmakers praised her as a trailblazer and an inspiration for those with disabilities. The Helen Keller statue depicts the moment when Anne Sullivan spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into the child's hand . ""Some are still dismissed and cast aside for nothing more than being less than perfect,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the unveiling ceremony. ""The story of Helen Keller inspires us all."" The statue shows Keller -- who lost her sight and hearing to illness when she was 19 months old -- standing at a water pump as a 7-year-old, a look of recognition on her face as water streams into her hand. It depicts the moment in 1887 when teacher Anne Sullivan spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into one of the child's hands as she held the other under the pump. It's the moment when Keller realized meanings were hidden in the manual alphabet shapes Sullivan had taught her to make with her hands. ""W-A-T-E-R,"" said Alabama Gov. Bob Riley. ""Five simple letters that helped rescue 7-year-old Helen Keller from a world of darkness and a world of silence. ""It is this defining moment that we celebrate today. And in time, this moment so vividly depicted by this statue helped the world to understand that all of us, regardless of any disability, have a mind that can be educated, a hand that can be trained, a life that will have meaning."" Keller learned to speak and earned a degree from Radcliffe College and the women's branch of Harvard University. She traveled the world as an adult, wrote 12 books and championed causes including women's suffrage and workers' rights. Carl Augusto, president and CEO of the American Foundation for the Blind, told the crowd he thinks Keller, who worked for the foundation for the last 44 years of her life, ""would have loved this impressive statue of herself and the symbolism attached."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and others assisted Augusto as he ran his hands over the statue. The foundation, Augusto said, still considers Keller ""our guiding light. She embodies the American spirit of limitless possibility ... her biggest desire was to leave the world a better place than she found it, and ladies and gentlemen, that's the legacy she leaves all of us."" More than 40 of Keller's descendants attended the ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Students from the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind sang a medley of patriotic songs. The statue, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, will ""always remind us that people must be respected for what they can do rather than judged for what they cannot."" The statue is also the Capitol's first depicting a child, Riley's office said. Since 1864, each state has been allowed to place two statues in the Capitol. In 2002, Congress changed the law to allow states to change their statues. Riley, then a U.S. representative, suggested the state place a statue of Keller, and the state Legislature passed a resolution asking Congress to accept a statue of Keller as a gift. A committee with Alabama first lady Patsy Riley serving as honorary chairwoman raised private donations and selected Utah bronze sculpture artist Edward Hlavka to create the piece. The 600-pound statue is made of bronze with a base of Alabama marble, Riley's office said. In 1997, a Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial that opened near the National Mall drew complaints from disability advocates because the statue of the president, who suffered from polio, did not show him in a wheelchair. In 2001, President Clinton unveiled an addition to the memorial including a new statue of the four-term president sitting in a wheelchair. ""By placing this statue in the Capitol, we appropriately honor this extraordinary American, and will inspire countless children who will come to understand that with faith and with courage, there truly are no limits on what can be accomplished, and there is no obstacle that can't be overcome,"" Riley said. Keller's statue will replace one depicting Jabez Curry. Curry, who has represented Alabama in the Capitol since 1908, was a Georgia native who served as president of Howard College, which later became Samford University in Birmingham. The Curry statue is being sent back to Alabama for display at the university. The other statue representing Alabama is of Joseph ""Fightin' Joe"" Wheeler, a Confederate general during the Civil War who, three decades later, volunteered to serve in the Spanish-American War at age 62 and attained the same rank in the U.S. Army, the only one of 425 Confederate generals to do so, according to a biography of him posted on the Fort Sam Houston Museum's Web site. His statue was donated by the state in 1925, Riley's office said.","Helen Keller lost her sight and hearing to illness when she was 19 months old .

"(CNN) -- Cara Cox was just 8 years old when she was taken by her father after a weekend visit, authorities say. It took more than four years for her to return to central Florida. Cara was in the legal custody of her mother, Jodie Borchert, when she vanished in August 2009. ""The arrangement was that he would drop the child off at a day care, and then she would go to day care and pick the child up,"" said Brandon Haught, a public information officer for the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. Aaron Cox never dropped Cara off at day care. They both vanished from Deltona. A missing persons report was filed for Cara, and an arrest warrant was issued for Cox, who was charged with interference with child custody, the Sheriff's Office said. For nearly four years, the Sheriff's Office said, there were ""no viable leads"" in the case. But deputies remained hopeful that Cara would be found. On Mother's Day of this year, Borchert posted to her Facebook page that she missed her daughter ""more than words could say."" She also asked Facebook friends to share a photo of how Cara could look now, at age 12. A break in the case came the next day, May 12, when a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children led authorities to a remote area of Hidalgo state in Mexico, two hours outside Mexico City, the Sheriff's Office said. On Friday morning, U.S. authorities went to the remote area, arrested Cox and recovered Cara. The father and daughter were almost, 1,700 miles from Cara's home in Deltona. Investigators say they were living under aliases and had no known ties to the area. After more than four years, the wait was finally over. Cara was reunited with her mother Saturday at Miami International Airport with a ""great big smile"" on her face, Haught told CNN affiliate WESH. Aaron Cox is under arrest in the Dade County Jail, WESH reported. He is waiting to be brought back to Volusia County on the interference with child custody charge. He is expected to be transferred by June 3 and is being held without bail, Volusia County officials said.

"(CNN) -- A New York woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to collecting a fraudulent $480,000 claim from One Fund Boston, a nonprofit that benefits victims of the Boston Marathon bombings, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. Audrea Gause, 27, pleaded guilty to a charge of larceny over $250 and was sentenced by a Superior Court judge to two and a half to three years in prison, according to a statement from state Attorney General Martha Coakley. ""It is disturbing that this defendant would attempt to steal from the real victims of the marathon bombing through fraud and deceit,"" Coakley said in a statement. Gause was awarded the $480,000 after submitting forged medical records in June 2013 indicating she had suffered a traumatic brain injury in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that resulted in long-term memory loss, impaired speech and the loss of some motor function that would require future surgery, the attorney general's office said. An investigation into Gause began after the Massachusetts attorney general received a tip that she was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, Coakley told a news conference in July. The attorney general's office said that the investigation determined that Gause was not a patient at Boston Medical Center on the day of the bombing nor Albany Medical Center at the times she had indicated on her notarized claim form. Investigators were later able to secure the nearly half a million dollars that Gause stole and will return it to One Fund Boston, according to the attorney general's office. The attorney general's office said it has charged two other individuals with attempted fraud of One Fund Boston and that both are awaiting trial. The One Fund Boston began distributing nearly $61 million to more than 200 claimants starting last June, according to the fund's website.","A woman pleaded guilty to scamming $480,000 from charity, attorney general says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- After being laid off from a corporate job, many people might use their severance money to pay bills or buy groceries. Keren Taylor used hers to launch a nonprofit. ""A lot of people were wondering what the hell I was doing,"" Taylor said. The former sales executive dipped into her savings and began working 18-hour days to start a creative writing program for at-risk teenagers in Los Angeles. ""Some of our girls face the greatest challenges teens could ever face: violence at home, violence in their community, huge schools with security guards in the parking lot and in the lunchroom,"" said Taylor, 50. ""They need to know that their voice is important. Their stories are important."" In the Los Angeles public schools, nearly one in five students drops out before high school graduation. In the last 12 years, Taylor's organization, WriteGirl, has helped around 500 girls graduate high school and go on to college. The power of a girl -- and her pen . This year, 350 girls from 60 area high schools are participating in Taylor's program. All the girls receive one-on-one mentoring to work on their writing, speaking skills and academics. This, Taylor says, gives them the confidence to speak up and reach out for help in school, in their relationships and at home. ""There are so many girls with so many heart-wrenching stories,"" Taylor said. ""I often wake up in the night thinking about them."" About 150 girls take part in the group's ""Core Program."" Some meet with a designated mentor every week; others attend monthly workshops for mentor support. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . Taylor expects all 60 of the seniors in the core program to enroll in college next year. ""We are working feverishly to make sure they all go to college, even though this is the biggest number that we've ever had,"" she said. The other participating students are critically at-risk: Many are pregnant, have children or are incarcerated. ""(Our van) takes our volunteers to them,"" Taylor said. ""That's been really exciting to bring the program to girls who otherwise wouldn't be able to come to us."" Finding their voice . Taylor says the program helps the girls improve their grades and their confidence. ""They can walk into a WriteGirl workshop and they're not going to get criticized, judged, graded, any of that,"" she said. ""They can just relax, let their ideas out and grow as individuals."" Anastasia said she was flunking classes until she was paired with a WriteGirl mentor who took the time to work with her every week. ""My grammar improved, my sentences were beyond amazing, so it was amazing how I transformed,"" said the 14-year-old. ""I used to get F's, and now I get A's, B's and C's."" ""A lot of our girls have those ah-ha moments, like, 'Wow, I could be a journalist.' Or 'I could go on to go to college outside of Los Angeles,' "" Taylor said. ""They have these eye-opening experiences that really give them a lot more hope about their future."" The talent pool . WriteGirl mentors include journalists, screenwriters, authors, poets and executives from varied backgrounds and ethnicities. Each is asked to commit at least one hour a week to their mentee. ""Some mentors say it's the most rewarding thing they've ever done,"" Taylor said. ""(They) tell us they get just as much as they give, if not more."" Mentors and mentees also participate in monthly programs that explore subjects such as poetry, journalism and screenwriting. The girls can also receive help with college applications. Each girl has the opportunity to submit their writing for publication. Taylor has directed the production of more than two dozen collections of works by teenage girls and their mentors. WriteGirl publications have received numerous awards. Taylor, who didn't take a salary for two years so the the program could get going, says she has no regrets about her decision to abandon the corporate world. ""I wanted to do something that would be inspiring and something that would have meaning for others,"" she said. ""I wake up every morning and I think about how we can make a greater impact.""

"(CNN) -- Every year there is talk of how the Champions League trophy will find itself lured back to Madrid for ""La Decima"" -- or the tenth as Real Madrid refers to it. That could very well be the case this season -- but perhaps it will reside at Vicente Calderon for the very first time and in the hands of Diego Simeone, the manager of Atletico Madrid. On Wednesday, his side produced a fine display to clinch its place in the semifinals of the Champions League and in doing so ended Barcelona's hopes in the competition. An early goal by talented playmaker Koke ensured Atletico recorded a 1-0 victory -- a result which gave the home side a 2-1 aggregate victory. Atletico, which was held to a 1-1 draw at Camp Nou in the first leg, should have had the game wrapped up by the interval after hitting the woodwork three times in the opening 20 minutes. Despite missing top scorer Diego Costa through injury, Atletico continued to look the more dangerous. Midfielder Gabi then missed a glorious opportunity in the second half to kill off any hopes of a Barcelona comeback but failed to score when in on goal. Barcelona's best opportunity came through midfielder Xavi but he failed to convert a rare chance in front of goal. While Barcelona has won the competition four times, Atletico has never managed to claim Europe's biggest prize -- losing out in its only appearance in the final to Bayern Munich in 1974. Now it has the opportunity to win not just La Liga, where it sits top with six games to go, but also the Champions League. ""It was a very important goal because it got us through to the semi-finals,"" Koke told Spanish broadcaster Canal Plus. ""The work of the team across both legs has been spectacular. ""We ran a huge amount, we played the two games in the way we wanted and I think we were the clear winners. ""With these fans behind us it is very hard for us to lose a match here."" Barcelona, which faces Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final on April 16, failed to impress despite the presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar in attack. Tata Martino's side will now switch its focus to the league title race with Real and Atletico also in contention. ""We had the game within our grasp,"" Barca midfielder Xavi said. ""We had four or five very clear chances that normally we would put away. ""They made the most of those first 15 to 20 minutes when they played with a lot of intensity and scored the goal,"" Xavi told Canal Plus. ""I think after that we stepped up to the challenge and deserved at least a draw. ""I think we played two good games and had our chances in both legs but it slipped through our fingers. ""We can only congratulate all the Atletico fans."" The two teams will meet again on the final day of the league season at Camp Nou -- a match which could be spectacular if this fixture is anything to go by. Bayern cruise . In the night's other game, Bayern Munich survived a scare against Manchester United to book its place in the semifinals. The defending champion overcame its English opposition 3-1 on the night, 4-2 on aggregate following an entertaining second half. Patrice Evra's fierce effort gave United a shock lead after 57 minutes but goals from Mario Mandzukic, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben sealed the win. There were few who gave United any chance whatsoever of making it through to the semifinals of the competition given its horrendous season in the Premier League. Last season, under Alex Ferguson, United won the league title by 11 points -- this year it sits seventh and faces a struggle to even claim a place in the Europa League. Thrashed at home by rivals Liverpool and Manchester City, United performed admirably to record a 1-1 draw in the first leg against a rampant Bayern side. The German giant swept all before it last season -- winning the domestic double as well as the Champions League under Jupp Heynckes. Pep Guardiola, who won the competition with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, has already wrapped up the league title after his side stormed past its rivals. Its first defeat in 54 league games came against Augsburg on Saturday -- although Guardiola had taken the opportunity to rest players ahead of the United game. Bayern, without suspended duo of Bastian Schewinsteiger and Javi Martinez, enjoyed plenty of possession in the opening 45 minutes but failed to make any clear cut chances. Winger Robben flashed an effort wide of the post, while United's best effort was ruled out for offside after Antonio Valencia had netted from close-range. While the first half may have been a rather dour affair, the second was a rollercoaster of emotion as both sides began throwing men forward in search of victory. And it was United which struck first with 57 minutes played when Evra fired home an unstoppable effort from 20-yards into the top corner of Manuel Neuer's goal. That strike was wildy celebrated by players on the visiting bench but before they could even sit down, Bayern was level thanks to a fine header by Mandzukic. Buoyed by the equalizer, Bayern bean to scent victory and Muller tapped home a second after beating Nemanja Vidic to Robben's cross. Robben added a third after leading the United defense a merry dance to round off the scoring and book Bayern's place in the semifinal for the third time in four years. ""They scored the first goal so it was a tricky tie but in the end 3-1 was a very good result,"" the Dutchman told Sky Sports. ""It was important to score straight after they made it 1-0. It was a wake-up call because the first 10 minutes in the second half were a disaster - we were slow and were not there. ""You can't do that in the Champions League. After that we scored three goals. We wanted to attack and they were playing on the counter so you have to be careful."" The defeat means United will not compete in Europe's top competition next season and heaps more pressure on manager David Moyes. Midfielder Michael Carrick says the absence of Champions League football at Old Trafford will be difficult to swallow. ""It was always going to be tough tonight and we're not in the Champions League next season, not necessarily because of tonight, but because we have been weak and haven't been good enough over the season,"" he told Sky Sports. ""We need to finish the season as best we can and get ready for next season and come back believing we can win the title and qualify for the Champions League next season.""","Atletico Madrid defeats Barcelona in Champions League .

"(CNN) -- Is there no end to Marion Bartoli's talents? She is a grand slam tennis winner, but she has a prodigious intellect and is also an adept artist. In the relaxed settings of Claude Monet's garden in Giverny, France, Bartoli reflected on a career that blossomed after years of struggles -- both personal and professional -- opening up about feeling like a ""ghost"" as a child and her Mission Impossible win at Wimbledon. Monet's garden is one of Bartoli's favorite spots. She often traveled to tennis tournaments around the world with paint brushes and recently graduated from art school in Switzerland with a 90%. The stellar grade shouldn't come as a surprise, since the Frenchwoman once claimed she had an IQ of 175, higher than Albert Einstein. Despite winning Wimbledon and carving out a 13-year professional career with earnings of more than $11 million, Bartoli suffered for her art on court. And contrary to what she uttered in August, Bartoli has no plans of staging a comeback. ""I had some really deep scars that were wide open,"" the 29-year-old told CNN's Open Court. ""But I covered them and made sure no one could see them when I was playing. ""Now I can say I have passed every single test, and I became the happiest person in the world."" Feeling of neglect . By now many know the methods her dad and coach, Walter, used to train Bartoli. Her father -- also a doctor -- would reward Bartoli with sweets when she hit targets and attached tennis balls to the bottom of her feet to make sure she stayed on her toes. Using old tennis balls in practice allowed Bartoli to acclimatize to all types of bounces. But much lesser known is how Bartoli said she played second-fiddle to her older brother -- who was having ""issues"" at school -- when growing up and received less attention from her mom Sophie. It stung. ""She was giving more time to him than to me and I had almost to be a ghost,"" said Bartoli. Even as she rose into the top 10 and reached major finals, the feeling of neglect lingered. Over the years Sophie rarely attended Bartoli's matches. ""My mother had another, big influence in another way,"" said Bartoli. When asked if she had now proven herself to her mom, Bartoli added: ""Oh yeah, I think so. But that's what was also very hard for me to take with my dad, when I could see his disappointment with my performance. ""That was the toughest part."" In 2011, Bartoli's fraught relationship with parents came to a head when she threw them both out of a player's box on a Wimbledon side court. But she grew stronger mentally on the tennis court, helping to explain her ascent. Her game mirrored Monica Seles' in being unorthodox -- hitting with two hands on both the forehand and backhand. Between points Bartoli could often be seen bobbing up and down, concurrently simulating a swing. ""The way she bounced up and down and swung between points was exhausting,"" retired former world No. 5 Jo Durie, a longtime analyst with Eurosport, told CNN. ""She must have run so many miles between points let alone during the points."" For a spell Bartoli never bounced the ball before serving, another unusual practice. For the casual fan Bartoli rose to prominence at Wimbledon in 2007 when she upset then world No. 1 Justine Henin to reach the finale. Her fondness for actor Pierce Brosnan, who watched one of her matches, became international news. ""Personal"" problems . Grass was indeed Bartoli's most productive surface, with her flat, hard ground strokes moving through the court and making life difficult for her opponents. This, despite her home grand slam being held on clay. It took a while for Bartoli to win over French fans and she was in dispute for most of her career with her federation. When it didn't budge in her request to make Walter a key member of the Federation Cup setup, she sat out the competition and missed last year's Olympics -- on the very same grass at Wimbledon. But Bartoli would be the last woman standing at the All England Club last July. Not that she expected it. ""If I tell you what was happening three days in my life before Wimbledon started, you will never believe I won it,"" she said. ""Keeping busy"" Bartoli contested a Wimbledon warmup in Eastbourne on the east coast of England and developed a 40-degree fever that forced her to pull out of a second-round encounter against former Roland Garros champion Li Na. She had ""personal"" problems, too, to contend with -- reportedly the separation of her parents. ""I just prayed to God and said, 'The only thing I want from now on is to be happy. I don't care about my tennis ranking, I don't care about winning or losing. I just want to be happy,'"" she said. ""I felt miserable. I was tired, lonely and sad."" Bartoli's friends rallied around her -- ""when I feel loved, I can lift mountains,"" she says -- and thus her special fortnight began. Bartoli will be the first to tell you the draw gods helped, as she didn't have to face ex champions Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, or grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka. They were all upset. As it turned out, Bartoli avoided any player in the top 10. But Bartoli downed the promising Sloane Stephens in the quarterfinals, former Wimbledon junior titlist Kirsten Flipkens in the semifinals and big-serving Sabine Lisicki in the final. Even though she was better ranked than Lisicki, many picked the German to triumph given she had upset Williams and Agnieszka Radwanska. Durie wasn't one of them. ""I thought she was just so beautifully focused and determined that there was no question in her mind that she wasn't going to win,"" said Durie. ""You could see the determination written large on her face."" Bartoli had little nerves entering the final, relaxed enough to take a nap shortly before it began, joking with her entourage and even booking tickets for her team. Prior to striking an ace on the final point, Bartoli flashed back to those days as a child when she finished practice past midnight in freezing conditions under a leaking roof. When it was over a hug to dad, the biggest influence in her career, ensued. ""Two weeks earlier I just wanted to be happy, and then I won Wimbledon,"" said Bartoli. ""That was it. Then you can write, 'The end.'"" It was indeed almost the end. A month later, her body unable to withstand the demands of the tennis tour any longer, Bartoli quit. ""She dragged every little bit of talent out of herself,"" said Durie. But a return, a la Henin, Kim Clijsters or Lindsay Davenport, isn't on the cards. ""I will not come back,"" Bartoli insisted. Even after winning Wimbledon, Bartoli was subjected to comments about her appearance after British commentator John Inverdale apologized to her for saying she was ""never going to be a looker."" At the time, asked about Inverdale's comments, Bartoli reportedly said: ""It doesn't matter, honestly. I am not blonde, yes. That is a fact. Have I dreamt about having a model contract? No. I'm sorry."" Marion, meet Usain . Bartoli is keeping busy in retirement. She played in an exhibition on Necker Island -- owned by Richard Branson -- this month and returns to the Caribbean in January to meet the fastest man on the planet, Usain Bolt. Bartoli isn't sure what is on the agenda that day. ""He actually invited me and wanted to meet me,"" said Bartoli. If Bolt wants to learn more about tennis, painting -- and maybe even life -- Bartoli might just be the right person.","Marion Bartoli has no plans to return to the tennis tour after retiring in August .

"(CNN) -- The man believed to have killed a police officer Monday before an explosion rocked the New Hampshire duplex where the shooting happened did not have a criminal record -- not even a motor vehicle record -- prosecutors said Tuesday. Investigators believe that Michael Nolan, 47, shot and killed police officer Steve Arkell before losing his own life in a fire and explosion that followed. The Brentwood, New Hampshire, Police Department was in mourning Tuesday, even as investigators tried to understand how one officer's response to a domestic disturbance call ended this way. Monday was the first time that police were called to the home shared by Michael Nolan and his father Walter Nolan, 86, said Jane Young, chief of the New Hampshire attorney general's criminal bureau. Young said officer Arkell responded to a call at the home Monday afternoon, where the younger Nolan was allegedly swearing at his father. When Arkell arrived, he met with Walter Nolan in front of the house and was granted permission to enter, Young said. After the officer entered, three volleys of gunfire were heard, and another emergency call was made by a neighbor to report the shots, Young said. A second officer arrived and entered the residence, where ""he noticed that there was a wall that had been sprayed with bullets, and he saw officer Arkell on the floor, on his back,"" Young said. The officer was met with gunfire and he retreated to call for backup. As authorities built up a presence around the house, a fire was spotted by the front, followed by an explosion that was captured live on air by CNN affiliate WCVB-TV. A witness told police that arguing had been heard from the Nolan home before, but police had not been called. Young said investigators may never know what prompted the argument because of the father's diminished mental state and difficulty communicating. The incident is being investigated by the state and federal authorities, according to Foster. The 48-year-old Arkell was married and the father of two teenage girls, affiliate WMUR reported. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan ordered that flags in the state be flown at half-staff in honor of Arkell. ""I join all Granite Staters in mourning the loss of Brentwood police officer Steve Arkell, who died ... doing his job, protecting his community,"" she said. Brentwood is a town of about 4,200, located 50 miles north of Boston. CNN's Ed Payne, Janet DiGiacomo and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Prosecutors believe Michael Nolan shot and killed a police officer .

"(CNN) -- Coal-producing giant Massey Energy defended its safety record Monday after the worst U.S. mine disaster in decades and rebuffed calls for its CEO to step down. Stan Suboleski, a member of Massey's board of directors, acknowledged the company's Upper Big Branch Mine had a high number of citations for serious safety violations. But he said federal inspectors found ""no major issues"" with the mine a few days before the April 5 explosion that killed 29 miners, and no hazards were found the day of the explosion. In addition, Suboleski said, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration required changes to the mine's ventilation system in September that company engineers found ""significantly reduced"" the amount of fresh air that reached the portion of the mine where work was taking place, and the company resisted that change ""to the point of shutting down production for two days"" before agreeing. Amy Louviere, a spokeswoman for MSHA, said the issue Subleski raised will be part of its investigation of the disaster. ""MSHA's accident investigation team will thoroughly examine the mine's ventilation plan and any changes required by MSHA in order to determine the volume of air flow,"" Louviere told CNN. A preliminary report on the disaster by MSHA found that the Upper Big Branch mine had ""a significant history of safety issues"" and that the agency was closely monitoring Massey Energy. In 2009, federal inspectors issued 515 citations and orders at the Upper Big Branch mine, with 39 percent of them for ""significant and substantial"" violations. Massey's safety record came under a harsh spotlight after the disaster at the Upper Big Branch Mine. Its CEO, Don Blankenship, has been an outspoken critic of federal regulators, and at least two investment funds have called for his resignation since the explosion earlier this month. But another Massey director, Bobby Inman, said Blankenship had the board's confidence, and that changing leadership ""in the midst of a crisis"" would be a bad idea. ""When the crisis has subsided and we know the facts, we will maintain the highest standard of accountability and responsibility,"" Inman said during a news conference in Charleston, West Virginia. And Blankenship offered condolences to the families and co-workers of the men who died in the blast, saying, ""We know there are no words to describe either their losses or the sorrow they are experiencing."" ""In the past 20 years, we have done our best to engineer the dangers out of coal mining,"" Blankenship said. ""We have made great strides and been proud of our accomplishments. But on April 5, we lost 29 great coal miners, and we don't know why. This has left us humbled and hurt and searching for answers."" Since the disaster, President Obama has ordered a review of mines with poor safety records. He called Massey's safety record ""troubled"" in an April 15 appearance. Massey called the criticism ""regrettable.""","Massey board member Stan Suboleski admits mine had lots of safety citations .

"(CNN) -- Bombers killed at least 31 people and wounded 56 more at a political rally in a stadium in eastern Baghdad on Friday, days ahead of parliamentary elections, two police officials said. The al Qaeda splinter group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria claimed responsibility, according to a post on a jihadist website. About 200 people attended the event, sponsored by a Shiite political group, officials told CNN. A car bomb first hit the gathering. It was followed by a suicide bomber wearing an explosives vest. Earlier, police had said two car bombs were used. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. Violence has escalated over the past year. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians. The army and police will cast their ballots Monday in the parliamentary elections. The general public will vote Wednesday. Some 277 political entities across Iraq will compete for 328 seats of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, the country's parliament.

"(CNN) -- This week, a California woman who disappeared from her home when she was just 15, walked into a police station and ended her decade-long alleged kidnapping saga. According to the police, she was just 15, when her mother's boyfriend, Isidro Garcia, drugged her and kidnapped her. She woke up in a barricaded garage and that's allegedly when the sexual, physical and mental abuse began. He allegedly moved her frequently over the 10 years, gave her a fake name (he went by ""Tomas"") convinced her that her family was no longer looking for her and told her she'd be deported if she looked for them. I've heard some people say that ""there's something a little off"" about the woman's story. The reason: In recent years, the victim has been living in plain sight with her kidnapper. In fact, they were apparently married and have a daughter together who is 3. Neighbors of ""Tomas"" and his wife said they were stunned to learn that the ""happy couple"" who were ""thrilled"" about their pregnancy were in reality a kidnapper/rapist and his victim. It's easy to be baffled by this case or question the victim's story. She was, after all, not physically barricaded against her will in the House of Horrors, like the three women held captive by Ariel Castro for years in Cleveland, nor was she chained in the wilderness and disguised in a wig, sunglasses and a veil the way Elizabeth Smart was when she was rescued after nine months of absolute hell. In recent years, the young woman in this case, according to neighbors was often at the park alone with her daughter or at the grocery store. Or dancing happily at the elaborate parties the ""couple"" threw with caterers and clowns. I guess it seems a little off because it's natural to wonder why an alleged victim living in the open with her alleged captor didn't escape. Psychologists will tell you that it's natural to not only think about what you might do in the same situation but to also try to convince yourself that you'd have the courage to escape. We do this as a way to reassure ourselves and make ourselves feel safe against the many threats in the world. To wonder what you might do in a similar situation is psychologically natural, but to judge what this young woman should or shouldn't have done, is unfair. In an interview with The Associated Press, Elizabeth Smart cautioned people to not question why a victim might not have escaped sooner: ""We don't know what these evil people are holding over them -- whether it's their families' lives, their lives, whatever it is. We just don't know. There can be stronger bonds and chains than physical bonds and chains."" Or as Michelle Knight said on CNN's New Day: ""You don't know what went through her head. You don't know what that was doing to her. You have absolutely no clue what she went through to say things and say that she was lying or she's doing this. You're making her not able to function or heal properly when you do these things to people. You're making people not want to come out, not want to say anything."" In the late '80s, I was trained as a crisis intervention counselor and I volunteered on a domestic violence hotline for four years. Abusers typically have a Jekyll and Hyde personality. In public, an abuser often acts like a ""friendly guy"" or a ""nice neighbor,"" but in private he may be pure evil. Most victims are terrified to come forward fearing no one will believe them because neighbors and friends never witness the abuse. I'm sure friends of the actor Michael Jace, for example, who is accused of murdering his wife were shocked to learn that such a ""friendly"" guy might be capable of such evil. And this California kidnapping victim isn't a typical American 15-year-old (like my daughter) with a smart phone, a U.S. education, a large family network and an army of teenage friends. She was a 15-year-old from Mexico, who had been living in America for just six months when she was allegedly kidnapped. She didn't speak English. She didn't attend school. She was undocumented and of course feared deportation. With no network of friends or extended family, no education, no roots and no papers, she was allegedly completely under her captor's control. Finally, there was the alleged physical and sexual abuse. She told police she was beaten twice when she tried to escape and for many years was never out of Garcia's sight. I've heard immigration experts speak about undocumented people living in ""the shadows."" This woman may have been living out in the open, but she was in the psychological shadow of her abuser and of a system that makes undocumented immigrants fear the police.

"(CNN) -- Yemeni commando forces from elite units are conducting simultaneous raids on al Qaeda hideouts and cells on the outskirts of the capital, Sanaa, a Yemeni government official told CNN on Friday. The raids are part of recent operations to crack down on al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, considered the most dangerous wing of the global terror group, and represents the most intense campaign against it since 2012, the official said. Yemeni military brigades are also besieging areas around Abyan, Shabwa and Baida provinces, slowly attempting to form a security perimeter around those areas by cutting off main roads and supply routes, according to the official. The official did not provide information about whether another ground operation involving commandos and infantry troops in those areas was imminent. A crackdown began last weekend, resulting in the deaths of more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19-21, Yemeni officials have said. The offensive included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes, a high-level Yemeni government official said. U.S. special operations troops helped during that offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen, though no Americans took part in combat, a U.S. official said. DNA tests are being conducted to determine if one of the most well-known members of that group -- bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri -- is among the dead, according to Yemeni officials. One of the sites targeted is in the same area where scores of al Qaeda followers had gathered recently to hear from Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the head of the terrorist network's Yemeni branch and the global organization's ""crown prince,"" the high-level Yemeni official said. A video of that meeting appeared on jihadist websites. In the middle of that video, al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. One reason why Yemen and the United States partnered in the offensive: Threats from al Qaeda operatives in Yemen increased in recent weeks, U.S. officials told CNN. U.S. authorities blame the Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda for a string of plots against Americans, including the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner with a bomb concealed in an operative's underwear in 2009. It is also suspected of being behind another plot involving printer bombs on U.S.-bound cargo jets. Did Yemen, U.S. kill al Qaeda's chief bomb maker?

"(CNN) -- ""They must know what they're doing, right?"" It's a common enough phrase, often muttered by nervous people who are thinking the exact opposite -- who are expressing doubts about those who seem to be in charge, the ones who are supposed to have all the answers. The bus to work is making a strange, loud, thumping sound, but the driver keeps motoring along. There's an unmistakable smell of smoke coming from the restaurant kitchen, but the waiters and waitresses continue taking orders as if nothing is amiss. There is lightning in the sky above the outdoor field of a sporting event and warning sirens can be heard from somewhere in town, but the officials allow the contest to play on. The packaged meat looks a little funny, but the sell-by date is current, and the supermarket has it out on prominent display. ""They must know what they're doing, right?"" We tend to take it on faith that they -- whoever the amorphous ""they"" may be -- are on the case and full of expertise and wisdom, ever on the lookout for any threats to the well-being of those who are counting on them. So when there are signs that mistakes have slipped past inspectors, past engineers, past control towers -- signs that, for all the double-checking, perhaps a little triple- or quadruple-checking may have been called for -- people pause to consider if the safeguards assumed to be constantly in place are really so fail-safe. This Memorial Day weekend, Americans are pondering a series of recent events that have called into question the airtightness of the business world's layers of quality assurance, and the effectiveness of the in-house inspection processes that are supposed to monitor and affirm that assurance before customers can be adversely affected. Food-product recalls around the nation have brought worries to consumers used to taking home products assuming they are safe. In Idaho and Washington, state health departments directed people not to eat raw clover sprouts produced by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited seven confirmed and three likely cases of E. coli infection. Nearly 15,000 pounds of hummus and dip products were voluntarily recalled by Lansal Inc. because of possible bacterial contamination flagged by the Texas Department of Health. Merchants in Missouri and Illinois were returning bulk and packaged walnuts to Sherman Produce, which issued a recall as a precautionary measure against possible listeria. And the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because of possible E. coli contamination. In the world of automobiles, General Motors signaled to Barclays Capital analysts that it may continue with recalls into the middle of the summer. GM, so far this year, has called in almost 14 million vehicles in the U.S., in 29 separate recalls -- which constitutes more vehicles recalled than the total of what GM has sold domestically in the last five years. The Federal Aviation Administration was looking into a near miss between two passenger jets in the skies near George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston earlier this month. This follows the FAA's investigation of two other recent near-miss incidents, one at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and the other at Tallahassee Regional Airport in Florida, where a passenger jet reportedly almost collided with a drone. Most of the time, things go just fine. But when stories like these appear in the news in a single week, there is the impulse to wonder just what else is perhaps being missed. And to reflect upon just how many times each day we depend on precision and diligence that, without knowing exactly who is responsible for it, we presume is there. In truth, people reluctantly understand that the idea of endless layers of perfectionist platoons of unblinking and errorless industrial inspectors, while something to be aimed for, is probably a pipe dream. Consumers know that their own common sense, and personal scrutiny of what they buy, is their best protection. Yet there are many areas in which the customer cannot be expected to be an expert, which is why the relentlessness and rigor of professional inspectors and regulators is so essential. The old joke is that the ultimate act of faith in one's fellow man is opening the door to take a box of pizza from the delivery guy, and then eating it. But each time you step into a high-rise elevator and count on all the mechanisms that hold it in the air being up to standards; each time you get a prescription filled and count on the pharmacist dispensing the correct medication into the bottle; each time you watch your child climb onto a purposely scary amusement park ride and count on someone having made certain every rail at every turn is intact and tight and correctly angled; each time you blithely drive through a green-light signal at a busy intersection and count on the light for the perpendicular street being red just like it's supposed to be; each time you start to count backward from 100 as the anesthesiologist begins to administer the first drops of the dose before you drift off. ... each time, you are, of necessity, relying on the conscientiousness, thoroughness, and devotion to detail of strangers. There's a whole lot that, without stopping too often to ruminate over it, we assure ourselves is being done correctly by people we will never meet. Thinking too much about that, especially after a week like the one just past, could drive us nuts. And after all, they must know that they're doing. Right?","Bob Greene: We count on notion that some vague official authority is protecting our safety .
He says recent food recalls, GM recalls and planes' near misses remind us this isn't always so .

"(CNN) -- Lazio's 0-0 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur in a top European club football match Thursday was marred by anti-semitic chanting, according to local media. The chant ""Spurs Jews, Spurs Jews"" came from the north stand of the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, reported Italian news agency ANSA. A banner reading ""Free Palestine"" was also unveiled by Lazio fans during the key Europa League match. English Premier League Tottenham have a strong following from the Jewish community in North London where their White Hart Lane Stadium is situated. The incidents came after Tottenham fans in the Italian capital were attacked in Camp de Fiori, in the heart of Rome's nightlife area Wednesday night. One was left in a serious condition in a local hospital after an assault in a bar, apparently by extremist supporters named ""Ultras"". A Rome police spokesman told CNN that arrests had been made following the attacks. ""I can confirm that we have arrested two Roma fans after the incident yesterday at the Drunken Ship pub in the Campo de'Fiori district,"" he said. Roma are the local rival club to Lazio and both play in the Stadio Olimpico. The pre-match violence and offensive chanting was in sharp contrast to a warm reception given to former Tottenham and England football star Paul Gascoigne, who also played for Lazio. The 45-year-old, who has battled personal problems, donned a light blue and white scarf, the colors of Lazio, as he was presented to the crowd. ""Welcome back Gazza. Lionheart, headstrong, pure talent, real man: still our hero,"" said one of the banners held aloft by home fans. The match itself left both teams well-placed in Europe's second level club competition. Lazio are already through to the knockout stage and top the group, while Tottenham, who owed the draw to heroics from French international goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, need only to avoid defeat in their final home match against Greek side Panathinaikos to go through. In other games, Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o scored as Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala moved into the knockout round with a 2-0 win over Italy's Udinese. But Liverpool were held 2-2 at home by Swiss side Young Boys in the same group, with the second place to be decided in the final batch of matches. La Liga high flyers Atletico Madrid also secured their passage with a 1-0 home win over Hapoel Tel Aviv, while French side Bordeaux and EPL Newcastle have gone through from Group D. The European football season has been marked by a series of racist incidents, with England players in an under-21 international in Serbia, claiming they had been subjected to offensive chanting. Governing body UEFA has charged the Serbian FA but said Thursday it had decided to postpone a decision on the disciplinary case until December 13. Former England captain John Terry was recently banned by the English FA for four games for racial language he directed at an opponent in an EPL game last year. Earlier Thursday, the FA cleared referee Mark Clattenburg of making racist comments to Terry's Chelsea teammate Jon Obi Mikel during a match against Manchester United last month.","Anti-semitic chanting reported at Lazio home match against Tottenham Hotspur .

"TULSA, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Weeks of protests, rallies, lawsuits and candlelight vigils failed to stop a new state immigration bill -- HB 1804 -- from becoming the law in Oklahoma. Vigils like this one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week were unable to stop a tough new immigration law. The law went into effect Thursday and is intended to make life difficult for illegal immigrants in Oklahoma. Its authors say they're sending a very clear message: If you're an illegal immigrant, you are not welcome. ""I'm convinced illegal aliens will not come to Oklahoma, or any other state, if there are no jobs waiting for them."" said state Rep. Randy Terrill, a Republican and the law's author. ""They will not stay here if there are not taxpayer subsidies and they certainly won't stay here if they ever encounter one of our fine state and local law enforcement officials,"" he added. ""They'll be physically detained -- until they're deported."" The new law restricts the ability of illegal immigrants to obtain government IDs or public assistance. It also gives police authority to check the immigration status of anyone arrested, which can lead to deportations. It doesn't stop at illegal immigrants. The law also makes it a felony for U.S. citizens to knowingly provide shelter, transportation or employment to illegal immigrants. The message has been received loud and clear. Many in Oklahoma's Latino community say people are staying home, fearful police will arrest and deport them. ""They're afraid they're going to get deported. They're just afraid,"" said Alex Yoguez, a juice store owner who relies on Latino customers for her business to survive. Yoguez said her business is normally filled with customers. ""We are down 50 percent just today,"" she said Thursday, the day the law went on the books. Latino supporters are up in arms about the way the state now views illegal immigrants who have been here for many years. ""You are guilty of ethnic cleansing in this community! You are going against my community!"" said the Rev. Miguel Rivera of the National Coalition of Latino Clergy. The clergy group filed a federal lawsuit against the state saying the state has overstepped its bounds by enforcing immigration law, which is under federal jurisdiction. A hearing in the case is scheduled next week. An earlier attempt to get an injunction to prevent enforcement of the law was turned down by a judge. It's not yet clear how the law will be enforced. Illegal immigrants in Oklahoma fear police will use the law for roundups of anyone working and living in the state illegally. ""I don't know if we're going to be actively looking for them,"" said Tulsa Police Capt. Steve Odom, who works in the Latino district of Tulsa. ""If we come across them in the course of a call, or a course of an investigation, certainly we'll take the appropriate action."" The Tulsa Police Department said it has not received guidance from the district attorney's office on how to enforce the law. The department points out that suspicion of illegal activity is not enough, and proving the intent of U.S. citizens is a challenge. Still, many in Oklahoma say Latinos have been leaving by the thousands since the law was passed in May. ""We are losing a lot of business, a lot of business,"" said Antonio Perez, who owns Mexican grocery stores. ""I would say between the four stores we have lost about $300,000 a month in sales."" So far, the absence of the Latinos on the streets may be the only visible result of the law. E-mail to a friend .","Law goes into effect November 1 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities have made a concerted effort to censor images and online accounts of a jeep that plowed into crowds in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, killing five and injuring 38, amid suggestions police are looking for suspects from the restive western region of Xinjiang. While the cause or motive for Monday's crash remains unclear, one manager at a five-star hotel in Beijing, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, told CNN that the city's hotels had received a notice from local police requesting assistance in the investigation of a ""major incident"" late on Monday. It listed four people with names that suggested they belonged to the Uighur ethnic group that comes from Xinjiang Province, where tensions between Han Chinese and the largely Muslim Uighurs have sometimes turned violent. The notice also listed four vehicles -- including two cars and a motorcycle -- with license plate numbers from Xinjiang and asked hotels to keep a look out for suspicious guests that may have stayed in the capital from October 1. A spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a diaspora group, said it was too early to blame Uighurs and the group was concerned over the the lack of transparency surrounding the incident. ""Every time something like this happens, authorities usually point fingers at Uighurs,"" Alim Seytoff said. ""The notice should not be taken as the evidence of Uighur involvement in the incident."" Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies, said the incident, taking place in China's most important and sensitive public space, would be considered a major loss of face for Beijing's leadership, especially if it turned out to be related to Uighur separatism. ""It was close to the Zhongnanhai party headquarters and, in terms of timing, it's on the eve of the plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party so they don't want these rumors and speculation,"" he said. ""According to eye witness reports I've read online, the jeep was driving at people. It appears to be a deliberate attempt to create havoc and a number of casualties,"" he said. Earlier this month, Chinese police said they had arrested 139 people in Xinjiang for spreading religious extremism online. The arrests came in the wake of riots that left 35 people dead. While a number of Chinese media outlets reported Monday's incident, their accounts stuck to the bare-bones details published by the official Xinhua news agency. No footage was shown on CCTV, China's state broadcaster, and the images that appeared immediately after the incident on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, showing black smoke and a vehicle engulfed in flames, were largely deleted. Searches combining the words Tiananmen, terrorism and car crash were also blocked. CNN broadcasts about the incident were blacked out inside China. Lam said Chinese media outlets had likely received an official order to stick to Xinhua's version of events. However, the English-language Global Times, which is state-run but not regarded as an official mouthpiece, reported that police were looking for two suspects from Xinjiang in connection with the jeep, which was described as light colored with Xinjiang plates. Of the five people killed, three were the vehicle's driver and two passengers and the other two were tourists; a woman from the Philippines and a Chinese man. Authorities moved quickly to tackle the blaze and clear up the scene on Monday. On Tuesday, the square was back to normal. CNN's David McKenzie and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report .","China censors images of jeep that plowed into Tiananmen Square, killing 5 .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen passengers are still missing after a plane burst into flames after landing in Sudan's capital Khartoum on Tuesday, killing 29 people. Officials say 29 are dead after a plane caught fire shortly after landing in Sudan. The Sudan Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday the remaining 171 passengers on the Sudan Airways Airbus survived. Many passengers did not wait around for customs inspection after fleeing the burning plane, making the toll difficult to ascertain initially, officials said. Khartoum Police Chief Mohammad Othman Mohammad Noor said that ""a defect"" in the Sudan Airways plane caused it to catch fire as it touched down during a storm. ""The fire then led to an explosion on the airplane,"" he said. ""There was a large number of passengers on the plane, some of whom survived.

"(CNN) -- European monarchs appear to be falling like dominoes. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands set the ball rolling in April 2013 when she stepped down in favor of her son and heir Prince Willem-Alexander following a 33-year reign. In July 2013, 79-year-old Albert II of Belgium gave up his throne citing advancing age and health issues, and now comes word that King Juan Carlos of Spain, 76, has decided to abdicate after a reign that has spanned almost four decades. The popularity of the Spanish monarchy has nose-dived in recent years. Juan Carlos's secret luxury trip to Botswana to hunt elephants at the height of his country's financial crisis in 2012 didn't help ... especially given his role as honorary president of the World Wildlife Fund. Then there's the ongoing investigation of his son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, who faces preliminary charges of embezzling millions of euros in public funds through his charity. Through his lawyer, Urdangarin has denied the charges, which could still be dropped. Add to that the king's slew of health issues -- five operations over the course of two years -- and it seems rather a sensible decision to hand over to his son, Prince Felipe, 46, who has seen his own popularity steadily increase. While Juan Carlos's abdication comes as no surprise, it does beg the question: Will Britain's Queen Elizabeth II follow suit? She has after all put in an impressive tenure, 62 years to be precise (today marks the 61st anniversary of her coronation). She's currently enjoying a surge in popularity -- always better to go out on top -- and at 88 she has surely earned the right to put her feet up and bask in her twilight years. So will we see her throw in the towel next? In a word, no. In 1947, on the occasion of her 21st birthday, during a tour with her parents to Southern Africa, a then Princess Elizabeth made a pledge in a broadcast to the Commonwealth in which she said: ""I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."" In a speech to both houses of parliament commemorating her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the queen rededicated herself to her country and its people, vowing to serve,""... now and in the years to come."" The queen is a deeply religious woman, and in 1953 she took her oath before God. For her that means a lifetime of commitment. Due to her advancing age, Prince Charles has stepped in to represent his mother at several high profile engagements over the last year, most notably at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka last November, but this by no means indicates that he's planning a coup. Queen Elizabeth continues to fulfill a jam-packed royal schedule and will travel to France later this week to mark the D-Day commemorations alongside her ""strength and stay"" Prince Philip who will celebrate his 93rd birthday next week. The Queen is for all intents and purposes the royal equivalent of the Energizer Bunny and the only way she will ever step aside is if she becomes incapacitated. Come September 2015, Queen Elizabeth II will surpass Queen Victoria's record as Britain's longest reigning monarch, and if one was to think optimistically, should she live to the ripe old age of 108, she would break former King Sobhuza II of Swaziland's reign as the world's longest serving monarch. While that is a record that stands to remain unbroken, you can rest assured that as long as she remains healthy, the queen is not going anywhere, and for that we should be immensely proud and grateful. I quit, says king who defied coup . Juan Carlos: All you need to know . Belgium's King Albert II gives up throne to son . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victoria Arbiter.","King Juan Carlos has announced he is abdicating after almost four decades on Spain's throne .

"(CNN) -- Former Brazil international captain Socrates has died in a Sao Paolo hospital at the age of 57 following an intestinal infection. The cultured midfielder, who won 60 international caps and scored 22 goals for his country, was admitted to the Albert Einstein hospital on Friday after suffering from food poisoning and died early on Sunday morning after going into septic shock. Socrates had already been admitted to hospital twice in 2011, in August and September, because of bleeding in his digestive tract. Despite not turning professional until he was 24, Socrates starred for Brazil between 1979 and 1986, playing in two World Cup finals tournaments in the process. However, he will always be associated with the brilliant 1982 Brazilian side, who are widely regarding as the greatest team to never win the World Cup. Socrates captained the 1982 side in Spain and was widely expected to lift the World Cup trophy. However, they were beaten 3-2 by Italy in the second group phase in one of football's most iconic matches. He also played 297 matches, scoring 172 goals, in six years with Corinthians and the Brazilian side paid tribute to him on their official website. ""We can always be thankful for having witnessed one of the greatest ever footballers.

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Storefront after storefront are closed and buildings are boarded up and falling into disrepair in Selma. SELMA, Alabama (CNN) -- To cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge into Selma is to share a stage with history. And these days, it is to come face-to-face with a bleak present. Storefront after storefront is closed, and many of the buildings in the famous photos from the days of the historic March 1965 events have fallen into disrepair. ""It is very depressing,"" Selma Mayor George P. Evans tells us during an evening walk down Broad Street in downtown. ""People are not buying. People are not spending. Businesses are going out of business."" This is the heart of Alabama's ""Black Belt,"" and Selma is a reminder that a recession that has punished so many across America has hit hardest in places that were already struggling. ""A double whammy,"" Evans says. ""It does seem to be those cities with the largest population of minorities that has taken the biggest hit.""  Watch Mayor Evans talk about Selma's economic struggles » . Statewide, unemployment in Alabama has doubled in the past year from 4.5 percent to 9 percent. But here in Dallas County, it is 18.2 percent. In neighboring Wilcox County, is it more than 22 percent. That is staggering: One in five people you pass are unemployed. ""I have been looking and most of the time you go to a place, they are saying: 'No jobs. No applications','' is how Beatrice Jackson explained a job search going on six months. ""You have to go looking and you have to apply for jobs, but there ain't nothing really in Selma. So, you know, you just take one day at a time.""  Watch John King talk to Selma residents about the loss of jobs » . Jackson was one of more than 300 workers at a cigar factory owned by a company called Altadis USA. Harsh news spread there in November. On the factory floor, the word was that just shy of 40 workers would lose their jobs, based on seniority. Instead, the owner announced the entire plant was being shut down. ""It was really shocking to us. It was shocking to everybody because we weren't expecting that,"" Jackson said. She had been back at the cigar factory for nine years, after another plant where she worked was shut down. She made about $400 a week -- with health insurance -- at the cigar factory. Her unemployment benefits run about $250. She has lived in Selma all her life and says it has never been this bad. ""That is why most of the young people -- they are leaving,"" Jackson said. ""They are leaving because there ain't no jobs here, and there ain't nothing for them to do, so they leave."" Jimmie Coleman III sees the domino effect every day as he walks the aisles at his job. He is the director of the Calhoun Foods supermarket, a minority-owned chain whose meat section caters to the tastes of Selma's predominantly African-American population. The average shopping cart in the checkout line is down to $19 or $20, and customers Coleman says he would see several times a week not too long ago come in just once a week now. More economical family packs are the big sellers, and the traffic in other aisles is slowing dramatically. Calhoun Foods is losing sales of laundry detergent, canned goods, frozen foods, breakfast cereal and other household staples to the Wal-Mart on the outskirts of town. Last year, the meat department represented 35 percent of sales; this year, it is 50 percent. 'This is basically a meat store,"" Coleman says during a late morning walk through the Selma store. ""We put all of our investment in our meat department."" Looking to lure in more customers, the store this week had a giant promotion -- a truckload meat sale with prices slashed 40 percent or more. The slumping economy means revenues are down, but in an effort to avoid layoffs, Calhoun stores three weeks ago decided to trim back work hours. The work week for all hourly workers (managers are salaried) has been trimmed back to no more than 32 hours a week. There has been some grumbling from workers who in the past counted on overtime earnings or from workers who are now their household's only wage-earner because a spouse has lost a job. But Coleman says ""we try to save everybody,"" and the alternative to cutting back hours is slashing jobs. What is striking amid all the bleak statistics and sad stories is a persistent strand of optimism. ""I have never seen it this bad,'' Coleman says. ""But I think it is going to get better."" Adds Evans: ""If you come back in two or three years, you will see a different city in our downtown area. I believe that."" The mayor's vision of economic revival includes loft apartments in many of the vacant downtown storefronts and warehouses. He has an ambitious plan for a new riverfront development that includes restaurants, shops, parkland and a spacious amphitheater. It is a vision he pitches to every visitor, but it is a vision dependent on financial commitments that, so far, are slow to materialize. Selma would appear, in the short term, a perfect target for the Obama stimulus plan. Selma has a wish list of $40 million in projects, from street repairs and other infrastructure to help with the new riverfront development. But not a dime has reached here yet. ""We have not gotten a response on it at this point,"" Evans says. ""It is very frustrating. The entitlement cities with greater populations have gotten a lot of theirs, but the smaller cities like Selma have not gotten theirs yet. ... I believe we will get something. It is just -- it is just a long process.""","Alabama's unemployment rate has doubled to 9 percent, Selma area's is twice that .

""He stayed because of Katrina. Mississippi is doing very well, and he's delivered what he needed to deliver."" ""He struggled hard with the decision to run for re-election. He decided he needed to work on more Katrina aid, but he's not fully enthused about another 6 years."" Republican sources close to Lott said one reason for Lott's decision to resign is the new lobbying restrictions on former lawmakers. A law kicks in on January 1 that forbids lawmakers from lobbying for two years after leaving office. Those who leave by the end of 2007 are covered by the previous law, which demands a wait of only one year. ""He wants to go make a living; he has no money,"" a GOP source said. ""He'll be acting as a lobbyist and political adviser."" The source also said Lott wanted to leave now so that the person appointed to replace him would have almost a year in the Senate before facing the voters during the elections in November 2008. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour is responsible for appointing someone to hold Lott's seat until a special election next year. Rep. Chip Pickering, who has previously announced his resignation from the House, and Rep. Roger Wicker are both considered possible contenders for the seat. Five other GOP senators -- John Warner of Virginia, Wayne Allard of Colorado, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and Larry Craig of Idaho have said they will not seek re-election next year. Since Lott's Mississippi seat is considered safe for Republicans, GOP sources say Lott's resignations should not affect the Republicans' mood going into the 2008 elections. ""While the Republican mood is somewhat dark, this is not one of those examples of Republicans feeling they don't have good electoral prospects in '08,"" one source said. ""Lott's decision is about Lott. This is just a changing of the guard and a safe seat, and Republicans have nothing to worry about."" Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, currently the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, will run for the whip position Lott is vacating, Ryan Patmintra, Kyl's press secretary, told CNN. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, praised the man who had been his counterpart when Lott served as the Republican leader. ""Senator Lott has been a true friend, consistently reaching across the aisle to serve the interests of the people of Mississippi and to help me serve the interests of the people of Nevada,"" Reid said in a statement. Senator Lott is one of the strongest defenders of the institution of the Senate and one of the most pleasant senators I have ever worked with."" The current Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, also praised his whip. ""Trent is the best whip I've ever worked with, and I'm pretty familiar with the requirements of the job,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""I am deeply grateful for Trent's friendship; he is truly one of the great ones."" Lott's resignation will bring to an end his more than three decades in Congress. He won a House seat in 1972 and was first elected to the Senate in 1988. He is the first person to serve as whip in both the House and Senate. Lott, 66, served as Senate majority leader when Republicans controlled that body but was pushed out of the leadership post after he told a 2002 birthday gathering for former Sen. Strom Thurmond that the country would have avoided ""all these problems"" if Thurmond's 1948 segregationist presidential bid had succeeded. Lott later apologized for his ""poor choice of words.""

"(CNN) -- An incident-packed final day at Cheltenham culminated in a no-less dramatic finale when outsider Lord Windermere captured the Gold Cup in heart-stopping fashion for trainer Jim Culloty and jockey Davy Russell. The 20-1 shot beat On His Own and crowd favorite The Giant Bolster on Friday to land the most prestigious prize in the British jumps racing calendar. A stewards' inquiry was immediately called after possible interference between the first two and third-placed The Giant Bolster, but the result stood to give Culloty a notable Gold Cup double as well as the £327,300 ($544,000) first prize. The Irishman, who rode Best Mate to three consecutive victories from 2002-04, became just the fourth person to triumph as both jockey and trainer. ""They were the worst few minutes of my life,"" the 41-year-old said of his agonizing wait during the inquiry. ""This was so unbelievable that I almost expected to lose the race."" Lord Windermere won the RSA Chase novices race at Cheltenham last year, but was not among the favorites for the Gold Cup. ""I'd told Davy Russell to take his time but halfway round I wondered what he was doing -- I wanted to sack him!"" Culloty said. ""I told him to ride the horse to get a place but he exaggerated the waiting tactics a bit too much! ""Everyone has said the horses haven't been right but I've only got 25 horses and 10 of those would be three-year-olds, so it's pretty impressive to have two winners here, including a Gold Cup."" The owners of On His Own were celebrating after taking a gamble to pay a £27,500 ($45,000) supplementary late-entry fee for the 16-1 shot, who took home £122,800 ($204,000). ""It was well worth spending the money to supplement him,"" said co-owner Graham Wylie. ""I'm not at all disappointed, just proud of the horse. He did better than we expected. Coming down to the second-last I thought he might be sixth or seventh, but then his stamina kicked in and he flew up the hill."" Earlier in the day, Ruby Walsh (overnight leading jockey for the meeting) and fellow rider Daryl Jacobs were taken to hospital following falls. Both are receiving ongoing treatment.","Jim Culloty becomes fourth person to win Cheltenham Gold Cup as jockey and trainer .

"(CNN) -- The United States military has re-instituted a curfew on service members in South Korea after two soldiers have been accused of raping local girls. One of the cases involves 21-year-old soldier who allegedly broke into a girl's home on September 17, U.S. Forces Korea, said in a statement. The soldier, who was identified only as ""R"", is accused of raping the girl and stealing a computer from the home. ""He had been drinking with her earlier in the evening and walked her home,"" the military statement said. ""Police say the accused says it was consensual but admits to stealing her computer. Police are now studying DNA evidence and CCTV footage."" Another soldier, identified only as ""I"" is accused of raping a 18-year-old on September 24, U.S. Forces Korea said. The U.S. military has handed that soldier over to local South Korea authorities. ""I offer the victim, her family and the Korean people my sincere regret for this incident. We fully expect our soldiers to maintain the highest standards of professionalism and conduct in the community,"" said Maj. Gen. Edward C. Cardon. The commander of U.S. Forces Korea, Gen. James D. Thurman, said the curfew would be in place from midnight to 5 a.m. Monday to Friday and from 3.a.m. to 5 a.m. on Saturday, Sunday and holidays. It will be in place for the next 30 days, Thurman said. ""Given the incidents that have occurred over the last several months, I'm reinstating the curfew to assess current conditions,"" Thurman said. ""The overwhelming majority of our personnel make the right choices and conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner."" Military officials had rescinded the previous curfew on July 2, 2010. That curfew had been in place for nine years.

"London, England (CNN) -- The drone of the vuvuzela will not be heard in any European competitions after the continent's governing body banned them from all stadiums hosting UEFA matches. The plastic trumpets that were used by fans at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, will be banned from the Champions League and Europa League, as well as all Euro 2012 Qualifying matches. ""UEFA has decided that vuvuzelas may not be brought into stadiums at matches in UEFA competitions,"" a statement on the governing body's website said. The organization believes the instrument is integral to the football culture of South Africa, and its use in Europe would be inappropriate. ""The World Cup was characterized by the vuvuzela's widespread and permanent use in the stands. In the specific context of South Africa, the vuvuzela adds a touch of local flavor and folklore,"" the statement read. ""UEFA feels that the instrument's widespread use would not be appropriate in Europe, where a continuous loud background noise would be emphasized. ""UEFA is of the view that the vuvuzelas would completely change the atmosphere, drowning supporter emotions and detracting from the experience of the game."" The plastic horns have divided opinion since July's competition in South Africa, with numerous English Premier League clubs banning them from their stadiums. Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal were among the first clubs to issue a ban, citing irritation and safety concerns as their reasons. West Ham have also banned the vuvuzela, stating the horns could be considered a weapon.","UEFA have banned the vuvuzela from matches in any of their competitions .

"(CNN) -- Genetic screening techniques that allow parents to choose their children's gender are now more accurate than ever and are becoming increasingly mainstream, but experts are divided over whether the technology should be used in this way. A technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was originally developed two decades ago to allow embryos to be tested for genetic disease. It requires parents to use in vitro fertilization, where eggs are fertilized outside the womb. With PGD, the embryos are tested for genetic disorders and only those that are free of disease are transferred to the mother's uterus. It means that parents who carry genetic defects can ensure they don't pass on a genetic illness to their children. But PGD also can also be used to allow people undergoing in-vitro fertilization to select the gender of the embryo implanted in the mother's uterus. Click on the flags above to watch people around the world answer the question, ""Would you choose your child's gender?"" Using PGD for gender selection is banned in most countries, but it is legal in the U.S., where the procedure costs around $18,000, including in-vitro fertilization. Los Angeles fertility expert Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg uses PGD for gender selection. He told CNN's Vital Signs program that many of his American clients already have children of one gender and are trying to achieve ""family balancing."" He added that 70 percent of his patients are from countries where the procedure is banned. Critics question the ethics of gender selection, and some argue that it could lead to a gender imbalance, particularly in societies with a traditional preference for boys. ""If anything, there's a slight preponderance for females, and this is contrary to everything that is publicized, and clearly it varies by country,"" said Steinberg. ""China is strongly in favor of boys, as we would suspect. India, strongly in favor of boys. But when you look at the world in general, it's 50-50"" Dr. Mark Hughes, who pioneered PGD, he has concerns about its use for non-medical purposes. He told CNN, ""It definitely is an expanded reproductive choice. The question is, is it medicine? Is it something that doctors should be involved in?"" But Steinberg argues that it's wrong to limit scientific capabilities. ""I say to critics that the last thing in the world that you want to do is put the handcuffs on science. ""We've been giving women expanded reproductive choices for 50 years. This is another choice."" Although the technology for gender selection is becoming more widespread, it remains controversial. Some feel that it's ""playing God,"" while others welcome having more choice in family planning. Would you choose your child's gender?

"(CNN) -- Rarely has an animal birth been more hotly anticipated but the equine answer to the Royal Baby has taken its first tentative steps at the home of racing, Newmarket in eastern England. On Sunday, Song produced the first filly to the superstar stallion Frankel at the National Stud, and despite it being just a few days old, the expectation on it to succeed on the racecourse is already huge. An anticipated 130 foals will be born to Frankel in 2014, none of which will race for two years but with the potential for some sporting sibling rivalry come 2016 at the earliest. Song is owned by Khalid Abdul Rahim, of Bahrain, who paid $1.3 million for the mare when she was already in foal to Frankel. Director of The National Stud Brian O'Rourke described the new offspring as ""a very nice quality, athletic individual,"" adding that both ""mare and foal are doing well."" There is even footage online of the foal taking some of its first steps in Newmarket. Mother and foal will stay together for at least five months. Frankel earned owner Prince Khalid Abdullah, a Saudi prince, more than $4m in prize money during an illustrious racing career, which included a record nine consecutive Group 1 wins and ended with victory in the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October last year. However, Frankel, who went to work in his new role at stud in February last year, is now earning his owners infinitely more with a whopping fee of $160,000 for every mare sired and hence earnings of nearly four times his career winnings this year alone. The offspring of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo, Frankel boasts an impressive pedigree, but predicting how Frankel foals may fare is by no means an exact science. Despite the sums paid for the mares and foals in question, she could well prove a flop. Despite that there are high hopes for the filly and Frankel's first foal, a colt, born just a few days earlier at Coolmore Stud in Ireland to a mare called Chrysanthemum. That colt is valued at Â£6m and has been quoted as a 100-1 shot to win the 2017 Derby. As for the filly foal in Newmarket, she remains unnamed with suggestions for a possible moniker to the offspring of Frankel and Song, currently including Sinatra or My Way.","Mare Song produces first filly to superstar stallion Frankel .

"(CNN) -- The president of Yale University announced new steps Friday in the wake of a federal sexual harassment probe at the school, including creating an external committee of former graduates and facilitating informal chats between administrators and students. The school is accused of providing an insufficient process for addressing the federal gender-equity law, Title IX, which may have resulted in ""the denial of equal opportunity to education for numerous university students,"" U.S. Department of Education spokesman Jim Bradshaw has said. In an email Friday, Yale President Richard Levin said administrators and others at the New Haven, Connecticut, university will cooperate with the federal education department's Office of Civil Rights. The university will take other immediate measures distinct from that investigation, the email said. They include the creation of an advisory committee, which has been charged with offering advice on how sexual harassment, violence or misconduct may be more effectively combated at Yale,"" Levin said. ""The committee will spend time listening to members of our community about the situation as they live it and will make its own assessments,"" the president wrote, saying the group's recommendations will be submitted to him next fall and eventually will be made public. The group will be chaired by Margaret Marshall, the former chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Other members, including former U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the University of Chicago's Dean of Students Kimberly Goff-Crews and Elizabeth Smiley, a San Francisco consultant. All were appointed by Levin, and all are Yale graduates. This move comes a week after University Provost Peter Salovey announced that an internal committee -- consisting of student, faculty and administrative members -- would meet to build ""upon the existing processes of the college and each of the schools,"" and will address ""allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct of every kind."" That committee is to start up on July 1. ""We believe that this streamlining will make it simpler for students and faculty to initiate and pursue any complaint,"" Salovey said in an email sent to Yale faculty and students. Federal investigators are looking into a complaint that claims university policies allowed a ""sexually hostile environment"" to exist on campus, Salovey has said. The complaint blames Yale for failing to adequately respond to alleged incidents of harassment, according to Bradshaw. The federal investigation follows a controversial YouTube video released in October that apparently showed new recruits of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity repeating chants encouraging rape as they marched through campus. The board of directors of Delta Kappa Epsilon issued a statement saying the international fraternity strongly condemns the actions of the Yale chapter and acknowledges that the sentiments expressed were offensive. The complaint also follows reports of a party in which undergraduate students were allegedly asked to strip naked. While Levin did not address any specific incident in his message, he did detail other actions -- in addition to setting up the second committee -- being taken before the school year ends in the coming weeks. That includes top administrators, including Salovey and several deans, engaging students in the school's dining halls for ""a conversation about the campus climate and our policies governing sexual misconduct."" Levin said these informal meetings are taking place at his request, facilitated by members of the school's Women's Center. ""The deepest values of our institution compel us to take very seriously the issues raised by the complaint,"" Levin said.","Yale's president taps elite graduates to look at the school's sexual harassment policies .

"(CNN) -- It's no shock that people love to hate Facebook. On Friday, for some, the emphasis shifted to hate as Facebook went public, turning its CEO into a billionaire and, as CNNMoney gracefully put it, making ""thousands of millionaires"" out of the rest of its staff and stockholders. ""Well most Americans are bitter and hateful toward anyone and anything more successful than themselves,"" one commenter wrote on that story. ""Just me or anyone else really hoping for Facebook stock to take a nose dive and never come back up? I want to watch it drop like a rock,"" one Twitter user wrote on the eve of Facebook's initial public offering Thursday. The anti-social network: Life without Facebook . Here's a rant from one financial analyst, spotted by Time.com, which shares a parent company with CNN and authored a recent post called ""Sick of hearing about Facebook? You're not alone."" ""But do I really need to see another article about how the Ferrari dealers in Silicon Valley have brought in extra inventory in anticipation of all the new millionaires? Or how Menlo Park and Palo Alto housing prices, which were already sky-high, are soaring even higher from all the new money?"" the analyst, Tracey Ryniec, wrote. ""I can't wait for this week to be over so we can talk about some other companies."" Some of the venom online was directed at the Winklevoss twins, those rowing-happy Harvard kids who repeatedly have been suing for part of Facebook. Dubbed ""the Winklevii"" in the film ""The Social Network,"" Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are set to make millions off of Facebook's IPO despite the fact that some courts have rejected their claims that Zuckerberg stole their idea for his blockbuster website. They could make $228 million for their 6 million shares in the company, according to a CNNMoney gallery on Facebook's new billionaires. At The New Yorker, Silvia Killingsworth writes that we all should give the Winklevii a bit of a break -- especially since they've been good sports about their anti-fame: . ""Sure, the Winklevii may sound a little cheesy finishing each other's sentences -- a well-enunciated mix of locker-room pep talk and well-worn entrepreneurial Web-2.0 jargon -- and they will be subject to Al Gore-style Internet-invention jokes until the end of time. But who'd have known they'd be such good sportsmen about it? In the movie, Cameron gets frustrated at one point and hollers. 'Screw it! Let's gut the frigging nerd!' In real life, the twins seem to have become entirely content with chasing the nerd around the courts, and collecting their cut of the biggest tech I.P.O. in history."" Others are teasing CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself. The comedian Andy Borowitz posted a fake letter from the 28-year-old to potential investors. It opens: . ""For years, you've wasted your time on Facebook. Now here's your chance to waste your money on it, too."" It ends like this: . ""One last thing: what will, I, Mark Zuckerberg, do with the $18 billion I'm expected to earn from Facebook's IPO? Well, I'm considering buying Greece, but that would still leave me with $18 billion. LOL. Friend me, Mark"" According to The New York Times, Facebook's new billionaires may spend their money in subtle (but still over-the-top) ways. On Thursday, the paper looked at spending culture in Silicon Valley, finding that the really rich types spend money in ways that are difficult to detect without a rich-person radar: . ""Fabulous home theaters are tucked into the basements of plain suburban houses. Bespoke jeans that start at $1,200 can be detected only by a tiny red logo on the button. The hand-painted Italian bicycles that flash across Silicon Valley on Saturday mornings have become the new Ferrari -- and only the cognoscenti could imagine that they cost more than $20,000,"" Somini Sengupta writes for the paper. ""Even at Facebook, ground zero for the nouveau tech riche, peer pressure dictates that consumption be kept on the down low."" Part of the reason some people are frustrated with Facebook this week is that all of us -- the users of Facebook -- are essentially the ones making the company so much money. My colleague Doug Gross looked at this on Wednesday. If you want to make the point really personal, check out this widget, which will tell you exactly how many dollars your Facebook page is making for the company. It's an estimate, of course, but it brings the point home. Here are details on the math they're using to make the calculations, in case you're feeling brainy. Others used the opportunity to gripe about Facebook's privacy settings, which are notoriously complicated (perhaps since the company wants info to be public): . ""Why is Facebook going public? They couldn't figure out the privacy settings either,"" wrote one Twitter user. Not all of the reaction is negative, of course. Many tech bloggers and Wall Street watchers are cheering on Facebook's run at the market, saying it's yet another Steve Jobsian expression of the American Dream. ""In 2004, who could have predicted that a Harvard sophomore would be destined to lead his dorm-room creation to a gajillion-dollar IPO eight years later?"" wrote Kasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg at The Atlantic. ""The life and times of Mark Zuckerberg are dramatic, even epic, and -- you might say -- lyrical."" For more on that, check out this faux-musical about the company's rise. ""I'm happy for Facebook, Zuck and others put in their own time efforts and own capital they deserve this reward,"" another Twitter pundit said. ""American Dream!"" Some people will see this post and say, ""Yeah, yeah yeah. Haters gonna hate."" That's the tack Facebook appears to be taking. According to the blog TechCrunch, Facebook's Toronto office created a poster that counters all the negativity by saying ""Likers gonna like"" -- a riff on the site's mechanism for sharing content with friends. The blog post ends with this little bit of sappy futurism: . ""Facebook's mission is 'making the world more open and connected.' Sometimes that means making people uncomfortable at first. You don't have to agree with how Mark Zuckerberg does things, and you can hate if you want to. But remember, Facebook's just the messenger. The message is the future."" Feel free to complain about that in the comments section.","Facebook IPO is set to create ""thousands of millionaires""
That has led some to resent the site, which makes money off its users' data .

"(Oprah.com) -- How long have you and I known each other? Well, by my calculations, we go back quite some time. This can mean only one thing: It's time for the monkey story. There are those who will suggest that even to hint at the monkey story is to bring immeasurable shame upon the good Kogan name, that its mere mention invites the sort of familial acrimony and heartache seldom witnessed outside ""King Lear."" Still, I will tell the monkey story not because I want to -- but because I must. The monkey story takes place in the late 1960s. It was, as Simon & Garfunkel used to sing, a time of innocence, a time of confidences. I wore a ""That Girl"" flip and white vinyl go-go boots. Those boots were made for walking, so I'd walk two doors down the street to the Sapersteins' house because the Sapersteins had the biggest color TV on the block, and it was impossible to fully appreciate a masterpiece like ""Batman"" in black-and-white. Anyway, at some point between Nixon's election and Elvis's comeback concert, my mother and father, brother, and cousins all went to visit the grandparents in Miami Beach ... but not the Miami Beach you're thinking of. You see, before Miami was filled with fabulously sexy models eating fabulously sexy food at fabulously sexy boutique hotels, it was filled with old people who had dinner at 5:30 and worshipped Eleanor Roosevelt. As for entertainment, a kid could check out Ponce de León at the wax museum, play a rousing game of bingo and still be bored silly by noon. And that, my friends, brings us to the monkey story. There was -- and I believe there probably still is -- a place in Florida called the Monkey Jungle. It had funny little monkeys swinging from vines overhead, it had monkey memorabilia that made monkey memories last forever, it even had a monkey that was trained to put his hairy little arms around your neck and smile for the camera. I could go on, but suffice it to say the place was lousy with monkeys, and my cousin Suzie Gale and I thought we'd found paradise, complete with souvenir shop and snack bar. Then it happened. Fact: Suzie was holding a peanut. Fact: There, high above a large cage of spider monkeys, hung a gigantic sign that read, ""Do not feed the monkeys."" Fact: I was always an inquisitive child, a sucker for an educational science project, if you will, and .. hell, I wanted to know what would happen if I fed the monkeys. Okay, strike that, I wanted to know what would happen if somebody fed the monkeys. And there was sweet Suzie with her cherry pink cheeks and her enormous angel eyes and her layers of dark, curly hair that rioted around that innocent freckled face, tangling and untangling according to the humidity, and, lo and behold, there was her peanut. ""Suzie,"" I whispered with perfect nonchalance, ""go see if that monkey wants your peanut."" This next part happened rather quickly, and my recollection is a little hazy. If memory serves, Suzie walked over to the monkey cage and held the peanut up to the bars. The monkey took the peanut, and I could see Suzie beaming with pride as she turned to look at me. Unfortunately, I could also see the monkey toss the peanut over its shoulder, reach its menacing monkey paw between the bars, grab a chunk of Suzie's hair, and yank it out of her terrified little head. I don't know how many of you have ever had to act as lookout while your mother crouches in a closet as she attempts to hide from her mother-in-law while phoning every pediatrician in the greater Miami area to inquire about any potential issues that might arise, ""if, say, for example, your 5-year-old niece happens to be mauled by a deranged monkey."" Wait a minute, I do know. None of you have had to do that, because I'm the only person in the universe who's ever sent her darling cousin out to be attacked by a monkey. In any case, the name of the column is ""Lisa Kogan Tells All,"" and now I've told you all the monkey story. It was the first bad thing I ever did -- and I remember being shocked that Walter Cronkite didn't lead with it that night on the evening news. I guess Paul Simon knows his stuff -- it really was a time of innocence. My family hadn't yet been touched by debt or divorce or death, and betrayal never amounted to more than a little bit of monkey business. The grown-ups smoked, the children tanned, we all ate red meat, and everybody thought they would live forever. But by the summer of '67, my hometown of Detroit was burning around us, and -- thanks to James Earl Ray, Sirhan Sirhan, and a war we were assured was winnable -- the shelf life on forever officially expired in 1968. Suzie Gale eventually became Suzanne Rubini, an Atlanta attorney with a lovely husband, two terrific kids and a major aversion to ""Curious George."" Because my cousin is a charitable soul, and because she understood that I would do a much better job of beating myself up than she ever could, and mostly because her hair grew back, Suzie still speaks to me. Of course, these days the conversations tend to include a lot more about politics and eye lifts than we ever would have imagined back when we played shuffleboard at our grandparents' condominium. The monkey story does occasionally come up, because it turns out you can't really have a monkey take a swipe at your head without mentioning it from time to time. But for the record, Suzie laughs when she tells the story. She's always been slightly sunnier than me -- on a bad day, I can make Sylvia Plath look like a rodeo clown. And I've always been slightly funnier than Suzie -- though she might argue that this is because I've never been attacked by a giant spider monkey. I still struggle with impulse control and guilt and the deeply unsettling truth that I am actually quite capable of hurting the people I adore, that, given the right set of circumstances, we all are. Suzie and I are both a lot older and a little wiser now, and we've learned to pay close attention when a warning sign is posted right there in front of our eyes. We fasten our seat belts, we leave the tags on our mattresses, we refuse to operate heavy machinery after a tablespoon of Robitussin -- and under no circumstances do we ever feed the monkeys.

"(CNN) -- She graced the cover of Vogue, launched a best-selling biography and was named Australian Sportswoman of the Year. Quite impressive, considering this was her ""time off work."" Even more so, given she's a race horse. Champion thoroughbred Black Caviar hasn't competed since her dramatic win at Britain's Royal Ascot eight months ago but that hasn't diminished the hype surrounding the world's greatest sprinter, who remains undefeated in a staggering 22 consecutive races. Now, after a long absence due to muscle injury, the six-year-old mare is set to return to the track in what could well prove her D-Day race. ""We're all hoping she wins on Saturday,"" co-owner Colin Madden told CNN. ""But the real benefit is she doesn't read the newspapers so she doesn't know the pressure is on."" Her performance at the Lightning Stakes, in her hometown of Melbourne, will determine if this is the last hurrah of a stellar career. ""If things go really well, we've got around two or three more races left in her,"" Madden said. And if she doesn't live up to expectations? ""We'll just have to see. The fact she got 22 wins without losing, and the affection Australians have for her, means our respect for her is so high. None of us want to see her race if she can't present herself well."" It will be a defining race for a horse who appeared ""tired and cranky"" in her most recent win at the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in June. Black Caviar, worth almost $7 million in prize money, barely nudged ahead of the tightly fought pack. It was later revealed she had muscle strain in her legs which would put her out of action -- until now. ""She was courageous the way she won at Ascot,"" Madden said. ""It was at the end of a very long run of competitions -- she'd had five races that year and a trip to the UK."" Healed and rested after an eight-month break, Madden says we'll see a return to the Black Caviar of old on Saturday -- not the mare who scrambled over the finishing line in front of a sellout crowd of 80,000 at Ascot. ""She's fully recovered. She's got a glint in her eye and her mind and body are strong,"" he added. She appeared back on top form during a training run in Melbourne last week, with bookmakers already placing the two-time Lightning Stakes winner as the favorite for Saturday's race. Depending on her performance, Black Caviar could next compete at a handful of races across Australia in the coming months, including Newmarket in Melbourne and the T.J. Smith Stakes in Sydney, said Madden. But a return to Ascot was unlikely, he added. Since demolishing the field in her first major win at the Danehill Stakes in 2009, an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred. The superstar mare, who even has her own Twitter handle, has not just won all 22 of her races -- with the exception of Ascot she has won them by staggering margins, destroying world-class fields to become one of the top-rated race horses on the planet. Her unblemished record is the second highest of all time, trailing behind only Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s. Beyond the track, Black Caviar may also have a profitable career as a breeding mare, with managing owner Neil Werrett last year hinting that champion British thoroughbred Frankel could be a good match. Frankel, who wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot with an unblemished 14-win record, has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. The top-rated race horse in the world is expected to start his new duties this month, commanding a fee of $160,000 each time he sires a foal. Win or lose on Saturday, one thing is certain -- Black Caviar has already cemented her place in the hearts of Australians. More than 10,000 people packed into Melbourne's Federation Square to watch her Ascot triumph on the big screen in June, her biography has sold 50,000 copies, and in December she became the first horse to grace the country's Vogue magazine.","Horse racing's greatest sprinter, Black Caviar, returns to track after long absence .

"(CNN) -- Who do you think you are, Internet? All this complaining and demanding you have been doing lately is making you look even more mouthy and angry than usual. It was bad enough that you exploded over the casting of Ben Affleck as Batman in the upcoming Superman movie, but then you went and started a petition to recast ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" because Charlie Hunnam and Dakota Johnson just didn't do it for you. Backlash much? Now there are screeches about the cast of this season's ""Dancing With the Stars."" The target of ire this time around is mostly ""High School Musical"" star Corbin Bleu who has been labeled a ""ringer"" because he happens to know how to dance thanks to his role as ""Chad Danforth"" in the aforementioned TV movies and film as well as some time spent on Broadway. Fans not happy with 'Fifty Shades' casting . To be fair, fellow ""DWTS"" contestant and ""Saved By the Bell"" star Elizabeth Berkley has also been targeted for knowing how to dance, though it's almost surely not because of her starring role in the now cult classic ""Showgirls."" ""It's not fair!"" stage producer Brian Howie told RadarOnline.com. ""They have the muscle memory about the ways to do this. I think it's dishonest that (the show doesn't) level the playing field."" Could it be that fans are now drunk with power after their successes? Over the years campaigns from the distraught have saved television shows like ""Family Guy,"" ""Chuck,"" ""Firefly"" and ""Friday Night Lights."" These days folks can also vote with their dollars and make things happen. Really missing ""Veronica Mars"" and wish there was a reunion movie? Kickstarter to the rescue and it is happening. According to that company, 10% of the films at Sundance last year were Kickstarter funded. Is there a movie you want to see not playing in your town? You can always hop on Tugg and make a showing happen. Couple this with the power of social media, which, because it allows users to share their opinions freely and have massive interaction with others, apparently heightens the sense of influence and power. Before you know it there's a recipe for rebellion. No place is this more obvious than over on the ""50 Shades of Grey"" Facebook page.  To say people are unhappy over this Christian Grey/Anastasia Steele casting would be an understatement. 'Fifty Shades': Before Hunnam and Johnson, was there Gosling? ""No chance,"" wrote Facebook user Olivia Michelle Hooper about Hunnam's casting. ""He does not have the right face ... he looks like he belongs in movies like Troy or 300, not as Christian Grey, and he looks a hell of a lot older than 27 (the character's age when the book begins), just saying!"" ""They are not right for it,"" wrote Ashley Taylor of Hunnam and Johnson's casting. ""Period, will not be watching the movie."" There are already calls for a boycott of ""Fifty Shades"" before a scene has even been filmed. The furor caused the film's producer, Dana Brunetti, to feel the need to explain how casting works. '""There is a lot that goes into casting that isn't just looks,"" The Daily Mail reported Brunetti as saying. ""Talent, availability, their desire to do it, chemistry with the other actor, etc. So if your favorite wasn't cast, then it is most likely due to something on that list. Keep that in mind while hating and keep perspective."" So can you please dial it back a bit, Internet, and perhaps pick and choose your battles? After all, there are brand new ""American Idol"" judges to be criticized and Miley Cyrus is sure to twerk again. You know, the important stuff.","Fans are roaring even louder and more often these days .
""Dancing With the Stars"" is the latest to suffer backlash .

"(CNN) -- There is a big debate in the world of those advocating gender parity and it goes like this. Most companies and countries around the globe have a dearth of women in leadership roles. Many people agree we should be at 50-50, but they don't agree on how to get there. For some, progress has to be ground up, based on governments providing structures that support work-life balance, companies adjusting practices to make it possible for parents to combine work and family, women leaning in, and women in power opening the doors for the next generation of women. They believe any other path to progress will be artificial. For others, change has to be top down. Mandatory quotas have to be put in place to get more women into business and politics. Without them, progress will be too slow because women will simply never get a level playing field to make it into leadership. We need both approaches. But in order to make quotas work, we need to get a whole lot smarter about them. For instance, quotas need sophisticated design - otherwise, they can backfire. So what do we know about quotas? Quotas need time to be implemented and to deliver results. In Norway, the law to implement quotas on corporate boards was passed in 2005, but companies were expected to comply by 2008. At first, board directorships were concentrated among a lucky few, known as the ""golden skirts"". But over time a wider variety of women moved into these roles, as companies learned how to expand their search for female candidates. Another example is the political quota in India. Since the mid-1990s, 33 percent of the seats in local elected bodies in villages - the panchayats - are reserved for women. Some men were initially resistant to what they saw as an undeserving advantage for women. Some even put their own female family members forward as a prop for their own ambitions. But after 20 years of growing pains, we can see change on the ground. Women are now primarily recognized and elected for their leadership on village councils. Quotas are a temporary catalyst -- if managed well they need not be used forever. In Denmark, voluntary gender quotas introduced by political parties in the 1970s, but were removed two decades later as gender balanced candidate pools became the norm. Quotas give big, unexpected returns. Many people believe that quotas will only profit specific individuals that make it into leadership through these mandatory policies and that no one else will benefit. The evidence shows otherwise. Indian village councils are responsible for providing local public goods. After more women came in through the quota, they started allocating funds to things that mattered more to women, like drinking water. In the case of boards, the evidence is more mixed. While Norwegian boards have become more professional since the quotas have been put in place, there has been an adverse effect on short-run profits. It remains to be seen if this is due to short-term negative perceptions of female management choices and whether in the long-run this pattern will change. Quotas create role models. In India, 20 years after the quota was first put in place, families' aspirations for their daughters have changed. They want them to be more educated and they want them to be leaders. Gender quotas are not ""one size fits all"". They need to be tailored to the issue they are trying to address and that means that sometimes 50-50 parity is just not possible, at least not yet. For example, while parity may be the ultimate target, a direct quota of 50% of each gender in an engineering firm that can only tap into a 30% pool of female science and engineering graduates is likely to lead to a backlash, including amongst women themselves on being perceived as being there for a quota rather than merit. But a 30% quota to tap into the full pool of women engineering graduates can lead to measures that address short-term recruiting as well as understand and root out longer term barriers, setting up the path towards parity. Quotas sometimes need co-design. The World Economic Forum put in place a 20% quota in Davos for the companies bringing the largest delegations. Specifically, a company has 5 places to come to Davos. Unless at least one place is given to a woman, the company is only allowed to bring 4 delegates. At the time the quota was introduced, this was a big stretch for some of the companies involved who didn't have women in their senior leadership and meant that some might have to forgo that 5th pass. But because it was designed collectively with them, everyone could agree to a more aspirational target because it was the right thing to do, even if it meant losses for some of them. Quotas need to take human behavior into account. For example, political quotas that seek to increase the percentage of women candidates in elections also need to make sure that women and men's names on candidate lists are randomly distributed -- otherwise the traditional ""minority"" -- women -- end up at the bottom. Quotas won't be sustainable unless other gender parity efforts are put in place. In my own country, Pakistan, there is a reservation for women in parliament, but given the poor track record of investment in women's empowerment more broadly, if the quota were to be removed tomorrow, it is unlikely to have had any lasting effect on women's integration into politics. Sometimes, the implied threat of quotas may be as effective as quotas themselves. In the United Kingdom, under a period of intense discussion regarding whether or not a 25% quota should be introduced for women on boards, companies have started changing behavior already. Three years ago women made up 12.5 % of FTSE 100 directors. They now make up 20.4 %, for the first time in history. There is no doubt that quotas distort in the short term. But they are also one of the most effective tools available to create a more level playing field in the long term. They help set a goal, they help address underlying barriers and spur for rapid change. The debate on whether or not quotas should be used is getting old and irrelevant. We need to start thinking about how quotas can be used. We now know a lot more about how quotas work and the evidence shows that are only as effective as their design. It's time to learn how to design smarter quotas. READ THIS: Join CNN's gender equality Tweetchat on March 7 . READ THIS: Why more men should be like Brad Pitt .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Yale pharmacology student who was killed by a lab technician shortly before her wedding day has sued the university, saying it failed to protect women on its campus. Annie Le, 24, was reported missing on September 8, 2009. Her strangled body was found stuffed inside a wall of a campus lab building five days later. Former Yale University lab technician Raymond Clark III has been sentenced to 44 years in prison after pleading guilty in March to the murder and attempted sexual assault of Le. Both Yale University and the Yale School of Medicine are named as defendants in the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New Haven Superior Court in Connecticut. ""Prior to September 8, 2009, Yale had long taken inadequate steps to ensure the safety and security of women on its campus,"" the complaint states. ""Sexual attacks on and harassment of women at Yale had been well-documented and longstanding problem, and there was a widespread belief that Yale repeatedly failed to impose meaningful discipline on offenders. As a result, Yale created a culture of tolerance that allowed and encouraged aggressive male behavior towards women."" The suit also cited a Title IX complaint filed by students against the university ""which highlighted Yale's failure to adequately prevent and respond to sexual harassment and sexual assaults on female students at Yale. A federal investigation of Yale's conduct in this regard is ongoing."" But the university said the suit has ""no basis."" ""Yale had no information indicating that Raymond Clark was capable of committing this terrible crime, and no reasonable security measures could have prevented his unforeseeable act,"" Yale said in a statement. ""Annie Le's murder shocked and deeply saddened the entire Yale community. As a community we united to support and comfort her family and loved ones, and create a lasting memorial to her life. This lawsuit serves neither justice nor Annie's memory, and the University will defend against it as appropriate."" Le had planned to marry Columbia graduate student Jonathan Widawsky on the day her body was found. Clark was not a Yale student but had worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004, after graduating from high school. He lived with his girlfriend, who also was a Yale lab technician, according to police. A Yale faculty member had described Clark's job as maintaining colonies for animals used in research. CNN's Maggie Schneider contributed to this report .","Yale graduate student Annie Le's body was found inside a wall at a Yale lab building .

"Washington (CNN) -- The names involved in the escalating crisis in Ukraine -- Crimea, Sevastopol, Simferopol -- make it sound far away and far removed from America's allies and its interests. But the tensions there in fact hit very close to home for the United States. First, Ukraine is not a distant empire but an integral part of Europe. Its capital, Kiev, is just a short flight from cities Americans visit all the time: Rome, Frankfurt, Paris. And, it is neighbors with some of America's closest allies. Just along its western border are Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania. All four are members of NATO and, as a result, the United States is obligated to defend them militarily if they come under threat. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but there had been discussions in recent years of enhancing ties. Second, a tug of war is playing out inside Ukraine between East and West. President Barack Obama has said the Ukraine crisis is not part of ""some Cold War chessboard,"" but Cold War-era divisions are evident on the ground. Ukraine's east is predominantly ethnic Russian and Russian speaking. The percentage is as high as 75% in the easternmost areas. Ukraine's west, by contrast, is dominated by ethnic Ukrainians. In the westernmost areas, fewer than 5% speak Russian. Obama: U.S. weighing steps to 'isolate Russia' over Ukraine crisis . Those cultural and historic divisions pull western Ukraine toward the West and Europe, and eastern Ukraine into the arms of Russia. Now, it is not black and white. Even in the hotly contested Crimean peninsula, two out of five residents are not Russian. But Ukraine's demographic map displays a clear division, which is now playing out in cities and towns and -- it appears -- even inside military bases. ""To be sure, there is an East-West divide in Ukraine, but I think it's often overstated in the West,"" said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. ""Certainly in the last two decades of Ukraine's independence, that line has blurred a lot,"" Pifer said. ""Bear in mind, in eastern Ukraine, while the majority of the people there may speak Russian, it's still a majority population that are ethnic Ukrainian. The only place in Ukraine where Russians are an ethnic majority is Crimea."" ""My sense is that in eastern Ukraine while they might not be wholly comfortable with what has happened in Kiev in the last 10 days, they are not talking about separatism. It's a very big distinction between eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Third, as Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday, Russia's military intervention violates international law, the United Nations charter and several post-war military agreements -- all of which designed to keep the peace in Europe following several 20th century wars. Russia's violation of those agreements calls into question its ability to keep the peace going forward as well as basic principles such as the sanctity of international borders. Kerry rebukes Russia's 'incredible act of aggression' in move into Ukraine . Russia is claiming that ethnic Russians in Ukraine are calling for Russian help, a claim with little so far to support it on the ground. And, looking forward, experts note there are many more Russians in, for instance, the Baltic state of Latvia, which, unlike Ukraine, is a NATO ally. What would happen if Russia did the same there? So what are Russia's interests? Why would it risk so much for a seemingly tiny corner of Ukraine. The answer lies with one of those distant-sounding places mentioned at the start of the piece: Sevastopol. Crimea caught in a 'war of information' Sevastopol is home to the base of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. It is Russia's only warm-water port, the only port Russia has that provides access to the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic year-round. This is an essential tool for projecting Russian military power abroad. When Ukraine's government abruptly shifted from pro-Russian to pro-European following protests in Kiev, Russia appeared to identify a threat to its core interests. ""I think what were really seeing are the initial steps in some form â€” maybe premature on my part, but that's OK -- of an annexation by Russia,"" said retired Army Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN contributor. Its response is the massive military intervention the world is witnessing right now. Marks said the key thing is to ensure that the crisis doesn't escalate. And to accept reality. ""I think the United States and the international community is probably going to have to accept a half a loaf -- in other words, the annexation of Crimea may be a fait accompli. We have to accept that and have to acknowledge that if (Russian President Vladimr) Putin is not going to act against Ukraine, it's certainly in our best interest,"" Marks said. ""This might, in fact, be Version Two of containment -- in fact I'd suggest it is.""","Ukraine uprising stokes Cold War tensions .

"(CNN) -- Controversial soccer star Luis Suarez will not be sacked by Liverpool despite his latest biting incident, but he faces a lengthy suspension. The Premier League club said Monday it had fined the Uruguay international for his assault on Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic, and the English Football Association later announced the 26-year-old has been charged with violent conduct. ""It is the FA's contention that the standard punishment of three matches that would otherwise apply is clearly insufficient in these circumstances,"" the ruling body said. Suarez, who was banned seven matches for biting an opponent during a Dutch league game shortly before joining Liverpool in January 2011, wrestled with Ivanovic before sinking his teeth into the Serbian's arm during Sunday's 2-2 draw at Anfield. Photos: Soccer's most controversial foul play . Suarez has until Tuesday to respond to the charge -- if he doesn't then the hearing will take place Wednesday. British Prime Minister David Cameron said any punishment for Suarez needs to take into account his high profile and responsibility as a role model. ""It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider,"" a spokesman said. ""As part of their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models."" Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre said team manager Brendan Rodgers will be working with Suarez -- the EPL's top scorer this season with 23 goals -- to improve his discipline. ""You can see when you speak to him how sorry he is about it and he's certainly shown quite a lot of contrition to us -- and as part of that, he's also asked we donate the fine to the Hillsborough Family Support Group,"" Ayre said on the club's website.. Suarez was criticized by former Liverpool captain and manager Graeme Souness for bringing shame on the club the week after the 24th anniversary of the Hillsborough stadium tragedy, in which 96 people were killed. The Hillsborough Families Support Group -- set up to help the victims of the crush that happened during the 1989 FA Cup match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest -- has accepted the donation, but said it was unhappy about the circumstances. ""I would rather not be accepting the fine from Luis Suarez because I would rather he had not bitten that player,"" its chair Margaret Aspinall told the UK Press Association. ""It is an awful thing at any time -- not just this particular week. We could refuse to accept it but it is going to have to go to someone, and he wants to show respect and remorse to the families."" Liverpool police said they would not be taking any further action after talking to Ivanovic, who refused to press charges. Ayre rejected any suggestion that Liverpool would seek to sell Suarez, who was banned for eight matches for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in October 2011 and was reprimanded by Rodgers after admitting that he dived during matches -- known as ""simulation"" -- to win free kicks and penalties. ""It affects his future in the sense that we have to work with him on his discipline -- but Luis is a very important player to the club,"" Ayre said. ""He's a very popular player with his teammates. He signed a new four-year contract last summer and we'd all love to see him here throughout that contract. He's a fantastic player, top scorer and everything we'd want in a striker, so there's no change there. ""This is more about getting him back on the right track and it's largely down to Brendan now to work with him on that side of his character."" Suarez has been warned by his boot sponsor Adidas that he must behave better. ""Adidas takes this type of incident very seriously and does not condone Luis Suarez's behavior,"" it said in a statement Monday. ""We will be reminding him of the standards we expect from our players."" The head of English Professional Footballers' Association said that Suarez needs help controlling his temper. ""We have to work hard on anger management now. We have trained counselors in this field and we will be offering their services to Liverpool and the player to try to improve matters,"" PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said. Suarez is one of six nominees for the PFA player of the year award -- voted for by his peers -- which will be announced on Sunday. ""His reputation for controversy continues to increase when he can be such a good player, one of the world's best, so it is a real dilemma now,"" Taylor told Sky Sports. Liverpool's American owners were widely criticized for not taking stronger action after the Suarez-Evra incident, and for allowing former team manager Kenny Dalglish to publicly defend his player while the FA was still investigating and after the verdict was announced. Ayre said he had been in contact with the Fenway Sports Group, which also owns baseball's Boston Red Sox, about the best way to handle this situation. ""With any incident like this, any major incident at the club, we're in direct dialogue with the owners, always. I spoke to them last night and they were happy with the way we were handling the matter,"" he said Monday.","Luis Suarez fined by his club Liverpool after biting a Chelsea opponent on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Every day in sub-Saharan Africa 700 children are infected with HIV, mostly through their mothers, according to the United Nations. Fortunately, with the right treatment most cases of mother-child HIV transmission are entirely preventable, a goal the international AIDS community is working to make a reality by 2015. To that end, the New York-based charity Born Free is teaming up with top names in the fashion and beauty industries to raise money to stop mother-child transmission of HIV once and for all. Born Free has recruited Vogue editor Anna Wintour along with 22 designers and models to each create unique wearable pieces from an exclusive print by African artist Wangechi Mutu. Proceeds from sales of the clothing will go toward getting lifesaving drugs to those who need them. Stella McCartney, Donna Karan, Tory Burch and Gisele Bundchen are just a few of the celeb mothers and designers who are participating. Shopbop, owned by Amazon, is exclusively selling the line, which launches Wednesday. Pieces cost $250 or less. ""Born Free is an idea that came from a place of deep respect for the delicate cycle of life. How incredible to be able to work with gifted designers, who as mothers recognize what the devastating loss of a child could mean and how easily that loss can be avoided,"" said Mutu. Designers were given free rein to create with Mutu's prints. Each designer presented something for mother and child. Isabel Marant, known for her bohemian vibe, went with a micro-print on a peasant blouse. Jenna Lyons from J.Crew went with louche pants and a pleated girl's skirt. The effort is the brainchild of John Megrue, chairman of private equity firm Apax Partners, who was concerned with the spread of HIV to the smallest and most vulnerable people in sub-Saharan Africa. There are a number of private, public and international organizations on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa, fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Megrue's vision was to see private sector charities like MAC AIDS and mothers2mothers join forces with organizations like UNAIDS and PEPFAR. Born Free was announced in November 2013 as an umbrella organization to raise money and distribute medicine where it's needed. With just one pill a day -- a combination of several anti-retroviral medicines -- a mother with HIV or AIDS can almost completely eradicate the risk of passing the disease on to her baby, according to Born Free. ""I am thrilled that the fashion community has so generously added their time, talent and voice to our collective efforts to meet the serious, but achievable challenge of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV by December 31, 2015,"" said Megrue. Born Free will raise money via sales of the clothing from Shopbop, donations, and Conde Nast magazine subscription fees in May and June. One hundred percent of proceeds will be donated to Born Free, and the MAC AIDS Fund will match up to $500,000 of all donations. The organization's aim is to work with governments within countries where the rate of mother-child HIV transmission is high to move toward solving the issue. ""We've seen incredible advances in HIV treatment, but to end the epidemic, we need to ensure all at-risk pregnant women are tested for HIV, and if they are positive, they receive HIV treatment so their babies can be born HIV free,"" said Nancy Mahon, global executive director, MAC AIDS Fund.","700 children are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan African daily .

"(CNN) -- Speaking to Fabien Cousteau is like plunging into dreamlike darkness. The sunlight falls away as you dive deeper and deeper underwater with him, and you can't help but hold your breath a little as he describes the alien creatures hovering at the edge of vision. I needn't fear. Fabien is a master aquanaut -- and the grandson of legendary diver Jacques Cousteau. His American accent, with soft French undertones, guides me 20 meters below the surface of the water until we rest our imaginary flippers at a very special spot on the ocean floor -- 14 kilometers off the coast of Florida Keys. It's cold down here, around 35 degrees Fahrenheit. The enormous water pressure -- three times the atmosphere on land -- bears down on us, filling our veins with nitrogen and creating the feeling of being ever so slightly drunk. As our eyes adjust to the gloom, twinkling yellow lights reveal a steel capsule the size of a school bus, with small portholes providing a glimpse of the scientists working inside. Welcome to ""Aquarius"", the only underwater laboratory in the world, and Fabien's home for a record-breaking 31 days. Cousteau's legacy . Fifty years after his famous grandfather, Jacques Cousteau, spent 30 days living in an underwater village at the bottom of the Red Sea, Fabien will follow in his footsteps with a similar project twice as deep and one day longer. In 1963, Cousteau elder turned science fiction into reality when he and a team of five divers lived in an underwater habitat -- named ""Conshelf II"" -- researching the effects of deep sea living. The pioneering experiment found cuts and grazes healed quicker and hair grew slower. New species of animals were discovered and Cousteau's haunting video diary was turned into an Oscar winning documentary, ""World Without Sun."" ""I hope we recapture the magic, mystery and beauty of the ocean which my grandfather was able to offer the world for so many decades,"" said Fabien, who takes the plunge on September 30. Mission 31 . This will be a new era of ocean exploration as the team of six aquanauts -- dubbed ""Mission 31"" -- examine not just the physical and psychological effects of underwater living, but the impact of climate change. They will use space-age motorcycles to cruise the ocean floor nine hours a day, examining marine life, coral reefs, and ocean acidity -- which is linked to carbon emissions in the air. ""It's very much in the same spirit of adventure and exploration as in my grandfather's day,"" said 45-year-old Cousteau. ""But by default we're living in a time where human impact is directly related to the ocean's health."" ""The ocean contains 99% of the planet's total living space. That said, we know so little about it -- just 5% has been explored."" Underwater ""Truman Show"" While audiences in the 1960s had to wait for Jacques Cousteau's groundbreaking documentary to hit cinemas, this time round we'll be able to follow Fabien every step of the way, thanks to rolling coverage on the Weather Channel, Skype video calls to classrooms around the world, Twitter and Facebook updates, and ultimately an IMAX film. This isn't just a new age of environmental frontiers, but media management, as ""Aquarius"" also welcomes celebrities on board, including Virgin business magnate Richard Branson and pop singer will.i.am. ""We'll have millions of eyeballs looking at us -- a bit like an underwater Truman Show,"" said Cousteau. ""Inside, it looks much like a submarine, with bunk beds, a kitchenette and a laboratory. It actually gets very warm in the habitat -- almost as humid as the Amazon River."" Risky business . This will be the longest stint researchers have spent on Aquarius -- the previous record was 18 days -- and the ambitious mission will not be without risk. Diver Dewey Smith died after his equipment malfunctioned outside the lab in 2009. The team will spend 15 days in extreme training, including diving 20 meters underwater, taking off their masks, being spun around to lose their bearings and then swimming back to the habitat. ""The point of training is to make sure we're prepared for every situation,"" said Cousteau, who has been diving since he was four. ""Once your veins are fully saturated in nitrogen you won't be able to go back to the surface because of the decompression sickness -- we'll have to slowly come back up over 24 hours."" Magic realm . For Cousteau, who grew up playing on the salt-stained deck of his grandfather's boat, the ocean is a bewitching realm -- and one he wants to share with a world which has seen more people travel into deep space than deep sea. ""Being in the water is a dream, it's part fantasy,"" he says. ""It still holds so much magic and mystery and I can only imagine what kind of sea creatures will be coming up to us during those experiments in the dark."" ""My grandfather said people protect what they love. But how can you protect what you don't understand?""","Jacques Cousteau's grandson, Fabien, to live in underwater lab 31 days .

"Palma de Mallorca, Spain (CNN) -- It was expected to be a court date like no other, with Spaniards riveted to a financial corruption case that involves members of the royal family. But on Saturday, when Princess Cristina arrived at the courthouse here just before 10 a.m., she offered them little. ""Buenos dias,"" she told reporters. ""Buenos dias."" With that, she entered the building for a proceeding that was closed to the public in a courtroom where a photograph of her father, King Juan Carlos, hangs on a wall. As head of state, his photograph hangs at many courts. Outside, several hundred anti-monarchy and pro-republic demonstrators chanted noisily. An audio recording was made of her testimony, but it is intended for internal court use only. Upon leaving about seven hours later, she offered the news media little more than she had given upon arrival. ""Hasta luego,"" she said. ""Gracias."" Her appearance marked the first time a direct member of Spain's royal family was to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime, according to Spain's royal household. Her husband, Inaki Urdgangarin, faces preliminary charges in the same matter and testified a year ago. The case centers on his nonprofit Noos foundation, which received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events. Princess maintained her innocence, lawyers said . Judge Jose Castro is investigating whether part of that money may have been diverted for private use by the princess, who is 48, and her husband, 46. Through their legal teams, both deny any wrongdoing, and in court on Saturday, the princess maintained her innocence, lawyers who were present at the proceedings said. The closed-door testimony for the princess was held at a local court here in the Balearic Islands. The courthouse is near the Marivent Palace, the royal family's summer residence on Mallorca, one of Europe's top tourist destinations. Judge Castro last April leveled preliminary charges against the princess in this case, but they were dropped in May after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. But Castro continued his investigation and last month issued a 227-page order, again bringing preliminary charges against the princess, for alleged tax fraud and money laundering through a separate company, Aizoon, in which she had a 50% stake, with her husband holding the rest. ""They used that company to pocket the public money and also to pay the lowest possible tax or simply cheat the Treasury,"" said Eduardo Inda, investigations editor at El Mundo newspaper who co-authored a book, ""Urdangarin,"" about the alleged financial improprieties. ""In that company, Princess Cristina is the one who signs the annual reports,"" Inda said. When the new preliminary charges were filed in January, Cristina's top lawyer, veteran politician and defense attorney Miquel Roca, told reporters they would appeal. But a week later, there was a sudden change of position, and it was announced that the princess would testify. Roca appeared with his client at the courthouse on Saturday. The about-face was not due to pressure from the royal household, but instead was a personal decision by the princess, who persuaded her defense team on the issue, said an official familiar with discussions within the royal household, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It was her decision to testify, simply because she has nothing to hide, and she's convinced the preliminary charges could be dropped, and it's better to testify than let the idea of cowardice be out there,"" the official said. The preliminary charges eventually could be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion. One of various corruption scandals during the economic crisis . The case is one of various financial corruption scandals affecting the royal family and major political parties and a leading union, during the economic crisis, when many Spaniards have lost jobs or had to tighten their financial belts. Princess Cristina's testimony comes as a new report by the European Commission shows that 95% of Spaniards say that corruption is widespread in the nation. The royal household two years ago excluded Princess Cristina and her husband from representing Spain at official functions, like one in Madrid this week, when the King, Queen Sofia, Crown Prince Felipe and his wife, Princess Letizia, welcomed the foreign diplomatic corps. But some Spaniards say the princess is still getting special treatment. ""It's great they're finally bringing preliminary charges,"" said student Mariana Moragrega, outside the royal palace in Madrid, on Friday. ""But considering she's the King's daughter, she'll be very protected, and won't go to jail."" Spanish media reports said the judge is not expected to immediately issue a decision on whether to proceed with the case or to drop the charges against the princess.

"London (CNN) -- Members of the royal family, UK government and dignitaries gathered Tuesday in Westminster Abbey for a service to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. The queen was accompanied to the service by her husband, Prince Philip, as well as her son Prince Charles and her grandchildren, among them Princes William and Harry. William's pregnant wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was also present. She is expecting their first child in July, just over two years after they were married at the abbey. Prime Minister David Cameron gave a reading as the service began amid pomp and ceremony. The queen acceded to the throne in 1952, but her formal coronation took place on June 2, 1953. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in his reading paid tribute to the queen's ""60 years of commitment"" and service since she was crowned. The Bishop of London, the Right Rev. Richard Chartres, also hailed the queen's ""affectionate service"" to her people in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth and ""the strength and inspiration she fosters"" there. The music and choral works performed at Tuesday's service reflected the choice of music for the coronation 60 years ago. After the service, the queen and Philip stepped out into brilliant sunshine amid the tolling of bells, climbing into a glass-topped limousine for the return journey to Buckingham Palace. Diamond Jubilee celebrations were held last year to mark the queen's 60 years on the throne. There have been 38 coronations at Westminster Abbey since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066. A special ""coronation chair"" ordered built by Edward I, who reigned from 1272 to 1307, has been used for almost every coronation since the 14th century. Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 was the first to be televised, allowing her British subjects to watch the entire ceremony.

"(CNN) -- On a blazing summer's day in 1961, a race horse called Puss n Boots decided enough was enough and took an impromptu dip in a nearby lake. The only problem? He was racing at the Fort Erie Race Track at the time. Jockey Ronnie Behrens was sent flying as the horse made a sharp detour for the scenic infield lake. Adding insult to injury, wilful Puss n Boots had been winning the race at the time. The fabled plunge has gained almost legendary status in Canada, with Fort Erie now holding an annual Puss n Boots Stakes -- ending with a traditional leap into the lake by the winning jockey and trainer. But as Canadian government funding cuts take their toll, it seems the jockeys are not the only ones trying to stay afloat. The picturesque 115-year-old Fort Erie track now looks set for closure after controversial changes to gambling taxes. ""The whole racing industry in Ontario is in trouble,"" Fort Erie Economic Development and Tourism Corporation manager, Jim Thibert, said. ""Fort Erie Race Track is on a closing plan for the end of this year. The only thing that would interrupt that plan would be if we increased our business from CAD$30million ($30.6million) to CAD$35million ($35.6million) a year."" Thibert said the outlook was fairly bleak for the historic track which employs 240 people. It is thought another 600 jobs could be lost through support services if it is forced to close its doors as planned in December. At least 25,000 racing jobs in Canada are under threat from the controversial new laws, says the industry. Under the plans, funding sourced from a tax on government-owned slot machines at race tracks will be redirected. The result? Around CAD$345million ($351million) of funding coming into the sport will be lost. Currently, race tracks and horse owners receive 10% each of this fund to invest in facilities and thoroughbreds. But from March, that money will instead be directed into the government's general revenues. Legislators in Toronto have offered CAD$50 million ($51million) of 'transitional funding' to the industry to ease the burden. But Sue Leslie, president of the Ontario Horse Racing Industry Association, said many in the industry are bracing for the worst. ""We have 17 race tracks in Ontario. Three of them have already had the government slot machines removed and one has said that they are unable to stay in business after the end of the year,"" she said. ""If that is the way it is going to be when the funding program fully closes in March, we will be down to nine race tracks at most."" She added: ""It's about jobs, sure, but it's also about the welfare of the animals too. Who is looking after the horses if no one is buying them? What level of care will they get if the amount of money is cut?"" Amid austerity, the Ontario provincial government says it was compelled to overhaul its tax system on slot machines. ""Given our current economic situation our government is committed to reviewing all programs in order to reduce the rate of spending growth,"" said ministerial spokesman Aly Vitunski. ""The Slots at Racetrack Program is no exception. Since 1998 the horse racing industry has received CAD$3.7billion ($3.77billion) in government support -- that's more money than we spend on water and road safety. ""At the end of the day we need to ask ourselves whether the government should be in the business of healthcare and education or horse racing."" Britain's Betting Levy . And it's not just the Canadian racing industry feeling the pinch. Since the 1960s, when off-track betting was legalized in Britain, the racing industry has benefited from a direct payment from bookmakers called the Betting Levy. But that Levy is now under threat as some firms take advantage of a loophole which allows them to base online wagering units outside the UK and pay no money -- despite taking bets on British races. ""The Levy has almost halved in value between 2009 and 2011 to Â£34 million ($53 million) and this is starving the sport of prize money, which is its lifeblood,"" says British member of parliament Matthew Hancock, who is trying to close the loophole. ""I speak to owners who now cannot cover their fuel costs to get to the race tracks, even when their horses perform well."" He says if no action is taken to reform the Levy, it could put at risk the livelihoods of some of the nation's 100,000 horse racing employees. In response, UK betting companies say a change in the rules would lead to extra costs for them and the possibility of 2,000 betting industry workers losing their jobs. One of the 'offshore' companies at the center of the issue, Betfair, has tried to strike a balance by signing a five-year, Â£40 million ($63 million) funding deal with the British Horseracing Association. Future of horse racing? With betting and gambling proving to be a source of funding headaches, could racing bodies walk away from wagering as a main source of revenue and look to make it in other ways? ""Relying on handouts is not the way forward and it is all about trying to harness all the assets you have in racing and not sit back on a single funding mechanism,"" says Nigel Roddis, development director of Racing for Change, an organization looking to boost race track attendances and revenues. ""It's about making the product on the track far more attractive to corporate sponsors and families alike so they want to be part of it. ""That includes marketing to a new audience -- when they come they won't just pay at the gate, they will eat here, drink here, bet here and each day adds to the diversification of our income."" And it seems to be working. The number of people visiting UK racing meetings rose by 5% in the past year, according to British horse racing commercial group The Jockey Club. Meanwhile, the British Horseracing Association will also help deliver Â£50 million ($79 million) worth of improvements to racing facilities, through the sale of the former state bookmakers. Even the owners of Fort Erie in Ontario are now turning away from gambling in a bid to secure its future. Plans for a hotel and tourist resort have overtaken the battle to secure government state funding, as Jim Thibert explained. ""We are nine miles from Niagra Falls and just over the border from the United States . We could build a place to stay which encourages tourists to come here and still see the horse racing,"" he said. ""Things are tough with the removal of the slots revenue, but there still is hope that we could get funding to build something different here and keep racing alive.""","Half of Ontario's race tracks could close when government pulls funding scheme .

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II pledged to rededicate herself to the service of her people Tuesday, as she addressed both houses of Parliament as part of celebrations of her Diamond Jubilee, or 60 years on the throne. Dignitaries including present and former government leaders gathered for the speech in Westminster Hall, in London, in which the Queen reflected on the landmark. ""We are reminded here of our past, of the continuity of our national story and the virtues of resilience, ingenuity and tolerance which created it,"" she said. ""I have been privileged to witness some of that history and, with the support of my family, rededicate myself to the service of our great country and its people now and in the years to come."" She was presented with a stained-glass window specially commissioned by members of the House of Lords and House of Commons to commemorate the occasion. Made up of 1,500 pieces of glass, it was paid for by personal contributions from the lawmakers and peers and will be on permanent display in the grand environs of Westminster Hall. Queen Elizabeth commented that she is the second British monarch to mark 60 years on the throne, with Queen Victoria the first to do so in 1897. ""So, in an era when the regular, worthy rhythm of life is less eye-catching than doing something extraordinary, I am reassured that I am merely the second sovereign to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee,"" she said. Queen Elizabeth previously addressed both houses of Parliament when she celebrated her Silver and Golden Jubilees, in 1977 and 2002 respectively. She also opens the new session of Parliament each year. Addressing the packed hall, the British monarch recognized the ""remarkable courage and sacrifice"" of the armed forces, and the many people who serve the public good by volunteering. During her many years on the throne, the support of her own family had been ""beyond measure,"" she said. She paid special tribute to the contribution of her husband, Prince Philip, who accompanies her on many of her official visits and suffered a health scare at the end of last year. ""Prince Philip is, I believe, well-known for declining compliments of any kind. But throughout he has been a constant strength and guide,"" she said. She also praised the efforts of the younger generations of royals and commented on the family's ""close affinity"" with the Commonwealth nations, which together encompass about a third of the world's population. ""My own association with the Commonwealth has taught me that the most important contact between nations is usually contact between its peoples,"" she said. Prince Harry, the 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, traveled through the Caribbean and Brazil earlier this month on a 10-day tour to mark his grandmother's Diamond Jubilee. Celebrations marking six decades on the throne for Queen Elizabeth II officially began last month and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. Though the 85-year-old monarch has no real political power, she is officially the head of state for the Commonwealth of Nations, an association of 16 countries that used to be part of the British Empire. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Queen Elizabeth II praises her people's ""virtues of resilience, ingenuity and tolerance""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Los Angeles Episcopalians elected an openly lesbian bishop late Saturday, the denomination's news service reported. The Rev. Mary Douglas Glasspool, 55, will become the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church since Gene Robinson took office in New Hampshire in 2004, if she is formally approved. Conservative factions in the Anglican Communion -- a 77-million member denomination worldwide, with the Episcopal Church as its U.S. branch -- have opposed the ordination of gay bishops. The archbishop of Canterbury, the head of the Anglican Communion, issued a statement Saturday saying that Glasspool's election ""raises very serious questions not just for the Episcopal Church and its place in the Anglican Communion, but for the Communion as a whole,"" according to the Episcopal Church's Web site. Glasspool's election is the first choice of an openly gay bishop since the church ended an agreement designed to keep the worldwide Anglican Communion from tearing itself apart.  In the wake of the Robinson controversy, Episcopalians called a temporary halt to appointing any more openly gay bishops, to give the church time to hammer out a compromise.  They voted this summer not to renew the ban. Glasspool, now based in Baltimore at the Diocese of Maryland, is the first openly gay candidate elected bishop since then. The Diocese of Minnesota considered an openly gay candidate for bishop in October, but chose another priest when votes were cast. Some Episcopal leaders reacted angrily to Glasspool's election. The Rev. Canon Kendall Harmon, canon theologian from the Diocese of South Carolina, said the election ""represents an intransigent embrace of a pattern of life Christians throughout history and the world have rejected as against biblical teaching,"" according to the Episcopal Church site. Glasspool will assist Bishop Diocesan J. Jon Bruno in ministry to the Los Angeles region's 70,000 parishioners, according to that diocese's Web site. She will become one of two bishops suffragan -- the second-highest position in the clergy of the diocese -- if she is formally approved. The choice requires consent from a majority of the church's other 108 dioceses. ""If by chance people are going to withhold consents because of Mary's sexuality, it would be a violation of the canons of this church,"" Bruno said, according to the Episcopal Church site. Glasspool also becomes the second woman bishop in the 114-year history of the diocese -- elected only hours after the first, the Rev. Diane Jardine Bruce, 53. She is the 17th woman elected as an Episcopal bishop nationwide, according to the diocese Web site. ""She's not afraid of conflict and she is a reconciler,"" Bruno said, according to the Web site. Glasspool and her partner of 19 years are an example of loving service and ministry, he added. Her partner, Becki Sander, recently earned a doctorate in social work. Glasspool, who has been ordained a priest for 27 years, is the daughter of an Episcopal priest, the diocese said. She and Bruce were among six candidates nominated by a 24-member diocesan committee, according to the diocese. Bruce is now rector at St. Clement's by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Southern California. Describing herself when she was nominated, she wrote: ""At St. Clement's by-the-Sea, I pastor in a mixed Latino/Anglo neighborhood. Next to million-dollar homes near the beach are buildings with two or three families sharing one small apartment. We offer three services every Sunday: two in English and one in Spanish. I minister to a group ranging from the very wealthy to the very poor. I am most proud of having helped start the Peaceful Warrior Tae Kwon Do Academy for at-risk youth in the neighborhood.""","Rev. Mary Douglas Glasspool would be nation's second openly gay Episcopal bishop .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to become the nation's fourth female Supreme Court justice, setting up a final confirmation vote by the Senate. The committee vote broke down mostly along partisan lines, with one Republican joining the panel's Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate on a 13-6 vote. Democrats repeatedly characterized Kagan as a strong legal thinker who would be a fair judge, while Republicans slammed her as an inexperienced activist who would be unable to divorce her legal judgments from her political opinions. Members on both sides expressed frustration with a confirmation hearing process many observers say increasingly yields few clear answers about a nominee's judicial philosophy. ""Elena Kagan is one of this country's leading legal minds, and has shown throughout this process that, if confirmed, she would be a fair and impartial Supreme Court Justice who understands how decisions made by the Court affect the lives of everyday Americans,"" President Barack Obama said after the vote. The ""vote by the (committee) is a bipartisan affirmation of her strong performance during her confirmation hearings."" ""There is no question about Elena Kagan's qualifications,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. ""In my view, there is no good reason to deny her appointment."" She is clearly among nation's ""top legal minds."" ""Her grasp of each area of the law, and to reason within it, compared favorably with any of the nominees I have seen come before us,"" Feinstein added. ""Candidly, it surpassed some."" Kagan has demonstrated a ""keen intellect,"" ""judicial modesty,"" and respect for legal precedent, said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin. ""I'm confident she will make a superb Supreme Court justice."" Not so, said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. Kagan has ""extremely limited experience"" as a practicing attorney, he said. Her record ""has not been (one) of impartiality."" She has ""far left ideological beliefs"" and is likely to use an ""outcome-based approach"" to cases. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, called Kagan's June testimony ""disingenuous"" and ""deceptive."" Her ""policy preferences will influence her legal judgments"" if confirmed, he predicted. Among other things, the committee's Republicans highlighted Kagan's role in limiting military recruiters at Harvard Law School because of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. Several Republicans have said Kagan, who was the law school dean, sought to treat the military as second-class by denying recruiters access to the campus Office of Career Services. Kagan has argued she provided an ""equally effective substitute"" by requiring military recruiters to use a veterans service office. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, broke with other GOP committee members by voting for Kagan's nomination. Graham -- also the lone committee Republican to back Justice Sonia Sotomayor's nomination last year -- said he had ""100 reasons"" to oppose Kagan's nomination on philosophical grounds. But, he argued, elections have consequences, and senators should be deferential to presidential nominating decisions. Kagan, he argued, is sufficiently qualified, has a good character, and is capable of acting as a judge as opposed to a politician. Noting the controversy over Kagan's role in Harvard's military recruiting controversy, Graham said he would oppose her nomination if he believed she has ""animosity in her heart"" for members of the armed services. But ""I believe she is ... very patriotic,"" he said. Graham said he is hopeful that Democrats will follow his lead the next time a Republican president makes a high court nomination. If a liberal such as Kagan can be confirmed, he said, ""I hope Judge (Robert) Bork can be a conservatives' hero"" and be confirmed as well. Many legal and political analysts said the hearings went as expected, with clear ideological divisions, and very little of substance revealed about Kagan's views of specific issues. ""It's a real advantage for Elena Kagan that she's never been a judge with controversial opinions, so she was nominated just because of her lack of an explicit paper trail,"" said Mark Miller, a lawyer and political science professor at Clark University. ""And that's what the current politics of Washington demanded. I think Obama wanted a relatively easy confirmation and it looks like he's going to get it."" The committee's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, noted Kagan did not advise the Obama administration on legal and constitutional issues surrounding a massive overhaul of healthcare. Her supplemental written responses Monday to questions from GOP senators seemed to indicate she would not recuse herself as justice if the legislation were appealed to the high court. In reference to a pending lawsuit over the legislation by several state attorneys general, Kagan wrote, ""I attended at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned, but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred."" Kagan added she was neither asked nor offered any opinion about the legislation or any appeals, and did not review any internal administration documents. Her new answers also offer a possible reason -- she purposely scaled back her job duties as solicitor general in April, after the White House quietly told her she was being seriously considered for the high court. Kagan was eventually nominated May 10. The full Senate vote is expected to vote on Kagan's nomination before departing for its August recess. If approved, Kagan will fill the seat of retiring Justice John Paul Stevens and become the 112th person to join the high court.

"(CNN) -- Imagine hurtling down a mountain at 60 miles an hour. Now imagine doing it virtually blind. For Kelly Gallagher, it's a thrilling reality. She might not quite reach the speeds of fully-sighted skiers -- Olympic champions can clock upwards of 90 mph -- but it is nonetheless a daunting prospect. It involves a great deal of trust in her guide, Charlotte Evans, a former skier herself who will play a key role in their chances of success at next month's Winter Paralympics in Sochi. ""I don't really have depth perception, so snow in particular is quite difficult,"" Gallagher tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I definitely need Charlotte to be able to help me ski."" The 28-year-old from Northern Ireland was born with oculocutaneous albinism, a condition that affects skin, hair and eyes. Bright lights give her difficulties, forcing her to squint. ""I grew up not really realizing the extent of my visual impairment,"" she says. ""I was always encouraged by my parents to do whatever I wanted to do and if I wanted rollerblades, my mum would reluctantly let me have them. ""So although I know I have a visual impairment, it hasn't really stopped me in too many ways -- other than I can't drive a car."" Gallagher was certainly a late bloomer when it came to skiing, only taking it up -- understandably with some trepidation -- as a 17-year-old while on a family holiday in Andorra, the tiny landlocked nation bordering Spain and France. ""I tried to convince the instructor that I couldn't see anything,"" she says. ""He thought it was the bad visibility. ""We just got on with it and had a go, and I've never felt that sense of freedom or sense of joy from anything I'd done, so it was something I really threw myself into when I was at university. ""It's a real joy and something I haven't found in another part of my life. Ski racing and skiing at speed, it's something that I'm not able to do on a bike or on a car or on a horse. ""I always have to give away that responsibility or that part of enjoyment to someone else. Somebody else is always driving or I'm not able to go fast on a bike or I'm doing it in tandem, but with Charlotte skiing in front of me, I'm doing it all my own and she's just leading me."" Evans serves as Gallagher's eyes as they twist, turn and descend on tricky terrain. She guides Gallagher, who trails a few meters behind, down the course, as they communicate through microphones in their respective helmets. Gallagher tunes out the sound of the wind, spectators and looming helicopters, focusing solely on Evans' voice. It's then up to Gallagher to make adjustments as she's warned about a difficult patch, told to ""tuck"" or, conversely, drop speed. Call it a sort of leap of faith but also a study in quick reflexes. ""Charlotte and I worked a lot off snow in order for us to have that foundation on snow,"" Gallagher says, revealing that they saw a sports psychologist early on to help their partnership. If they can't communicate due to a breakdown in the audio equipment, Evans will -- and has -- stopped races. ""Safety first"" is her mantra, though Gallagher admits she wasn't averse to throwing caution to the wind earlier in her career. ""There's a confidence that comes with knowing Charlotte is in front of me,"" said Gallagher. ""Even if Charlotte is in difficulty, I am very confident skiing behind her. She wouldn't be bringing me into a situation where I wouldn't be able to cope with anything."" Evans is a former English champion who combined with Gallagher after a serious knee injury essentially ended her own competition hopes. By the time they met in November 2010, Gallagher had already made history by becoming Northern Ireland's first Winter Paralympian at the Vancouver Games earlier that year. When her guide -- another ex-racer named Claire Robb -- later left, Gallagher was ""desperate"" to find someone else in order to continue her athletic career. In came Evans, who had snapped her cruciate ligament at the British Championships but still harbored hopes of a comeback. ""I was asked to do this and my first instinct was, 'I must be crazy. I can't have that responsibility. I'm 18. I can't. I don't think I'm ready for that,' "" Evans recalls. ""It was actually my dad who was very much like, 'You have to just try. What's the problem?' ""I did. The plan was to go back but I made a lot better decision and I'm now here four years later."" The two are like family now. Even when on individual holidays, thoughts of the other are never far away. ""We would talk about this thing called, 'mention-itis,' "" says the ever-bubbly Gallagher. ""Whenever I go home, it takes me a good four to five days to stop being like, 'Charlotte thinks this' or 'Charlotte doesn't like to eat that.' ""Even on Charlotte's worst day, I would rather be with her than anyone else skiing. I find it a total delight to ski with her."" ""Awww!"" responds Evans. There's no doubt that the chemistry has led to fine results, so a medal or two in Sochi -- the Paralympics begin on March 7 -- wouldn't come as a surprise. They plan to compete for Great Britain in all five alpine skiing events -- the downhill, super-G, super combined, giant slalom and slalom. The pair warmed up by winning a super combined race in Canada in January, and they grabbed two silver medals and two bronze medals at last year's world championships in La Molina, Spain. ""I think our hopes are just to ski as well as we can and stick to what we know and not try to change anything,"" says Evans. ""It'll be my first Games. I'm normally the confident one who says, 'We're going to this race and we're going to do this,' but maybe Kelly will be my help and bring me back to the base. ""We can't wait to get on the big stage."" At some point Evans wants to finish her degree in sports science. As for Gallagher, she admits she's nervous about returning to her job as a statistician -- because her ""brain has really turned to mush"" since immersing herself in skiing. For the time being, though, and with Evans' assistance, the numbers might add up to success in Sochi.","Kelly Gallagher and Charlotte Evans will be competing at the Sochi Winter Paralympics .

"(CNN) -- When the Google Maps app for the iPhone had finally been released late Wednesday night, there was a collective rejoicing from Apple fans worldwide -- many took to Twitter and Facebook to relish in the news and download it immediately. Not at all surprisingly, the app quickly soared to the top of the free apps list in the Apple App Store. But with expectations beyond high for Google to swoop in and save the day from Apple's unreliable, problematic maps app -- which replaced the existing Google Maps app in September with the rollout of the new iOS 6 software -- many just hoped Google's version would live up to promises of being a superior mapping platform for the iPhone. SEE ALSO: Google Maps Soars to Top of Free App List . On the surface, it wouldn't have to take much to beat out the Apple Maps app, which had been widely criticized for omitting transit directions, giving poor navigation and displaying incomplete 3D views that distort national monuments, such as the Eiffel Tower. Not to mention the broken roads and satellite views that display nothing but clouds. The good news, however, is that the Google Maps app is excellent. Superb, even. But not perfect -- some are reporting issues with direction accuracy as well. Overall, users will have to choose to access it over Apple Maps which already comes on the platform. Here's a look at how the two stack up: . Accuracy . Google Maps has years of experience perfecting data accuracy and the latest app shows it. When typing in an address in the New York City area, it quickly identified our location and presented us with the target destination, even when a vague address was used. However, some users have expressed frustration with direction accuracy so far, but the reports are nowhere near the inaccuracy outcry caused after the launch of the Apple Maps app. Apple Maps was slammed for accuracy issues right out of the gate in September. The hits just kept on coming, too -- police in Australia recently issued a warning not to rely on Apple Maps since it was steering users to areas far from their destinations and in one case, misdirected a group of people who became stranded in dangerous terrain with no water. Apple worked for years to build trust in its users that its products just work (always), but this set the company back a bit. Now, people love to talk about how much they hate the Apple Maps app. (Apple CEO Tim Cook has since fired the manager in charge of apps). Voice Navigation . A perk for both platforms: voice-assistant Siri can help users out with directions via Apple Maps, while Google's platform also features voice guided turn-by-turn navigation. This was rumored to be a big point of contention in why Google Maps was kicked off iOS in the first place, but now both services have it -- an effective draw. Public Transportation . One of the biggest gripes about Apple Maps was that it didn't come with public transportation directions. Google Maps not only provides detailed instructions on how to get from one point to another, it also gives estimated times of arrival for the next train and pinpoints when you will arrive at a destination. Interface, 3D Views . The Google Maps interface is sleek and more organized than ever before. Users can select a home and work address within their profile to keep it on hand and quickly get directions. But say what you want about Apple Maps and its accuracy issues, it's hard to deny its interface is gorgeous and touts some impressive features. For example, by accessing the satellite view in Maps for cities such as New York, San Francisco and London, users are treated to 3D imagery. Attention to detail is so spot on that it almost looks like you're flying through streets as though you were in a video game. Although Google Maps incorporates 2D and 3D views via Street View, as well as the rotating and tilting of maps with gestures inside the app, we still prefer Apple's design. One-Stop Shop . Google Maps has made a poignant effort to become a destination spot on the iPhone. Typing in the name of a business not only reveals directions on how to get there, but additional information that may be of interest. For example, Google has partnered with such as Yelp and Zagat to provide users with a full look at restaurant reviews, menus, photos and making reservations. This capability is not yet available via Apple Maps. Developer Integration . As a bonus for developers -- and app users alike -- Google announced Google Maps SDK for iOS, which gives app developers the opportunity to use maps within apps for the iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad. This will help users easily search and get the directions they want while using other apps and ultimately strengthen Google's maps reach. Final Destination . While Apple Maps excels in some ways (3D rendering in particular) there are just too many arrows in Google Maps' quiver -- especially now that it's brought turn-by-turn navigation to its iOS app. Public transit, street view and easy searching propel Google to a clear victory -- for now. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Officials working to free 33 trapped miners in northern Chile denied Thursday they are under political orders to rescue the men ahead of President Sebastian Pinera's planned mid-month trip to Europe. ""No decision about any part of the rescue operation has been linked to any political decision. The miners' health and technical decisions come first,"" Interior Minister official Cristian Barra said in a news conference at the San Jose gold and copper mine. ""The president's agenda is not connected to the timeline for rescue. There are no guarantees this will be before October 17,"" he added. Pinera said earlier this week he believed the 33 miners would be rescued before October 15. He is due to depart on a government visit to Europe on October 17, government officials said. In his last visit to the mine on September 19, Pinera pledged to return the day the miners were extracted and personally hug each one. Mines Minister Laurence Golborne said over the weekend that his best estimate was that the miners would be extracted in the second half of October. Political opponents and even some relatives of the trapped miners have speculated in recent weeks that Pinera was trying to score political points from the miners' rescue. National opinion polls show his popularity has risen thanks to his handling of the accident. Prior to the disaster his administration had been under political fire for the slow pace of government reconstruction after the February earthquake and tsunami along Chile's south and central coast, and for his handling of a hunger strike by members of the Mapuche indigenous group of southern Chile, who are fighting for independence. Against the backdrop of political questioning, technical problems plagued the drilling effort at the San Jose mine. The Strata 950 drill, dubbed Plan A, had reached 587 meters by 8 a.m. Tuesday. The men are nearly 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground, but could be rescued from different levels. Andre Sougarret, mines manager for state-run copper company Codelco and on-site rescue coordinator, said that operation was stopped Tuesday while the drill head was changed. It was not expected to resume until late Wednesday. It is currently making its first pass down with a 12.5-inch diameter hole to the roof of the 50-square-meter (500-square-foot) refuge at Level 100 (100 meters above sea level). It would have to make a second pass to widen that shaft to 28 inches. The Schramm T-130 drill, so-called Plan B, was at 466 meters as of 8 a.m. Tuesday and is aiming for the roof of the mine workshop on Level 135 (135 meters above sea level). It had completed just two meters in the previous 24 hours. Sougarret said the drill hammer had been swapped out but hit fresh problems after running into rock that was tougher than expected. He said the drill diameter would be reduced from 28 inches to 26 inches until the hammer had cleared the hard rock but added that the slightly smaller diameter would not cause problems for the rescue. The Rig 421 oil drill, so-called Plan C, is currently at 265 meters and en route to the roof of the tunnel at Level 150 (150 meters above sea level). It is currently drilling a 17.5-inch diameter hole -- smaller than the 28 inches required to rescue the miners -- in an effort to realign after veering off course over the weekend. Mine engineer Renee Aguilar, another of the rescue coordinators, said the first 10 members of a 16-strong extraction team arrived at the San Jose mine Tuesday. The group consisted of Codelco rescue experts. Two other rescue experts from the northern Atacama region, along with three Navy and one police paramedic, were due to arrive at the mine later Tuesday. Once the rescue shaft has been completed and the extraction begins, four members of the 16-person team will be chosen to descend into the mine to carry out final medical checks on the 33 miners. They will then enclose the miners, one-by-one, in a 21.5-inch diameter rescue cage that has been dubbed the ""Phoenix capsule."" Rescuers on the surface will winch them up. Jean Romagnoli, sports medic and personal trainer working to get the miners in shape for their rescue, said the Phoenix capsule would be hoisted to the surface at a speed of about 60 kilometers per hour and would exert about 2 Gs of pressure on the miners. He said small bio-metric monitors, mounted on chest belts, had been sent down to the miners to help keep track of their physical condition. He said the miners are working out for at least one hour a day to ensure they keep their weight down and can fit into the rescue capsule. The U.S.-made monitors, known as Zephyr BioHarnesses, will record the miners' vital signs, pulse, heart rhythm and breathing. Romagnoli said similar monitors were used to check on the physical training of Chile's Davis Cup tennis stars.","Interior minister says the operation is not ""linked to any political decision""

"(CNN) -- It's the time of the year when pumpkins are all the rage. The biggier and heavier, all the more to brag about. Across the country, growers trot out their lovingly grown monster pumpkins. The record holder is a Rhode Island man who last year grew a 1-ton pumpkin that he aptly named ""The Freak II."" On Sunday, a Long Island, New York, man took the top honors for the island's largest pumpkin -- a modest, but nevertheless, massive 1,456 pounds. For five months, Scott Armstrong tended to the pumpkin in his backyard. His prize: $500, a plaque, a blue ribbon, and a trophy. CNN talked to Scott Armstrong about what it takes to grown a giant pumpkin: . Getting into the giant pumpkin business: . ""It's something I always wanted to do as a kid. I've been doing this since 1998. It's just a hobby but here I am 15 years later. I work a normal day job (he's a banker). Pumpkin raising is my hobby."" On the winning recipe: . ""I started growing this pumpkin in May. It takes about 5 months."" ""If you get rain or heat at the wrong time â€” too little or too much temperature â€” it all has an impact on growing the pumpkin. It's a fun thing I like to do. And this year, all the stars lined up for me. It doesn't always work out that way. It's extra special when it does."" On the right pumpkin seeds: . ""I order this special seed, called an Atlantic Giant. That's the main seed used to produce the really huge pumpkins."" ""Everybody grows tomatoes and all that other fun stuff, but pumpkins have been my main focus. I trade seeds with guys from all over the world."" Getting the pumpkin to the scale: . ""This year's pumpkin weighed in at 1,456. To get it to the scale, I move the pumpkin from my backyard into my truck. I do it myself, but the trick is getting it into the truck. I use a tripod hoist. I've never dropped it before, but that would be bad."" Fate of the winning pumpkin: . ""The pumpkin is sitting in the back of my truck in my driveway right now. Nine out of 10 times, my giant pumpkins just end up on the front yard. I cut it open a few days after Halloween and take the seeds out. I dry them and send them out to people around the world. We've tried to carve the pumpkins as jack-o-lanterns before. It could have gone better. Let's just say that.""","Scott Armstrong tended to his pumpkin in his backyard .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity. Pinera visited the mine Sunday and spoke with the trapped workers. He also presented their families with a copper plate engraved with the words miners first used to tell rescuers they were alive, ""We're fine, in the shelter, all 33."" ""This is all politics. It's dirty. It's trickery and propaganda. They're playing with the feelings of our loved ones,"" said Nelly Bugueno, mother of trapped miner Victor Zamora. The mine rescue appears to have boosted Pinera's popularity at a time when he was under fire in other parts of the country. In the south of Chile, Pinera is battling a hunger strike by 34 Mapuche Indians, part of the indigenous group's ongoing campaign for independence. Along the central and southern coast, some Chileans accuse the government of being too slow to rebuild after the February earthquake and tsunami. But his overall approval rating surged to 56 percent in August, according to a survey by Adimark GfK, a 10 percent increase over the July numbers. The Chilean research company said the increase was ""directly related with the rescue operations of the trapped miners in the San Jose mine."" When the workers first sent word that they were alive, Pinera triumphantly waved their written note before television cameras. Sunday was his fifth visit to the mine. Outside the mine Sunday, some family members said they were angry that the rescue effort was being turned into a political spectacle. ""We know politicians want to show off, but I don't care about the politics. All I care about is that the president gets our boys out,"" said Cristina Nunez, wife of miner Claudio Yanez. The sister of another trapped miner accused rescuers of delaying the switch-on of a recently-assembled oil rig -- the so-called Plan C drill -- until Pinera arrived Sunday. She also claimed rescuers discovered the miners were alive in an underground shelter in the early hours of August 22, but waited until midday to officially announce the news, after Pinera arrived at the mine. She declined to be named for fear of losing her job for anti-government comments. ""We're still not free in Chile to speak our mind,"" she said. Another woman, the wife of one of the miners, said families were sometimes not given information in a timely fashion. The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of unspecified reprisals, said she did not bother to wait in the hot sun to meet the president Sunday. ""I got tired of waiting and I'm bored of the way he's doing things. The mining minister and the rescuers have done a good job, but the president is playing with us,"" she said. Not all relatives, however, felt frustrated by political overtones in the rescue effort. ""We have to be calm. God works on his own schedule and we have to wait patiently,"" said Eli Steger, daughter of trapped miner Jose Ojeda. The president arrived at the mine at midmorning Sunday, flying in on a military helicopter that landed in the desert, kicking up dust. He spent about an hour and a half at the mine. He met 5-day-old Esperanza Ticona, the daughter of Ariel Ticona, one of the trapped miners -- and kissed her in front of television cameras. Esperanza was brought to the mine for the first time Sunday by her mother, Elizabeth Segovia. Watch how miners' families marked independence day . ""Hopefully this spirit of unity, faith, confidence and pride to be Chilean that is in the air at the San Jose mine and in every corner of Chile is a spirit that will illuminate this third century of independence,"" Pinera said, referring to Chile's recent bicentennial celebration. Away from reporters, Pinera first visited a powerful oil drill that has been transported to the mine to assist in the rescue. The drill, known as Plan C, began operating Sunday. Mine experts say it could be the fastest way of punching through rock a hole that is wide enough to hoist the miners back to the surface. Two other drills, a Schramm T-130 (Plan B) normally used for boring water holes and a Raise Borer Strata 950 (Plan A) normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines, have been operating for about three weeks. Sunday was the first day that all three drills were working simultaneously, Pinera said.","Pinera is battling a hunger strike by 34 Mapuche Indians in south of Chile .

"Anaheim, California (CNN) -- In the shadows of Disneyland, often referred to as the ""happiest place on Earth,"" many children are living a reality that's far from carefree. They are living in cheap motels more commonly associated with drug dealers, prostitutes and illicit affairs. It's the only option for many families that are struggling financially and can't scrape together a deposit for an apartment. By living week to week in these cramped quarters, they stay one step ahead of homelessness. ""Some people are stuck, they have no money. They need to live in that room,"" said Bruno Serato, a local chef and restaurateur. ""They've lost everything they have. They have no other chance. No choice."" While ""motel kids"" are found across the United States, the situation is very common in Orange County, California, a wealthy community with high rents and a large number of old motels. In 2009, local authorities estimated that more than 1,000 families lived in these conditions. When Serato learned that these children often go hungry, he began serving up assistance, one plate at a time. To date, he's served more than 270,000 pasta dinners -- for free -- to those in need. ""Kids should not be suffering,"" Serato said. ""[I had] to do something."" Serato, 55, has always given back to the community where he achieved his American dream. When the Italian immigrant arrived in the U.S. 30 years ago, his poor English skills forced him to settle for a job as a dishwasher. But within five years, he had become chef and owner of the Anaheim White House, an Italian restaurant that is now a local hot spot. In 2003, he created Caterina's Club, which raises money for underprivileged children. The charity is named after Serato's mother, who taught him how to cook at the family's trattoria in Verona, Italy. When she came to California in 2005 to visit her son, he took her to the local Boys & Girls Club, the main recipient of the charity's funds. There, they saw a small boy eating a bag of potato chips and learned that this snack was his supper. Bruno said his mother was shocked by the boy's meager meal. She had raised seven children and always made sure food was on the dinner table, even during the lean years after World War II. ""My mama ... her whole life was to feed kids,"" he said. The Seratos found out that the boy lived in a motel with his family. The situation was so common in the area that the Anaheim Boys & Girls Club had a ""motel kids"" program, where vans pick up the children after school and drop them off at the motels every night. While these children receive free breakfast and lunch through school programs, their parents often don't have the resources to give them dinner. Caterina found it unacceptable that the children would go to bed without supper. Speaking in rapid Italian, she made her feelings clear to her son. ""Mom said, 'Bruno, you must feed them the pasta!' "" Serato recalled. When he discovered that this meant feeding around 70 children, he demurred. But his mother insisted. He went back to his restaurant and prepared 70 pasta dinners to serve at the club. His mother helped him that first night, and Serato has maintained the ritual nearly every night for more than six years -- even through the recession. The economic downturn was a challenge, though. Serato lost 30% to 40% of his customers, and the number of children he fed each night more than doubled. He often found himself giving away more meals than he served in his restaurant, and he was forced to refinance his home to keep going. But Serato found that his work with the children helped sustain him, at least on a personal level. ""So many nights ... it was not too many customers,"" he said. ""[To] know that I served 150 kids ... it made me feel better."" Today, Serato's business has rebounded, and his program feeds nearly 200 children, in two locations, seven days a week. He also pays for drivers to transport the kids to the Boys & Girls Club, and he has purchased another van. All told, he estimates that the endeavor costs him around $2,000 a month. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Michael Baker, the executive director of the Anaheim Boys & Girls Club, says many of the ""motel kids"" he serves depend on Serato's meals. He also relishes the irony of the situation. ""These are some of the poorest kids in Anaheim eating from one of the most exclusive restaurants every night,"" he said. ""I love that!"" Carlos Gomez, 12, has lived in a motel room with his family -- a total of six people -- for almost his entire life. He and his younger brother Anthony often eat Serato's pasta, and his father, Martin, says it's a relief to know that his children can get a free meal. ""I no longer worry as much, about them [coming home] and there being no food,"" he said. ""I know that they eat over there at [the] Boys & Girls Club."" This spring, Serato plans to expand his program to an additional 100 kids a night, and he will partner with another organization to give 100 children three meals a day. He is also calling on other restaurants around the country to work together to feed ""motel kids."" He believes that providing just a few dinners a night could make a significant difference. ""Every restaurant in the country -- Chinese, Indian, Mexican, French -- let's do it all together,"" Serato said. ""We would have no hungry children."" Serato's love for the children is clear, but he's quick to give all of the credit to his beloved ""mama"" back in Italy. Although she suffers from Parkinson's disease, he still talks to her via Skype every morning and believes that if she knew how their work has grown, she would be proud. Although his mother made him start the work, he now says he could never stop helping the children. ""They're customers,"" he says with a smile. ""My favorite customers."" Want to get involved?

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A court in Turkey's capital, Ankara, lifted a ban on the YouTube video sharing website Friday, the semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. The ruling came a day after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said Turkey's ban on the social media service Twitter had been lifted. Ankara's Golbasi Court opted Friday to lift its March 27 ruling that barred access to all YouTube content, Anadolu reported, but decided to continue a block on 15 specific YouTube links. In its ruling, the court said that blocking access to the website was contrary to fundamental rights and freedom of expression, the news agency said. It's not clear how soon the ruling will come into effect. Access to YouTube still appeared to be blocked for Turkish users Friday. The restoration of Twitter came after Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled Wednesday that the ban violated the right to free expression and demanded that citizens' access to the popular microblogging service be restored. Several Twitter users told CNN on Thursday that the social media service was now functional inside the country. Disruption to the service began hours after Erdogan threatened to ""eradicate"" Twitter at a campaign rally on March 20, blaming social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric. The YouTube ban was imposed less than a week later. Turks went to the polls in nationwide municipal elections Sunday. Wiretap leaks . The Turkish government said its YouTube block was a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring Syria. Turkey's top media regulating agency announced a similar ban on the broadcast of the conversation to television and radio channels. Members of Turkey's political elite have been battered by a campaign of wiretap leaks recorded by unknown operatives and distributed daily on the Internet for more than a month. Until the purported Syria-related leak, all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations among Erdogan, his inner circle, government officials and top corporate executives. Erdogan, of the ruling Justice and Development Party, has called some recordings ""immorally edited material,"" including a conversation in which a man who sounds like the Prime Minister purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from police investigators. But he has also confirmed the authenticity of other wiretaps, in which he is heard instructing the head of a major television news network to cut short the live broadcast of a rival politician's speech in parliament. Turkey's government has accused social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, of being used to spread false information and lies. CNN's Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Ivan Watson and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","NEW: Access to YouTube still appeared to be blocked for Turkish users on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Women in Arizona may be forced to share certain private medical conditions with their employers if they want their contraception to be covered by health insurance, a bill proposes. The Arizona Senate is considering a bill that would give all businesses the option to exclude contraceptives from health insurance coverage. The only exception is if a woman can prove she is taking the contraceptives for other medical reasons. Supporters say such a law would protect the religious beliefs of employers, while critics assert the tradeoff would be an affront to the liberties of employees. The Arizona debate comes on the heels of a federal controversy over the same issue. An Obama administration policy originally required religiously affiliated institutions -- including hospitals and universities -- to offer contraception coverage. After heavy resistance from Republican lawmakers and religious institutions, the rule was amended to exempt employers from paying for contraceptives and will now instead require insurance companies to offer the coverage at no cost. The Arizona legislation arises as a response to that. The legislation, House Bill 2625 (PDF), was passed by the state House this month and now sits before the Senate. ""I personally don't have a moral objection to contraceptives, but I respect the people that do,"" state Rep. Debbie Lesko, one of the Republican sponsors of the bill, told CNN affiliate KTVK-TV in Phoenix. ""House Bill 2625 allows Arizona employers to opt out of the contraceptive mandate if they have a religious or moral objection,"" she told KTVK. Denying women coverage for contraceptives would restrict women's access to basic health care, said the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona. ""As strongly as the ACLU has protected people's rights to their religious beliefs, express those beliefs and practice those beliefs, we feel the bill goes beyond guaranteeing protections for religious liberties and into allowing an employer to prioritize his religious beliefs over the beliefs, needs, interests of his employees, particularly his female employees,"" Anjali Abraham, public policy director for the ACLU of Arizona, told KTVK. Arizona already has a law on the books that allows religious employers to deny such coverage, but the current bill would modify the law to allow any business to make the same exclusion. ""We live in America and government shouldn't force mom-and-pop employers to do something against their moral beliefs,"" Lesko told the CNN affiliate. The bill has some exceptions that its supporters said should allay critics' fears. For instance, coverage for contraception cannot be denied if it is prescribed for medical reasons other than pregnancy prevention. But the ACLU and others said that this exception amounts to an invasion of privacy that will force women to share sensitive medical information with their employers.","The Arizona Senate is considering a bill that could deny contraception coverage .

"(CNN) -- The people have spoken. Which, come to think of it, is where this whole problem started. In Congress last week, a House committee passed without opposition a measure that should allow the nation to breathe a grateful sigh of relief. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure approved a bill to prohibit phone calls on all domestic flights. The measure is on its way to the full House of Representatives; a similar bill is moving through the Senate. What this means is that the flying public is probably safe from being surrounded by fellow passengers blabbing nonstop on their cell phones from the moment a plane takes off until the moment it lands. For a while there, it appeared that one of the last bastions of cell phone-free silence -- planes during flight -- was going away. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission announced that, in its view, cell phone use no longer posed a technological threat to navigation and aeronautic safety. Thus, the FCC declared, lifting the longstanding ban on phone calls from planes should be considered. What the FCC seemed to be ignoring was the hazard cell phones presented not to the electronics that guide an airplane, but to the well-being and peace of mind of passengers confined inside the cabin of a plane with nowhere to flee while rude seatmates incessantly yakked away. It is, at its core, a matter of consumer protection. If cell phone voice calls were permitted, flight attendants would be placed in the impossible position of having to referee disputes between passengers who, jammed tightly into their seats on packed planes, argued over telephone etiquette and common courtesy (which is no longer so common at all). Travelers would demand to be moved; when no others seats were available, hand-to-hand combat might break out. On a street or in a public building, you can always walk away from a loud and obnoxious cell phone user. On a plane? Where are you supposed to go? There is a simple solution to satisfy those who wish to communicate with people on the ground during a flight: Allow text messages, e-mails and social network postings from the air. Engaging in those activities actually calms passengers, soothes their nerves. Voice calls? The opposite. Which, in a rare spirit of bipartisan wisdom, Congress appears to understand. The chairman of the House committee that advanced last week's measure, Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, cited a poll that said 59% of Americans who flew at least once last year oppose allowing phone calls on planes, and that among Americans who fly more frequently -- four or more flights a year -- 78% oppose the phone calls. ""Most passengers would like their flights to go by as quickly and quietly as possible,"" Shuster said. A Democrat on the committee -- Nick Rahall of West Virginia -- agreed: ""The prospect of sitting among dozens of people all talking on their cell phones in a confined space raises serious safety, if not comfort, considerations especially at a time when passengers face less legroom, higher fees and pricey flights."" Rahall said that when the FCC raised the possibility of allowing phone calls on commercial flights, ""a chill went through the flying public and flight attendants nationwide."" It's not hard to figure out why members of Congress are willing to take these steps now: It is one of those unusual occasions when they sense they will be applauded by a thankful public. Congress isn't taking anything away from anyone; a new law would merely pre-emptively make sure that no one gets very far with the idea of letting cell phones on flights. And no member of Congress is likely to be the one to demand that voice calls be made a part of flying. The public tends to connect the results of infuriating political decisions with the government officials who promoted them; any time a booming-voiced, serial-calling passenger ruined the flights of the people around him, the simmering anger would be directed at the politicians who had made that possible. Congress, by moving to prohibit inflight calls, is doing the airlines a favor. As with smoking onboard, it takes the decision out of the individual airlines' hands, so flight crews won't have to negotiate with enraged passengers. And, absent clear-cut rules, if one airline did choose to permit phone calls in the air, you can imagine the television commercials that its competitors would run in an effort to put it out of business: . An opening shot of a cabin full of passengers shouting into their phones, yelling ""Can you hear me?"", telling longwinded jokes and laughing at top volume, barking orders at business subordinates back at the office, braying ""You're fading in and out-- what did you just say?"", giving high-decibel and endlessly detailed recitations of what they had for dinner the night before. A roaring, earsplitting jumble of sound, each passenger with a phone to his or her ear. And then the next shot in the commercial: A quiet cabin filled with people reading, working on their computers, smiling silently at e-mails and text messages. No sound at all. Followed by the logo of that second airline, with a come-fly-with-us invitation to travel in a civilized way. Which of those flights seems preferable? You make the call. (On second thought ... don't.) The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: House committee OK'd bill to ban in-flight cell phone calls. This is good news .
He says poll shows most people against voice calls on planes; Congress seems to get this .
Passengers might be trapped on flight with noisy callers; chaos could easily ensue .
Greene: Pols knows if that occurs, fliers will blame them; they should ensure ban happens ."
"(CNN) -- Like many schools in heavily urban areas, there are metal detectors, the neighborhood is poorer than many and 90% of the students qualify for free or subsidized lunches. But there's a real difference at TechBoston Academy in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. At this school, 95% of the students are routinely accepted into college. Headmaster Mary Skipper has overseen this pilot model public school since it opened in 2002 as a partnership between the public school system, private business and philanthropists. ""It's a total team effort,"" Skipper told CNN. ""It starts with having quality teachers who are committed and hard-working."" And those metal detectors, Skipper sees them as a symbol and a metaphor. They ""keep the street in the street and the school in the school,"" she said. The simple act of walking through the metal detectors each day helps students ""forget all that outside stuff for that moment of time."" ""When you're in here, you're here to succeed."" And success has come to this small experimental school. President Barack Obama along with Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Education Secretary Arne Duncan will tour TechBoston Academy on Tuesday. The president will showcase the school's success story and discuss the shared responsibility of investing in education to win the future. ""There is no better economic policy than one that produces more graduates,"" Obama says in prepared remarks for a speech he will give to TechBoston students and teachers. ""That's why reforming education is the responsibility of every American -- every parent, every teacher, every business leader, every public official, and every student."" TechBoston Academy opened with 75 students and a $400,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as support from other private and philanthropic organizations. Today enrollment is more than 800 students in 6th through 12th grades. Its mission is to better educate kids using technology as an integral part of that education. Every student enrolling at TechBoston receives his or her own laptop. Forget chalkboards, each classroom has its own SMART board, a high tech, interactive white board. Technology giants like Microsoft, Apple, Dell and Cisco are benefactors. But Skipper, the headmaster, insists the success of the partnership is a result of much more than material donations. ""It's more than pulling up trucks and dropping things off,"" according to Skipper, who says it's the continuing relationship the companies pursue with the school that makes the difference. For instance, SMART boards are excellent tools in the classroom, but when companies work to develop teachers' skills in learning new and different ways to use those boards, it makes the technology all the more enriching. Another way the corporate partners help students is by opening job-shadow opportunities to them. ""They go out and see what's possible with a degree ... what doors will open for me,"" according to Skipper, who says putting her students in the workplace alongside engineers, scientists or technicians -- many of whom come from similar impoverished backgrounds -- is invaluable. Eighty to 90% of TechBoston's students are first-generation college applicants. The White House will announce a new program on Tuesday with $90 million in competitive grants for educators who create dramatic breakthroughs using technology for teaching and learning. Duncan said in a conference call with reporters on Monday that the program is part of a larger plan to remake the Department of Education into a ""department with a laser-like focus on innovation."" ""Technology has transformed how folks do business. It's transformed how folks interact socially,"" said Duncan. ""It's led to literally, you know, huge, revolutionary changes in places like Egypt. But technology frankly hasn't had that kind of impact on the education space yet."" ""We want to invest in that next generation of tools that could help us get the much better student outcomes for ideally a fraction of the time and a fraction of the cost,"" Duncan added. At TechBoston Academy, that vision has become reality, and Skipper sees the cycle of failure breaking. Former students are now back at the school -- this time as teaching aides -- as they pursue their education degrees. The headmaster proudly confided that she asked them why they had chosen teaching. ""They told me, 'because education changed my life,'"" she said.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. Of that, there is no doubt. But was it murder? One of South Africa's toughest prosecutors, Gerrie Nel, fought for most of the month of March to prove it was. Starting Monday, one of the country's shrewdest defense lawyers, Barry Roux, will try to convince a judge that it wasn't. The verdict will hinge on two questions: . Did the Olympic sprinter know his girlfriend was behind the door in the bathroom of his house when he fired four hollow-point bullets through it in the middle of the night? And if he did not -- if he thought she was a burglar, as he insists -- did he act as a reasonable person would have? Critical testimony will come from the only living person who was in the house at the time, the ""Blade Runner"" himself. Pistorius is likely to take the stand for the first time Tuesday or Wednesday to tell the story he has been telling for more than a year now. He woke up in the middle of the night, went to his balcony to bring in a fan -- or two fans, in his most recent version -- heard his bathroom window opening, took his gun, went to the bathroom and fired through the door when he heard a noise in the toilet. ""It was pitch dark in the bedroom, and I thought Reeva was in bed,"" he testified when he applied for bail in the days after the killing. In that version of the story, Pistorius emphasized that he ""felt a sense of terror"" when he heard the noise, that he ""felt extremely vulnerable"" because he was not wearing his prosthetic legs, and that he ""has been a victim of violence and of burglaries before."" And, he said, ""We were deeply in love and I could not be happier."" If Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa believes that story, Pistorius could be acquitted of murder. She could find him guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide -- similar to what would be called manslaughter in the United States -- or find him not guilty at all. The defense is likely to rely on three types of experts to support Pistorius' story: . Ballistics . Pistorius fired four shots. Three hit Steenkamp: one in the hip, one in the arm and one in the head. The shot to the head probably killed her almost instantly. But when did that shot hit her? The prosecution says it hit her last. That means she would have been able to scream between shots -- potentially giving Pistorius a moment to realize his mistake and stop shooting. Roux rejected the prosecution's order of shots in a heated exchange with police Capt. Christian Mangena, the prosecution ballistics expert. Roux said the defense ballistics expert would show that the order of shots was different, and that Pistorius fired the four shots in two quick bursts -- two ""double taps."" Mangena said it was ""impossible"" for the pattern of wounds on the body to be the result of two double taps, ultimately leaving Roux sighing dismissively and promising that his ballistics expert would explain. Pathology . Pistorius threw up repeatedly as Gert Saayman, who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp, described the devastating wounds Pistorius inflicted on her. But as gruesome as the testimony was, it is not critical to the state's case -- there's no doubt, after all, who killed Steenkamp or how. The most damning thing Saayman said was far less dramatic. Based on the contents of her stomach, the pathologist suggested that Steenkamp had probably eaten around 1 a.m., about two hours before she died. That's a direct contradiction of Pistorius' story that they were in the bedroom by about 10 p.m., her doing yoga and him watching television, and that they went to sleep after she finished her yoga. Roux hammered Saayman on the question of when Steenkamp last ate, going so far as to bring in academic articles for the pathologist to read, a clear sign that the defense considers it crucial to rebut that point. Saayman did not budge. A pathologist who attended the autopsy on behalf of Pistorius, Reggie Perumal, is due to testify for the defense . A police cell phone expert also may have found a similar inconsistency with Pistorius' timeline. Capt. Francois Moller, who downloaded the contents of Pistorius' iPhone, said it made an Internet connection for about five minutes an hour and 20 minutes before the shooting. The defense may put forward an expert of their own to explain. Psychiatry . Pistorius needs the judge to believe not only that there is a chance he made a genuine mistake in thinking Steenkamp was a burglar, but that his response was reasonable. Sean Rens, a gun dealer who was selling a small arsenal to Pistorius at the time of the killing, testified that the athlete had passed a test showing he knew what the law said about firing in self-defense. On the face of it, what Pistorius did in firing through a closed door, when he could not see an imminent threat, was neither legal nor safe, the Rens testimony suggested. But a psychiatrist may argue that Pistorius should be judged by a different standard of reasonableness because he is a double amputee who was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. His statement at his bail hearing implied that he should: ""As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself. ... I felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and I have limited mobility on my stumps."" If the judge accepts that as true, Pistorius' disability could prove to be his greatest defense.","The defense will try to convince a judge that Reeva Steenkamp's death wasn't murder .
Did Oscar Pistorius know his girlfriend was behind a door when he shot and killed her?
And if he did not, did he act as a reasonable person would have?

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A former government official was among 10 people killed in a bombing Saturday in Somalia's capital, with Al-Shabaab -- the Islamist militant group that's long been tied to violence in the region -- claiming responsibility for the attack. The slain official, Abdikafi Holowle Osman, was a former Benadir regional administrative secretary and an active campaigner against Al-Shabaab. He died when a bomb went off as he was driving in KM4, a busy junction in Mogadishu, police said. Police Col. Kamal Farah said the explosive device was attached to Osman's when it went off shortly after noon (5 a.m. ET). Three security guards and six civilians who were nearby also died in the blast, according to Farah. Hospital sources said at least eight people injured were being treated at Media Hospital. Separately, there were no injuries after a device attached to the car of Somali lawmaker Abdullah Ahmed exploded outside a hotel near the port, close to the heavily fortified government district. The prime minister's office indicated that a Somali citizen had alerted authorities that the car had been rigged with explosives. In a statement, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for both Saturday attacks in the eastern African nation's capital. Al-Shabaab official Ali Mohamed Hussein accused Osman of working with ""foreign spy agencies"" based southwest of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries as well. A prime example of the latter was last September's attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall, which ended with at least 67 dead. Somalia's Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed issued a statement Saturday, sending condolences to the families of those killed in the latest violence. ""Shedding the blood of innocent civilians has no basis in our Islamic religion or in Somali culture,"" he said. Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Leslie Holland and Samira Said contributed to this report.","NEW: Al-Shabaab claims responsibility; says slain official worked with 'foreign' spies .

"(CNN) -- The words ""Whitney Houston died"" appeared on my BlackBerry screen. Like many of us living in the digital age, I learned that the pop diva passed away by way of text message. Sent by my 25-year-old daughter, the announcement shocked me but soon triggered fond memories of the days when she and her younger sister would belt out Houston's latest hit along with the radio. Their voices were unleashed in that gleeful, full-throated and uninhibited way that only pre-teen girls seemed to do. (Imagine ""and I-eee-I-eee-I will always love you"" at earsplitting, hilarious volume). A few of the high notes were clearly out of my girls' easy reach in their spontaneous renditions. But they reveled in emulating Houston nonetheless. I've heard plenty about Houston's troubles during the course of the week. Despite her battles with drugs and alcohol, many people have good memories of her and her songs. So what made ""The Voice"" so glorious in the transcendent musicianship that Houston displayed in her recordings and concerts? Houston possessed the perfect vibrato. This effect was facilitated by her deceivingly effortless diaphragmic support. Houston belted out chorus after chorus on hit after hit, demonstrating white-knuckled control over this parameter of her ""singer's toolbox"" with an aplomb that seemed unfair to lesser vocalists. And the sheer stamina it took to achieve this elusive aspect of a singer's art separates the wannabes from the real McCoy. Never noticed that, right? That's because she was so good at it. Houston was famous for having a very wide range. Some of her songs spanned quite a bit of vocal territory, from alto to the highest soprano. What was remarkable is that she hardly ever ""bailed out"" by flipping into a falsetto voice -- you know, that head-buzzing sound that men emit when they're doing bad imitations of female opera singers. Houston seemingly had no natural break between the high and low registers of her instrument. This unique quality was highlighted because when she did flip into the ""head voice,"" it was employed as a subtle garnish, a precious design element in a phrase. Her impeccable intonation -- just one of the reasons her ""Star-Spangled Banner"" has become iconic -- instilled a ""trust"" in her listeners. When every note is perfectly in tune, as they were in a classic Houston performance, we relaxed and gave in to the sheer beauty of music. Beyond the gift of her instrument, Houston's musicianship comprised an uncanny way of handling the material she was given with such expertise and attention to detail that the songs became hers and hers alone. Her sense of musical balance allowed her ""crowd"" the cadences of a song's key passages with ""just enough"" sonic information before landing coyly in the next structural part of the song. Although her work grew more melismatic as her career progressed, she never overused this technique like some of her myriad imitators. She mostly executed them in clever twists at the ends of phrases or tossed them off with stunning ease between plainly rendered melodic statements. This allowed many of us to sing along with her at full voice, by ourselves, in the car. (Surely, we've all done this). And she made us feel it. Through musical economy and powerful execution, Houston could shape the emotional contour of a song whether in long concert-versions or on a four-minute record. Her exquisite beauty together with that ""come hither/don't take another step closer or I'll call my cousin"" camera presence intrigued us. What charisma she had. Certainly, this infectious package of beauty and talent was at least one of the reasons my youngest daughter, now a budding operatic coloratura soprano, is pursuing a life of long, beautiful gowns and very, very high notes. Miss Whitney's ubiquity in the media made that seem like a reasonable dream for many of the young women she mesmerized. Houston became a pop star the old fashioned way -- not through a virile YouTube video or as a contestant on ""American Idol."" She was discovered, given a record deal, provided material and the rest was lots of hard and endless work. Now that she's gone, we can do nothing but remember: Remember how she and ""the voice"" seemed like two separate entities. Remember how she performed that voice; how she allowed us to witness it, how she obviously enjoyed it herself. In the end, the voice just couldn't keep up with the extravagances and toils of her life in the spotlight. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"Perth, Australia (CNN) -- Danica Weeks says she just couldn't take it anymore. So she did what no other relative of those missing on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could do: She made the 10 minute drive from her home near Perth to the nerve center of the search for the missing plane at Royal Australian Air Force Base Pearce, and asked what they were doing to try and find her husband. ""I've seen what they're doing and have been taken over the process and I feel so privileged that I'm here now, that I'm right on and close to the search and that I can ask the questions,"" Weeks told CNN in an interview at her home Friday. ""And I feel so much for the families that are abroad -- in Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, the U.S. and everywhere else -- all families, that they can't be here."" Weeks' 39-year-old husband, Paul, a mechanical engineer, was on Flight 370. He was headed to Mongolia on a project and expected to be home to celebrate his son Jack's first birthday in a few weeks. ""Sometimes I catch myself, you know, seeing the excitement of him coming home and I have to get ... that out of my brain quick because I can't let myself go to that level of excitement ... it's only going to make me crash further when I find out the real truth, which we're all expecting will be the plane has crashed. But until that point and we have something concrete, I can't grieve."" said Weeks. But seeing the international search effort firsthand has given Weeks a measure of comfort, she said. Still, she does have nagging doubts about the lack of evidence and the amount of guesswork that has driven the investigation so far. The search goes underwater . ""This area -- where they are now -- if it's there, they're going to find it, but it's a big question that everybody's got. Is it the right area? It's a calculated guess,"" she said. ""So the hardest process for me is understanding that a commercial airline can just go black. That someone can just turn off all communications, all matter of tracking an airline and it can just disappear. And this is the mystery."" Weeks says her two sons, Lincoln, 3, and 11-month-old Jackson are too young yet to understand what's happened to their father and for that, this mother says she's grateful. Still, there are questions from her 3-year-old that are difficult to hear and answer. ""We find the brightest star and he says, 'Goodnight, Daddy, I love you. See you in the morning for breakfast.' And that breaks my heart. ""The other day I was going to work and (her son) said, 'Are you going off to work forever like Daddy?' and I, I obviously had to reassure him that I wasn't. So, I think that he's getting, he's getting it, that dad is gone and not coming back."" said Weeks. Weeks said she has complete confidence in the search team and believes that if searchers are looking in the right place, they will find something. And for that reason she says it's crucial that the international mission keep going for as long as it takes. ""We need something -- the families need something. We need answers -- not just for me, but for my children. They will ask questions. I think the world wants to know because it's such an unusual, extraordinary thing to happen. So we have to just fight for answers,"" she said. What happens when the pinger's batteries die? Weeks has tried to keep a sense of normalcy around her home for her boys. She's continued working and takes the boys out on frequent outings to family and friends. She said she owes it to them and to her husband to get to the bottom of what happened. She is realistic, she said, and knows there's a chance they may never find out what happened to Flight 370. ""I've thought of that possibility, yes. Am I willing to accept that right now? No. I'm not at that point. Because if this was me on that plane, Pauly would be fighting, going everywhere, asking every question, chasing down to find out what happened to me -- for our sons and for himself,"" said Weeks. ""So I just have to do my utmost right now, and keep going to find the truth. This will all encompass me, completely.""","Paul Weeks was on a business trip aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 .

"(CNN) -- Jimmy Fallon left us with great memories after five years on ""Late Night,"" but the pressure was on for his first time hosting ""The Tonight Show"" on Monday. Yet at the end of the hour, we were left with a ""Tonight Show"" that offered both surprising moments and big laughs, although it might've included a lot more than we'll see on an average night, since it was Fallon's first show. Will Smith was the night's guest, U2 provided some music, and house band the Roots was as sharp as ever. (As Fallon said during his opening monologue, they're ""the most talented band in all the land,"" and he ""couldn't do the show"" without them.) That alone was a set-up for a great show, but Fallon also called on celebrity friends like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert to help him get his version of ""Tonight"" off to a good start. Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' debut: New show, same Jimmy . The effort paid off, as early reviews have been quite positive, with TVLine calling the show ""vibrant and fresh"" and USA Today saying Fallon was ""easy to like."" Fallon was a hit online as well, with tweet after tweet praising his performance, even from Jay Leno fans: . If you missed the premiere or want to relive some of the best moments, here are our five favorite scenes from Fallon's first ""Tonight Show."" 1. Will Smith and the ""Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing"" Right away, it was clear that several of Fallon's ""Late Night"" staples weren't going anywhere, including his occasional ""Evolution of Dancing"" sketches. Fallon's first guest, Smith, helped him during an ""Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing"" sketch, with both performers wearing '90s-style overalls and gamely showing off a number of hip-hop moves like the ""Running Man,"" ""Kid N Play"" and -- of course -- ""the Carlton."" Smith was on fire during the whole episode. He later gave Fallon some heartwarming words of wisdom: . 2. A family affair . Fallon's dad, whom he jokingly referenced in his final ""Late Night"" episode as being disappointed in him, showed up along with the 39-year-old comedian's mom. Seeing his parents in the audience was a sweet moment for a guy who probably only dreamed he might ever host ""The Tonight Show"" as a kid. It was a nice way to start the show before getting into the typical monologue jokes. 3. The parade of cameos . Moments after sitting down to his desk for the first time, Fallon made reference to a ""buddy"" who owed him $100 after betting he would never host ""The Tonight Show."" The next thing you know, Robert De Niro (Fallon's first ""Late Night"" guest) showed up with a $100 bill. Then Tina Fey followed with yet another $100 bill. And then Joe Namath, Mariah Carey, Lindsay Lohan, Tracy Morgan, Seth Rogen, Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga, Mike Tyson and Joan Rivers (not seen on ""The Tonight Show"" since the Carson years, when she was banned) also showed up to slap down their Benjamins. Finally, Stephen Colbert arrived with $100 in pennies, took a selfie and announced ""Welcome to 11:30, b***h!"" It was a jaw-dropping moment to say the least, and we have to say we agree with this viewer: . 4. U2 at the Top of the Rock . All of these moments show how Fallon is planning to make ""The Tonight Show"" his own, but none presented his perspective quite like having U2 perform on the roof of the Rockefeller Center. The band set up came even before Smith was officially brought out as the night's guest. The sunset above the New York skyline during U2's performance looked beautiful, and it made for an original and unexpected moment. 5. U2, unplugged . Yep, U2 was so awesome on Fallon's ""Tonight"" that the band is taking up two moments on this list. Fallon said that if he ever had them on the show, he'd have them perform a song stripped down, with just acoustic guitars and Bono singing. On Monday night, U2 did just that, performing the Oscar-nominated ""Ordinary Love"" for the audience in a memorable, fitting end to the very first ""Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" Fallon's 'Tonight Show': A throwback or new guard?","Jimmy Fallon's first night as host of ""Tonight"" was well-received .
Critics have called him ""easy to like"" and ""fresh""
Online, social media were filled with praise .

"(CNN) -- How many years would you like to live? Seriously: If you had a choice, what would the number be? By the side of an expressway the other afternoon, I saw a billboard paid for by Prudential, the big insurance and financial-services company. The message, in letters large enough that no motorist zipping by could miss them: ""The First Person To Live To 150 Is Alive Today."" For centuries, scientists have been debating theories about just how long, with proper health care and judicious personal habits, the human lifespan can extend. In recent years, the 150 number has been up for discussion. Some have scoffed at that prospect, but insurance-company actuaries and retirement-planning accountants are not known for wacky practical jokes -- they are as somber-eyed as funeral directors as they calculate just how big a risk they run while writing policies for their customers of various ages -- so the sight of that Prudential billboard was a little jarring. I contacted Prudential's corporate headquarters, and the company forwarded to me a table of federal statistics showing the lengthening average lifespans in the U.S. over the past 80 or so years. In 1930, the average life expectancy (measured at birth) of Americans was 59.7 years. By 1940, it had grown to 62.9. 1950: 68.2. 1960: 69.7. 1970: 70.8. 1980: 73.7 1990: 75.4. 2000: 77. 2010: 78.7. Whether infants born today are entering a world in which 150th birthdays will eventually become if not common then at least possible, the thought raises separate issues for insurance and financial-planning firms than it does for the rest of us. For those companies, the prospect provides marketing opportunities. But for everyone else, it prompts the vexing question: Would you really want to live that long? Medical advances and emphasis on nutrition and keeping fit notwithstanding, can you imagine what it would be like to reach the age of 75 and think that you might only be halfway home? To put it in perspective: A person who was 150 today would have been born while the Civil War was still being fought. Longer is better; that's what we have always been taught to assume about a lifespan. And changes in the way we live have, in fact, transformed our expectations for what the metrics of a full life are. An emphasis on the benefits of healthy eating and regular exercise has altered the texture of American life. In the 1950s, had a man been seen sprinting down the street in a residential neighborhood in the middle of the day, some people's instinct would have been to immediately holler, ""Stop, thief!"" Today, the streets would seem barren without the sight of runners and joggers doing their daily best to keep in shape. Smoking cigarettes has evolved from a national habit into something regarded as almost illicit. I thought of the late Ray Kroc, who built McDonald's into an international business behemoth by relentlessly marketing burgers and fries, the other morning when I walked by one of the company's restaurants and saw that the one and only item being promoted on its marquee was ""Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothies."" For the past 10 years, Dairy Queens have been aggressively pushing salads. And woe be to any restaurateur who is not fully cognizant of the importance of a pair of words that, just a decade or two ago, would have sounded vaguely alien: ""gluten-free."" But as we head toward a time when 150-year-olds may be walking among us, it's not illogical to consider whether that would really be such a wonderful thing. To some people, the very thought of it is undoubtedly more than a little exhausting. If such a possibility does come to pass, what will happen to the retirement age? Will Americans be expected to work until they're 110? (And if you think Social Security and the finances of long-term medical care are controversial subjects now ...) Expectations about the passage of time are changing, and we take note of it as we observe the career trajectories of public figures. When Mick Jagger turned 30 in 1973, some people theorized that the Rolling Stones' days of touring might be numbered. Could a rock band, no matter how skilled, still find an audience when its members were in their 30s? But the Rolling Stones are on tour this summer, and next month Jagger will turn 70. The band's drummer, Charlie Watts, is 72, the same age as Dick Cheney. Yet it's unlikely that the world has seen the last Rolling Stones show. But it's one thing for Jagger to be singing in packed stadiums at 70; it would be quite another if someone were to tap him on the shoulder and tell him that he still had more than half of his life ahead of him. When Frank Sinatra was in his 70s, I visited with him backstage before what would turn out to be his last Chicago concert performance. That night, he went out onto the stage, and at one point he lifted a glass and offered a toast to his audience: ""I hope you live to be 675 years old, and the last voice you hear is mine."" No one is talking about being 675 yet, but Prudential is raising the possibility of 150, and it will be instructive to see whether people embrace the notion of being around that long or if the proposition of that protracted a slog gives them the chills. This is the first weekend of calendar summer, a good time to reflect upon such matters. Summers are fleeting and precious; we have always known that. They're over almost before they have begun. You are only given so many. But, even acknowledging that, it would seem supremely odd for some future 25-year-old to routinely think, on the first day of summer: . I'd better savor these warm days and nights. After this year, I may only have 125 summers left.

Greene: We live longer than ever due to medical advances, good nutrition, keeping fit .

"Ansan, South Korea (CNN) -- First days back at school are usually filled with optimism about what's ahead, but many students at Danwon High School near Seoul, South Korea, are looking back in mourning. On Thursday, a series of hearses made a slow crawl toward the school in the city of Ansan. Inside each, a person in the passenger seat held a portrait of the teenager they lost when a ferry capsized April 16. About two-thirds of the 476 passengers on the Sewol ferry were Danwon students on a field trip. Buses with blacked-out windows followed the hearses. The school was not the vehicles' final stop. They continued on to funerals. Danwon lost a large part of a grade. Several teachers also died in the disaster. The only students at school Thursday were those in their final year. About 100 psychiatrists and support staff from across South Korea were on hand to counsel them. Some teens arrived in hoods or wore caps to cover their faces as they made their way past journalists. A shrine of flowers and hundreds of notes to the dead decorated the school's entrance. ""Big brother, you have to live, you have to come back,"" read one note. ""I want to see you,"" another read. ""I love you and pray for you."" Many of the messages from other students expressed regret at not being able to help their classmates on the ferry traveling from the port city of Incheon to Jeju, a southern resort island. Thousands of yellow ribbons were tied to the school gates, trees and posts. The ribbons have become a symbol of hope that survivors might still be found in the submerged ferry vessel, picking up a practice used in the United States for soldiers and hostages overseas. Mental health care professionals will be available to the students for at least two months, said Dr. Kim Hyun-sook, head of the community mental health program in the region. ""Koreans, when they experience trauma, they feel anger and sadness but they tend to bottle it up,"" he said. ""We're trying to encourage emotional communication to let those feelings out."" A need to heal goes beyond the school. ""I feel my heart is being ripped up,"" said Ryu Chang-ryul, who has lived near the school for nine years. ""For three days I haven't eaten.

""He was sitting here playing guitar talking about just how important this trip was to him. I feel so bad that I could not be there. All of us, we could have done something."" An investigation into why the ferry sank is under way. Authorities have arrested the captain and other crew members. The number of crew members charged in connection to the ferry sinking has risen to 14, said Yang Joong-jin, the chief prosecutor in the city of Mokpo. Of the 29 crew members on the ship, 20 survived. The nine others are dead or missing. A South Korean lawmaker said Thursday that renovations last year expanded the top floor of the Sewol to make room for 117 more passengers. Investigators want to know if the modifications made the ferry more likely to capsize. Kim Yong-rok, an opposition lawmaker who represents Jindo, an island near where the ship sank, told CNN that the modifications raised the ferry's center of gravity. CNN asked South Korean prosecutors about that but they were unable to confirm it. For friends gripped by intense sadness, all they can do is write messages to the dead.

"(CNN) -- Iran is lauding the successful test-firing of new missiles, including one designed to destroy ""all types of enemy military equipment,"" state media said. U.S. officials say they're paying close attention. The Iranian Defense Ministry said the new missiles include a laser-guided surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missile as well as a new long-range ballistic missile that can carry multiple warheads, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehqan said the long-range ballistic missile can evade enemies' anti-missile defense systems and has ""the capability of destroying massive targets and destroying multiple targets."" Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby said the agency has seen the reports. ""Iran's missile program continues to pose a dangerous threat to region, and is an issue we monitor closely,"" he said. Kirby noted that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 prohibits Iran from undertaking any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology. Iran's missiles testing comes just days after Iranian warships reportedly were en route toward U.S. maritime borders, according to Fars. ""Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message,"" Iranian navy Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said, according to Fars. The plan, Fars reported Saturday, serves as a response to the United States beefing up its naval presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain. But a U.S. military official said there was no operational information to support the claim. The timing of Iran's missile testing is notable for another reason: Fars said it happened on Monday, the eve of the 35th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The revolution signified the end of Iran's Western-backed monarchy under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and the beginning of an Islamic republic. On Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani delivered a speech celebrating the revolution -- and slamming the United States. ""The revolution started because people didn't want to accept humiliation,"" Rouhani told his country. ""Is it possible for the great revolutionary people, it is possible for this nation to accept humiliation by foreign powers or America after 35 years? It is as if they have not recognized the great nation of Iran. They don't have the right understanding and knowledge of the Iranian people."" Iran's navy aims to make PR splash with voyage .

"(EW.com) -- Why do we laugh? If you believe Freud, it's the same reason why we dream: to satisfy unconscious desires that society usually forbids. So there must be a wink behind the strange and wonderful new season of ""Louie,"" which often uses dream logic in place of jokes. The second episode, ""Model,"" finds Louie (Louis C.K.) hooking up with a rich young beauty (Yvonne Strahovski) whose astronaut father walked on the moon. When he admits that things like this don't usually happen to him, the woman shrugs, ""Well, maybe it's not really happening."" Bradley Cooper proves Louis C.K.'s 'Inside the Actors Studio' theory wrong . ""Elevator Part 1″ opens with Louie's daughter Jane (Ursula Parker) waking from a nightmare, and Louie assuring her that the scary dream is over. ""No,"" she insists, ""I'm still dreaming, but ... I'm having a nice dream now."" Later, we're reminded that Jane's mother (Susan Kelechi Watson) is black, even though Jane is blond-haired and blue-eyed, which might make us suspect that we're dreaming too. This is what makes ""Louie"" so brilliant: It takes the type of mundane, familiar moment that fuels so much observational comedy — a random hookup, a rough night with the kids — and pushes it so far past its rational outcome it ends up challenging the idea that the ""naturalism"" we love from comedians is any less of a false construction than surrealism. Even the structure of ""Louie"" has always felt like a dream, mixing real-life clips of C.K.'s stand-up with semi-fictionalized moments from his life, cameos from people he knows (Sarah Silverman and Jerry Seinfeld pop up this season), and references to movies he's seen — from French New Wave films to Buster Keaton classics. No doubt, C.K. knows about oneiric theory, which claims that cinema is like dreaming too: It requires us to spend hours in the dark, with our fantasies projected before us, and emerge later into the real world as if we've just woken up. Louis C.K. releases 1998 film 'Tomorrow Night' on website . But this isn't just art-house pretension. Like the gnarliest stuff that your subconscious coughs up at night, its main purpose is to confront the taboo, and whether that means exploring just how far Louie will go into the ""experimental"" side of masturbation in the season premiere or simply digging into his ugliest prejudices about overweight women, the show can be revelatory. The third episode, ""So Did the Fat Lady,"" might be the most poignant one here, as Louie fends off the advances of a self-proclaimed ""fat girl"" (Sarah Baker). Her thoughts about what dating is like for plus-size women are so filled with truth, I found myself nodding at the TV, mumbling the kind of ""Mmm-hmms!"" you hear in church. Fans can debate whether the very last scene of that episode is too optimistic, but realism isn't the point on a show that once found Louie taking fuzzy ducklings on a magical journey to Iraq. It's like the astronaut's daughter says: None of this is happening. But it's a nice dream just the same. Grade: A . See the original story on EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The clouds looked ominous in Killeen, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon. So instead of letting her 14-year-old son, Jordan, hang out at the skate park at Fort Hood like he usually did when school let out, Sharon Rice decided to pick him up and bring him home. The military family had just moved off post, and mother and son were heading out of the gate to leave when they heard sirens. ""We thought there was a thunderstorm warning,"" she said. By the time they arrived home shortly after 4 p.m., they heard the news: Someone was on base shooting at people. Sharon's husband, Army Capt. David Rice, was still at work on Fort Hood. She tried to call him, but the phone lines were jammed. So she sent him a text. Capt. Rice's first response -- ""Is Jordan at the skate park?"" She assured him their son was safe. ""Good,"" he texted. ""I will contact you later."" This is what military families do during emergencies -- they handle the immediate needs and talk emotions later, she said. David Rice texted her that the service members in his unit were all right, so she went into ""key caller mode"" and grabbed a roster of family contacts. The relatives were spread out around the country, so she had no problem calling them to tell them their loved ones were not harmed. Then, Sharon Rice managed to have a talk with her teenager about what had happened just before it aired on the news. Army Spc. Ivan Lopez had walked from one building to another on the Army's largest post, firing a .45-caliber handgun. He killed three people and wounded 16. The 34-year-old, who had served in the Iraq war, then shot himself to death in front of a military police officer who had confronted him. The situation was nerve-wracking, but Rice steeled herself. With a father who fought with a Special Forces unit and a mother who was a military nurse in Vietnam, she knows what it's like to go on autopilot when something terrible happens. She said it's crucial to turn to ""certain protocols."" ""There's not a lot of time for emotion, at first. There will be later, there definitely will be later,"" she said Thursday. ""I'm sure I'll have talks with the chaplain later and have my breakdown."" Thursday morning, Jordan didn't go to school. He's a military kid, Sharon Rice said; he's always seen service members carrying guns. That is normal to him. He seemed to be OK, but was he really? Better that she be with him. Her husband, however, went back to work Thursday. ""Yes, it's secure"" Less than five years ago, in November 2009, Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured dozens at Fort Hood. In 2011, Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo was arrested after he tried to build a bomb to blow up Fort Hood troops. A search of his hotel room revealed various items used to make bombs, including battery-operated clocks and a pressure cooker. A federal judge sentenced him to life in prison. Considering this recent history, CNN asked Rice, did she have any concerns about security on post, whether anything that could have been different to prevent the shooting? Rice laughed heartily. ""Are you kidding me?"" It's very, very tight on Fort Hood, she said. ""Every time you get on installation, you have to have the tag on the car scanned. They do it every time, every time you go through the gate. And then there are random checks,"" she said. ""Yes, it's secure."" Fort Hood is the nation's largest Army post, covering 340 square miles. It is home to more than 45,000 assigned soldiers and nearly 9,000 civilian employees, according to the post's official website. Compare Fort Hood to cities its size, Rice said, and the violence there doesn't feel especially alarming. Changes after Hasan massacre . In the wake of the 2009 massacre, authorities launched various investigations and reviews. ""The tragic shooting of U.S. military personnel at Fort Hood in November 2009 underscored the need for the Department of Defense to thoroughly review its approach to force protection,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in a memo shortly after that shooting. A series of changes were put in place. A kind of ""neighborhood watch"" was created to teach the Army community to recognize and report suspicious behavior. Gates also called for a plan to educate commanders on signs of workplace violence and an enhanced 911 systems on military installations to enable emergency dispatchers to effectively determine a caller's location. Other recommendations included upgrading health care to service members and hiring additional providers, especially in mental health, to help meet that goal. Still, at least some soldiers at Fort Hood feel more needs to be done. ""This place is definitely a black hole. This place is a stressful place,"" a soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""Until we have people step up and see, hey, there needs to be change here, we're going to continue to have incidents like this."" ""People in jail have a better life than a lot of these soldiers here -- and if you don't have a family, and you're a single soldier living in the barracks, it can be miserable,"" the GI said. ""Nobody really understands how bad somebody's mental stability is, or how hard it is to keep your sanity here being at Fort Hood."" CNN asked U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to respond to the remarks on Friday, shortly after Cruz visited some of the wounded. ""Now is not the time to talk about public policy,"" Cruz said. A soldier suffering . Lopez was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder and going through the process required to diagnose the disorder. He had not been diagnosed with PTSD, said Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commander. Lopez had suffered from depression, anxiety and other psychiatric complaints and was receiving treatment and taking medication. Officials are trying to piece together what in his background and medical treatment may have triggered the violence. Lopez was transferred to Fort Hood from another base in February. His former base was not identified. Retired Army Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN analyst, expressed surprise at the transfer. Lopez should have remained at the other base for continuity of care, he said. Milley said, ""We will have to re-examine all of those programs to see if there were any gaps."" In the wake of the 2009 bloodshed, other measures were taken. Investigators said the Army had to transform how it protects its soldiers, collects information about internal threats and communicates with the FBI and terrorism experts. But to residents like Rice and others, the changes haven't been obvious. ""There hasn't been a whole lot of extra protection on base,"" said Lynn Adams, who lives on Fort Hood. Adams said authorities check identification and other things, but there has been no visible extra security. Massacre site to be torn down . Guns on base . Lopez used a .45-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol that he recently purchased in the area but did not register on post. Army regulations enacted in 1993 tightened gun restrictions, including a ban on carrying personal firearms on base. In September 2013, Republicans in the U.S. House introduced legislation to repeal the ban. Texas Rep. Steve Stockman was one of seven Republicans who proposed the Safe Military Bases Act, saying the bill would help thwart mass shootings on bases. Authorities will look at what, if anything, they could have done differently. That might be an uphill challenge. ""Fort Hood, tens of thousands of people come and go from that every day,"" said CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr. ""They have stickers in their cars; they have permits to get on base. They are waved through a gate, because traffic has to keep flowing."" ""If they are permitted onto the base because they have the right paperwork on any given day -- it is not likely that their cars will be searched every time they go in and out. It is assumed that they are acting appropriately and acting legally. That's just the way the reality is."" Retired Gen. Russel Honore, who was once an assistant division commander at Fort Hood, said ""military posts are our sanctuary."" ""It's a place where you're not carrying a weapon 24 hours a day. It's meant and designed to give you a sense of security where you can relax in a family environment. So, when this happens, it breaks the sacred trust."" 'Getting help helps' Perry Jefferies retired from the Army in 2004. He spent more than 10 years living and working on Fort Hood and was there during the 2009 massacre. He's a current leader with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""The 2009 shooting is still very raw,"" he said. ""And now here's another one. You just don't know what that's going to do to people."" Jefferies said he had his ""own little moment"" Wednesday night. ""It does bring back those feelings of last time,"" he said. ""Something about listening to the medical press conferences -- it was a bit overwhelming. I had to step out of the room."" He said he was worried some people might be overcome by the experience and feel like there is nothing they can do. Jefferies urged anyone in that situation to reach out, citing a 24/7 veterans crisis line. ""There are people there that can help,"" he said. ""If you're feeling bad, getting help helps.""

"(CNN) -- NASA is suspending much of its work with Russia in light of its actions in Ukraine but said it will continue to collaborate with Russia's space agency on International Space Station operations. The decision by the U.S. space agency to halt ""the majority of its ongoing engagements"" with Russia's Roscosmos comes amid heightened tensions sparked by Russia's annexation last month of Ukraine's southern Crimea region. A statement sent out by NASA on Wednesday said the U.S. space agency was acting ""given Russia's ongoing violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" But, the statement said, it will continue to work with Roscosmos to ""maintain safe and continuous operation of the International Space Station."" In 2011, NASA retired its space shuttle fleet, its only means of getting to and from the station. Now, Russian Soyuz capsules ferry U.S. astronauts and cosmonauts, together with supplies that can fit in the smaller craft. In its statement, NASA appealed for more funding from Congress to help it resume manned American space flights. ""NASA is laser focused on a plan to return human spaceflight launches to American soil, and end our reliance on Russia to get into space,"" it said. ""This has been a top priority of the Obama Administration's for the past five years, and had our plan been fully funded, we would have returned American human spaceflight launches -- and the jobs they support -- back to the United States next year. ""With the reduced level of funding approved by Congress, we're now looking at launching from U.S. soil in 2017. The choice here is between fully funding the plan to bring space launches back to America or continuing to send millions of dollars to the Russians. It's that simple."" The U.S. space agency's decision to suspend many activities comes in the same week that 28-member defense bloc NATO said it was ending cooperation with Russia over its activities in Ukraine. Western leaders have condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea as a violation of international law and called on Moscow to pull back the tens of thousands of troops it has massed near Ukraine's eastern border. Russia says its forces are there to take part in military exercises and will return to base when those are finished. Russia recalls ambassador to NATO amid Ukraine tensions .

"(CNN) -- Less than two weeks after a winter storm paralyzed Atlanta, a brand new round of bad weather is bearing down on the Southeast. The National Weather Service forecasts a 60% to 80% chance of rain, snow and sleet from Monday night through Wednesday in Atlanta. Up to 2 inches of snow could stick. A winter storm watch is in effect Monday through Wednesday morning for Atlanta, Birmingham, Memphis and Little Rock. The coming storm will be the first test for a 32-member severe weather task force created in the wake of the fallout from last month's debacle when 2.6 inches of snow shutdown Atlanta's metropolitan area. The city of Atlanta and Georgia say they're being proactive this time, unlike two weeks ago when the storm snuck up on Gov. Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, resulting in citizen inconvenience and outrage. The governor apologized to the public and promised to handle things differently next time. ""I'm the governor, the buck stops with me,"" he said. On Sunday the Georgia Department of Transportation said it would start treating roads with sand and salt after the Monday evening rush hour. Supplies from southern Georgia are being brought to the Atlanta metro area, said transportation department spokeswoman Natalie Dale. Deal also gave the National Guard a warning order, an advance notice to personnel of the possibility of a ""call up"" for a state mission. Schools also began announcing their plans to cancel evening activities beginning Monday. Atlanta City Hall spokesman Carlos Campos said priority roads and bridges will be treated Monday night with a combination of sand and salt, and more supplies are being ordered. The city will open a joint operations center and coordinate with the state government. The city urged people to take precautions such as filling cars with gas and stocking up on food. When the storm struck January 28, traffic gridlock occurred almost instantaneously as commuters fled Atlanta en masse. Thousands of school children across northern Georgia spent the night in schools, and countless motorists endured 20-plus hour commutes, if they were lucky enough to get home at all. Deal appointed the new task force to help prepare for future winter storms. Glenn Burns, chief meteorologist for CNN affiliate WSB and a member of the Georgia Severe Weather Task Force, told CNN Sunday that the group is ready. He participated in a meeting Sunday with the National Weather Service, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, GDOT, local schools and meteorologists. ""I think being on the same page with everybody getting the same information is going to be key to how we respond,"" he said. Burns also warned that this week's storm will be significant. ""This is a whole different ball game,"" Burns said. ""What we had two weeks ago was a minor event. This is likely to be a major event."" Burns predicts northern Georgia will see more than 30 hours of wintry precipitation compared to last month's four hours of snow. CNN weather forecasters say this week's storm will hit the Southeast in two waves. The first wave will occur Monday into Tuesday with a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The second wave pushes in Tuesday and Wednesday because of an area of low pressure bringing Gulf moisture to the Southeast. It will bring a wintry mix and freezing rain. The National Weather Service predicts lows of 35 degrees Monday night. On Tuesday, the high will only reach 37 and the low will be around 30. Wednesday will be even colder, with a high of 35 and a low of 30. On Thursday, temperatures should rise into the high 40s.","A winter storm expected to hit the Southeast Monday night .

"(CNN) -- Endangered cultural sites are the stars of the annual International Day for Monuments and Sites -- more commonly known as World Heritage Day -- on April 18. Some of these wonders are part of the Global Heritage Fund's first annual list of five endangered cultural sites, issued to mark the day and draw attention to the fund's work. The day was first adopted as a concept in 1983 to draw attention to the cultural heritage of communities around the world. Sites include a natural Guatemalan wonderland larger than Yellowstone National Park, Colombia's Lost City and medieval villages in the Transylvanian Alps. The fund, which works to protect significant and endangered cultural heritage sites in the developing world, named sites they're working to save from the impact of uncontrolled modern development, tourism and looting. ""Many cultural sites are endangered, especially those in the developing world (regions where per capita income is less than $2 per day), and they languish without any international attention,"" wrote Vince Michael, the fund's executive director, via e-mail. ""It's our hope that World Heritage Day and our list will inspire community involvement in preserving the legacy of these sites."" Travelers' choice: World's top 25 destinations . Why focus on these five sites? Some locations were chosen for their historical significance. ""Ciudad Perdida (in Colombia) was once a thriving center of political, social and economic power, and Göbekli Tepe (in Turkey) is the oldest man-made place of worship discovered to date. As awareness of these two sites has grown, threats such as unregulated tourism and looting could harm the sites,"" Michael wrote. The Minority Villages of Guizhou (in China) and the Carpathian Villages (in Romania) were included because of their important cultural heritage and traditional practices, ""which are being eroded by modern development and industrialization,"" Michael said. ""Finally, we included Mirador, Guatemala, because it is facing critical environmental threats -- ranching and logging have destroyed 70 percent of its forests in the last decade.""

"(Mental Floss) -- Memorial Day is more than just a three-day weekend and a chance to get the year's first sunburn. Here's a handy 10-pack of facts to give the holiday some perspective. The gravesite of Capt. Jesse Milton is seen in Arlington National Cemetery. 1. It started with the Civil War . Memorial Day was a response to the unprecedented carnage of the Civil War, in which some 620,000 soldiers on both sides died. The loss of life and its effect on communities throughout the North and South led to spontaneous commemorations of the dead: . • In 1864, women from Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, put flowers on the graves of their dead from the just-fought Battle of Gettysburg. The next year, a group of women decorated the graves of soldiers buried in a Vicksburg, Mississippi, cemetery. • In April 1866, women from Columbus, Mississippi, laid flowers on the graves of both Union and Confederate soldiers. It was recognized at the time as an act of healing regional wounds. In the same month, up in Carbondale, Illinois, 219 Civil War veterans marched through town in memory of the fallen to Woodlawn Cemetery, where Union hero Maj. Gen. John A. Logan delivered the principal address. The ceremony gave Carbondale its claim to the first organized, community-wide Memorial Day observance. Watch the meaning of the holiday . • Waterloo, New York., began holding an annual community service on May 5, 1866. Although many towns claimed the title, it was Waterloo that won congressional recognition as the ""birthplace of Memorial Day."" 2. General Logan made it official . Gen. Logan, the speaker at the Carbondale gathering, also was commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans. On May 5, 1868, he issued General Orders No. 11, which set aside May 30, 1868, ""for the purpose of strewing with flowers, or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion....""  Watch the history of the holiday » . The orders expressed hope that the observance would be ""kept up from year to year while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades.""  Watch military kids learn to grieve » . 3. It was first known as Decoration Day . From the practice of decorating graves with flowers, wreaths and flags, the holiday was long known as Decoration Day. The name Memorial Day goes back to 1882, but the older name didn't disappear until after World War II. Federal law declared ""Memorial Day"" the official name in 1967. 4. The holiday is a franchise . Calling Memorial Day a ""national holiday"" is a bit of a misnomer. While there are 11 ""federal holidays"" created by Congress -- including Memorial Day -- they apply only to Federal employees and the District of Columbia. Federal Memorial Day, established in 1888, allowed Civil War veterans, many of whom were drawing a government paycheck, to honor their fallen comrades with out being docked a day's pay. For the rest of us, our holidays were enacted state by state. New York was the first state to designate Memorial Day a legal holiday, in 1873. Most Northern states had followed suit by the 1890s. The states of the former Confederacy were unenthusiastic about a holiday memorializing those who, in Gen. Logan's words, ""united to suppress the late rebellion."" The South didn't adopt the May 30 Memorial Day until after World War I, by which time its purpose had been broadened to include those who died in all the country's wars. In 1971, the Monday Holiday Law shifted Memorial Day from May 30, to the last Monday of the month. Mental Floss: 10 holidays not yet exploited by Hallmark . 5. It was James Garfield's finest hour -- or maybe hour-and-a-half . On May 30, 1868, President Ulysses S. Grant presided over the first Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery -- which, until 1864, was Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's plantation. Some 5,000 people attended on a spring day which, The New York Times reported, was ""somewhat too warm for comfort."" The principal speaker was James A. Garfield, a Civil War general, Republican congressman from Ohio and future president. ""I am oppressed with a sense of the impropriety of uttering words on this occasion,"" Garfield began, and then continued to utter them. ""If silence is ever golden, it must be beside the graves of fifteen-thousand men, whose lives were more significant than speech, and whose death was a poem the music of which can never be sung."" It went on like that for pages and pages. As the songs, speeches and sermons ended, the participants helped to decorate the graves of the Union and Confederate soldiers buried in the cemetery. 6. Not even the Unknown Soldier can avoid media scrutiny these days . ""Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God."" That is the inscription on the Tomb of the Unknowns, established at Arlington National Cemetery to inter the remains of the first Unknown Soldier, a World War I fighter, on November 11, 1921. Unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean War subsequently were interred in the tomb on Memorial Day 1958. An emotional President Ronald Reagan presided over the interment of six bones, the remains of an unidentified Vietnam War soldier, on November 28, 1984. Fourteen years later, those remains were disinterred, no longer unknown. Spurred by an investigation by CBS News, the defense department removed the remains from the Tomb of the Unknowns for DNA testing. The once-unknown fighter was Air Force pilot Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, whose jet crashed in South Vietnam in 1972. ""The CBS investigation suggested that the military review board that had changed the designation on Lt. Blassie's remains to 'unknown' did so under pressure from veterans' groups to honor a casualty from the Vietnam War,"" The New York Times reported in 1998. Lt. Blassie was reburied near his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. His crypt at Arlington remains permanently empty.  Watch digital memorial to troops of Afghanistan and Iraq » . 7. Vietnam vets go whole hog . On Memorial Day weekend in 1988, 2,500 motorcyclists rode into Washington, D.C., for the first Rolling Thunder rally to draw attention to Vietnam War soldiers still missing in action or prisoners of war. By 2002, the numbers had swelled to 300,000 bikers, many of them veterans. There may have been a half-million participants in 2005 in what organizers bluntly call ""a demonstration -- not a parade."" A national veterans rights group, Rolling Thunder takes its name from the B-52 carpet-bombing runs during the war in Vietnam. Rolling Thunder XXII (and you thought only Super Bowls and Rocky movies used Roman numerals) is Sunday, May 24. 8. Memorial Day has its customs . General Orders No. 11 stated that ""in this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed,"" but over time several customs and symbols became associated with the holiday. It is customary on Memorial Day to fly the flag at half staff until noon, and then raise it to the top of the staff until sunset. Taps, the 24-note bugle call, is played at all military funerals and memorial services. It originated in 1862 when Union Gen. Dan Butterfield ""grew tired of the 'lights out' call sounded at the end of each day,"" according to The Washington Post. Together with the brigade bugler, Butterfield made some changes to the tune. Not long after, the melody was used at a burial for the first time, when a battery commander ordered it played in lieu of the customary three rifle volleys over the grave. The battery was so close to enemy lines, the commander was worried the shots would spark renewed fighting. The World War I poem ""In Flanders Fields,"" by John McCrea, inspired the Memorial Day custom of wearing red artificial poppies.

The sale of poppies has supported the work of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 9. There is still a grey Memorial Day . Several Southern states continue to set aside a day for honoring the Confederate dead, which is usually called Confederate Memorial Day: Alabama: fourth Monday in April; Georgia: April 26; Louisiana: June 3; Mississippi: last Monday in April; North Carolina: May 10; South Carolina: May 10; Tennessee (Confederate Decoration Day): June 3; Texas (Confederate Heroes Day): January 19; Virginia: last Monday in May.

That credit goes to Indianapolis businessman Carl Fisher. The winning driver that day was Ray Harroun, who averaged 74.6 mph and completed the race in 6 hours and 42 minutes. Gravitas returned on May 30, 1922, when the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated. Supreme Court chief justice (and former president) William Howard Taft dedicated the monument before a crowd of 50,000 people, segregated by race, and which included a row of Union and Confederate veterans. Also attending was Lincoln's surviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln. And in 2000, Congress established a National Moment of Remembrance, which asks Americans to pause for one minute at 3 p.m. in an act of national unity.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office has found ""challenges"" in securing thousands of pieces of radiological equipment spread throughout the United States that could become parts of a deadly ""dirty bomb."" The materials, used in the oil, gas, aerospace, and food sterilization industries, can include everything from portable cameras that scan pipe welds to large research equipment. ""In the hands of terrorists, these sources could be used to produce a simple and crude, but potentially dangerous weapon, known as a radiological dispersal device or dirty bomb,"" David Trimble, the GAO's director of natural resources and environment, wrote in the report. There are 4,162 containers of industrial radiological material spread among 498 licensees in the United States, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The material can be as small as a grain of rice or rods that are several inches long. To evaluate security, investigators visited 33 industrial sites that use radiological sources in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming over the last two years. An open door and fences that did not go all the way to the ceiling were found at one location. ""The NRC inspector told us that the licensee was in compliance with NRC's security controls because the sources were secured through other measures -- such as locks and a motion detector,"" Trimble wrote in the report. ""The inspector told us that while the security measures in place were not optimal, there were no apparent security violations."" Unsecured skylights were found at nine of the 33 sites visited, but the NRC inspector told the GAO those did not pose a security vulnerability because the radiological sources were locked in other containers. At oil and gas facilities, the GAO found an apparent loophole that allows companies to place radiological material in separate containers in the same room, thus avoiding stricter regulations than would apply if the material were considered ""collocated"" in the same container. When evaluating trucks equipped to carry portable devices that use the radiological material, the GAO found a wide variety of methods used to secure the material, ranging from high-security locks and alarms to simple padlocks and an army surplus container chained to a floor. Four trucks with radiological sources have been stolen since 2005, the GAO found. All but one of the devices were recovered. ""Officials at seven of the 33 licensees we reviewed said that they have granted unescorted access to high-risk radiological sources to individuals with criminal histories,"" the GAO found. In two of the cases, the workers had serious criminal records, including one who was convicted of making terroristic threats against another person. Several efforts are underway to increase radiological security, but the GAO found that ""agencies that play a role in nuclear and radiological security are not effectively collaborating to achieve the common mission of securing mobile industrial sources."" The GAO recommended that agencies work together to provide security, seek input from companies using the radiological material, reconsider collocation rules and evaluate when someone with a criminal history is given unescorted access to radiological material. The NRC and the National Nuclear Security Administration generally agreed with all of the recommendations.

"(CNN) -- Egypt's next president will have to work hand in hand with a complex bureaucratic structure that has been in a state of transition for the past three years. There are many serious security and socio-economic challenges, and there is no one person who can solve them alone. The success of the next president necessitates the full support and cooperation of the military, state bureaucracy and the majority of the population to be able to deliver to a polity with high expectations. At this juncture of Egypt's post-Mubarak story, only former army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has emerged as a candidate who enjoys both the support of the state and the street. He has become a symbol of hope for millions of Egyptians, and does present an opportunity to move the country forward amidst difficult times. Of course, his success is not guaranteed, but his strong connection to Egypt's most influential institutions serves as a positive asset that sets him apart from other candidates. If elected, he will definitely be more capable than others in maneuvering through the multifaceted bureaucracy to get things done and undertake necessary tough decisions. For some Western observers it is difficult to comprehend why people would mobilize behind a former military general. The reason behind this reality is simple; the military institution remains the most respected and most popular state institution in the country. 'Disciplined strongman' Most Egyptian families have a loved-one who has served in the military, fostering a special bond between the people and its armed forces. Three years of political transition, including a devastating year of Muslim Brotherhood rule, prompted many Egyptians to long for a disciplined strongman who can guide the country towards security and stability. One of the core domestic constituencies behind el-Sisi's presidential bid have been women and Christians, who actually suffered the most during the short-lived reign of the Brotherhood. Thus nowadays, we see them more vocal and engaged in the political arena and in support of an el-Sisi presidency. Even the head of the Coptic Church in Egypt, Pope Tawadros II, has endorsed el-Sisi's presidential bid, not surprising, especially after Muslim Brotherhood supporters were blamed for attacks on scores of churches around the country as deadly clashes took place in Cairo last August. The Muslim Brotherhood itself said at the time that it did not support attacks on houses of worship. The strong backing of the Gulf countries, foremost by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait, also strengthens the positive prospects of an el-Sisi presidency. This significant regional support has provided international political backing and opened the door for new economic and security cooperation initiatives. We have already seen multi-billion dollar economic packages and an arms deal, and much more would follow after an election victory by el-Sisi. The Gulf support has been key for the Egyptian armed forces and their ongoing efforts to combat terrorism in the Sinai and to preserve national security. The issue of security has become the number one priority for Egyptian voters, and would pose the main challenge for an el-Sisi presidency. However, his professional years in the intelligence community and military give him an edge over candidates who have never worked in the security apparatus. If el-Sisi cannot address nor solve the security threats facing Egyptians, then it is unlikely anyone else could. The odds are in favor of el-Sisi, but it will not be an easy task with a defiant Muslim Brotherhood that has rejected the current status quo. The violent path adopted by supporters of the Brotherhood and its sister organizations cannot win over the military and persuade the majority of Egyptians to turn back the clock. It has only succeeded in generating an ugly atmosphere by seeking to undermine the political system. They are violently contesting and expressing their political grievances, which will not change the new reality on the ground. Opportunities for future . In comparison with the political upheaval in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and other places in the Middle East, Egypt still seems better off. One thing is for sure; that the inclusion of the Brotherhood in the political system does not yield for a more stable political system, as demonstrated by their short stint in power. Egypt's political transition towards a flourishing, consolidated democracy will take time. There will be many obstacles and setbacks on the way, but there are enormous opportunities for Egypt's future. It only will be Egyptians who can determine their own domestic political destiny without outside interference, and they will never allow nor accept another Mubarak-like regime. The barrier of fear has been broken, and the first seeds of a pluralistic political society have been planted. Egypt has changed and the rules of the political game have as well. An el-Sisi presidency would have to be in tune to the new political dynamics in Egypt. So far, el-Sisi has proven to be a leader who has been able to adapt to a fast-changing political environment. As defense minister and deputy prime minister, he was directly exposed to the serious challenges facing the country, making him fully aware of the magnitude of the task at hand. For many Egyptians, there is no alternative but el-Sisi, he represents hope and the light at the end of the tunnel, but his success will depend on his ability to deliver.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius was on the stumps of his amputated legs when he knocked down a locked toilet door with a cricket bat to reach his shot girlfriend, a police forensic expert said Wednesday, countering the track star's assertion he was wearing his prosthetic legs at the time. South African police colonel J.G. Vermeulen took the stand to discuss marks on a cricket bat and a bent steel plate found in the bathroom door after the athlete shot model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. Wielding the cricket bat in his hands, Vermuelen squatted down before swinging it at the actual wooden door in a court reconstruction to show the angle of the marks. He said the location of the spots on the door was consistent with Pistorius not wearing his prosthetic legs. ""From the forensic evidence, he was on his stumps,"" Vermeulen said. Defense attorney Barry Roux countered by suggesting that even with his prosthetic legs on, Pistorius would not be swinging a bat at the same height as an able-bodied person. In a change from his bail hearing, when the state based its case for a premeditated murder charge on Pistorius having had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots, the prosecution said Wednesday he was on his stumps during the shooting and when he bashed down the door. The track star has said he didn't have his prosthetics on when he shot at the toilet door after hearing a noise, but then put them on when he tried to break open the door, realizing his girlfriend may be inside. The door is being used in the Pretoria court to show the trajectory of the bullets fired at Steenkamp, which both sides can use to argue whether it was premeditated murder or not. Pistorius, the first double-amputee to run in the Olympic Games, regularly wears prosthetic legs. If he was not wearing them at the time, the trajectory of the bullets would be lower and the defense can argue that he was feeling vulnerable and didn't have time to think. The 27-year old has pleaded not guilty to murder in the shooting. He admits killing Steenkamp, 29, by shooting her through a locked bathroom door in his house. However, he says that he mistook her for a burglar in the middle of the night and that the shooting was a tragic mistake. Pistorius has said he tried to break open the door when he realized he'd shot Steenkamp. Door in focus . The court heard that the door was intact before the shots were fired. Under cross-examination, Vermeulen said the first and only time he went to the crime scene was on March 8, 2013, nearly a month after the shooting. Asked about a mark on the door which he did not investigate, he said it was not from a cricket bat. Roux asserted it was the mark of a prosthetic leg kicking the door with a sock on and that fabric remained in the mark on the door. Vermeulen was unwilling to accept that that was the only possible explanation. Vermeulen told the court there were footprints consistent with police shoes on the bathroom door at one point and photos of this were shown. They were later removed and Vermeulen said he did not know how. He said that from photos, he knew the door was removed from its hinges and left on the floor for some time. When Roux suggested they were wiped off by someone who did not know the importance of police procedure, Vermeulen chuckled. Close-up photographs of the damaged door were shown in court, as well as scuffs on the autographed cricket bat, prompting a Tweet from former South African test cricketer Herschelle Gibbs: â€ .","Police expert testifies in court reconstruction .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Kenya Smith only has good things to say about the U.S. Navy, where she served a total of 14 years before leaving in 2009. It's the only profession she's ever known. ""I love the Navy,"" she said during a recent interview in suburban Maryland. ""If you split me open, I'm blue and gold."" Smith, a former lieutenant and medical service corps officer, first enlisted right after college but by the time she left had earned two master's degrees, deployed to Iraq and racked up substantial experience in healthcare and administration -- experience she thought would impress potential civilian employers. ""I ran projects. I was an HR manager. I was a logistics manager,"" she said. But despite all that, Smith now is unemployed -- two years after leaving the military. A single mother with two teenage children, she lost her home to foreclosure in September and is currently living in transitional housing. ""I'm a female homeless vet with children, and I mean that, that's horrible, that's the worst, I think. You go from being self-supportive, having a great income to now serving your country, fighting for your country, and then you get out, and now I'm homeless, all because I can't find a job."" Smith is not alone. In September, the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans was 11.7%, higher than the national average of 9.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For female veterans in particular, the number is even worse -- 14.7% last month. It's not entirely clear why the picture appears worse for female vets. Veterans advocates point to challenges like child care and dealing with a Veterans Affairs system -- and a civilian world -- still relatively unaccustomed to dealing with female combat veterans. ""A lot of people in this country don't understand or appreciate that women are in combat, that women are even in the military in the scope that they are. So, 15% of returning veterans are women, they are on the frontlines, they are getting shot at, they are leading tough missions,"" Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said. ""And they, too, need the same training and skills that their male counterparts do."" Skills like how to create a resume. ""I really didn't know how to do a resume. I never had to do one. So, that was a challenge,"" Smith said. ""Also a challenge was taking all of my military experience and putting it in layman's terms so a civilian employer could understand what I did."" Smith has since worked with professional resume writers, attended job fairs and sent out her resume dozens of times. But she's gotten few call backs and only two interviews. One of them was at Macy's. She didn't get that job and surmises it's because she was overqualified -- perhaps, but she needed a job. ""There were not a lot of jobs, and jobs I was applying for I was actually overqualified for, which led of course to depression and all things that come along with, you know, being unemployed. It was difficult because when you live in a town that is not necessarily a military town, people don't honor the fact that, yes, you were fighting for your country, and now here you are trying to fight for a job and fight to hold onto your house and all of that. "" Smith said she left the Navy for health reasons, and while re-enlistment might be an option, she is not sure she would meet the enlistment requirements. In recent weeks, she has pursued a new tack: ""I want to take the advice of one person, who said, 'Apply up. Don't apply for administrative assistant when you should really be applying for director or project manager or supervisor.'"" She remains hopeful. ""My faith gets me through a lot. I truly believe that God doesn't take anything away without bringing you something better. So, my faith keeps me going. And my children, they're very positive and upbeat, but not only that, they're very understanding. They know this is temporary. I know this is just temporary, I know something will turn around, soon. I know it will."" But for sure, Smith is under pressure to find something soon. She and her kids must move out of their temporary housing in just two weeks, on November 11 -- Veterans Day. CNN's Jonathan Helman contributed to this report.","Unemployment for female veterans is higher than the national average .

"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs often responded directly to fans and customers by e-mail, which were then posted to blogs, but a curious thing happened after the late Apple co-founder resigned in August and quieted his digital communications. E-mails from the new CEO, Tim Cook, began landing in the inboxes of enthusiastic Apple fans and on the same blogs that followed Jobs' every word. Cook replied to several people who sent notes of congratulations. ""Thanks Gary,"" he told Gary Ng, who blogs for iPhone in Canada. ""Thanks Zech,"" he told Zech Yohannes of Denver, Colorado. Cook graduated from Auburn University and is known to be a fan of its sports teams. So when an apparent graduate of his alma mater sent Cook a congratulatory e-mail, he responded: ""Thanks Justin. War Eagle Forever!"" Like Jobs before him, Cook has also started handling customer-relations inquiries. One person e-mailed Cook bemoaning the loss of file-and-preference synchronization in the transition from Internet services MobileMe to iCloud. The message was forwarded to the executive relations team that Jobs regularly tapped for similar e-mails, and a representative responded by calling the sender and explaining that Apple is open to bringing those features back if the company receives enough feedback requesting them. Boston-based blogger Ben Gold offered Cook a line of unsolicited advice when Jobs' deputy was named as Apple's chief. ""I honestly have no recollection of sending this email (to Cook). It was actually a really stupid thing for me to write,"" Gold wrote on his blog afterward. ""I'm totally qualified to be giving advice to the new CEO of one of the largest tech companies in the world, right?"" What Gold wrote in his e-mail was this: ""Don't be Steve Jobs, be Tim Cook.""

"(CNN) -- Last month a small pocket of marshland in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, was saved from development. The local online newspaper, the Sandpaper.net, celebrated the preservation of Grassle Marsh -- named for a leading authority on the larvae of surf clams - and its populations of kingfishers and fiddler crabs. This week, Little Egg Harbor, on the shore of Ocean County, was pulverized by Superstorm Sandy. Homes were turned into debris fields; boats were tossed into the marshes or piled on top of each other. One quiet ceremony, one catastrophic storm. Both symbolize a national dilemma, as the headlong migration to America's coastlines clashes with rapidly changing climate patterns and more powerful storms. Experts warn of superstorm era to come . Ocean County typifies what has happened along the East Coast. In 1970 it had 208,000 inhabitants; in 2010 there were 576,000, according to census data. That made the cost and extent of the damage inflicted by Sandy much greater. Nationwide, the scale and speed of the rush to the coast has been stunning. According to The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the population of coastal shore-line counties will reach 133 million by 2020, compared to 33 million in 1980. Much of the development has occurred in coastal communities most vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the coastal populations of states from Virginia to Texas grew 244% between 1950 and 2006. Opinion: Jersey Shore, I'll miss you . They are even higher in the summer months with the influx of tourists. One-quarter of all seasonal or second homes are in coastal Florida, and more than 60% of homes and buildings within 500 feet of the shoreline are on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. As population density has grown and land values risen, the preservation of natural features has become more difficult. Grassle Marsh was saved thanks to a 1.2 cent tax that the people of Ocean County approved in 1997 to preserve open spaces. It also helped that it adjoined the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve, a federally funded sanctuary of marshes, barrier islands and bays. The reserve is a natural sponge -- like the mangrove swamps in the Gulf of Mexico -- for absorbing storm and tidal surges. And officials with NOAA, which runs the reserve, say it coped well with Sandy's onslaught, despite a storm surge of 6 feet. New Jersey coastal town turned to ""devastation"" But such havens are a rarity on the Northeast Coast, and there are only 28 estuarine reserves across the country. Coastal development projects, meanwhile, continue apace. Just last week, a $100 million resort development was announced for Kingsland, a few miles from the coast on the Georgia-Florida border. The site, adjacent to an estuary, will occupy 575 acres and include a hotel, conference center, water adventure park and movie complex. It also may create as many as 800 jobs. The importance of tourism to employment and the tax base of many coastal communities makes for fierce arguments pitching the science of sea-level rise against development. North Carolina's senate recently voted to ban the state from using projections from its own science panel on sea-level, which forecast a rise of 39 inches by 2100, in development decisions. Instead it approved a much lower calculation of 8 inches. The vote, advocated by 20 coastal counties, was subsequently overturned. The searing experience of Sandy, following Katrina, Irene and other major storms in recent years, will likely raise more questions about the wisdom and scope of coastal migration and development, especially as many climate scientists expect the intensity and size of storms to increase, and their geographic reach to extend northward. The construction of roads and buildings has encroached on coastal forests and wetlands. Half of America's coastal wetlands have been lost, the majority over the last 50 years, according to a federal advisory committee that reported in 2009. On the Atlantic Coast, the average erosion rate is 2 to 3 feet a year; in the Gulf of Mexico, 6 feet. The forecast rise in sea level, water temperature and acidity is likely to damage more coastal habitats. The U.S. East Coast is made more vulnerable by the fact that the coastline is gradually sinking. But is there any way to mitigate the effects of development? New satellite data reveals sea-level rise . Forty years ago, Congress passed a law called the Coastal Zone Management Act. It empowered NOAA to preserve and where possible restore the natural features of the U.S. coastline. The Jacques Cousteau Reserve in Ocean County, New Jersey, was one of the areas funded by the act. The program has spent about $1 billion of federal money to acquire and run these reserves, but that's a sum dwarfed by the damage inflicted in just four hours this week. According to a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service, some two-dozen initiatives in Congress to increase funding for the program have been rejected. States have begun introducing laws that require setbacks for construction to take account of erosion. They also have been establishing commissions on climate change to advise on building regulations and zoning. NOAA has joined with local communities to explore the impact of development, using the estuary reserves as educational tools. But a federal advisory committee that reported in 2010 warned: ""It is clear that there are limits to how much adaptation can achieve ... in the future, adaptations will be particularly challenging because society won't be adapting to a new steady state but rather to a rapidly moving target."" Chesapeake Bay might be described as ground zero of this phenomenon. It has lost 500 islands in three centuries, at least a dozen of them inhabited, as the coastline has sunk and the sea level risen. Two years ago, the last house on what had been Holland Island crumpled and slipped beneath the waves. A century ago the island had nearly 400 residents. Scientists from the University of Maryland in 2008 said that during the 21st century carbon dioxide concentrations in the bay could increase by between 50% and 160%; sea-level could rise between 0.7 and 1.6 meters, and water temperature by 2 to 6 degrees Celsius. Opinion: Climate change is real . They stressed that we are in uncharted territory and much will depend on the level of CO2 emissions -- and the future of development. But the Bay's delicate ecosystem will undoubtedly be affected, with its vital eelgrass at risk and cold-water species vanishing. Some are already observed to be retreating north. Rather than the health of eelgrass, it's likely that hard cash and cold fear will influence human behavior. As coastal communities have become more crowded, so the cost inflicted by hurricanes, storms and storm surges has risen exponentially. The 1926 hurricane that hit Miami caused about $76 million in damage at today's prices. In 1995, Hurricane Andrew, which was no bigger, inflicted $17 billion in damage, according to figures from NOAA. Insurance companies have taken flight -- for example, pulling out of many coastal areas in Florida, where the state is now the insurer of last resort. Total government exposure to storm-related losses in coastal states has risen more than 15-fold since 1990 to $885 billion last year, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The Munich RE insurance group says North America has seen higher losses from extreme weather than any other part of the world in recent decades. Not all had to do with coastal events. But a year like 2005 (which included Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita) comes with a price of $60 billion in insured losses. That's the sort of number that drives up premiums. In a report last month, Munich RE said: ""A main loss driver is the concentration of people and assets on the coast combined with high and possibly growing vulnerabilities."" Risk Management Solutions, which models catastrophic risks, recently updated its scenarios, anticipating an increase of 40% in insurance losses on the Gulf Coast, Florida and the southeast over the next five years, and 25% to 30% for the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states. Those calculations were done pre-Sandy. Pockets of discontent among signs of recovery after Sandy . Getting more people out of harm's way is also a daunting challenge. As population density grows, so evacuation routes come under greater pressure. One out of Atlantic City this week was blocked by a stranded houseboat. More powerful storm surges threaten a wider area farther inland. And while forecasting the track of hurricanes has improved dramatically, forecasting their intensity has not. Hurricane Opel in 1995 went from a Category 1 to a Category 4 in just 20 hours. This week, many people in the coastal townships of Ocean County were stunned by the speed and force of the surge. One resident told CNN how the water level rose from a couple of inches to waist height within an hour. Another recounted how a boat crashed into their porch, and then driven like a battering ram by the waters demolished their garage. In Brigantine, the owner of a marina said 50 of the 90 boats there had been scattered across the neighborhood. Several homeowners lamented their lack of adequate flood insurance and their now tattered dreams of retiring to the shore. It's a fair bet that many households along the northeast coast will purchase such insurance -- through the National Flood Insurance Program -- in the coming months. After Irene the number of homeowners in the region with flood insurance rose from 5% to 14%. Of the millions of people with jobs, businesses or vacation homes on the coast, or who just find the lure of the shore irresistible as a place to live, few will likely pack up and seek higher ground because of Sandy. They can buy insurance. But if the scientists are right, peace of mind might come at a premium. Powerless in New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- Fifty-two years ago, the survivors of the Springhill Mine Disaster in Nova Scotia revealed a few things to the world about the brutality of survival in the depths. Without food or water, cut off in every way from life on the surface, in a world lighted only by the head-lamps on their helmets until the batteries died and left them in profound darkness, the men struggled to escape and then prepared to die. Psychologists, academics and journalists swamped the 18 men upon their miraculous rescue to hear their tales, take down their personal histories, and administer IQ and personality tests. These intensive examinations, repeated at yearly intervals, allowed experts to sketch a few conclusions about the psychology of group survival when hope, like light, is gone. The rescue of the Chilean miners -- which ended this week in jubilation as every one of them ascended, healthy and sound, to the surface -- represents a triumph of space-age ingenuity and technology. It would have been unthinkable half a century ago. Here is what happened then. At 8:06 p.m. October 23, 1958, in Springhill, Nova Scotia, one of the deepest coal mines on Earth collapsed, with 174 men underground. Eighty-one men struggled to the surface, battered but alive and speaking of horrors below. Ninety-three were missing. Fallen rock blocked access to the depths; the mine had sealed up as if it had never existed. The world was watching: The Springhill Mine Disaster was the world's first live-television-broadcast news event. Hundreds of people -- families, reporters, cameramen, officials and onlookers -- mobbed the mouth of the mine. In Springhill, each rescuer crawled on his belly into the collapsed mine with a hand-ax, chipped away at the rock, filled a bucket, passed it back to the man lying behind him, who passed it to the next man in line, and in that painstaking way, a single bucket of rocks reached the surface. Those workers encountered only the crushed bodies of their comrades. Families buried their loved ones; those without recovered bodies planned memorial services. But the mine had collapsed in such a way as to create two air pockets, two caves not much bigger than closed freight elevators. In one cave a mile below the surface, seven men awoke from the crash in rock prisons; at a deeper elevation, 12 men found themselves walled in together. Neither group heard the other. On Wednesday in Chile, the rescued mine foreman spoke of the worst moment underground: When the dust settled, the men were able to look around and see their predicament. The same was true in Springhill. Coming to consciousness after the double earthquake of the collapse, lighting their head lamps, the men in each cave were staggered by the extent of the destruction. These men had known the underground walkways and tunnels as well as their own neighborhoods; now, all was twisted beyond recognition. Immediately, they began to search for an exit: they pried into every cranny and felt their way along jagged walls. In each group, a natural leader emerged. Each of the leaders (the researchers later concluded) was a man short on words and poorly educated, handy with equipment, with a good navigational sense but poor interpersonal skills, confident that he would find or chop a way out. Following his lead, the other miners jury-rigged tools from broken pieces, chipped at the walls, hungrily ate leftover dinners and drank from canteens. Other men privately wondered whether the food and water ought to be preserved and rationed in case escape was more than a few hours away, but they said nothing. The energy and optimism of the dexterous leaders lasted for about three days and gave out along with the food, water and lamp batteries. In Chile, love moves the sun and stars . On the third day, even the crumbs were gone, canteens were dry, and head lamps blinked off. This was the deepest darkness on Earth. The handyman leaders sat down and gave up. In the darkness, with no projects and work to distract them, the men could no longer avoid sad thoughts. They missed their families terribly and feared that the mine owners wouldn't take care of their widows and children. One man was heartened because it was Monday morning, so his daughter must be in school. Then he realized that the mine disaster probably caused the schools to close, and he felt lonely again, not knowing where his daughter was. Men longed to take back words spoken in anger. One realized he'd taken a couple of little things from a friend's shop with the intention of paying a few days later. Now, he'd never be able to pay; now, it was as if he'd stolen from his friend. One man quietly wondered whether the other fellows knew that he had been born out of wedlock; he'd spent his life protecting the secret that he was a ""bastard."" Then thirst came on and blotted out almost everything else on their minds: It seemed to turn their tongues to wood and cracked their lips and scraped their throats raw. The men pooled their urine in a bucket and used bits of cloth to moisten their lips. Now, in both groups, new leaders arose. These (the researchers later determined) were more educated, had higher IQs and better interpersonal skills. They offered no escape plans and were not equipment experts. In the gassy pitch-black pits, their quiet voices sounded fatherly and moderate (one was the father of 12). They were not panicking; they still had hope. Their peaceful voices -- they spoke a little bit about God, a little bit about their certainty that rescuers were looking for them -- calmed the other men. Just being in the company of these thoughtful and kind men comforted the rest. Another remarkable thing happened underground, and it was that conventional social barriers fell. In one of the groups, the second leader, the sharer of hope, was Afro-Canadian. Aboveground, others worked beside him cheerfully enough -- this was not the American South -- but he'd always felt himself held at bay. His family never socialized with any of theirs; their wives were not friends. He, almost alone among the miners, couldn't be said to have a best buddy on the crew. But now, in the dark, when only his deep and calm voice stood among them, race was a non-issue. He was more than equal. They looked to him as a leader. The rescue of the trapped miners after five days for the group of 12 and seven days for the group of six (a lone man was found alive elsewhere) was celebrated worldwide with breaking news reports, live footage and jubilation. A few miners accepted an invitation to appear on ""the Ed Sullivan Show"" in New York. All of them traveled with their families to Jekyll Island, Georgia, at the state of Georgia's expense, to relax and recuperate. How will Chilean miners fare psychologically? But there, the realities of life on the Earth's surface returned with a vengeance. Georgia was segregated; only one motel, solely for whites, existed on Jekyll Island. Though the miners flew together to Jacksonville, Florida, Georgia authorities transported them to Jekyll in a white-only bus and a black-only bus, the latter exclusively for the Afro-Canadian miner and his family. His fellow miners protested, but the black miner, Maurice Ruddick, insisted that he and his family would have a fine vacation (though they were housed in a trailer far from the hotel), and he urged everyone to relax and enjoy. The white vacationers enjoyed fishing trips, restaurants and a football game, while the Afro-Canadian family was entertained privately in the homes of black residents. Thus was the fellowship that existed underground -- between black and white, educated and uneducated, those of legitimate birth and those born ""out of wedlock"" -- gradually dissolved by the bright light of day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Fay Greene.","Melissa Fay Greene writes about Canada mine collapse that captured world's attention .

"(CNN) -- Ravaging floods killed dozens in Nigeria and displaced tens of thousands of residents as crocodiles, hippos and other water animals washed into homes. The floods have left 148 people dead and affected 21 of the nation's three dozens states, according to the local Red Cross. ""Torrential downpours in recent weeks have caused widespread destruction and forced many families into makeshift camps,"" the aid agency said on its website. ""An estimated 134,000 people have now been affected by the floods and concern is growing about the spread of waterborne diseases."" Read more: Heavy rains kill 21 in Nigeria . The floods have affected a series of states, including Bayelsa and Benue. In Bayelsa state, an official said the area's terrain has intensified the effects of the downpour. ""It is like Florida ... swampy with a lot of sea water mixed with fresh water because we are close to rivers and the Atlantic (ocean),"" said Tam Alazigha, the chief economic adviser for the state. ""A lot of people have been displaced. Snakes, crocodiles and hippos have been displaced and are ending up in people's homes. Everyone has been displaced."" Alazigha said more rain is forecast and authorities are evacuating residents to shelters that have been set up in schools located on higher ground. ""The bad part is ... there is no relief yet,"" he said. State officials are working to enhance drainage around the buldging rivers, according to the adviser. ""Our main goals are to help settle the displaced people and improve on the drainage,"" he said. ""Our hope is that when the drainage gets better and the waters subside, we can deploy more resources to see how much we can save."" Alazigha said the amount of rain was unexpected. ""It took us by surprise,"" he said. ""We need help from those agencies that are out there that usually help out in situations like these. All hands are on deck, but it is quite a challenge."" In the state of Benue, more than 25, 000 people were displaced after a local river overflowed, the National Emergency Management Agency said. Nigeria's rainy season occurs between May and October. Torrential rains are especially hard on communities in rural areas, where drainage is inadequate or nonexistent. Last month, authorities urged residents living along River Niger to move to higher ground. The evacuation order affected the states of Niger, Kogi, Kwara, Kebbi, Anambra and Delta.

"(CNN) -- Rights groups are warning of a backlash against activists in Sri Lanka following a landmark United Nations resolution calling for an international inquiry into abuses at the end of the country's civil war. The U.N.'s Human Rights Council passed a resolution Thursday calling for a ""comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights"" allegedly committed both by Sri Lankan government forces and the separatist Tamil Tigers in the final stages of the country's brutal 26-year civil war. The resolution -- the Council's third directed at Sri Lanka in recent years, but the first explicitly calling for an independent probe -- tasked the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights with conducting the investigation. Sponsored by countries including the United States and Britain, the resolution was supported by 23 members of the 47-member Human Rights Council, with 12 opposed and 12 abstentions. In comments on a government website, Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa said his government rejected the resolution, saying it did not help efforts at national reconciliation. The government would press ahead with its own healing process by pursuing recommendations made by its Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission, he said. A bloody end . The Sri Lankan civil war ended in May 2009 with the crushing defeat of the Tamil Tigers in their heartland in the north of the island. According to a report by a panel appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, government troops were responsible for abuses including the intentional shelling of civilians, summary executions, rape, and blocking food and medicine from reaching affected communities. One report estimates up to 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the war's final stages. The Tigers similarly stand accused of abuses, including using child soldiers, deploying civilians as human shields, and killing those who tried to escape. The Human Rights Council resolution also expresses ""serious concern"" at conditions that rights organizations claim persist in Sri Lanka -- including the intimidation of activists, disappearances and torture. Sri Lanka's government has consistently denied the allegations against it, and claims it faces a renewed threat of Tamil separatists regrouping in the country's north. This week, it banned the Tamil government-in-exile and 15 other Tamil groups operating in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Norway, accusing them of committing and supporting terrorism. Amnesty International's representative to the U.N. in Geneva, Peter Splinter, told CNN that the move would add to a climate that made it difficult for NGO staff, journalists and others interacting with Tamil groups, as it could render them vulnerable to anti-terror laws. ""The consequences of that is that anyone dealing with those organizations will be subject to accusations of cooperating with terrorism --- that brings them within the parameters of a rather draconian piece of legislation, the Prevention of Terrorism Act,"" he said. 'Culture of impunity' Rights groups have welcomed the U.N. resolution, with David Griffiths, Asia-Pacific deputy director at Amnesty International, saying it brought ""new hope for the thousands of victims of abuses in Sri Lanka,"" and presented the country's government with the opportunity ""to restore some international credibility by cooperating with the investigation."" But they say that Sri Lanka appeared to be responding to the increased international scrutiny by demonstrating a renewed determination to crack down on dissent. Fred Carver of the UK-based Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice said the recent arrests of prominent human rights activists Ruki Fernando and Rev. Praveen Mahesan under anti-terror laws highlighted the ""culture of impunity"" in which the government was operating. Shortly after Fernando was released after more than two days of detention last month, he told CNN he believed his arrest was part of ""a deliberate attempt to intimidate and suppress any form of dissent, criticism or challenge, and clearly not allow people outside Sri Lanka to know what's happening inside the country."" Fernando, who Carver said had since been instructed by the government not to speak with media, said the security personnel questioning him seemed interested in whether he was sharing information with people behind the U.N. resolution in Geneva. Splinter said the crackdown on activists and civil society figures appeared calculated to send a message to potential witnesses not to cooperate with the U.N. inquiry, which was scheduled to deliver an oral report to the Human Rights Council in September, and a written report in March. He said Sri Lanka's refusal to cooperate with the probe would likely not prove an issue, as similar commissions of inquiry into abuses in Syria and North Korea had progressed without the involvement of those governments. A crucial consideration, though, would be safeguarding the protection of witnesses, as even those in the diaspora would likely have family members remaining in Sri Lanka who could be vulnerable to potential retribution, he said.

"(CNN) -- Churches in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo have vowed to continue to use the word ""Allah"" in defiance of a Malaysian court ruling this week that ruled that the word could not be used by a Roman Catholic newspaper to refer to the Christian God. Christians in Malaysia use the term interchangeably to refer to the Christian and Muslim God, but now a Christian newspaper published in the capital Kuala Lumpur has been told to stop doing so. The Archbishop of the Anglican Church in South East Asia Datuk Bolly Lapok described the decision as ""excessive, utterly irresponsible and grossly demeaning, to say the least. ""In the meantime, Christians in Sabah and Sarawak continue to reverently worship their Allah until the Kingdom comes,"" Rev. Lapok said in a statement reported in Malaysian media. ""What are you going to do about it?"" He said in an earlier statement the decision struck at the constitutional basis of the Malaysian Federation. The Malaysian constitution guarantees freedom of religion while making Islam the state religion. ""We find it completely unacceptable that what are common practices of the Church of Sabah and Sarawak for hundreds of years, and indeed for generations of Christians even before the very idea of Malaysia was conceived, are now proscribed by administrative orders and laws,"" Rev. Lapok said. President of the Sabah Council of Churches, Datuk Thomas Tsen, said churches in the state would continue to use the word ""Allah"" in their church services, publications and prayers. ""We have made a very clear stand and we will stick to it,"" he said. ""We have purged our hearts and minds on whatever decision the court would make. Even if the court decides against us using the word, we will continue to use it."" The unanimous decision by three Muslim judges sitting in Malaysia's appeals court on Monday overturns a 2009 decision from a lower court that permitted The Herald to use the word Allah. ""The usage of the word Allah is not an integral part of the faith in Christianity,"" chief judge Mohamed Apandi Ali said in the court ruling. ""The usage of the world will cause confusion in the community."" The Herald editor Rev. Lawrence Andrew said he was ""disappointed and dismayed,"" and would appeal against the decision. ""It is a retrograde step in the development of law in relation to the fundamental liberty of religious minorities,"" he said. The decision comes amid escalating ethnic and religious tension in Malaysia following a bruising election campaign in May in which the ruling coalition -- which has been in power since federation in 1963 -- found its support among urban voters crumbling. Prime Minister Najib Razak has attempted to shore up his support among majority ethnic Muslim Malays, by toughening security laws and boosting Malaysia's controversial policy of bumiputra -- a Malay term that literally means ""son of the soil"" -- which favors the ethnic Malay majority, providing them with preference in employment, business, education and housing. While proponents say the radical affirmative action campaign -- instituted in the early 1970s in response to anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia in 1969 -- has lifted many urban Malays into the middle class, critics say that Chinese, Indian and the indigenous Orang Asli have been excluded from the political process. While problems with bumiputra were among the election issues in May, allegations of government cronyism and nepotism are now high on the list of voter concerns. Razak's latest steps to reverse liberal reforms -- known as ""reformasi"" -- has hit educated young Malaysians in their 20s and 30s who have been leaving the country to take up opportunities overseas. The brain drain is now a serious problem for the coalition government which has embarked on economic reforms, but is accused of doing little to reform the public service or education. According to Malaysia's Population and Housing Census from 2010, 61.3% of Malays practice Islam, while 9.2% are Christians.","Churches in Sabah and Sarawak have vowed to continue to use the word ""Allah""

"(CNN) -- Taking inspiration from the teenage exploits of Michelle Wie, already admired by the most successful player of her generation Annika Sorenstam and with a bucketful of talent, New Zealand's Lydia Ko has the world of golf at her feet. Still only 17 years of age, Ko is in her rookie season as a professional -- the LPGA waiving their age limit of 18 on account of her talent and maturity -- and duly collected her first tournament win at the Swinging Skirts Classic in California Sunday. It was not her first success at this level, Ko had already claimed the 2012 and 2013 Canadian Open crowns while still an amateur, but it was an important milestone at a $1.8 million tournament. The South Korean-born Kiwi carded a final round three-under-par 69 at Lake Merced to hold off Stacey Lewis of the United States by a shot. Not only did she pocket $270,000 but the victory has lifted her to number two in the world rankings, just three days after her 17th birthday. Wie fan . Wie's exploits, even before she reached her teenage years, are well-documented and Ko, who first picked up a golf club at just five years of age, quite naturally was a fan. ""I really look up to Michelle,"" she told CNN. ""She had a lot of success and attention at a young age. I have been very lucky to spend some time with her on and off the golf course over the last two years and she has been really gracious to me,"" she added. Ko's latest triumph has already lifted her level with Wie for all-time career LPGA Tour wins on three and it's not hard to predict that there will be many more. Sorenstam, who won 93 events, including 10 majors, is so impressed with Ko that she endorsed the teen phenom for inclusion in Time Magazine's lists of the most 100 influential people on the planet. She was one of just five from the world of sport, the others gay NBA icon Jason Collins, Super Bowl champion Richard Sherman, tennis ace Serena Williams and FIFA World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo. It is heady company but her inclusion in the Pioneers section is, according to Sorenstam, thoroughly deserved. ""Lydia Ko is exceptionally talented, mature beyond her years and well liked by golf fans and competitors alike,"" the Swedish legend wrote in the published citation. ""She is responsible for sparking increased interest in our sport not just in her native South Korea and adopted homeland of New Zealand but also among juniors across the globe. Fantastic job . ""Her early, record-breaking success brings with it incredible pressure â€” and she's doing a fantastic job handling the many responsibilities that accompany stardom."" Quite a compliment and Ko admitted that Sorenstam and another retired former world number one Lorena Ochoa were her idols as she honed her game. ""For a long time, I looked up to Annika and Lorena. They did so much for the game and I hope one day I can be remembered like them,"" she told CNN. To be mentioned in the same breath, Ko will have to claim her share of golf's majors and came close to claiming her first when runner-up in the Evian Championship in France last year. Few have any doubt that it is only a matter of time and Ko is prepared to be patient in her quest. ""I think it's important not to put too much pressure on myself at the majors, though, and continue to approach them in the same manner I always have. ""Last year, aside from Evian, I came away from the majors feeling a bit disappointed so there is definitely room for improvement,"" she said. Ko was coached from the start by New Zealander Guy Wilson, only ending her full-time association with him because of the need for full-time help while playing a full schedule on the LPGA Tour. Historic wins . She won her first professional golf event -- a tournament on her home circuit while still 14 and the following year became the youngest winner of an LPGA Tour event when she won in Canada aged just 15 years and four months. It broke the record set by American Lexi Thompson, but the winners check for $300,000 went to South Korean runner-up Inbee Park because Ko was still an amateur. Inbee Park also trailed Ko in fourth place at this weekend's tournament but is now the only player ahead of her in the world rankings. Park is only 25 years old and has held the number one status for a year, surely to come under challenge from Ko, who was born in Seoul before her parents emigrated to New Zealand while she was a toddler. Sporting stars are getting ever younger and Ko admits that getting to the top at such a tender age has not been without sacrifices. ""Golf has been my number one priority from a young age so I have certainly missed out on some things back home,"" she said. Missing friends . ""I do enjoy spending time with my friends and I miss them when I am gone. I keep in touch with them over Facebook and we hang out when I am home. "" She is hoping her own incredible exploits will encourage others to follow in her footsteps. ""On a global stage, particularly in women's golf, the game is really growing and I think many more girls are exposed to golf at a younger age. ""I just hope I can be a small inspiration to girls in New Zealand and elsewhere."" That much is certainly assured but Ko's level-headed and mature approach is what has so impressed the likes of Sorenstam and other expert observers. ""I have been very fortunate to achieve success at a young age in golf. I realize how lucky I am to pursue the game I love. ""From a young age, I have had very high expectations of myself on the golf course and while I am proud of the success I have achieved, I know I have a long way to go,"" she said. Hall of Famer Sorenstam sums it up succinctly. ""She's leading golf's youth movement.""","Lydia Ko wins first LPGA Tour event as a professional .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's extraordinary climb to the world's second largest economy was built on the back of Chinese workers, many of whom left rural farms to migrate for work in coastal factories. But as China's wealth rises, workers are demanding a greater share of the wealth and better access to social services. And as this month's edition of ""On China"" examines, the young generation of worker are tech savvy, aware of their rights and choosier about where they go for work. ""They're on the Internet more ... on especially Weibo, China's social media, Twitter-like thing. They're able to connect with others, see what others are doing,"" William Nee of China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based NGO which defends workers' rights, told CNN. ""And in cases where there are strikes or things like that, they can put it out there on Weibo and other people can learn about it,"" he said. ""They can look online for labor rights and labor contract law."" One of the greatest issues for China's 250 million migrant workers is the ""hukou"" system of household registration. Migrant workers often can't register in the cities where they work, and subsequently can't qualify for social services such as public education or social security. ""When I talk to migrant workers about a vast array of problems, I think, this usually rises to number one,"" Rob Schmitz, a Marketplace correspondent in Shanghai, told CNN. ""And I think, for them, the biggest reason this is such a big problem is that they are treated like illegal immigrants inside of their own country."" This hits the children of migrant workers. ""Many children are born in these larger cities where their parents have moved to. This is their hometown, as far as they know it,"" Schmitz said. But as China's coastal provinces -- which were first opened for Western-style economic reform in 1979 -- grow more expensive, more companies are moving factories into rural areas, sparking a new wave of development and giving workers more options closer to home. ""The companies are looking for cheaper resources, cheaper land, cheaper labor in the home provinces, like in the rural remote provinces in China,"" Suki Chung, executive director, Labor Action China, told CNN. ""In places like Shenzhen, the Pearl River Delta, these places have become very expensive. So for migrant workers perhaps in the past, you make a salary and then bring it home, because of the cost of living how it's risen so quickly, it's no longer viable,"" said Nee. ""Taking a salary that's a little bit less back near their hometown is a much more attractive option, especially since they can visit their family much more easily."" Meanwhile, the low-skilled factory jobs in Shenzhen are being replaced by higher skilled employment. ""Shenzhen is moving up the value chain,"" Schmitz said. ""A lot of the jobs now that are available at places like Huawei (the telecommunications giant) ... you're seeing a lot of folks who graduated from 'dazhuang,' which is the vocational colleges of China, coming to Shenzhen instead of folks who have dropped out of high school perhaps or just come right off the farm."" As China moves from an export-driven, investment-led economy toward domestic consumption growth, the nation depends on the rising buying power of its workforce. Still, ""400 million people in China still live on less than $2 a day,"" Schmitz said. ""(China) is going to experience slower growth. Slower growth probably means fewer job,"" Schmitz said. ""I think there are a lot of threats that lie ahead."" CNN's Kristie Lu Stout contributed to this article .","China's climb to the world's second largest economy was built by Chinese workers .

That's because the crime itself conveys multiple issues in its summary: . A mentally ill 20-year-old recluse obsessed with school shootings enters Sandy Hook Elementary School after the morning bell and kills six adult women, 12 girls and eight boys in 11 minutes. The children were 6 or 7 years old. The heavily armed Adam Lanza, who first killed his mother before taking her car to the school, also killed himself, in a classroom. On the anniversary of the December 14 slaughter -- under the shadow of another school shooting, this time at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado -- country and community alike pause and reflect on an event known simply as ""Newtown"" or ""Sandy Hook"" and what it says about America on the matters of guns, mental health, healing, and the human spirit. Guns . Whether the United States has reformed its gun laws after the Newtown massacre may depend on your point of view. Clearly, America affirms a right to bear arms. President Barack Obama was unable to persuade Congress, as he vowed in Newtown's aftermath, to ""come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics"" about gun reform. Obama failed to even expand background checks on firearm buyers, though he signed 23 executive actions to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety. However, Paul Barrett, author of ""Glock: The Rise of America's Gun,"" said it's easier today to own a firearm in some states than a year ago. ""The one-word answer is yes,"" Barrett, an assistant managing editor and senior writer at Bloomberg Businessweek, told National Public Radio. ""And I say yes because I think the overall environment in the United States has moved in a libertarian direction, in a pro-gun direction, away from the idea that the regulation of the lawful acquisition of firearms has much effect on crime."" Others disagree and point to how a growing number of states have reformed gun laws -- in the absence of the federal reforms. Barrett acknowledges the success in those states, indicating it's not easier to own and operate a gun in those regions a year after Sandy Hook. Those are major victories, according to gun reform advocates who have spent years working on their cause. Those activists assembled this month a report card on all 50 states, grading their regulations on guns and ammunition, background checks, and prohibitions against dangerous people buying weapons. High grades went to eight states that have enacted major gun reforms: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Low grades were given to Arizona, Alaska, Wyoming, South Dakota -- states with some of the highest gun death rates in the country, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""States have clearly led where Congress has failed, and passed gun measures that will save lives,"" Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign, said in a statement. ""But to make this the truly safer nation we all want, we need the same laws on a federal level."" Newtown marks the anniversary . Mental Health . Lanza, 20, suffered mental health problems. Many people, including the parents whose children were killed by Lanza, say society needs to better treat these problems to prevent another disturbed gunman committing a massacre. In fact, to combat the stigma-loaded phrase of ""mental illness,"" some Newtown parents have advanced a new wording to illustrate how the issue is deeper or more organic: ""brain health"" or ""brain illness."" Lanza was living with his mother, Nancy, 52, in a Newtown house that evoked the old-growth elegance of New England. She ensured her son received treatment, but after her son's rampage, she was criticized by some for owning a semiautomatic rifle and two handguns, a Glock and a Sig Sauer, and giving her son access to them. Adam Lanza took those firearms to Sandy Hook and used a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S rifle in the shooting. Before the violence, Lanza had become isolated. His parents divorced in September 2009, and his father, Peter, remarried and moved to an area not far from Newtown. Their only other child, also a son, 24, wasn't living in the mother's home. A 44-page summary of Connecticut authorities' investigation concludes that Lanza ""had significant mental health issues that affected his ability to live a normal life and to interact with others. What contribution this made to the shootings, if any, is unknown as those mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior."" Some Newtown parents and a journalist who wrote a book about the town's atrocity take exception with that finding. They are raising public awareness about mental -- or brain -- health issues as a way to prevent catastrophic crimes and to honor the memory of the children who were slain. Nancy Lanza arranged help for her son in school, but once he left school at age 18 and became socially isolated, the mother's options became limited, said journalist Matthew Lysiak, author of ""Newtown: An American Tragedy."" Why she kept guns in the home, however, is ""inexplicable,"" he said. ""When I tracked through Adam's life -- and I was able to access years' worth of Nancy Lanza, the mother's, e-mails -- you can see this deterioration of mental health over the course of many years. And this was a mother who identified that her son was mentally ill and sought professional help,"" Lysiak said. ""Still, Adam was not on medication. And the fact that we have a lot of dangerously mentally ill people around who are not being treated, to me says that you can expect this rising trend of mass shootings to continue unless we figure out a solution."" The parents of Newtown are urging society to make treatment of brain illnesses an affirmative experience, not a stigmatizing one. ""The Sandy Hook shooting could have been avoided if the proper intervention had been made, if he and his family had received help, had sought help and had received help at an earlier stage,"" said Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan, 6, was killed in the gunfire. ""And certainly if there hadn't been that sort of open access to firearms, I probably wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today, and to be honest that would be a really good thing,"" Hockley said last week. After Newtown, mental health gains prominence in gun debate . The victimized families . Families who lost a child in the mass shooting still recover from the devastation. They are just now beginning to share with the world the depth of the tragedy. Public comments by the families this weekend are unlikely, as several news outlets, including CNN, have agreed not to send reporters to Newtown on the anniversary. ""I had to be on the floor because I felt if I stood up the world would spin away. I remember asking, why would somebody walk into the school and kill my child,"" Jennifer Hensel said in a recent interview. She and Jeremy Richman lost 6-year-old daughter Avielle Richman in the shooting. ""I think there's not a minute, not a second of any day that goes by where somewhere in my head I'm thinking, I don't have my daughter Avielle. She's gone. That's always in my head,"" said Richman. Mark and Jackie Barden also spoke of falling into an abyss. Their son, Daniel, 7, was also killed. ""I still really can't seem to get my head around that this has happened and how final it is,"" Jackie Barden said. Added her husband: ""The bottom just falls out for you. What's left is faith."" Hensel and Richman are both research scientists. He studies neuroscience and neuropsychopharmacology. To seek something constructive in a situation so destructive, the couple started a foundation in the name of their daughter, devoted to understanding the biological and environmental factors that can lead to malevolent behavior. ""We do think that there are physical manifestations in the brain that lead to all our behaviors,"" Richman said. ""And if we can understand those, we can help nudge them one direction or another to make things happier and healthier."" Opinion: Keep your guns, but take responsibility . The community itself . After much soul searching, the hamlet of Newtown decided to tear down the school, whose razing began in October. Another big decision had to be made: Should the new school be built in the same place or another? The residents would not be bowed: The new school will be built on the same site, a symbol of resurrection. It wasn't an easy choice in a town of 27,000 where everyone seems to have some sort of connection -- close or loose -- to the school and its carnage. Should children return to that scene, even if a new school would greet them? ""It was gut wrenching,"" said Richard Harwood, a community building expert who helped a 28-person task force in Newtown come to a decision. ""This was really about how the community was going to move forward and under what conditions and how you were going to balance the needs of the current students and those of future generations,"" Harwood said. ""There was the question of building on another site and whether that was giving into evil of the gunman."" Public testimony showed divisions, said Harwood, who is president of an institute for public innovation bearing his name. ""Families for victims or survivors would speak before the task force,"" he said. ""They would say something that I wouldn't want to have to be in your shoes making this decision, and even though I don't agree with your decision, I would be supportive."" Perhaps it's these public legacies that are the greatest: Humanity shows compassion in its darkest hour. And a community moves forward the best it can, recognizing, as Harwood said, that there's ""not a perfect solution to an imperfect, horrific situation.""

"(CNN) -- Once marred by conflict, Mozambique is slowly emerging as a popular tourist destination as people are drawn in by the tropical weather, beautiful beaches and rich culture. Mozambique's capital, Maputo is a vibrant and cosmopolitan city bursting with lively sidewalk cafes and jazz venues. One of Maputo's landmark buildings is the train station designed by an associate of the famous French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. Today the train station he inspired rarely sees trains, instead its jazz cafe is among the city's best night spots. The music likely to be performed there is marrabenta, a mix of traditional and urban dance music that was born in the capital. ""It's really become a national genre,"" said Joao Carlos Schwalba, a musician with the band Ghorwane. ""It was created in the south but slowly it has such a strong rhythm, it really became a national rhythm you can hear it in the south, the center and the north,"" he continued. The official language is Portuguese, after settlers first arrived in Mozambique in the 15th century. Colonial era architecture and relics can be found across the country but the nation has also preserved much of its African cultural heritage, making for an interesting and diverse mix of old and new. The city has undergone major redevelopment since the end of the civil war and any reminders of the country's brutal past are being carefully transformed in to points of interest. And it is proving a draw with tourists; government figures show that four times as many tourists visited the country in 2010 compared to 2004. Investment in tourism began in 1992, following a peace agreement, which brought an end to 16 years of civil war in the country. The old fort in the capital, built by the Portuguese nearly 200 years ago, is a symbol of the country's, sometimes violent, colonial past. But a group of Mozambique artists are working in the building to transform reminders of Mozambique's more recent civil war into pieces of art. Nucleo de arte or Arms to Art is a creative form of demobilization. The group have collected some 800,000 guns spanning two wars and four decades and are working on transforming them into works of art. The machine guns, landmines and hand weapons that the artists use are collected and deactivated by the Christian Council of Mozambique. ""We want to give our opinion, we want to show the world the good way for these bad materials and make some beautiful,"" said artist Goncalo Mabunda. Outside of the capital, the country has a number of beautiful islands to visit. Inhaca Island is the closet to Maputo and has a quaint village and Biology Museum. But depending on what you are looking for the islands range in size. Some are practically deserted while others, like the island of Mozambique, have a population of 14,000. With 2,500km of coastline along the warm Indian Ocean it is no surprise that fishing is one of Mozambique's most important industries. For generations, fishermen outside of the capital have been bringing in their catch using the same process and methods. One of Mozambique's most important exports are prawns and they are available to buy fresh in nearby markets. Prawns are still something of a delicacy to the average Mozambican so they can be quite expensive. About a kilo of king-sized prawns will cost around $10. The long stretches of coastline also means there are plenty of sea-based activities from snorkeling to scuba diving. Joseph Mayers, who lives in Canada, visited the country and told CNN that he can see it becoming a more desirable place in the coming years. ""Mozambique is a truly beautiful country with breathtaking scenery and sunsets. It has vast amounts of potential and it was an unforgettable experience, to say the least.""","It has been nearly 20 years since Mozambique's civil war ended .

"Kuwait (CNN) -- A former military bunker in the desert is one of the last places you might expect to find nature bloom. But above a maze of abandoned foxholes to the north of Kuwait's capital lies a landscape that shimmers green and purple with vegetation, attracting foxes, migratory birds and other wildlife. The Sabah Al-Ahmad nature reserve occupies land that once served as an important base for Saddam Hussein's army during its invasion of Kuwait from 1990-1. Iraq's annexation of its southern neighbor, which began in August 1990 and lasted until the liberation the following February, had a devastating impact not only on Kuwait's people, but its ecology, said Dr Samira Omar Asem of the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research. One of Kuwait's leading environmental scientists, with three decades experience in resource conservation, Asem has played a major role in restoring Kuwait's war-ravaged ecosystems as head of the United Nations Compensation Commission's environmental remediation program. The body was established in 1991 to process claims and pay compensation damages suffered as a result of the occupation of Kuwait, and processed its final claim in 2005. The war, said Asem, resulted in ""a lot of aggression against the environment"" -- most infamously, the destruction of Kuwait's oil fields as part of Hussein's ""scorched earth"" policy on retreat. More than 700 wells were destroyed, choking the skies with black smoke in an inferno that raged for eight months before firefighters eventually extinguished the blaze. But substantial damage was inflicted during the occupation as well. As the Iraqi army swept through the country, it built an elaborate system of fortifications, destroying the fragile desert ecosystem. About 24,000 fortifications were built in the area of the reserve alone, she said. ""I saw these bunkers immediately after liberation,"" she said. ""They had services established under the ground. So you can imagine ... a natural reserve is being converted into a headquarters for military activities. The whole reserve was full of ammunition."" The abandoned, unexploded ordnance, combined with oil from leaks or deliberately flooded trenches, has left a hazardous environment for rehabilitation workers to operate in. ""All this heavy machinery and vehicles caused a lot of soil compaction, changed the landscape, and allowed more sand to move and caused a lot of erosion,"" she said. At the Sabah Al-Ahmad nature reserve, environmental remediation has involved planting trees and building ponds to bring back wildlife, resulting in a flourishing desert ecosystem. ""This is a major achievement for the government of Kuwait, to preserve the natural history for the new generations and the existing generations,"" she said. ""It is our contribution for the international community to say that we are serious about protecting our environment."" But the reserve is only a first step. More than one billion barrels were burned and spilled in the oil field destruction at the end of the war, and the country still bears the scars of that legacy. Outside the reserve, the deserts remain affected, with large lakes of oil -- caused by leaked crude oil mixing with the billions of gallons of seawater used to extinguish the flames -- contaminating the sands across about 100 square kilometers of desert. The clean-up effort, says Asem, still has a long way to go.

"(CNN) -- On June 13, 2009, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in the largest demonstrations seen in Tehran since the Iranian revolution of 1979. They were protesting what many observers said was a rigged presidential election. The regime answered with brutal repression. Security forces admitted 2,000 arrests and some 20 killings. Families of the protesters insisted that the true number of the killed was hundreds more. Through the crisis, President Barack Obama mostly held his tongue. On June 15, he disavowed any intention by the United States to favor one side or the other. He assured Americans that the Iranian government had promised him ""that they are going to look into irregularities that have taken place."" Only on June 23, after 10 days of arrests, beatings, and killings, did Obama harden his tone. That day, he expressed disapproval of the regime's ""threats, beatings and imprisonments."" Yet even that tougher statement was hedged with careful restraints. While deploring loss of life, the president avoided any suggestion that the regime had intentionally killed anyone. By then, of course, the ""irregularities"" had achieved their effect: the protests were suppressed, the election was stolen. By crushing protesters in 2009, the Iranian regime survived to aid its clients in Syria when they faced an uprising in 2011. Iranian generals and Hezbollah militias stiffened Syrian government forces and turned the tide of war -- a war that has to date claimed perhaps 150,000 lives -- and generated the largest refugee exodus in postWorld War II history. In August 2011, Obama called upon President Bashar al-Assad to step down. He didn't. In August 2012, Obama declared the use of poison gas a ""red line."" Al-Assad crossed it. American presidents should use the language of command only very sparingly -- but when they do use it, they cannot allow their commands to be defied with impunity. Yet that, to the world's cost, is precisely what happened. Al-Assad used poison gas in December 2012. Rather than react, the U.S. government pooh-poohed the reports. ""The reporting we have seen from media sources regarding alleged chemical weapons incidents in Syria has not been consistent with what we believe to be true about the Syrian chemical weapons program."" Within hours, the Washington soft line had been contradicted by a leaked cable from U.S. officials on the Turkey-Syria border. Nothing changed. The Obama administration seemed to take the view:  If we see something, we'll have to do something. We don't want to do anything, so we won't see anything. Al-Assad did not cooperate, however. He used poison gas again, in attacks of escalating deadliness, through the spring of 2013. Obama threatened military action -- and again nothing much happened. A Russian plan to deactivate Syrian weapons has bogged down, with the Syrians gaining extensions and more extensions. As of March 2014, Syria still retained a majority of its original chemical stockpile. In the meanwhile, the government continues to gain the upper hand over the rebels. Did al-Assad's successful crossing of Obama's red line embolden another al-Assad ally, Russia's Vladimir Putin? Over the past six months, the sovereign state of Ukraine -- a country of 50 million -- has chased out a corrupt authoritarian Russian-backed president and attempted to reorient itself to Europe and the West. Russia has invaded and annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea -- the first time since 1945 that a larger European country has taken territory from a smaller. The U.S. response has again been muted. Obama's most recent statement about Ukraine, delivered in Europe on March 26, belittled the significance of what has happened there. ""To be honest, if we define our -- our interests narrowly, if we applied a cold-hearted calculus, we might decide to look the other way. Our economy is not deeply integrated with Ukraine's. Our people and our homeland face no direct threat from the invasion of Crimea. Our own borders are not threatened by Russia's annexation."" He concluded: ""Now is not the time for bluster. The situation in Ukraine, like crises in many parts of the world, does not have easy answers nor a military solution."" Meanwhile, in Venezuela, another authoritarian regime is violently suppressing student protesters. Venezuela, too, seems to have got the message: All clear, nothing to fear from Washington. The President's response? A four-sentence statement delivered at a press conference in Mexico back in February that seemed to lay blame on all parties. ""I want to take this opportunity to address the situation in Venezuela and Ukraine, and the unacceptable violence in those two countries, which the United States strongly condemns. ""In Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people. So, along with the Organization of American States, we call on the Venezuelan government to release protesters that it's detained and engage in real dialogue. And all parties have an obligation to work together to restrain violence and restore calm."" In crisis after crisis, the United States seems just AWOL. And there's an emerging pattern to this passivity: all four of these cases -- Iran, Syria, the Russian invasion of Crimea and Venezuela -- involve governments in which Obama tried to engage in dialogue. In each case, the government in question preferred violent repression to dialogue. And in each case, the violently repressive government got away with its actions, leaving the United States and its eloquent President defied, outmaneuvered and tongue-tied. The Crimea situation isn't over yet. But it does seem likely to follow the same path as the other cases. The pattern established here is embarrassing to the United States and destabilizing to the world. Obama blames his predecessor as too provocative. But, as the saying goes, weakness is provocative, too. By that measure, the United States has seldom provoked more trouble than it is provoking today.","David Frum: Time after time, President Barack Obama has ducked foreign policy challenges .

"New York (CNN) -- When Dr. Jessie Stone decided to give up her career as a doctor in New York in favor of full-time kayaking, she could never have imagined that a kayaking expedition in Africa would ultimately lead her back to it. A native of Purchase, New York, Stone worked hard to achieve her goal of becoming a doctor, attending New York Medical College. But at the time of the expedition, in 2003, Stone had decided a full-time medical career just wasn't for her. ""I really did not see myself going back to medicine,"" she said. ""Then the trip to Uganda happened, and everything changed."" According to the UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, Uganda has one of the highest malaria death rates in Africa. Despite being warned the country was facing a dire outbreak, Stone embarked on a cross-country kayaking trip to the Nile along with E.J., a boat designer for one of her kayaking sponsors, Wave Sport. They took antimalarial drugs and slept under mosquito nets. They figured they'd be fine. They were wrong. It wasn't long before E.J. came down with malaria, and Stone's background as a doctor was called upon. ""Luckily for all of us, E.J. ended up being fine,"" she recalls, ""but it was a wake-up call."" It was a wake-up call that piqued Stone's interest as a doctor. If E.J. could catch malaria despite precautions, how about those who lived in these malarial regions year-round? Stone went to the nearest village and conducted a 50-hut survey. The results astounded her: ""Nobody had a mosquito net, not one single person we interviewed. Everyone reported at least one child in their household dying from malaria, and everyone wanted more information."" Residents of a small village named Kyabirwa asked Stone, or ""Dr. Jessie"" as she's known locally, to stay and build a clinic. ""I knew absolutely nothing about it,"" she admitted. But the will was there: On her return to New York, Stone raised $25,000 -- enough to build a clinic and found Soft Power Health Uganda. Stone says that aside from the funds, the support and encouragement of the villagers was vital to bringing the project to fruition. ""To do this work, you need the community's support and blessing,"" she said. ""The entire process is a shared endeavor."" Kyabirwa is 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) downstream from Jinja, Uganda, which sits at the source of the Nile River. The clinic now receives 50 to 100 patients a day -- up from eight to 10 when it first opened. Patients run the gamut from tiny babies with malaria to those with advanced cancers and other disorders. As well as treating patients, outreach and educational programs form a large part of Soft Power Health's doctrine. Stone says its malaria outreach programs have taught more than 100,000 people about prevention and provided more than 45,000 mosquito nets to the community at a fraction of the cost. With one of the highest birth rates in Africa, Stone discovered, many Ugandans had little to no education about conception or contraception. Her family planning outreach works in 39 villages every three months and has overtaken even the malaria outreach in popularity. Stone describes vast differences in the communities she serves since the clinic began. She says knowledge of malaria prevention is much more widespread, and she's seen a huge increase in the numbers of people sleeping under mosquito nets. Stone says Soft Power Health's reputation has grown to the point where patients now come from all over Uganda. (It has implemented a referral system to assist with some more complicated diseases). These days, kayaking has taken a back seat to doctoring for 44-year-old Stone, who has relegated it from full-time job to part-time stress reliever, but she still takes part in freestyle kayaking and will be competing in the American circuit in Colorado this summer. Stone now lives in Uganda five or six months of the year, despite the fact that a recently completed dam has turned the nearby section of whitewater she used to kayak into a lake. She says the locals fear that fewer kayaking opportunities mean she'll leave, but she reassures them that as long is the need is there, so is she. ""I feel very lucky to be able to do this work,"" she said. ""You just never know what life has in store for you!""","Dr. Jessie Stone gave up medicine to be a kayaker, but medicine found her again .

"(CNN) -- Recently a school principal in Ohio suspended a student for three days after the 10-year-old pointed his finger at another student in class and pretended to shoot. This kind of harsh sentencing is not new. In recent years, we've heard of kids being suspended for pop-tarts chewed into ""gun shapes,"" or for firing an imaginary bow and arrow. In fact, school suspensions over things that could not possibly be guns have been going on for years. Last year, a Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, kindergarten student was suspended from school for allegedly threatening others and herself with a weapon -- her pink ""Hello Kitty"" bubble gun. Even finger gun suspensions have come up before. In a suspiciously similar Florida case last year, an 8-year-old was also suspended for playing cops and robbers and pretending his finger was a gun. No word yet on whether these kids are part of the same ring of ""robbers"" -- or ""cops,"" for that matter. The use of imaginary weapons is only escalating. Last year, a 7-year-old in Colorado was suspended from school for throwing an imaginary grenade. This ups the imaginary-weapon ante: Given that real explosives can arguably cause more harm and terror than firearms, should the punishment for an imaginary grenade be greater than that for an imaginary gun? When a kid runs around the room pretending to fly a fighter jet, he or she probably should be expelled or sent to juvie hall, no? After all, an imaginary fighter jet carries imaginary missiles and other fictional ordnance. Indeed, the modern imaginary F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter aircraft carries enough imaginary ordnance to lay waste to a small imaginary village. We are having fun here, but only to demonstrate what, logically, we are dealing with when students are caught in the net of ""zero tolerance,"" where the mandatory punishments are anything but imaginary. In our public schools, ""zero tolerance"" policies impose unwavering, pre-determined consequences for certain behavior, with little or no discretion given to school officials enforcing the policies. You can't blame school districts entirely -- the federal government bears some responsibility. In 1994, the Gun-Free Schools Act, forced each state (upon threat of losing federal funding) to pass laws requiring local educational agencies to, among other things, impose a minimum year expulsion upon a student who brings a weapon to school. Sound familiar? It should. The policy is firmly rooted in the idea of mandatory minimum sentences for adult crimes. Such mandatory minimums remove a judge's discretion to impose any punishment lower than the statutory floor. Mitigating information about the offense and offender becomes irrelevant, because the judge is powerless to impose a below-minimum sentence. Last year, Attorney General Eric Holder urged reform of mandatory minimum sentencing, so that individuals accused of certain low-level federal drug crimes no longer face excessive mandatory minimum sentences. Even the nation's top prosecutor acknowledges that ""mando mins"" have ""resulted in unduly harsh sentences and perceived or actual disparities that do not reflect our Principles of Federal Prosecution."" In sum, for adult criminal defendants, the mandatory minimum approach to punishment may be too draconian. For schools and our children, ""mando mins"" are apparently just fine. Especially when they are repackaged as ""zero tolerance"" policies. There is no question that students who bring actual weapons to class with evil plans should face harsh penalties like expulsion. But how did we get to Pop-Tarts and fingers? At this point, schools cannot blame the Gun Free Schools Act, because these items are simply not weapons under the applicable definition, 18 U.S.C. ยง 921(a)(3)(4) 18 U.S.C. ยง 921(a)(3)(4). And while it's true Ohio law vaguely requires school boards to adopt ""zero tolerance"" policies, without a whole lot of guidance, it's clear that schools have irrationally overreacted. Exhibit A? The Columbus School Board's ""look-alike"" weapon definition upon which this principal apparently based the suspension: . ""Possessing, transmitting, or using any kind of firearm, knife, razor, club, chain or other look-alike or replica object or item which can be considered a weapon or used as a weapon."" First, a finger is not an ""object or item"" because it's not separate from your body -- unless you cut it off in shop class. Second, a finger cannot be ""considered a weapon"" nor can it be ""used as a weapon,"" unless you're Chuck Norris. Third, the policy is also pretty vague. Due process will render a law void for vagueness if its terms are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary intelligence can readily identify what it prohibits. After reading that policy, do you know for sure what you can and can't bring to school? Did you conclude after reading it that you could not bring your own finger? The school district doesn't burn a lot of calories considering the precarious constitutionality of these policies. This is because the school can just suspend first, and plan on parents and children not having the time or money to invest in litigation over their constitutional rights. School violence is indeed a real threat. On the other hand we must not let terror cause us to jettison common sense. A child's punishment should fit his or her crime. Kindergartners playing cops and robbers using their finger are not the same as disturbed teens with AR-15's on a campus rampage. School officials here are exercising discretion without oversight, and their snap decisions on imaginary weapons are affecting real futures. Even in instances where a school official is capable of common sense, these mandatory sentencing policies can strip away whatever discretion and mercy could have been applied in an individual case. Mandatory sentencing is increasingly being reconsidered as more harmful than beneficial. If we're rethinking it for our inmates, perhaps we should rethink it for the students -- ""cops"" and ""robbers"" alike.

"(CNN) -- A woman, her face a mask of concentration, hefts a huge sheet of translucent dough into the air as sunlight and steam fill the air. This atmospheric moment, captured in a village in Vietnam by British photographer Tessa Bunney, was awarded the prize for best food photography this week in a competition that attracted more than 6,000 images from around the world. The Pink Lady Food Photographer of the Year competition showcased dozens of entries that showed that some travel photos offer a feast for the stomach as well as the eyes. Among others shortlisted was another image from Vietnam by Australian photographer Tuan Nguyen, showing two women preparing food for the annual Tet feast celebrating lunar new year. Another, by Jonathan Gregson, showed steam rising as a worker roasts coffee beans in Rwanda -- a photograph you can almost smell as well as see. Bunney, who is based in Laos, picked up $8,400 for her noodle-making image. The photographer captured the image while spending six months living with a family in Hanoi as she documented ""craft villages"" -- centuries-old communities dedicated to the manufacture of one product, such as pottery or silk. Slash and burn landscapes . It shows a woman in the noodle-making center of Huu Tu, a village close to the center of the Vietnamese capital that Bunney says has become badly polluted due to industrialization, even though some still make the noodles by hand. ""The job she was doing was really repetitive, she did it day after day, for hours on end,"" she told CNN. "" Her mom was there feeding her rice as she worked so she didn't have to stop to eat -- so she could keep on going as long as possible. ""Every village was the same, they worked really long hours for not very much money."" Bunney said the mien noodles in the image were made from root flour which is formed on large hotplates into the heavy pancake seen in her photo. Before it dries completely, it is cut into strips -- just one of many ways in which noodles are made in the village. Bunney says her food photography comes from a wider interest in landscape documentation. ""I'm really interested in agriculture and the different landscapes that come from different farming methods. ""I'm living in Laos at the moment and there's been a lot of slash-and-burn farming for rice in the lowlands. I'm really interested in the details -- how the landscape makes people farm in different ways."" 'Politics of food' In Cairo, Italian photographer Sandro Maddalena visited the trash piles of the Egyptian capital's Garbage City -- a slum settlement where mainly Coptic Christians subsist by recycling refuse. His image, which shows dirt-blackened pigs in a sty surrounded by garbage, was presented a ""politics of food"" award for showing the realities of food production. ""The competition was intensely fierce,"" said Andy Macdonald, managing director of competition sponsor Coregeo, a UK-based produce brand marketing company. ""There were 6,000 images entered internationally and the standard was phenomenal. ""Tessa's image stood out from the rest, however, for its beautiful composition, the expression of utter absorption on its subject's face, and the capture of a perfect moment in time as the noodle dough flies through the air.""","Images of from around the word celebrated in Pink Lady food photography awards .

"(CNN) -- It worked in 2005 with David Beckham, the impassioned pleas of London school children and the promise that an Olympic Games in the British capital would ""Inspire a Generation."" It worked -- four years later -- with the prospect of a historic Games in South America when Rio de Janeiro convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of Brazil's suitably to host the world's greatest sporting event. So on Saturday, what will representatives from Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo come up with to convince IOC members in Buenos Aires that their city should be handed the right to host the 2020 Summer Games? ""Being chosen as a host city is a gold medal,"" Mike Lee, a veteran of three successful Olympic bid campaigns, told CNN. ""Not all cities can host them, not all countries have the economic strength to be able to do it."" Lee is something of an Olympic king-maker. It began when he was appointed the director of communications and public affairs for London's ultimately successful 2012 bid, before he set up his own strategic communications company Vero in 2006. Since then, Vero has contributed to the success of Rio de Janeiro's bid to host the 2016 Olympics and Pyeongchang's winning campaign for the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. Vero's list of accomplishments also includes advising on Rugby Sevens' election into the 2016 Games and a significant contribution to Qatar's bid to host the 2022 football World Cup. ""We're very proud of our record,"" Lee said before jetting off to Buenos Aires, where he hopes to see the World Squash Federation -- another Vero client -- successfully lobby for the inclusion of their sport in the 2020 Games. ""There's a danger with cities that they say they need the Games, but that's not the question. ""The question is why do the Games need your city? What can you bring to the Games, Olympic sport, the Olympic movement? How can you make it different? Rio's Olympic village is delicious eye candy . ""Ultimately that is what we would call a narrative that will allow you to bring your story to life."" Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo will all be desperate for their cities to write the 2020 chapter of the Olympic tale. Each location will hope to tell its own compelling story. The Spanish capital of Madrid is proposing a Games on a comparatively modest budget of $2 billion, with the aim of stimulating the economy of a country still wrestling with a financial crisis that has gone on for several years. Istanbul, with a reported mega-budget of $20 billion, is tantalizingly positioned across two vast markets in Asia and Europe. And then there is Tokyo's futuristic pitch epitomized by plans for a space-age Olympic Stadium and the promise of a first ""downtown Games."" So what factors will woo over 100 voting IOC members? ""Every bid is different,"" said Lee. ""I think we set a new benchmark in modern campaigning with London 2012. ""The focus was very much on inspiring young people, reconnecting Olympic sport with the next generation. That was a theme with London right from the beginning. ""With Rio it was a focus on a Games of transformation and celebration. Rio was ready, investment in the city would be very significant and also bringing the Games to South America for the first time. ""Pyeongchang, South Korea was the gateway to the Asian market, Asian fans and the next generation of Winter Olympic competitors. South Korea was the platform to do that."" However, each city's Olympic fairytale must first address concerns over their readiness to stage the Games. Spain's financial situation remains precarious, while Tokyo's bid team is facing questions and growing concerns over the radiation leak at the Fukushima nuclear plant. Anti-government protests swept through the streets of Istanbul in June and July, with tear gas and water cannons used by the police to halt demonstrators. Against the backdrop of political and financial unrest, campaigning for the right to hold a sporting event must strike a delicate balance. While the rewards and prestige of hosting the Olympics are enormous -- it is safe to say the legacy of staging the Games can breathe new life into a country -- there are plenty of dangers. ""You've got to bid for the event that's right for your city or your country at that time,"" said Lee. ""Cities shouldn't come into a race without understanding the scale of what is involved. Just bidding is an expensive exercise. ""I'm certainly not one who believes more major cities should be bidding for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. They are a massive commitment and a golden prize. ""As London showed, they can be a major boost to a city and to the image and brand of a country. They can make a different to the landscape."" In the final hours before Saturday's vote, Lee urges the bidding cities to hone their narrative to strike the right chord. After all, the chance to stage an Olympic Games arrives just once in a generation. ""You need to be able to show that technically you're good, but also you've got a real edge and story which makes you an attractive option for the IOC,"" he explained. ""Ultimately, it is clear cities are interested in bidding and we have three strong cities in the 2020 race. ""Already cities are lining up for the 2022 Winter Games and even the 2024 Summer Games. It is clear there is interest across the globe in hosting an Olympic Games.""","Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo vying for the right to host 2020 Olympic Games .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Fireworks, athletes and pageantry on a scale never before seen in the Olympics opened the Summer Games in Beijing on Friday as the Asian nation kicked off the biggest and most scrutinized Games in history. Fans celebrate the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, on Friday. Chinese President Hu Jintao declared the Olympics officially open, retired Chinese gymnastics champion Li Ning was carried through the air to light the Olympic cauldron, and pyrotechnics exploded throughout Beijing as the crowd of 91,000 at National Stadium cheered wildly. It was a stunning display from the nation of 1.3 billion people. Some media observers believe that the Opening Ceremony may be the most-watched television event in history. IOC President Jacques Rogge spoke of China's long-held ambition to host the Olympics. ""Tonight, that dream comes true,"" he said. Rogge mentioned the Sichuan earthquake, saying the world was moved ""by the great courage and solidarity of the Chinese people."" Emotion was high, as Friday's Opening Ceremony not only officially started the Summer Games but was a symbolic expression of a nation seeking its place as a global superpower.  Watch the excitement in Beijing as the ceremony begins » . The ceremony began at 8 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) on the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008 -- in a country where eight is the luckiest number. The opening was an artistic mix of performance and light depicting China's 5,000 years of history. Fireworks shot off across the Chinese capital as thousands of drummers, acrobats, martial artists and dancers performed under a light display at the National Stadium. Children representing each of the 56 ethnic groups in China marched out into the stadium, called the ""Bird's Nest"" because of its notable appearance. Dancers merged with objects that depicted China's ancient Silk Road, its Great Wall and ancient imperial past. Acrobats swirled around a giant sphere, depicting China's ambitions in space.  Watch why the Olympics mean so much for the Chinese » . Delegations from Afghanistan, Taiwan, North Korea and the United States were welcomed by huge cheers. But the loudest roars were saved for the Chinese participants. Waves of emotion greeted China's delegation as it entered National Stadium, led by flag bearer and basketball superstar Yao Ming. U.S. President Bush was joined by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and more than 100 heads of state, heads of government and sovereigns expected to attend, the International Olympic Committee said. The joy in Beijing was countered by grave news in Europe. As the Opening Ceremony was under way, Georgia's president said that his country was under attack by Russian tanks and warplanes. While in Beijing, Bush and Putin met to discuss the conflict. Earlier Friday, the anticipation over the Beijing Olympics was unmistakable in China's capital city. Thousands were on hand early at Beijing's Tiananmen Square to witness the traditional flag-raising ceremony by soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Blog: Anticipation was at fever pitch . This version of the Olympics brings with it controversy, discord that began in 2001 when the 2008 Games were awarded to Beijing. Criticism over China's policies on human rights for its citizens, its policies in Tibet and the persistent pollution across the country have been the focus of much international scrutiny and media attention.  Watch protests in Germany over China's Tibet policies » . For some world leaders, the decision to attend was a tough call. French President Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to boycott the Games because of human rights abuses in Tibet but later changed his mind. ""It's inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye,""  Hu said recently, ""so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect."" Political leaders do not attend Olympic opening ceremonies as a matter of protocol -- Bush is the first American president to attend them outside the United States -- but China seemed determined to have as many there as possible. ""They want those leaders to confirm the fact that China has returned to great power, prominence in the world,"" said David Zweig, a political analyst at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""They really want to say to the people of China that we, the Communist party of China, have done a great job.""  Watch why China has invested so much in the Olympics » .

"(CNN) -- In the U.S. Senate, where power extends from seniority and most politicians pride themselves on longevity, Daryl Chappelle has humbly outlasted them all. Retiring Thursday after 41 years, the Senate subway car operator has served longer than any current member of the Senate and all but two members of the House. Longevity that is hard to grasp . Chappelle came to the Senate, not long out of high school, in 1972. First a worker with the night labor division, he then moved into his second and final job as a subway driver/mechanic. Ever since, the 62-year-old's office has been a single swivel seat inside a small open-air jostling train cab. His task has been to carry senators back and forth from the Capitol to their office buildings. By one estimate, Chappelle has made the trip 130,000 times. The longevity is hard to grasp, from an era where many Americans expected to work in a single place for 30 or 40 years. The Watergate scandal. The Cold War. The Clinton era. September 11th. Chappelle has worked in the Capitol during every historic event the nation has seen since the time of Richard Nixon. When he began, the Berlin Wall was barely a decade old and Afghanistan still had a king. And in all that time, Chappelle never once stepped onto the Senate floor. Until Thursday. 41 years, then first steps onto the Senate floor . ""That was incredible,"" the bespectacled man beamed as he told CNN about the trip two floors above the subway, into the much more majestic Senate chamber. ""That was really special. I don't know how else to describe it. Incredible,"" he said. Top leaders from the Republican and Democratic parties took to the floor to recognize Chappelle, the man who had almost no power except for what he was able to do with the few minutes American leaders sat on his train. What he did was smile. ""He has a smile the covers his whole face,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a tribute on the Senate floor. That smile has made Chappelle a bit of a legend in the echoing, sterile Capitol Hill halls. He wears it for the crankiest of politicians and on the longest of overnight sessions. ""He's the happiest guy you ever met,"" followed Reid's adversary, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. ""He has a genius for lifting people's spirits."" McConnell relayed the story of one of his staffers who on her first, nervous day on the Hill, asked Chappelle for directions. The subway operator gave them to the young woman and then, McConnell recounted, he said something simple that she never forgot in the overstressed workplace: ""Everything will be alright."" Lines outside his subway car . The job of subway driver is monotonous. Shuttling back and forth, back and forth, underground for the one-to-two-block distance between buildings. Responding to a buzzer that senators can sound when they are in a particular hurry. It is the kind of job and Chappelle is the kind of worker that both parties talk about in vague rhetoric all the time. But Thursday, Chappelle took in very specific congratulations from the powerful and nearly-powerful all day long. Small lines formed as senators, staffers and visitors stood by his subway car to shake his hand and offer goodbye hugs. Dozens of reporters signed a card for him. (Disclosure: including this reporter.) ""Congress may not have a high approval rating these days,"" McConnell said as Chappelle sat in the chamber listening, ""but nobody who ever has had the pleasure of riding Daryl's train can leave without feeling a little bit better about this place.""","There is a small subway service that runs under the Capitol .

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN) -- For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him. Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital. He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life. ""There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,"" Georges Bwelle said. ""We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money."" Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get. ""It's not easy,"" Bwelle said. ""You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first. There (are) a lot of patients. ... Some people can die because they are waiting."" The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002. In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people. And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it. Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private. ""The only problem they have is poverty,"" Bwelle said. ""And with poverty, they ... cannot enjoy their life."" Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it. He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital. And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care. Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need. Their luck doesn't always hold out: They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once. But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer. In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun. The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients. ""We are receiving 500 people in each trip,"" Bwelle said. ""They are coming from 60 kilometers (37 miles) around the village, and they're coming on foot."" Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care. Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford. In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia. Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person. With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning. It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated. ""They are beating drums all the night to (keep us) awake and continue our work,"" Bwelle said. On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work. The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help. One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again. ""This will change my future with my family,"" the man said. In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde. It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations. ""I'm not sure when he sleeps,"" said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group. ""He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns."" For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home. ""We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,"" O'Malley said. ""That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student."" The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies. But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle. ""He's a hero, without a doubt,"" O'Malley said. ""He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting."" For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship. Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy. ""I am so happy when I am doing this work,"" Bwelle said. ""And I think about my father. I hope he sees what I am doing. ""To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this."" Want to get involved?

"Beijing (CNN) -- Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city. After unsuccessfully demanding a meeting with the Malaysian ambassador at their hotel for more than eight hours, angry relatives pushed past police officers who tried to stop them from making a midnight march across the Chinese capital. Their destination: the Malaysian Embassy. ""The ambassador kept saying he would come but he never showed,"" an elderly man told CNN as he and scores of others walked quietly through Beijing's streets. As has been the practice of many other Chinese passengers' next of kin, the man asked not to publish his name. ""They're lying. They're lying to us,"" the man repeated. ""And now we're going to the embassy. If they won't come to us, we'll go to them."" The surreal late-night procession was followed closely by police squad cars. Around midnight, more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit-in outside the embassy gates. Though vastly out-numbered by Chinese security forces, the family members continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning. They remained camped out by the diplomatic mission more than 15 hours later. Periodically, they chanted ""Fulfill your commitments! No more delays! No more lies!"" Throughout the sit-in, no Malaysian diplomat came out to meet with protesters. The demonstrators finally dispersed peacefully before sunset on Friday, after camping out by the diplomatic mission for more than 17 hours. The small gathering departed after delivering a letter of protest to the embassy demanding an explanation for how the prime minister of Malaysia has concluded that the plane ended its flight over the Indian Ocean. Broken promises . For weeks, distraught next of kin have requested face-to-face meetings with Malaysian officials. They are demanding a briefing on details of the last moments before Flight 370 was believed to have disappeared over the Indian Ocean. In the absence of information from Malaysian authorities, many relatives continue to believe their missing loved ones are still alive. On several occasions within the last two weeks, Malaysian officials in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur publicly pledged to meet the Chinese families within a matter of 24 hours, but then failed to show up for talks. ""We just want them to stop breaking their promises again and again,"" said Steven Wang, a spokesman for the families, whose mother went missing when the Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8. He spoke to CNN in a ""journalist's area"" located out of sight of the Malaysian Embassy protest. Even at the early hour of 1 a.m. on Friday, Chinese police had cordoned off an area for media around the corner from the sit-in. During the day, security forces continued to prevent journalists from reaching the families. Public protests are extremely rare in China. The Malaysia Airlines crisis, which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 Chinese nationals who were on board the plane, has put Chinese authorities in an uncomfortable position. The Chinese government has tolerated -- but stopped far short of endorsing -- the political mobilization of the flight's next of kin. Families have organized committees, issued press releases, and printed t-shirts and hats with the slogan ""Pray for MH370."" But they have also been largely prevented from organizing public displays outside the windowless hotel conference room that serves as the families' improvised headquarters. On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to ""express their appeals in a legal and rational way"" while pledging to give them further assistance. He urged the Malaysian authorities to ""actively"" pursue the investigation.
