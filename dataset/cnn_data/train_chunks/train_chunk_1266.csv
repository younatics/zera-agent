"Cancer deaths are soaring in parts of the UK with the highest obesity levels, new figures have revealed. In pockets of the country where vast swathes of the population are overweight, rates of the disease are rocketing. It comes as it emerged the mounting obesity crisis is costing the UK economy a staggering £47 billion each year - the same as smoking and war and terrorism. Campaigners warned today if drastic action is not taken to stem the rising tide of obese and overweight people, cancer will continue to claim more and more lives. Scroll down for video . Cancer deaths are soaring in parts of the UK with the highest obesity rates. Copeland in Cumbria recorded the largest increase in death rates linked to the disease over a 10-year period, rising 30 per cent. Three quarters of the population in the Cumbrian borough are overweight or obese - a UK high . For both men and women the first and second most common forms of cancer leading to death were cancers of the digestive organs,  the respiratory and intrathoracic organs. For women the fourth most common form was breast cancer, pictured under the microscope, while for men it was testicular, prostate and penile . Obesity is measured using the body mass index (BMI) score which is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. Anything under 25 is fine. BMI of 25 to 29.9 is classified as overweight and clinical obesity is defined as 30 or greater. New figures published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, found cancer continues to kill more people under the age of 75 than any other disease. For every 100,000 people in England aged 74 and younger, 142 died from cancer in 2013, compared to 166 in 2003. Of the 326 local authority areas included in the report, the death rate from cancer among the under-75s fell in 298 areas, and rose in 246. The largest increase in cancer death rates was in Copeland, Cumbria, where three quarters of the population are obese or overweight - a UK high. There the death rate rose by 30 per cent in a decade, from 149.3 to 193.3 per 100,000 residents from 2003 to 2013. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told the Sun: 'This is a real wake-up call and proof that being fat can kill. 'Bad diet and being overweight means you are more likely to die of many cancers.' People living in Salford face the greatest risk of dying from cancer, with death rates at 201 per 100,000 of the population. Blackpool and Manchester rank second and third with rates at 196. Gosport - where 72.9 per cent of the population are obese - came fourth with 195. Meanwhile, those people living in Hart (95), West Oxfordshire (95), Spelthorne (96) and North Dorset (97) faced the lowest risk. • 6,451 women under 75 died from cancers of the digestive organs in 2013, a 10.2 per cent rise from 5,856 in 2003 . • 6,497 women under 75 died from cancers of respiratory and intrathoracic organs in 2013, an increase of 15.7 per cent on 5,617 in 2003 . • 5,810 women under 75 died from breast cancer in 2013, a 13.3 per cent fall from 5,037 in 2003 . • 10,948 men under 75 died from cancers of the digestive organs in 2013, an increase of 3.0 per cent from the 10,630 deaths in 2003 . • 8,677 men under 75 died from cancers of respiratory and intrathoracic organs in 2013, a 7.0 per cent fall from 9,330 deaths in 2003 . • 2,381 men died from cancers of the genital organs in 2013, a 9.7 per cent fall from 2,636 in 2003 . Spelthorne in the South West recorded the largest fall in the death rate over the decade of 39.1 per cent. For both men and women the first and second most common forms of cancer leading to death were cancers of the digestive organs, the disease of the respiratory and intrathoracic organs. North East (68% are overweight or obese) North West 66% . West Midlands 65.7% . East Midlands 65.6% . Yorkshire and the Humber 65.4% . East of England 65.1% . South East 63.1% . South West 62.7% . London 57.3% . For men the third most common form of the disease was cancers of the genital organs - testicular, prostate and penile cancers - while for women it was breast cancer. HSCIC chair Kingsley Manning said: 'As the report shows, cancer kills more people under 75 than any other cause and so most of us will have been touched in some way by this. 'So many people will take a keen interest in these statistics and the story they tell about the overall drop across the country and the different pictures in local areas.' A report published yesterday by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) found the spiralling obesity epidemic costs the UK economy £47 billion each year. It found the burden of treating and caring for those who are overweight or obese has the second largest impact after smoking. They predict a series of 44 interventions could bring 20 per cent of overweight or obese people in the UK back to normal weight within five to 10 years. It would save around £16 billion a year in UK, including an annual saving of about £766 million in the NHS, according to the study. It comes as a report by the McKinsey Global Institute found obesity costs the UK economy a staggering £47 billion each year - the same as war and terrorism, and just a shade less than smoking . The study found the UK Government's efforts to tackle obesity were 'too fragmented to be effective', while investment in obesity prevention was 'relatively low given the scale of the problem.' The UK spends less than £638 million a year on obesity prevention programmes - about 1 per cent of the country's social cost of obesity, researchers said. But the country spends about £6 billion a year on the medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese and a further £10 billion on diabetes. Meanwhile, the cost of obesity and diabetes to the NHS is equivalent to the UK's combined 'protection' budget for the police and fire services, law courts, and prisons. The current rate of obesity and overweight conditions suggest the cost to the NHS could increase from between £6 billion and £8 billion in 2015 to between £10 billion and £12 billion in 2030, the study found. MGI director Richard Dobbs said: 'Efforts to address obesity have been piecemeal up till now. 'Yet obesity is a systemic issue, born of many interlocking factors, and only a systemic response will do.'","New figures show death rates have increased 30% in Copeland over 10-year period - where 75% of the population are overweight or obese .

"Findings: Overall, a third of those identifying as LGBT are non white, the Gallup report said following a survey of 121,000 people . Poorer blacks and Asians are more likely to be gay than wealthier whites, a controversial study claimed yesterday. A Gallup survey – said to be the largest of its kind ever undertaken in America – estimated that 3.4 per cent of US adults saw themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). That figure consisted of 4.6 per cent of African-Americans, 4.3 per cent of Asians, 4 per cent of Hispanics – but only 3.2 per cent of whites. In contrast to earlier, smaller studies, researchers also found that Americans with the lowest levels of education were most likely to say they were gay. A similar pattern was found in wealth, with more than 5 per cent of those with annual incomes of under £15,000 identified as gay compared with 2.8 per cent earning more than £37,000 a year. And while 21 per cent of American adults earn more than £56,000 a year, only 16 per cent of gay people claimed to earn that much. The survey – based on interviews with more than 121,000 people – contradicts the perception that lesbians and gays are mostly white, urban and affluent, said lead author Gary Gates. ‘Contemporary media often think of LGBT people as disproportionately white, male, urban and pretty wealthy,’ said Mr Gates of the University of California, Los Angeles. ‘But this data reveals that relative to the general population, the LGBT population has a larger proportion of non-white people and clearly is not overly wealthy.’ The survey revealed a slight gender difference – 3.6 per cent of women identified themselves as lesbian or gay, compared with 3.3 per cent of men.This discrepancy was particularly marked among younger adults, aged 18 to 29, where 8.3 per cent of women said they were LGBT compared with only 4.6 per cent of men. Findings: The Gallup survey, released this week, . was based on interviews with more then 121,000 people, and showed that . 3.4 per cent of adults fell into the LGBT category in America . The results show that fewer white people said they were LGBT while 4.6 per cent of black people ticked 'Yes' The survey also found that geography didn't really make a difference to whether people were LGBT . The survey noted that it could not account for those not admitting their sexual preference. Very little research has been done into which races are more likely to be homosexual. Estimates of the proportion of the population who are lesbian or gay range from 2 per cent to 10 per cent, although recent US surveys have put it at around 4 per cent. In 2010, a survey by the Office for National Statistics concluded that 1.5 per cent of Britons identified themselves as gay or bisexual, although a 2008 poll put the proportion at 6 per cent. Survey: Seventy one per cent of LGBT registered . voters support President Barack Obama in this year's election, and 22 . per cent support Republican challenger Mitt Romney .","Gallup survey, .

"The kissing congressman has been dumped. Voters comprehensively rejected Republican candidate Vance McAllister's bid for re-election to the U.S. House of Represenatives on Tuesday - going against a tide of conservative wins across the country. The married father of five came to national prominence in April when he was caught on video sharing and kiss and a cuddle with a staff member who was also married - to one of his best and oldest friends. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage showed Mr McAllister stealing a kiss from a staffer at his office in Monroe, Louisiana on 23 December 2013. She worked as his district scheduler - and was the wife of a childhood friend . Mr McAllister, a staunch conservative who had campaigned on Christian values, publicly apologised for his indiscretion and asked for forgiveness. As the mid-term elections approached, Republican leaders called on Mr McAllister to resign. He initially said he would not stand for re-election but then changed his mind, saying in June 'the people should decide whether or not I continue to represent them.' The people's decision on that question a resounding 'no' on Tuesday. Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, was named as the woman caught in a clinch with Mr McAllister, a Republican Congressman for Louisiana . McAllister failed to win enough votes to reach a run-off ballot between a Republican and Democratic candidate on December 6,The Hill reported. Mr McAllister's campaign for re-election included a bizarre ad in which he appeared with his wife, Kelly, and they both studiously avoid mentioning his indiscretion while praising a man who 'owns up to his mistakes.' Mr McAllister was captured on video in a passionate embrace with a woman later identified as Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, who worked in his office as a scheduler. Mrs Peacock's husband, Heath, was a longtime friend of Mr McAllister and the two couples had spent many hours together. The two man grew up a few miles from each other and graduated from the same high school in 1990. The two men later worked together at an oil and gas company in Houston, Texas. The Peacock's donated $10,000 to Mr McAllister's first campaign. Mr Peacock was devastated by the revelation of his friend and wife's affair, and said at the time his life was ruined and he and his wife were 'headed for divorce.' Mr McAllister initially said he would not stand for re-election but changed his mind saying 'voters should decide'. They resoundingly decided against returning him to Congress in Tuesday's mid-term elections . Mr McAllister lost the support of the Republican party over his indiscretion, and then the support of voters in his Louisiana constituency in the mid-term elections on Tuesday . Mr McAllister's rejection went against the tide of support for Republican candidates at the mid-terms. The Republicans delivered a humiliating defeat to President Barack Obama's Democrats across the country, securing a majority in the Senate and numerous state governor's positions in the landslide win.","Vance McAllister's loss went against tide of Republican mid-term victories .

"Revealed here are stunning images of the microscopic world that would normally be invisible to the naked eye. More than 80 winners from around the world were awarded prizes for excellence in photomicrography in Nikon's 40th annual Small World competition. First prize went to Rogelio Moreno, a computer programmer from Panama, for capturing a rarely seen image of the open mouth interior and heart-shaped corona of an aquatic creature, known as a rotifer. Pictured is the first place winner Rogelio Moreno from Panama showing the mouth interior and heart shaped corona of a rotifer. The amazing image is shot 'head on' and shows the mouth of the tiny aquatic animal, which is less than 0.004 inches (0.1mm) long . Moreno is a self-taught microscopist who began in 2009, and Nikon said his image 'serves to show just how close the beauty and wonder of the micro-world truly is'. The top ten was selected by the panel of judges based on artistic quality and masterful scientific technique. Rotifers are microscopic aquatic animals of the phylum Rotifera. They can be found in many freshwater environments and moist soil, where they live in thin films of water around soil particles. Their habitat may include still water environments like lakebeds in addition to flowing water environments like rivers and streams. Their bodies are soft save for their jaws, which are solid. They are multicellular and have specialised organ systems. The main winners were from Italy, the United States, Austria, Spain and Australia. The only British entry came from Dr Nils Lindstrom, who works in development biology at The Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, with his close-up photo of the kidneys. Eric Flem, Communications Manager for Nikon Instruments, said: 'Since the competition began 40 years ago, the calibre in quality and range of subject matter of the images, is matched only by the scientists and photographers who submit them. 'So much has changed in science and technology in the past 40 years, opening the door for more and more scientists and artists alike to capture and share their stunning images with the world. 'A look at our gallery is like a time capsule of the advancements made in the last four decades and truly shows the legacy a Nikon Small World continues to build.' Mr Moreno said: 'When you see that movement, you fall in love. I thought - wow, that is amazing. 'I can't believe what I'm seeing. This is something very, very beautiful. 'I hope now it can inspire others as much as it has inspired me - to learn about science, to look closely and notice something truly amazing.' Noah Fram-Schwartz from Greenwich, Connecticut, US scooped third place with this image of the eyes of a jumping spider . Charles Krebs from Issaquah, Washington, came 13th with this image showing a rotifer actively feeding. Rotifers are microscopic aquatic animals of the phylum Rotifera.They can be found in many freshwater environments and moist soil, where they live in thin films of water around soil particles . Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells stained for actin (pink), mitochondria (green) and DNA (yellow) are seen in this image from Dr Muthugapatti Kandasamy from the University of Georgia, who came fifth overall . The award for 10th place went to Dr Paul Joseph Rigby from the University of Western Australia for this image showing a daisy petal with fungal infection and pollen grains . Dr Douglas Brumley from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology came sixth with this image showing the active fluid flow around Pocillopora damicornis, a type of 'stony coral' that has a hard exterior . Judges praised Moreno's shot of a rotifer caught open-mouthed and facing the camera for its exemplary technique. Capturing the perfect moment when the rotifer opened its mouth for the camera required extreme patience from Moreno, who watched for hours. With the rotifer in constant motion, he used the flash to freeze the movement as soon as the mouth opened. But that still left him with only a one- or two-second window to take the photo, and possibly only one shot to get it right. This is another photo by Rogelio Moreno, which came 17th. It shows Pleurotaenium ovatum (micro algae) in polarised light . Ninth place went to Meritxell Vendrell from Barcelona for this picture of a parsley (Petroselinum crispum) ovary fixed and stained to show lectins (red) and nuclei (blue) Another picture by Charles Krebs shows a close-up near the eye of a Chrysochroa buqueti, more commonly known as a jewel beetle . Douglas Moore from the University of Wisconsin took twelfth place with this picture of Montana Dryhead agate, a type of silica rock . This image of the appendages of a common brine shrimp was taken by Dr Igor Robert, who came eighth overall . As the 2014 winner, Moreno joins the ranks of 36 other photomicrographers, artists and scientists from all over the world who have taken the top prize. This year's competition received over 1,200 entries from more than 79 countries around the world. Nikon is hosting an online popular vote to select the best first-place winner from the past four decades. At the website visitors can select their choice to take the top spot. Second place went to Alessandro Da Mommio from Pisa, Italy for this image of Rhombohedral cleavage in a calcite crystal. Cleavage is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along their structural planes . Dr Nils Lindstrom from the Developmental Biology at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh took this image of three transgenic kidneys cultured together, showing colliding branching collecting duct systems . Dr Sabrina Kaul from the University of Vienna, Austria took 19th place with this image of the larval stage of an acorn worm . Seventh place went to Dennis Hinks from Cleveland, Ohio for this image showing the circuitry in a DVD reader . Jens Petersen MycoKey from Ebeltoft, Denmark came 18th for picturing Anagallis arvensis, a plant also known as scarlet pimpernel .","The winners of Nikon's 40th annual Small World competition have been announced .

"A student accused of funding terrorism in Syria walked free from court yesterday after she was cleared of trying to smuggle cash out of the UK in her knickers.

Msaad, whose model looks have earned her the nickname ‘jihottie’ on . social media sites, wept as she was cleared. The London Metropolitan . University human resources management undergraduate appeared during the . trial to be a most unlikely jihadi sympathiser. Nawal Msaad believed she may have targeted because of her race and religion. The part-time singer and student was held on remand for more than a month after her arrest, but maintained her innocence throughout. Posting on Facebook shortly after her release on bail, she wrote: 'I can't help but wonder if I had been called Natalie from Surrey whether the authorities would have pressed terrorism charges against me. 'I'd urge that we do not lose sight and go after British Muslims where the delicacy of the political climate means very little is needed to detain someone and charge them.' She added: 'Anyone out there who knows me will know I do not have any extremist views or support terrorism nor do I have any jihadist affiliations. 'I hate terrorism - I am a British Muslim and they make religion not look peaceful. 'We can all understand the importance of security within the current climate, however we need to be careful that we don't breed racial hatred as that is exactly what terrorists would want - to create divisions.'

Described . by those close to her as being ‘attracted like a moth to the flame of . publicity’, the would-be singer from Holloway, North London, posted a . video on YouTube, professionally recorded in a studio weeks before her . trial, of her performing a Jennifer Lopez song. Yesterday . she said: ‘The last eight months have been surreal, now I just want to . get my life back.

Msaad met Wahabi, who is also of Moroccan descent, when they were . pupils at Holland Park School in West London and the pair remained . close. She told jurors she was ‘stitched up’ by her friend who promised . her £790 to take the 20,000 euros to Turkey in January. Wahabi told her the cash, in 500-euro notes, was to pay a deposit on a house in Turkey and fund a beauty therapy business there. 'Stitched up': Nawal Msaad, 27, left, was today cleared of funding terrorism despite being caught with 20,000 euros handed to her by friend Amal El-Wahabi, 27, right, who was found guilty of the same charge . Extremist: The cash was for El-Wahabi's husband Aine Davis, a convicted drug dealer and Muslim-convert believed to be fighting with ISIS forces in Syria . Posed up: El Wahabi wanted the cash for her husband Aine Davis, who was known as Hamza and had joined fighters in war-torn Syria . But . in reality, the hairdresser was preparing to join her 30-year-old . drug-dealing husband Aine Davis on his terrorist crusade, taking their . two infant sons with her. Wahabi, . was described by her own barrister as a ‘foul-mouthed, phone addicted, . weed-smoking kaffir’ collapsed, screaming, ‘No, I can’t breathe’ as she . was convicted of funding terrorism. She claimed she thought her husband, whom she met at a West London mosque when she was 19, was helping an aid convoy in Syria. But . police found extremist videos sent by Davis, a former Tube driver with . drug and firearm convictions. Friends: Miss Msaad agreed to take the cash for her friend El-Wahabi but had believed that it was a deposit for a property in Turkey . Anger: Nawal Msaad, pictured leaning on a car, believed she may have targeted because of her race and religion and was held for a month in custody after he arrest . Outraged: After she was cleared Miss Msaad, left and right, said she should never have been charged . He also sent a message featuring the flag . of terrorist group ISIS, with the slogan: ‘Allah prefers the Mujahadeen . over those who remain behind.’ Wahabi responded: ‘Be beside you until . the day you die.’ Police . found photographs on Wahabi’s phone of Davis posing with an AK-47 along . with other fighters.

"The Premier League's love affair with Ed Sheeran shows no sign of abating after Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney was caught duetting with the singer-songwriter. Sheeran was seen riffing with the England captain at an after-party following a gig in Manchester - one which Robin van Persie also rocked up to. Rooney was sat on stage in a nearby pub alongside the 23-year-old, head wobbling as he tried to keep pace with Lego House in front of a roomful of revellers at the Sir Ralph Abercromby pub near Deansgate. VIDEO Watch England striker Wayne Rooney singing alongside Ed Sheeran . Wayne Rooney and singer Ed Sheeran pose for a picture after the singer's show in Manchester . Manchester United striker Rooney sat down as Sheeran strummed his guitar to the tune of Lego House . Rooney was all smiles as he entertained fans at an after-party following Sheeran's sell-out gig in Manchester . The Sir Ralph Abercromby in central Manchester was the venue for Rooney's impromptu gig . Onlookers can be heard urging on the frontman as he sang with Sheeran following a 15,000 sell-out gig. The phenomenon surrounding Sheeran has taken on a mind of its own in the past fortnight. Mark Clattenburg was dropped from the top-flight's list of officials at the weekend after breaking protocol and travelling to a concert in Newcastle days before. The referee drove alone to take charge of West Brom's home game against Crystal Palace on October 25 - a move engineered in order to see the award winner perform at the Metro Radio Arena. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has also seen Sheeran perform recently. Mark Clattenburg was in hot water for breaking protocol in order to attend a Sheeran gig last month . Clattenburg drove alone to West Brom v Crystal Palace at the weekend so he could see Sheeran perform . Dutch striker Robin van Persie tweeted this picture of Sheeran's concert from his place in the crowd . Rooney's got previous for singing in public - pictured here in a Barbados night club three years ago . But Rooney - who made no secret of the fact he'd kept company with the star last week - took it one step further, entertaining those around him with his rendition. One punter told The Sun: 'Everyone was singing along and laughing but he showed he can take a joke. 'It was like a normal group of mates messing about in a pub but I'd definitely advise him not give up the day job.' Wayne Rooney isn't the only Premier League star who has been showing off his musical talent over the past few days. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech posted a video to his YouTube account playing along to the Foo Fighters song 'Walk'. Cech has previously performed at a music festival in the Czech Republic, and says he has considered a career as a musician once he hangs up his gloves. Pub landlord Mike Christodoulou said: 'Ed pulled out his guitar and him and Wayne had a little sing-song — it was good vibes all round.' Rooney missed three games through suspension but returned as United lost 1-0 to derby rivals City. Sunday’s defeat left Louis van Gaal’s side in 10th place in the table after their worst start to a season since 1986. Rooney's return to action ended on a low note as Sergio Aguero scored Manchester City's winner at the Etihad . This was far from being Rooney's first gig, having been filmed doing karaoke in the past. In 2011 he did a seven-song set while on holiday with his wife and children in Barbados. He belted out Queen hit We Are The Champions and Yesterday by The Beatles after asking people for requests. He later tweeted: 'Having a great night in Barbados! In lexys piano bar with ColeenRoo and friends. Been on the mic for about 7 songs and felt like a rock star'. Rooney, who celebrated his birthday days, had remained in Manchester while wife Coleen and their two sons, Kai, two, and 17-month old Klay, enjoyed a half-term break in Barbados.

"The number of people in the UK infected with HIV has reached an all-time high, new figures show. Nearly 110,000 are living with the condition, but around a quarter are unaware they have it. They are therefore at risk of passing on the virus to others through unprotected sex, experts warn. The figures, from Public Health England (PHE), have been released ahead of National HIV Testing Week. Nearly 110,000 people in the UK are living with HIV, but around a quarter are unaware they have it, experts have warned ahead of National HIV Testing Week . They show that overall, more people are being diagnosed earlier. The proportion of people diagnosed with a late stage of HIV infection fell from 57 per cent in 2004 to 42 per cent in 2013. Meanwhile, around six per cent of gay and bisexual men are now living with HIV. This rises to 13 per cent in London - meaning that one in eight sexually active gay men now has the condition. In 2013, 3,250 men were newly diagnosed - an all-time annual high. It is estimated that over 7,000 gay men have an HIV infection that remains undiagnosed and that an estimated 2,800 men acquired HIV in 2013. Doctors say these figures highlight the need to increase both the numbers and frequency of HIV tests, which is critical to tackling the ongoing high levels of HIV transmission. In a statement, Public Health England (PHE) said: 'While the large majority of black Africans do not have the HIV infection, the report also draws attention to the fact that one-third of the 40,000 black African heterosexual men and women living with HIV in the UK do not know they have HIV.' Dr Valerie Delpech, head of PHE's national HIV surveillance, said: 'We can’t overstate the importance of testing for HIV to ensure an early diagnosis. Early diagnosis of HIV enables better treatment outcomes and reduces the risk of onward transmission. To get a test... Go to an open access STI clinic (some clinics in large cities are offering ‘fast-track’ HIV testing) or go to a community testing site. Ask your GP for an HIV test – nowadays there is no need for lengthy discussion about the test, it just involves having blood taken, or even a finger prick. Ask online for a self-sampling kit. 'People diagnosed promptly with HIV infection can expect to live long and healthy lives. 'However in 2013, people diagnosed with HIV late were 10 times more likely to die in the first year of diagnosis compared to those diagnosed promptly. 'People who remain unaware of their infection are also at risk of transmitting HIV to others. 'Knowing HIV status is the key to both effective treatment, and to preventing onward transmission'. As a result, PHE is encouraging people most at risk to take an HIV test. This includes gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and black Africans in particular. Professor Noel Gill, head of the HIV & STI department, said: 'Used correctly and consistently, condoms remain an inexpensive and effective way to prevent HIV. 'We are also now seeing important and exciting data on ways to use antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV.' PHE has also issued advice on safer sexual behaviour to reduce the risk of HIV. Around six per cent of gay and bisexual men are now living with HIV (the infection is pictured) Get tested regularly for HIV if you are one of those most-at-risk: . * Men who have sex with men are advised to have an HIV and STI screen at least annually, and every three months if having unprotected sex with new or casual partners. * Black African men and women are advised to have an HIV test and a regular HIV and STI screen if having unprotected sex with new or casual partners. * Always use a condom correctly and consistently, and until all partners have had a sexual health screen. *Reduce the number of sexual partners and avoid overlapping sexual relationships. * Unprotected sex with partners believed to be of the same HIV status (serosorting) is unsafe. For the HIV positive, there is a high risk of acquiring other STIs and hepatitis. For the HIV negative, there is a high risk of HIV transmission as well as of acquiring STIs and hepatitis.","Nearly 110,000 people in the UK are now living with the condition .

"A builder has been ordered to pay a policeman £400 in compensation after he posted a doctored photograph on Facebook which featured two penises drawn onto the officer . Jordan Barrack secretly took a photograph of PC Charles Harris while he was being interviewed at Sleaford Police Station, in Lincolnshire. He was asked to attend a voluntary interview on August 21 last year after he witnessed a drunken brawl the night before. Builder Jordan Barrack (left) has been ordered to pay a police officer £400 compensation after he posted a doctored photograph of him (right) on to Facebook . The 20-year-old was so frustrated at being left waiting for two hours he took a picture of PC Harris when he took his statement. Later that day Barrack used Photoshop to draw two penises on the officer before uploading the image to Facebook and Snapchat. He was arrested after the image was shared by more than 1,700 people and passed to Lincolnshire Police. Barrack was arrested and pleaded guilty to posting a grossly offensive, obscene picture on a social media site at Lincoln Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He was ordered to pay £400 in compensation to PC Harris as well as £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. The builder also received a 12-month community order with 40 hours of unpaid work. Barrack (pictured) was arrested and pleaded guilty to posting a grossly offensive, obscene picture on a social media site at Lincoln Magistrates Court on Tuesday . Prosecutor Daniel Pietryka told the court: 'On August 21 at Sleaford Police Station he posted a picture on Snapchat and Facebook of PC Harris who had been interviewing Barrack at the station. 'Without the officers knowledge he took a photo and adapted the image by drawing two penises on the officer’s face. 'The image was visible on his Facebook profile and had been seen on Snapchat.' Defending himself in court, Barrack, who lives with his parents in Ruskington, Lincolnshire, said: 'I am terribly sorry and it was a massive mistake and I shouldn’t have done it. 'Please send my apologies to the officer. If I was to see them again I would apologise to them. 'It was a very expensive photograph and I won’t do it again.' Barrack (pictured) was ordered to pay £400 in compensation to PC Harris as well as £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge . The doctored photograph of the police officer was shown to magistrates in open court. Today Barrack’s mother Karen, 47, said: 'What Jordan did was stupid and he knows that but to be dragged to court and told to pay over £500 in fines and costs is a bit draconian. 'The reason he took the picture was because he was being forced to wait for hours to give an interview. 'He had been attacked by a drunken yob and the thug claimed Jordan had attacked him. Jordan was never charged with any offence and just wanted to come home. 'When he was arrested for taking the picture and putting it on the internet he was shocked, he thought it was joke at first. 'Surely the courts have got better things to do than arrest people for doing what is no more than a schoolboy prank.' Barrack today said a court official told him he had only been prosecuted because the victim of his prank was a police officer. He said: 'I was massively shocked at the fine. At first they said I had to do 40 hours of community service which I thought was okay and I was happy with that. 'Then they said I had to pay £85 court fees and £60 victim surcharge which I was expecting. 'But then they said the compensation for the distress of the police was £400 and I couldn’t believe it.' He went on to say: 'The amount of calls police get saying so and so has uploaded a nasty picture and they do nothing about it must be huge. 'A woman in the court said because it was a police officer they had to do something about it. It’s ridiculous. 'One of my mates got abused and assaulted and he only got £100 compensation. 'People have come up to me and said they can’t believe it got to court and said it was a waste of taxpayers’ money.' Barrack said he took the picture after getting fed up of waiting for over two hours to give officers an account of a bar brawl he had witnessed. He said: 'I was waiting for ages. They told me to turn about at 9.30pm after I had been at work all day and had work the next morning. 'But I didn’t leave until after midnight. I was doing them a favour as a voluntary witness. 'He (the police officer) was writing things down and I just sat there bored out of my head so got my phone out and thought I would be a bit cocky and did it. 'I thought nothing would come of it.' He went on to say: 'They confiscated my phone at the time and I still haven’t got it back over five months later even though the case is finished now.'","Jordan Barrack took the picture of Charles Harris while being interviewed .

"Killed by police: Witnesses say Michael Brown was shot repeatedly by a white police officer in his home town of Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday afternoon . Computer hackers' collective Anonymous says it will find out and publish the name of the policeman who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Missouri. The warning comes after the group earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the handling of protests following the killing of Michael Brown. Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night. Despite calls for calm, officers fired teargas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area last night. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer. As police tried to put the area on lockdown, messages posted on a newly established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appears to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated. 'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient. 'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.' A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated. 'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.' There has been anger from Mr Brown's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son. Speaking out through the media last night, Lesley McSpadden, Mr Brown's mother, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.' Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures. In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'. 'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests. 'That's not a threat, it is a promise.' In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.' 'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.' There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective. The websites for Ferguson City Police and Missouri State Highway Patrol were still online when MailOnline checked this morning. Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request. No justice, no peace: Michael'sparents, Michael Brown Sr., left, and Lesley McSpadden, right, stand next to civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton in St Louis as they call for the name of the officer who shot their son . The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Mr Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car 'to where it almost hit us.' The officer, Mr Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it 'ricocheted' back. Mr Johnson said the officer reached through the window, 'grabbed my friend around the neck' and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then pulled out his gun and said, '""I'll shoot you' or ""I'm going to shoot"",' Mr Johnson said. When the officer opened fire, Mr Brown was hit, said Mr Johnson, who hid behind a car. Mr Brown began running, Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the officer pursued Mr Brown and fired again. When Mr Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Mr Johnson said. Mr Brown had just graduated from high school and was set to begin university this autumn.","Hackers' collective also warns of online attacks on police departments .

"It is one of the most unique catches ever hauled aboard a fishing boat. In Antarctica's remote Ross Sea, a crew has hauled up a creature with tentacles like fire hoses and eyes like dinner plates from a mile below the surface. Capt. John Bennett and his crew were stunned to see a colossal squid weighing 350 kilograms (770 pounds), and as long as a minibus. Watch scientists examine the colossal squid below . In this Dec. 2013 photo provided by a crew member of the boat San Aspring of New Zealand fishing company Sanford, Capt. John Bennett shows a colossal squid he and and his crew caught on the boat in Antarctica's remote Ross Sea. The colossal squid is thought to extend up to 4-5 metres (13-16 feet) from tip to tentacle and weigh up to 500 kilograms. Its relation, the giant squid, can grow a lot longer but is much more spindly. This specimen, like other octopus and squid species, has three hearts—one to pump blood around the body and two for its gills (lungs)—and is estimated to be about 3.5 metres in length. One of the sea's most elusive species, it had been frozen for eight months until today, when scientists in New Zealand got a long-anticipated chance to thaw out the animal and inspect it — once they used a forklift to maneuver it into a tank. The squid is a female, and its eight arms are each well over a meter (3.3 feet) long. Its two tentacles would have been perhaps double that length if they had not been damaged. Kat Bolstad, a squid scientist from the Auckland University of Technology who was leading a team examining the creature, described it as 'very big, very beautiful.' 'This is essentially an intact specimen, which is almost an unparalleled opportunity for us to examine,' she said. 'This is a spectacular opportunity.' Only the second intact specimen ever found was carrying eggs when discovered in the Antarctic. 'We were excited to find that out... as it turns out this one is a female, and it has got some eggs,' Bolstad told reporters. 'This was by far the most perfect colossal squid that I have seen.' The squid is a female, and its eight arms are each well over a meter (3.3 feet) long.Its two tentacles would have been perhaps double that length if they had not been damaged . Scientist Kat Bolstad, left, from the Auckland University of Technology, and student Aaron Boyd Evans examine a beak of a colossal squid. About 142,000 people from 180 countries watched streaming footage of the squid examination on the Internet. Colossal squid sometimes inhabit the world of fiction and imagination, but have rarely been seen in daylight. Remarkably, Bennett and his crew on the San Aspiring toothfish boat have caught two of them. Their first, hauled in seven years ago, is on display in New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa. The tentacles of a colossal squid sit on the surface of the water as it is defrosted at Te Papa labs in Wellington on September 16, 2014. Bennett said there was so much excitement about his previous catch, he thought he had better save the latest one for research. 'It was partly alive, it was still hanging onto the fish,' Bennett recalls. 'Just a big bulk in the water. They're huge, and the mantle's all filled with water. It's quite an awesome sight.' Susan Waugh, a senior curator at Te Papa, said scientists hope to find out more about where the creature fits in the food chain, how much genetic variation there is among different squid types, and basic facts about how the colossal squid lives and dies. She said scientists plan to further assess the condition of the squid before determining whether to preserve it for public display. Bolstad said it's possible that ancient sightings of the species gave rise to tales of the kraken, or giant sea-monster squid. She said sperm whales often eat colossal squid and are known to play with their food, and sailors may have mistaken that for epic battles. 'On the other hand, we don't really know what the grog rations were like at that time at sea, either,' she said. 'So it may be that we've got a bit of a fisherman's story going on there, too.'

I didn't know what I was going to do with a snake that large.' Animal control was called into help with the officer showing up with a ten-gallon bucket - but the officers finally decided that the only way to contain the snake was in a trash can. The snake, which appeared to be around five years old and in healthy condition, was initially taken to a rescue facility but it has since been returned to its owner. Police have refused to release the owner's identity because he did nothing wrong, they say.

"The African-American teenager shot dead by a white policeman in a killing which sparked riots in St. Louis posted a haunting message on Facebook just days before he died. Michael Brown wrote in a Facebook message: 'If I leave this earth today, at least you'll know I care about others more than I cared about my damn self.' Friends told MailOnline that the message was 'typical' of Michael and that he was selfless and always willing to help others. Scroll down for videos .

Michael is pictured right in his graduation photograph . He was a 'gentle giant' - timid and quiet yet 6ft 4 tall and 300lbs - raising the possibility that the cop who killed him may have been intimidated by his size. But to those around him, there was nothing in his nature that was violent. Monday would have been Michael's first day at college in the first step towards his dream of one day opening his own business. But all those hopes were dashed in one confrontation on a street in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri on Saturday with a white policeman. The killing was the spark that ignited long-running tensions with the police department and set off three nights of rioting, looting and the protests of an entire community demanding justice. Family and friends have complained that amid the rage, tear gas and street battles, their son is being forgotten. Michael’s mother Lesley McSpadden and father, Michael Sr, are divorced but in their grief their love for their son has reunited them. The case has now drawn the attention of President Obama who said in a statement that it was 'heartbreaking'. After being shown the message Lesley nodded her head approvingly. Standing outside of her mother’s home, where Michael was walking to when he was shot dead, Lesley told MailOnline: 'We are going to make a lot of noise about this. This isn’t going away'. Her determination is all too apparent: on the back window of her car she has written: 'Justice for my son' in white paint. Pastor Charles Ewing, who helped raise . Michael and was his uncle, told MailOnline that the teenager had wanted . to be a heating and cooling engineer because it would be a 'good job . with a good wage'. He said: 'People said to him that because he was so big he should play football in college but he was too timid. 'He . received Jesus into his life about two weeks ago. It was something that . his grandmother had been talking to him about for some time. It was with her church. I was so elated - at least he has that now'. Pastor Ewing said that on the night that Michael was killed he was wearing flip flops, a t-shirt, shorts and a hat. He said: 'There was no chance he was going to be able to run off'.

To become a success from such humble roots would have required an admirable determination on Michael's part - but it seems he was up to the task. He attended Normandy High School where a former classmate told MailOnline that he was quiet and did not talk much but stayed out of trouble. He also had a great sense of humour and was always going to make something of his life, friends said. Hershel Johnson, who knew Michael since middle school, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch: 'We were at graduation, me and him, and we were talking. He said he wasn’t going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education. He was going to make his life a whole a lot better.' Violence: A demonstrator stands amid clouds of tear gas as police fired canisters to break up agitated crowds on Monday night . Tear . gas: Protesters met police with their arms raised on Monday night after . witnesses said that teenager Michael Brown had approached a police . officer in the same way on Saturday before he was shot dead . Justice: Michael's mother Lesley McSpadden with husband, Louis Head, during a rally at the St. Mark Family Church on Tuesday night . As a freshman Michael was in Junior ROTC and whilst he was a sophomore he played football. He switched to McCluer High School in nearby Ferguson-Florissant and then returned to Normandy for his senior year. There he put in the hours in a credit recovery programme which meant he could graduate in May instead of going to summer school or repeating a year. Relatives said he did it for his mother out of respect and love for her. Friend Gerard Fuller told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael was not like his other friends and that he did not want to become a basketball or football player. The two bonded over their love of rap and Gerard recalled how Michael used to listen to Tupac on his headphones - recently he had tried some rapping of his own under the name 'Big Mike' and his videos posted on Facebook had been a hit among friends. Michael's graduation day was on May 22 and a picture taken then shows him smiling in his green gown after being given his diploma. It would have been one of the proudest days of his life, and that of his parents. Friend Raquan Smith said: 'After that was done and people were leaving, I remember seeing him off to the side. He kind of just came up to me and said: ""We made it"". '""Yeah man, we made it"", I told him. It was a breath of fresh air to know someone else shared the struggle in school. And now we were starting a whole new life.' Other family members have described Michael as a 'sharer' and a 'giver' who would give away candy in middle school that he was selling. While Michael should have been starting at Vatterott College, a local trade school, and his friends are leaving for colleges elsewhere his family are planning his funeral. Pictures posted on Michael’s Facebook page show he adored his family and a number of photos show him holding a baby girl, thought to be his niece. Michael’s aunt Elizabeth Spivey has said: 'He wasn't a violent person. He was peaceful. He was a gentle giant. He looked like he could really do something but he wouldn't.' The most heartbreaking interviews however come from Lesley and Michael Sr. She has described her son as a 'big teddy bear' and said that Michael was 'the type of person that everybody flocked to'. Devastated: . Desuirea Harris, the grandmother of Michael Brown, sits in a chair as . she is comforted by others outside Jennings Mason Temple Church . Determined: Ms McSpadden, who has written the above phrase on her car, told MailOnline that: 'We are going to make a lot of noise about this. This isn’t going away' Lesley, 34, told USA Today: 'He wanted to be really good in visual arts and heating and cooling. He was really good with his hands and taking things apart and putting them back together. He was almost like a healer. 'He fixed things. He didn't create problems. He fixed things. My son was sweet. He didn't mean any harm to anybody.' Michael Sr has broken down in tears and has called for calm, adding that his son would not have wanted violence after his death. He has said: 'He wouldn’t have wanted none of that. We're going to do it the right way. But we need justice for our son'.","Friends said the post was 'typical' of Michael Brown, 18, shot dead by a police officer in St Louis, Missouri, on Saturday .

"Shakespeare is renowned for his enormous vocabulary as well as his introduction of new words to the English language - but can any modern-day writers compete with his literary skills? A New York data scientist not only proved that there are indeed contemporary lyricists that can give the playwright a run for his money, he has also discovered that they come from an unexpected source - hip hop. By comparing the works of Shakespeare with 85 different hip-hop artists, he found 37-year-old Californian rapper Aesop Rock - who used 7,392 unique words in his first 35,000 lyrics - has a wider vocabulary than the 16th century poet. Click the image below to explore the interactive graphic . Earlier this week, New York-based data scientist Matt Daniels analysed the first 35,000 lyrics of 85 hip-hop and rap artists and compared the number of unique words to those used in the first 35,000 words of Shakespeare's plays and Herman Melville's Moby Dick. In top spot was Aesop Rock who used 7,392 unique words, highlighted, while DMX sat at the opposite end of the scale with 3,214 unique words . 1. Aseop Rock: 7,392 unique words . 2. GZA: 6,426 unique words . 3. Kool Keith: 6,238 unique words . 4. Herman Melville: 6,022 unique words . 5. Canibus: 5,991 unique words . 6. CunninLynguists: 5,971 unique words . 7. RZA: 5,905 unique words . 8. Wu-Tang Clan: 5,985 unique words . 9. Roots: 5,803 unique words . 10. Ghostface Killah: 5,774 unique words . 11. Killah Priest: 5,737 unique words . 12. Blackalicious: 5,480 unique words . 13. Kool G Rap: 5,394 unique words . 13. Redman: 5,331 unique words . 14: E-40: 5,207 unique words . 15. MF Doom: 5,204 unique words . 16. Outkast: 5,212 unique words . 17. Shakespeare: 5,170 unique words . 18. Nas: 5,096 unique words . 19. Beastie Boys: 5,090 unique words . 20. Das EFX: 5,005 unique words . By comparison, Shakespeare used 5,170 unique words, putting his vocabulary alongside Beastie Boys and Outkast, while Moby Dick author Herman Melville scored 6,022, only beaten by Kool Keith, GZA and Aesop Rock. ‘Literary elites love to rep Shakespeare’s vocabulary: across his entire corpus, he uses 28,829 words, suggesting he knew over 100,000 words and arguably had the largest vocabulary, ever,' explained Matt Daniels from Undercurrent in New York. ‘I decided to compare this data point against the most famous artists in hip hop. I used each artist’s first 35,000 lyrics. That way, prolific artists, such as Jay-Z, could be compared to newer artists, such as Drake. Daniels analysed the first 5,000 words for seven of Shakespeare's works including Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Macbeth, As You Like It, Winter's Tale, and Troilus and Cressida. While for Melville, he studied the first 35,000 words used in his 1851 novel Moby Dick. All lyrics were taken from website Rap Genius, but Daniels only used lyrics current to 2012. As a result, he said this lack of recent data prevented him using a number of more recent artists such as Kid Cudi. He also admitted a few other high-profile rappers didn’t have enough official material to be included, for example, Biggie and Kendrick Lamar. According to Daniels, 35,000 lyrics is . the equivalent of between three and five studios albums, but because not . all artists have released that number of tracks, he included mixtapes. He then used a methodology called . token analysis, also known as lexical analysis which involves using a . computer to turn words into tokens that can be analysed and counted. As . Daniels explained, each word was counted once, so pimps, pimp, pimping, . and pimpin are four unique words. To avoid issues with apostrophes, for . example, pimpin’ versus pimpin, Daniels removed these from the dataset. ‘It still isn’t perfect. Hip hop is full of slang that is hard to transcribe, for example, shorty . vs. shawty, featured vocalists, and repetitive choruses.’ But he adds it’s still interesting and reveals a wide range. Aesop Rock was well-above every artist in the dataset, while the presence of Wu Tang Clan at number seven, excluding Herman Melville, was also significant. This . is because, as well as being in the top ten as a group, individual . members also feature in the top 20 with GZA at number two, Ghostface . Killah at nine and Raekwon and Method Man at 19 and 20 respectively. Daniels analysed the first 5,000 words for seven . of Shakespeare's works, illustration pictured left, including Hamlet, . Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Macbeth, As You Like It, Winter's Tale, and . Troilus and Cressida. While for Herman Melville, pictured right, he . studied the first 35,000 words used in his 1851 novel Moby Dick. Shakespeare used 5,170 unique words putting his vocabulary alongside . Beastie Boys and Outkast, and Melville scored 6,022, only beaten by Kool . Keith, GZA and Aesop Rock . In top spot on the chart was 37-year-old Californian rapper Aesop Rock, also known as Ian Matthias Bavits, pictured left, who used 7,392 unique words in his first 35,000 lyrics. While Earl Simmons, known as DMX, pictured right holding the award for Male Entertainer of the Year at the Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles, sat at the opposite end of the scale with 3,214 unique words . ‘Perhaps their countless hours of studio time together exposed each rapper’s vocabulary to one another,’ explained Daniels. To . further understand each rapper's vocabulary in Wu-Tang's first five . albums, Daniels selected a 3,500-word threshold to put each member was . on an equal footing. ‘U-God . and GZA clearly bolster the group’s average,’ said Daniel. 'Raekwon and . Method Man’s contributions have a lower average compared to other . members, but recognise that their data points would exceed most artists . in hip hop.’ Wu-Tang Clan made the top ten, but individual members also made the top 20. GZA is at number two, Ghostface Killah is at nine and Raekwon and Method Man at 19 and 20. To further understand each rapper's vocabulary in Wu-Tang's first five albums, Daniels selected a 3,500-word threshold, pictured. 'U-God and GZA clearly bolster the group's average,' said Daniel. 'Raekwon and Method Man's contributions have a lower average, but their data points exceed most artists in hip hop' Wu-Tang Clan perform at Pimlico Racetrack in Baltimore. From left to right, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, and Inspectah Deck. To explain the group's large vocabulary, Daniels said: 'Perhaps their countless hours of studio time together exposed each rapper's vocabulary to one another' Daniels also looked at where the . rappers were from, to see if there was a vocabulary divide between . southern, midwest, west and east coast states. The south had the lowest average at 4,268, while the east-coast, including 50 Cent and Fat Joe, scored highest with 4,804. Only . four of the 17 southern-based artists in the dataset were above . average, including Outkast, as Daniels explained: ‘At 15, Outkast’s deep . vocabulary is definitely a function of their style: frequent use of . portmanteau, such as ATLiens, Stankonia, southern drawl, including . nahmsayin, ery’day, and made-up slang, for example, flawsky-wawsky. 'My guess is that this is a function of crunk music's call-and-response style, resulting in more repetition of words.’ Daniels also looked at where the rappers were from to see if there was a vocabulary divide between southern, midwest, west and east coast states. The south had the lowest average at 4,268, while the east-coast, including 50 Cent and Fat Joe, scored highest with 4,804. Only four of the 17 southern-based artists in the dataset were above average, including Outkast . Daniels also discovered some of the biggest names in hip hop scored below the average. These included 2Pac on 3,790 words, Snoop Dogg on 3,974, Kanye on 3,982 and Lil Wayne on 3,743, pictured. Popular artist Drake scored 3,522. While Jay Z scored marginally higher than Nelly with 4,506 compared to 4,413 respectively . Meanwhile, Daniels discovered some of the biggest names in hip hop scored poorly and well below the average. These included 2Pac on 3,790 words, Snoop Dogg on 3,974 and Drake on 3,522.

"Outspoken: CariDee English says TV executives only selected Strauss because of her volatile personality . A former America's Next Top Model winner has slammed TV executives for exploiting one of the reality show's most vulnerable contestants. CariDee English, who won the modelling competition in 2006, has spoken out in support of fellow competitor Jael Strauss. Strauss, 28, has battled a life-threatening addiction to methamphetamine - also known as crystal meth - and been homeless in the five years since her 2007 appearance on the programme. The troubled former star opened up to . TV's Dr Phil McGraw about her problems recently, prompting other ANTM . contestants to come forward with their own well-wishes and opinions. Now English - who won a $100,000 CoverGirl Cosmetics contract and a deal with Elite Models after her 2003 triumph - says Strauss should never have been allowed to take part in the competition. '[Execs] should have evaluated her a lot . more before letting her on the show,' she said in the comments section of Gawker.com, in an article about the Strauss family's plea to Dr Phil to help Jael. 'All they saw was a personality good . for television. Well, this hopefully will save at least her life and . someone watching. Everything happens for a reason.' English says it is the fate of every . ANTM contestant to face terrible struggles in the fashion industry after . appearing on the show. She wrote: 'I love, love what I have made for myself since my win, but . mentally, it's horrific. And any girl who has been on ANTM can back me . up. 'No one wants to take us serious as models. Even though we just were named 'TOP,' our place in line at Fashion . World was at the bottom. 'The industry many times didn't care about our . name, but did turn a snobby cheek to the name ANTM.' But another former ANTM star - . plus-size winner Whitney Thompson, who triumphed in 2009 - has also blogged to say there is no point blaming . producers and executives for Strauss' demise. She wrote: 'There have been 211 . contestants on the show. Only one has an addiction to meth so far. Statistically speaking, Jael's problem is evident in . less than 1% of the contestants. 'Do I think that Tyra Banks . would give us this enormous responsibility if she didn't know we could . handle it? No.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Before and after: Jael Strauss, a former contestant on .

"Half a dozen piranhas have been pulled from a Midlands sewer after homeowners complained about a fishy smell. Workmen found the flesh-eating tropical fish in a drain leading to residents' homes in Telford, Shropshire, yesterday. By the time they were fished out all of them though, they were dead. One of the piranhas found by workmen who were unblocking a sewer in Madeley, Telford . Water bosses believe that someone had flushed the fish down the toilet when they got bored of keeping them as pets, and claimed they were the killer fish commonly found in South America and not any cold-water species. In a statement, Severn Trent Water said: 'It appears that a nearby resident had been disposing of dead fish, including piranhas, down the toilet and they had blocked the sewers' Severn Trent inspectors, Matt Final and Jay Slater, who were sent to investigate the Telford blockage said: 'We've certainly seen some weird things in the sewers over the years but we were a little shocked to remove piranhas. 'You wouldn't think a fish of this size would fit down a toilet, but this is just one example of amazing things we find blocking the sewers.' Locals now fear more of the fish - known for their razor sharp teeth, powerful jaws and a voracious appetite for meat - could still be alive in their sewerage system . IT worker Niall Poole,22, from Madeley, Shrops., said: 'We could have a real-life ‘Piranha 3D' in Telford on our hands, you never know. 'If they've found some piranhas, it is surely feasible that there could be more still alive down there.' Local butcher Jim Hoult, 56, added: 'I might well be checking beneath the toilets seat before I go to the loo now.' Barry Briggs has lived on New Road for five years and has a drain right outside his house. He was forced to call Environmental Health after the drain began to have a fishy whiff. (Stock picture) Piranhas are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat . Hungry for meat: A piranha fish in the wild. They are usually found in the Amazon and climes more tropical than the Midlands . Mr Briggs said: 'If someone called me . up and told me they found pirahnas in the drain last week, I would have . thought it was an April Fool's joke. 'As . long as they are all dead I don't mind, but I don't like the though of . the fish swimming around here- not when I have my pond in my garden.' Workmen . Matt Final and Jay Slater, who went to investigate the smelly sewers . for Severn Trent, said many of the fish were several inches long. Piranhas are omnivorous freshwater fish native to South American rivers, but they have also been spotted in Bangladesh and China. They are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat. The exact number of piranha species is unknown, as new species continue to be discovered, but estimates range from 30 to 60. Piranhas are normally 14cm to 26cm long, though some have been reported up to 43cm in length. Attacks in the Amazon basin have been on the increase in recent years. In 2011, a drunk 18-year-old man was attacked and killed in Rosario del Yata, Bolivia. In 2012, a five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of piranhas, while recurring attacks in Piaui in 2011 resulted in 100 people being injured. Piranha attacks peak in the dry season when there is less food and the water levels are lower. Fatalities are rare, with the majority of attacks taking the form of bites to the feet and hands. Splashing tends to make piranhas more likely to attack, explaining why children are often injured during mass attacks of these creatures. Mr Final said: 'We've certainly seen . some weird things in the sewers over the years but we were just a bit . shocked to remove piranhas. 'I wouldn't have thought a fish of this size would fit down a toilet. 'It . is just one example of amazing things we find blocking the sewers, but . there is a serious aspect to this as they had the potential to cause a . lot of damage.' It is the second time sewers have been . blocked in Shropshire this year by rubbish being pushed into toilets - . after workers found several pairs of knickers blocking the drains in . January. Severn Trent said . it was called to investigate the latest incident after people complained . of a fishy smell coming into their homes. Severn Trent today said blocked sewers are a serious issue. It said three-quarters of the 4,000 blockages in Shropshire last year were found to be caused by people misusing the sewer system. The problem costs Severn Trent more than £10 million per year clearing products and mess from its network. Sue Fulford, customer operations manager for Severn Trent, said: 'Having sewage flooding inside your home due to sewers being blocked is one of the most horrible things that can happen to you, and we don't want our customers to suffer in this way. 'The drains that take waste water away from your home are only a few inches wide and are only meant to take water, toilet roll and human waste - certainly not piranhas or pants. 'Toilet roll is meant to break down when it gets wet so it washes easily through the system. That's not the case with things like large tropical fish which can get stuck in smaller drains. 'These sewer blockages, if not identified and cleared, can lead to sewers backing up and overflowing into people's homes and gardens. 'And it's not necessarily the people who put the wrong things down the toilet that are affected. 'The blockage can happen further down the street, so what you do in your home can be causing a problem for your neighbours. 'We are spending millions of pounds every year sending teams into sewers with jetting equipment and sometimes even spades to dig out these blockages. 'We ask people to get themselves a bin in their bathroom and use that rather than the toilet.'","Predators found after residents complained about a fishy smell .

"A third night of violent protests flared up in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday as police in riot gear and armored trucks trained high-powered rifles on protesters. The demonstrations in the quiet suburb of St Louis were sparked by the police shooting of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown on Saturday night. Police revealed today that a woman had been shot in the head in an alleged drive-by shooting in Ferguson on Tuesday night while in a separate incident, a police officer reportedly shot an armed man.

Riot police in tactical gear with shields and high-powered rifles keep watch while demonstrators took to the streets on Tuesday in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis . It was unclear whether the shootings were connected to the protests, according to NBC reports. Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night. The teen, who was about to start college, was unarmed . According to WBNS, four men wearing ski masks and armed with shotguns believed to be staging a robbery were apprehended by officers. One suspect confronted an officer with a handgun. The officer, who feared for his life said a police spokesman, shot the armed subject. The alleged robber was taken to hospital in critical condition. In a separate incident, a woman was shot once in the head during a drive-by shooting, police reported. She was taken to hospital and is expected to live. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has established a no-fly zone over Ferguson after police said one of their helicopters was fired upon on multiple occasions. The ban will remain in place until Monday. Following a rally by civil rights leader Al Sharpton on Tuesday, crowds confronted police and refused orders to disperse. Police fired more tear gas on the protests but overall, the situation did not escalate as it had on previous nights. On Sunday and Monday nights, tensions have run high in Ferguson where crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted police. Riot officers dressed in tactical gear shot rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds at protesters who volleyed rocks in return. At a rally held by Reverend Sharpton on Tuesday night, the mother of Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden, demanded that the police officer who shot her son come forward. 'You take your punishment,' Lesley McSpadden said. 'If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.' Reverend Sharpton added: 'The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation.' Her plea comes as Ferguson police refused to name of the officer in question, citing death threats made on social media. An officer in the records department of the Ferguson Police headquarters told MailOnline today that their computers had been shut down because they had been hacked. The Ferguson Police Department released a statement on Wednesday mourning the loss of the 18-year-old and asking for peace in the community. It made no mention of the identity of the officer involved. The statement read: 'We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner. We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community. 'Unfortunately, . those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent . demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during . the evening hours. These events are no indicative of the City of . Ferguson and its residents.' Demonstrators flooded into the street following a rally over the death the teenager Michael Brown. When the crowd refused to disperse, the police deployed tear gas for the third night . Protesters block the street outside a rally being held at the St Mark Family Church in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday .

Michael Brown's parents, Michael Brown Sr, left, and Lesley McSpadden, right, stand next to the Reverend Al Sharpton on Tuesday at a rally . The police claim that the teenager assaulted the police officer in the street on Saturday and made a grab for his weapon. That claim is entirely refuted by Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was within feet of the entire incident. Mr Johnson, 22, said his friend fled from the officer after being shot once, held his hands up and shouted that he was unarmed. The officer then repeatedly fired shots at Brown, Mr Johnson said. Police admit that Brown was shot 'a couple of times' but could not give an exact number. Vigils have been planned across the U.S. on Thursday in response to recent alleged acts of police brutality including the killing of 18-year-old Brown. Organized by a movement called the National Moment Of Silence, vigils are being planned in 50 cities across 30 states. A group demonstrates  in the middle of the street outside the Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church after the conclusion of a gathering with Michael Brown's family and Rev. Al Sharpton on Tuesday . President Obama released a statement on Tuesday where he addressed the teen's shooting. He said: 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed. 'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. 'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.' Demonstrators protest the killing of teenager Michael Brown on Tuesday in Ferguson, Missouri. Racial tensions have run high after an unarmed black student was killed by a cop in the street on Saturday . The Ferguson Police Department released a statement on Wednesday following the shooting of Michael Brown four days ago. It read:'The City of Ferguson mourns the loss of Michael Brown's life that occurred this past Saturday. We understand members of our community and those nationwide, are grieving with us. We have worked diligently to provide an opportunity for our residents to both grieve and voice frustrations through prayer vigils and peaceful protests. 'We would like to extend our gratitude to the St Louis County Police Department, the St Louis City Police Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol and numerous local law enforcement agencies for their assistance over the past several days. These officers have worked throughout the night to quell violent outbursts and restore calm to our City. 'We are working to restore confidence in the safety of our community and our neighborhoods so that we may begin the healing process. We have heard the community's cries for justice and assure the public that the Ferguson Police Department will continue to cooperate fully in the investigations led by the St Louis County Police Department, the FBI and the Justice Department. 'We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner. We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community. 'Unfortunately, those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during the evening hours. These events are no indicative of the City of Ferguson and its residents. 'The City of Ferguson has been through tough situations in the past, albeit nothing to this magnitude, but will continue to display resilience and fortitude. The Mayor and City Council are committed to taking the necessary steps to rebuild and strengthen our community. We look forward to your cooperation and support.'","Police fired tear gas for a third night to break up demonstrators following a rally by civil rights leader Al Sharpton .

"The world's biggest indoor art installation has been unveiled in Germany by the artist who once wrapped the Reichstag in fabric. The 300ft high 'inflatable envelope', called Big Air Package, is the creation of contemporary artist Christo and is kept upright by fans blowing air into more than 20,000 square metres of translucent white polyester fabric. Visitors will enter the Gasometer exhibition space, a former natural gas holding tank, through airlocks and walk through the sculpture. The effect, says Christo, is to leave visitors 'virtually swimming in light'. Contemporary artist Christo has unveiled the world's biggest indoor installation in Oberhausen, Germany . Big Air Package - a 300ft high inflated fabric dome - fills the Gasometer in Oberhausen . The installation by the Bulgarian artist opens to the public today and will on show until December . The project is Christo's first since the death of his wife and collaborater Jeanne-Claude in 2009 . Wolfgang Volz, the artist's photographer and project manager, told reporters: 'It feels like being in a heavenly chamber.' The installation by the Bulgarian-born artist opened to the public today in Oberhausen, Germany, and will remain open until December 30 this year. Christo, born Christo Javacheff, is best known for wrapping everyday items such as bottles and chairs in sheets or tarpaulin. Big Air Package is his first project since the death of his wife and collaborator Jeanne-Claude in 2009. Together, the pair created spectacular public spectacles such as wrapping the German parliament building in Berlin in 100,000 square metres of fireproof polypropylene fabric in 1995. The display attracted five million visitors to the site after politicians gave permission for the stunt. The pair exhibited a wall made of 13,000 colored oil barrels at the Gasometer in 1999. Visitors lay on their backs to take photos of the vast balloon . Christo showed a visitor around the sculpture as he unveiled the work before it opened to the public today . Christo, 77, told reporters he is trying to finish more of the projects he and his wife Jeanne-Claude had planned before she died .

"Most people have a favourite list of songs they use to motivate themselves before a sports game or during a workout, but is there any science behind this idea? According to new research it turns out there is - music truly does make us feel powerful, but not all songs have the same effect. Researchers found some music empowers you to do great things, and levels of bass are a key factor in its effectiveness. Illinois based researchers have found music makes us feel powerful. They found certain songs could make people work and exercise harder (stock image shown) 'When watching major sports events, my coauthors and I frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room,' says Dr Dennis Hsu of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois. In previous research by the Music in Exercise and Sport Group at Brunel University in London and Spotify scientists analysed 6.7 million Spotify playlists containing the word ‘workout’ in the title to compare the different beats per minute (bpm) and compile the ultimate playlist. A person’s typical stride rate while jogging or running is 150 to 190 strides per minute. If these figures are halved it gives a range of 75 to 95 bpm - the beat range most commonly used in urban music, particularly rap. Whereas pop is perfect for slower, more repetitive-type tasks, including aerobic warm up and cool down because many pop songs 'have regular rhythmic patterns.' Dance music is best suited to strength and weight training because of its ‘fast, rhythmical, bass’. Whereas rock music should be avoid during cardio and high-intensity workouts because the different changes in tempo can affect a person’s rhythm. 'The ways these athletes immerse themselves in the music - some with their eyes steely shut and some gently nodded along the beats - seem as if the music is mentally preparing and toughening them up for the competition about to occur.' These observations got Dr Hsu and his colleagues curious as to whether music can truly transform the psychological state of the listener. Previous research has established that music can have positive effects on people, ranging from enhancing learning and motivation to reducing physical pain. However, no study until now has linked music to a sense of power, identifying not only the consequences but also a potential cause of this link. The research, published in  Social Psychological and Personality Science, first pre-tested 31 pieces of music from several genres, such as sports music, hip-hop, and reggae, to see how powerful participants felt listening to 30-second clips. From this pre-test, they identified the highest power and lowest power songs. Songs rated as powerful included Queen's 'We Will Rock You' and 2 Unlimited's 'Get Ready for This,' while songs rated lower in power included songs such as Fatboy Slim's 'Because We Can' and Baha Men's 'Who Let the Dogs Out.' The researchers found that the high-power music evoked a sense of power subconsciously and also generated three consequences of power - the ability to see the 'bigger picture', perceived control in social events and the desire to move first in competitive interactions. Importantly, the researchers also ruled out lyrics as the cause of the effects, separately asking people to rate how powerful the lyrics made them feel. 'Because participants did not report increased powerful feelings after reading the lyrics, we can rule out the semantic priming effect of lyrics in the selected songs,' Dr Hsu explains. Songs evoking a sense of power included Queen's 'We will rock you' (Queen shown at Wembley Stadium in London, 1986). High-power music was found to evoke a sense of power subconsciously . Dr Hsu's team also conducted separate experiments to look at one structural component of music that might explain the music-power effect: bass levels. 'We chose to manipulate bass levels in music because existing literature suggests that bass sound and voice are associated with dominance,' Dr Hsu says. They also observed that bass sound and voice are frequently utilised in popular culture to project perceptions of dominance and confidence. In the bass experiments, the researchers asked participants to listen to novel instrumental music pieces in which bass levels were digitally varied. In one experiment, they surveyed participants about their self-reported feelings of power, and in another, they asked them to perform a word-completion task designed to test implicit, or unconscious, feelings of power. They found that those who listened to the heavy-bass music reported more feelings of power and generated more power-related words in the implicit task than those listening to the low-bass music. The effects of the bass levels support one possible explanation for why music makes people feel more powerful: the 'contagion hypothesis.' The idea is that when people hear specific music components that express a sense of power, they mimic these feelings internally. 'When watching major sports events, my coauthors and I frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room,' says Dr Dennis Hsu of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois (stock image shown) However, the researchers also say a 'conditioning hypothesis' could account for some of the results. This suggests that certain pieces of music might trigger powerful experiences because these experiences are often paired with that particular music. For example, music used frequently at sports events may elicit powerful feelings because of the association with power, rewards, and winning - for example, Queen's 'We Are the Champions' is often played to celebrate victory. Dr Hsu and colleagues plan to further study other potential mechanisms through which music can induce power. They are also interested in exploring whether empowering music can lead to more desirable outcomes in contexts such as negotiations, employee performance, job interviews, marketing campaigns and social perceptions. 'People might want to explore whether pumping up their favorite tunes can quickly ease them into an empowered mental state before going into a first date, an important client meeting or a job interview,' says Dr Hsu.","Illinois based researchers have found music makes us feel powerful .

"United Airlines said on Thursday that it is notifying passengers who were on flights with a man later diagnosed with Ebola and telling them how to contact federal health officials. United said it is also telling passengers that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believe the man could not have spread the disease during the flights because he was not showing symptoms and was not yet contagious. On September 19, Thomas Eric Duncan flew from Liberia in the heart of western Africa's Ebola outbreak zone to Belgium on a Brussels Airlines flight, according to Belgian officials. Scroll down for video . United Airlines finally informed concerned passengers on Thursday that they had been traveling on flights with Thomas Duncan, the man who was diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. - but are not at risk . Thomas Duncan flew from Liberia to Brussels in Belgium to Washington, D.C., before finally arriving in Dallas on September 20 . United said it believes that Duncan flew the next day on United Flight 951 from Brussels to Dulles International Airport near Washington and connected to Flight 822 from Dulles to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. United officials declined to say how many passengers were on the flights. The Brussels-to-Dulles flight was on a Boeing 777 that has 266 seats, and the flight to Dallas used an Airbus A320 with 138 seats. In a statement, the airline said on Thursday that the two planes underwent their routine overnight 'thorough cleaning' after the flights, 'including cleaning of lavatories and galleys with heavy-duty all-purpose cleaners and wiping tray tables and armrests with disinfectant.' It added that 'we continue to clean and route the planes throughout our network as usual'. Duncan remained in a hospital isolation ward on Thursday. According to health officials, he became sick and went to a Dallas hospital on September 25, but was released, only to return by ambulance three days later and test positive for Ebola. The airline industry and its labor unions worked Thursday to tamp down travelers' fears about Ebola. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at United and other carriers, said airlines have the authority under U.S. law to deny boarding to passengers who appear ill. Thomas Eric Duncan took three flights to travel from Monrovia, Liberia to his final destination of Dallas, Texas on September 20 . On September 19, Thomas Eric Duncan flew from Monrovia Airport (pictured) in Liberia in the heart of western Africa's Ebola outbreak zone to Belgium on a Brussels Airlines flight . The union said it also had 'full confidence' in procedures to contain the Ebola outbreak, including checking passengers for fever - a key symptom - at airports in western Africa. Duncan did not have a fever when he left Liberia. But authorities there said Thursday that they will charge him with lying on a health-screening form he filled out at the airport for not disclosing that he had helped carry a woman who became ill and died of Ebola. The disease is believed to have sickened more than 7,100 people in West Africa and killed more than 3,000, according to the World Health Organization.","United told passengers that the CDC doesn't believe the man could have spread the disease on the  flights he took last month .

"Kentucky Senator Rand Paul cautioned on Wednesday that the government's health experts may not be as capable of containing Ebola as they're telling Americans. 'It's a big mistake to downplay and act as if ""oh, this is not a big deal, we can control all this."" This could get beyond our control,' Paul, who has an MD in optometry from Duke University, told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. 'I think because of political correctness we’re not really making sound, rational, scientific decisions on this,' he warned. Paul later claimed, 'we should not underestimate the transmissibility' of the virus, introducing doubt into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assertions that Ebola can only be passed on through bodily fluids. Scroll down for video . Sen. Rand Paul told a conservative radio show host on Wednesday that 'because of political correctness' he thinks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are trying to 'downplay' the transmissibility of the Ebola virus . Paul's comments came after a Liberian man who had traveled to the U.S. from Liberia on Sept. 20 to visit his family tested positive for Ebola over the weekend. The man, who has since been quarantined, was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Dallas, Texas, and is now believed to have come in contact with as many as 100 people, including five children, from the time he began showing symptoms to the moment doctors discovered he had Ebola. That number does not include persons who were on his transnational flights, as he was not yet exhibiting symptoms at the time of travel. It can take up to 21 days for a person who has contracted the deadly disease to begin showing symptoms, which often include fever, muscle pain, vomiting and bleeding. Panic has ensued in Texas since details emerged on Wednesday about the 42-year-old man's hospitalization. The Ebola patient was revealed on Wednesday to be Thomas Eric Duncan. A neighbor of his family told NBC that when he was helped into an ambulance, Duncan was 'throwing up all over the place.' Duncan reportedly contracted Ebola while helping family friends take their Ebola-stricken daughter to the hospital in a taxi on Sept. 15 in Monrovia, Liberia. The brother of woman also became infected with Ebola and died a few days later, according to the New York Times. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sought to restore calm to the situation yesterday, explaining that the U.S. has the medical infrastructure to treat Ebola victims, if necessary, in ways that will not 'pose a significant risk to other patients in the hospital, to the doctors and nurses who will be caring for that individual, and certainly doesn’t post a significant risk to the broader community.' He also attempted to debunk accusations like Paul's. Ebola does not spread as easily as the common cold, he assured reporters. The odds of an Ebola epidemic occurring in the U.S. are 'incredibly low.' 'Ebola is not easily transmitted. It isn’t transmitted through the air like the flu,' the White House spokesman said. 'It is not transmitted through water or food here in the United States. 'The only way that Ebola can be transmitted is through the bodily fluids of an individual who is already showing symptoms of being sick with Ebola,' he asserted, later noting that 'it is not possible to transmit Ebola through the air. 'You can't catch it through the air,' he again promised. Paul, who is a likely 2016 presidential candidate, expressed concern that health officials were glossing over just how contagious the disease is, however, in his radio interview the same day. 'My suspicion is that it's a lot more transmissible than that if people who are taking every precaution are getting it,' the Republican Senator said. 'There are people getting it who simply helped people get in or out of a taxicab,' he said, indirectly referring to Duncan. At another point in the interview, Paul mocked President Barack Obama's advice in 2009 that Americans could stop the spread of the H1N1 flu by coughing into their shirt sleeves instead of their hands. 'I can't believe that you don't think it's enough of a plan to prevent worldwide pandemic to cough into your elbow,' Paul told Ingraham, according to CBS News. 'If you just bring your elbow up to your mouth and cough into it, surely that will stop a worldwide pandemic.' Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who had traveled to the U.S. from Liberia on September 20 to visit family, has been quarantined at a Dallas hospital for Ebola after reportedly contracting the disease in Liberia while putting an infected family friend into a taxi and riding with her to the hospital . Already, the CDC has raised it's travel warning to the highest level possible - three- and warned Americans against travelling to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in order to avoid the possibility of accidentally contracting the infectious disease. The White House indicated on Wednesday that it has no intentions of placing new restrictions on travel to and from areas effected by the Ebola outbreak, however. Rather, the Obama administration 'has taken the step of recirculating our guidance' to law enforcement agencies, the airline industry and medical professionals 'to make sure that people are aware that there is an important protocol that should be implemented if an individual presents with symptoms that are consistent with Ebola,' Earnest said. The White House official reassured the press that Duncan was neither displaying nor experiencing symptoms or Ebola during his flight. 'So there’s nothing about this case that we know so far that would indicate any weakness or any flaws in [our border protection] system right now,' he insisted. But as another reporter pointed out minutes later, Earnest's comments suggested that the U.S. has not yet developed a way to effectively screen people who may have contracted Ebola before they reach America and their bodily fluids become toxic. And before this week, the CDC had claimed that it was unlikely that an infected traveler would bring Ebola to the U.S. That assurance has clearly proven to be inaccurate. Paul expressed concerns Wednesday that the troops President Barack Obama is sending to West Africa to help keep the peace in the Ebola hot spot could end up becoming carriers of the disease and beginning their own epidemic. 'You also have to be concerned about 3,000 soldiers getting back on a ship,' he said. 'Can you imagine if a whole ship full of our soldiers catch Ebola?'","'It's a big mistake to downplay and act as if ""oh, this is not a big deal, we can control all this,' "" Paul said Wednesday .

"A little lie and a lot of ibuprofen is all a contagious  Ebola patient would need to sneak out of Africa and into the United States, a public health watchdog warns. Nearly all of the screening that prevents people with the deadly disease from traveling the world is done in Ebola-stricken African nations by screeners at airports there. Before being allowed to board a plane, travelers in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are given temperature scans to check for fever and asked whether they have had contact with anyone who was sick with Ebola. It's a system that's far from fool-proof and is easy to defeat, Sean Kaufman, president of Behavioral-Based Improvement Solutions, a biosafety company based in Atlanta, says. Scroll down for video . Ibuprofen and a lie: A health watchdog points out that even someone contagious with Ebola in the early stages of the disease could get past screeners by taking fever reducers like ibuprofen (stock image left) and lying about their contact with Ebola patients like Thomas Eric Duncan  (right) appeared to do before entry to the U.S. 'The fever-screening instruments run low and aren't that accurate,' said Kaufman, an infection control specialist. 'And people can take ibuprofen to reduce their fever enough to pass screening, and why wouldn't they? If it will get them on a plane so they can come to the United States and get effective treatment after they're exposed to Ebola, wouldn't you do that to save your life?' On Thursday, Liberia said the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in the United States had lied on a questionnaire at the Monrovia airport about his exposure to an Ebola patient. He flew to Brussels and then Dulles airport outside Washington, D.C., before landing in Dallas on Sept. 20. The traveler, Thomas Eric Duncan, had no symptoms when he left Liberia, and fever scans there had shown a normal body temperature of 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, U.S. health officials said. He therefore could not have been identified through examination as carrying the Ebola virus. His arrival and hospitalization in Dallas have underscored how much U.S. authorities are relying on their counterparts in West African countries to screen passengers and contain the worst Ebola outbreak on record. Part of the screening burden rests on connecting airports. For example, Kaufman flew from Monrovia to Casablanca to London to Atlanta. He was fever-screened in Monrovia and Casablanca, but not London's Heathrow, he said, and not when he arrived in Atlanta. Thomas Eric Duncan was allowed into the United States after he came in close contact with a pregnant woman who died of Ebola . 'At Heathrow, there were no questions about where I had come from,' he said. 'I offered the information to the official in Atlanta, and he said, 'Thank you. Be safe.'' In August, experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began teaching airport workers in Monrovia and other cities in the Ebola zone to conduct screenings, CDC medical worker Tai Chen said in an interview. Ebola cases and deaths have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. The World Health Organization has put the death toll at 3,338 out of 7,178 cases since March. The CDC also worked with Liberian authorities to develop the questionnaire that was completed by Duncan: before travelers enter Roberts International Airport in Monrovia they are asked if they have had contact with anyone showing symptoms of Ebola. There are at least two other screening points before a passenger is allowed to board a plane, with trained airport personnel asking about exposure to Ebola in the previous 21 days and any symptoms including fever, severe headache, bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This process relies on an honor system, Chen said. Officials at the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security would not say if they are considering using hand-held fever detectors on passengers arriving at U.S. airports. But Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron said the agency 'will not hesitate to execute additional safety measures should it become necessary.' CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden cautioned on Thursday that a more restrictive approach to travel could make the Ebola outbreak harder to contain. 'The approach of isolating a country is going to make it harder to get help into that country,' he said. FEVER DETECTION . Virologist Heinz Feldmann of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has studied Ebola for years and helped develop an experimental Ebola vaccine. He told Science magazine in September that airport screeners in Monrovia, where he spent three weeks, 'Don't really know how to use the devices.' He said he saw screeners record temperatures of 32 degrees C (90 F), which is so low it 'is impossible for a living person.' Feldmann said in an email that according to his colleagues who have returned from Liberia in the last few days procedures for taking temperatures and doing clinical checks have improved. Since August, major U.S. airports that receive international flights have displayed signs alerting passengers to the presence of Ebola in West Africa and telling them to be on the look out for symptoms, said Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokeswoman Jennifer Evanitsky. On Wednesday, customs personnel began distributing information prepared by the CDC describing Ebola symptoms and noting, 'You were given this card because you arrived to the United States from a country with Ebola.' It tells travelers that if they were exposed to Ebola overseas, 'call your doctor even if you do not have symptoms.'","Public health watchdog says Ebola patients could use ibuprofen to lower their fevers so that they can pass through airport checkpoints .

"A Slovakian woman who wants her two grandsons to leave the UK and live with her in Eastern Europe has won the latest round of a legal fight. The Court of Appeal gave the woman - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - the go-ahead to challenge a ruling saying the boys should be adopted and stay in the UK. Appeal judge Lord Justice McFarlane said Slovakian government officials had 'expressed concern' about the approach a lower UK court had taken to the case. The Court of Appeal has given the go-ahead for a Slovakian woman who wants her two grandsons to leave the UK to challenge a ruling saying the boys should stay in the UK . Lord Justice McFarlane was told that the boys - aged four and three - were born in England to Slovakian parents. Social workers had intervened after one suffered a 'non-accidental' injury thought to have been caused by his father. Both parents had accepted that the children could not live with them, said Lord Justice McFarlane. Earlier this year a family court judge decided that the boys should be placed for adoption in England, not returned to Slovakia to live with their mother’s mother. Lord Justice McFarlane gave the grandmother permission to challenge the family court judge’s ruling, during an appeal court hearing in London. He said there was an 'arguable case' that the family court judge had 'fallen into error'. The grandmother is expected to outline her arguments in detail at a full appeal hearing in London later this year. Lord Justice McFarlane said the Slovakian government had raised concerns. 'They (the Slovakian government) expressed concern about the approach of the UK court in this case,' he said. 'They questioned whether the decision affords proper respect to the grandmother.' A few weeks ago an MP who campaigns for family law reform raised concerns about the 'forcible adoption' of Slovakian children living in England and Wales. Liberal Democrat John Hemming, who represents Birmingham Yardley, said Slovakian government officials were troubled by decisions made by judges hearing family court cases involving Slovak parents. Mr Hemming raised the issue in a parliamentary motion and said Slovakian officials had worries that there were cases where children had been adopted 'without sound reasons'. Mr Hemming said the Slovakian representative at the European Court of Human Rights had 'expressed a willingness to intervene in support of complaints made by Slovakian citizens about wrongful adoptions'. He thought that officials had concerns about 'possibly 30 children' and said he would raise the issue with UK Government ministers.","She wants the boys, who were born in England to Slovakian parents, to leave the UK .

"Israeli fighter jets have bombed warehouses they believed were holding military equipment used to launch chemical weapons.

Strike: The Israeli planes targeted a suspected chemical weapons site in Syria, according to US officials. An IDF F-16 is pictured . It followed days of heightened concerns that Syria might be using chemical weapons against opposition forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly warned in . recent weeks that Israel would be prepared to take military action if . chemical weapons or other arms were to reach Hezbollah. In January, an Israeli airstrike hit a convoy believed to be carrying advanced anti-aircraft weapons to Hezbollah. Earlier this week, Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan .

The statements did not mention possible strikes against Syria. An Israeli embassy spokesman in Washington declined to comment on the air strike. But he added: 'What we can say is that Israel is determined to prevent the transfer of chemical weapons or other game-changing weaponry by the Syrian regime to terrorists, especially to Hezbollah in Lebanon.' In 2007, Israeli jets bombed a . suspected nuclear reactor site along the Euphrates River in northeastern . Syria, an attack that embarrassed and jolted the Assad regime. It led . to a build-up of the Syrian air defense system with Russia providing the . hardware for the defense systems upgrade. It continues to be a reliable . supplier of military equipment to the Assad regime. The airstrike, first reported by CNN, . came hours before President Barack Obama  told a press conference in Costa Rica that did not expect the U.S. to send ground troops into Syria. He said: 'I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground, would not only be good for America but also would be good for Syria.' More than 70,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled the country as the Assad regime has fought rebels. Locator map of Israel, Lebanon and Syria . Dictator: Syria's President Bashar Assad delivers a speech at the parliament in Damascus, Syria. Israel is thought to have targeted chemical weapons belonging to his regime . Mr Obama has called evidence of the use of chemical weapons a 'game-changer' that would have 'enormous consequences'. The Israeli airstrikes are believed to be part of a cautious, step-by-step plan in Washington to rally support for an international momentum which supports the rebels in Syria. While the U.S. has been providing . non-lethal aid to opposition forces in Syria, stepping up support in . recent days, the Obama administration has resisted calls from some . American politicians to arm the rebels, or work to establish a no-fly . zone to aid the insurgency. Israel struck on the same day that reports of the most gruesome massacre filtered through to western media of ‘assassinations’ and ‘burning’ of bodies on a city near the port of Baniyas. Assad's regime was accused of committing a 'large-scale massacre' of up to 100 men, women and children with guns, knives and blunt objects.

"Michael Gove today sought to quash speculation that the Tories’ local election losses will trigger a challenge against David Cameron’s leadership. The Education Secretary said the idea of ousting the Prime Minister was ‘bonkerooney’ as defeated Tory councillors demanded change at the top. The Tories lost 335 seats in county and unitary council elections in England, and were pushed into third by Nigel Farage’s UKIP in the South Shields by-election. Education Secretary Michael Gove said it was 'barmy' to talk about ousting David Cameron as Tory leader . Conservative ministers moved to promise tougher policies on immigration and Europe in an attempt to steady the mood in the party. But some of the councillors who lost their seats at the hands of UKIP said there had to be fundamental change in the direction of the party. Tory Alexis McEvoy, who lost her seat in Hampshire, pinned the blame on the Prime Minister. 'Clearly the message was to the government. I hope the government will listen because they never do,' she told the BBC. 'They are arrogant, out of touch and because of them good councillors have now been lost.' Graham Marsh, a former Conservative councillor in Lincolnshire who also lost his seat said: ‘My rock-bed supporters were absolutely fed up by coalition policy.’ A Conservative MP told BBC Radiop 4: ‘It's time for a leadership election now.’ As news of Tory council election losses emerged, Mr Cameron was meeting scientists before opening the 'Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery' at Oxford University . Mr Cameron, who also visited The Batt School in his Witney constituency, was accused of running an 'out of touch' government by Tory members . But Mr Gove said no-one in the Tory party should think that removing Mr Cameron from Number 10 was the solution to the party’s problems. ‘I think that any of my colleagues who want to indulge in leadership speculation should spend the weekend reading the history books and consider if leadership speculation has ever helped any political party to enhance its position with the voters. ‘With great respect to anyone – actually, with no respect, it’s barmy. The idea of changing the leader is bonkeroony.’ He suggested that many UKIP voters return to the Tory fold when faced with the prospect of Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister in 2015. ‘At the next election it’s a straightforward choice between David Cameron and Ed Miliband. ‘The second thing is that those people who are voting for UKIP – and they have a number of concerns that we have to respectfully address - those people who are voting for UKIP are emphatically not people who at the next general election are likely to vote for Ed Miliband and they haven’t been persuaded by what passes for his analysis of our current problems. Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant said there had to be 'serious research' into why voters backed UKIP . ‘Given how poorly Labour have done today I think there’s every chance at the next general election that many of those who have voted for UKIP will support the Conservatives because faced with that choice between David Cameron and Ed Miliband, I think the majority of the people in the country will conclude that David Cameron is the right person to change Britain for the better.’ Ministers are preparing to use next week's Queen's Speech to set out new measures on welfare and immigration aimed at winning wooing voters who have switched to UKIP. New laws will be set out to curb benefits for immigrants, amid concern about the impact of the influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when movement restrictions are lifted next year. A Bill which will limit the right of immigrants to access benefits, the NHS and other public services will form a centrepiece of the coalition's programme. However, Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant said the party had to carry out ‘serious research’ into the message UKIP voters sent at the ballot box . He tweeted: ‘If nothing else, let us be polite to Ukip and their supporters, eh? ‘I hope there will be some serious research about exactly WHAT message UKIP voters are giving: none-of-the-above or specific issues.’ Mr Fabricant added ‘life cannot go on as normal’ for the main three parties ‘unless they have no ambition for 2015’. Conservative Robert Halfon tweeted: ‘We have 2years to communicate loudly that Conservatives are party which will have IN/OUT Referendum, vetoed EU Treaty & Cut EU Budget.’","Pressure mounts on Tory leadership after losing support to UKIP .

"A man has gone to drastic measures to do away with his headphones - by having small magnets implanted directly into his ears. Rich Lee, from Nevada, U.S., is a ‘bodyhacker’ or ‘grinder’ – a person who experiments with surgical implants. In his latest stunt, he embedded small magnets into his tragus – a small piece of cartilage just outside the ear – and built a coil to be worn around his neck. He claims that this creates a magnetic field that causes the implant to vibrate and make a sound. Scroll down for video . Body-enhancement enthusiast Rich Lee has done away with traditional headphones and implanted a small magnet headphone directly into his own ear. He wears a coil around his neck (pictured) which creates a magnetic field which causes the implant to vibrate and make a sound . To listen to music, Mr Lee has to plug his phone into a tiny amplifier which is connected to the coil around his neck to create a magnetic field.

To listen to music, Mr Lee has to plug his phone into a tiny amplifier which is connected to the coil around his neck to create a magnetic field.

This magnetic field causes the magnets in his ears to create sound which only he can hear. Mr Lee admits that the sound quality is not nearly as good as it would be using traditional headphones. However, he says there are numerous advantages – he can listen to music anytime, anywhere, and the implants are also invisible to the naked eye. Writing in the magazine Humanity+ Mr Lee said: ‘Having stuff like this done isn’t really the realm of doctors. ‘Most Grinders rely on body modification artists to install their implants. I’ve had work done by the body modification master Steve Haworth in the past and have relied on him for advice on several project ideas. ‘Steve instinctively knew the best way to go about the implantation in a way that would minimise chances for infection and would leave no scarring. The implant procedure itself went very smoothly and the pain was surprisingly minimal.’ He went on to explain that he had numerous plans for the use of the device. He hopes to hook it up to the GPS on his phone so that it can give him directions as he is walking around. He also intends to connect it to a directional microphone in a shirt button so that he can hear conversations across a room. Mr Lee also plans to link the implants up to an ultrasonic rangefinder so that it hums when he gets closer to an object. The implant is placed in his tragus (pictured) - the small piece of cartilage just outside the ear. He can listen to music through the implant but also hopes to connect it to GPS so it can give him directions . He believes that this would give him a sense of echolocation similar to that of a bat and he thinks that this invention could eventually be useful for people who are blind. Mr Lee says that this project is particularly important to him as he fears that he may lose his sight. He wrote: ‘Echolocation is something I want to start practicing with now because I might be legally blind soon. ‘I lost much of vision in my right eye overnight a few years back. I just woke up and couldn’t see well up close or far away. ‘My other eye has compensated for the vision loss but the doc says the good eye can go at any time and when it does it will be very rapid. I’ll lose my driver’s licence, won’t be able to read, and glasses won’t correct the problem. ‘So I figure learning to navigate with echolocation is a good thing to develop now, not that I’ve resigned myself to blindness or anything.’ Finally, Mr Lee says that he is considering connecting the device to a Geiger counter so that he can ‘experience the world of radiation’.

"She made her name starring in A Town Like Alice, but actress Virginia McKenna is still best known for the film Born Free. It told the true story of pioneering conservation work being carried out in Kenya by Joy Adamson (Virginia) and her husband George (played by her real-life husband Bill Travers), and their efforts to return lion cub Elsa to the wild. Virginia and Bill's experiences with the Adamsons and their growing concern for the plight of endangered African animals eventually led them in 1984 to establish the Born Free charity. Pride of Africa: Virginia McKenna with Elsa in the film Born Free . Pioneering: Born Free told the true story of conservation work being carried out in Kenya by Joy Adamson (Virginia) and her husband George (played by her real-life husband Bill Travers) It works throughout the world 'to stop individual wild animals suffering and to protect threatened species'. Thirty years on, Born Free has become a global charity with 100 employees, a £2million-a-year budget and a proud record in rescuing animals and rehoming them in sanctuaries. Now aged 83 (her husband died 20 years ago), Virginia continues to wage a tireless battle on behalf of wild animals. Recent terror activities in Kenya, which led to a toughening of Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice on travelling in the country, are also causing her great concern. Out of Africa: Virginia and Bill's experiences with the Adamsons and their growing concern for the plight of endangered African animals eventually led them to establish the Born Free charity in 1984 . Important work: Thirty years on, Born Free has a proud record in rescuing animals and protecting wild animals . 'A big fall in the number of UK tourists to Kenya will have serious implications for the wildlife,' she says. 'It would be such a tragedy if a small number of extremists, doing such harsh and terrible things, brought about the end of tourism - the industry accounts for about 12 per cent of Kenya's economy. 'Without tourism, what will happen to the country and the livelihood of the indigenous people? One has to think about that too.' Virginia believes that the presence of tourism in Kenya's national parks is vital for the safety of wildlife. Speaking out: Now aged 83, Virginia continues to wage a tireless battle on behalf of wild animals . Constant monitoring: Virginia believes that tourism in Kenya's national parks is vital for the safety of wildlife . Rangers and drivers provide constant monitoring - without that monitoring, there must be a concern about the welfare of those animals facing threats from poachers. 'Perhaps the advice to travellers ought to differentiate between travel in the parks and travel elsewhere in Kenya,' says Virginia. 'The violence in Nairobi, for example, has not been in an area perhaps that most of the tourists go to.' She is hopeful the country's troubles will be short-lived. 'I'm always optimistic. I would just hate anything to destroy Kenya, this wonderful country. 'There's something about Africa, about the skies, the clouds, the silence, and yet it's filled with sound. It isn't human sound. It's usually birdsong and animal sounds. 'A break in Kenya is an uplifting experience.' Virginia . McKenna is hosting two Born Free Foundation 30th anniversary tours in . Kenya.

"A friend of Texas Ebola patient, Thomas Duncan, who saw the sick man the day he was taken into hospital apparently 'vomiting wildly' has described his family's ordeal in isolation. And, shockingly, three days after CDC officials visited him in the family's apartment, 43-year-old Aaron Yah revealed he had not received an order to remain indoors or any advice on how to cope. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Mr Yah said: 'The CDC came on Tuesday, the day it was confirmed Thomas had Ebola. They told me that the children should not go to school until 17 October. Scroll down for video . Sick with worry: Aaron Yah and his family are being monitored by the CDC after visiting Ebola victim Thomas Dunn on Sunday - the day he was taken to hospital and put in isolation . Fears: Mr Yah said: 'I am concerned. I am worried. All we can do is pray. I can say it is not fair. But what is not fair happens' 'But it was not really confirmed to me that I should stay indoors. I don't know. Can you tell me?' While Mr Yah said he does not know - and has not been told what to do - it was revealed on Thursday that Thomas Duncan's family have been ordered to stay indoors after violating officials request to do so. Mr Yah, originally from Liberia, has lived in America for many years, he said. He lives with fiancée Youngor, 35, and their four children three boys ages 2, 4 and 11 and a six-year-old daughter. He has been visited by CDC officials daily since confirmation of Mr Duncan's infection. He said: 'They take our temperature and blood pressure but I don’t know what is going on. They do not tell us what to do for food. Maybe someone will bring us food. Or can I use my card to get some if I sanitize it. I know Ebola is in the blood and body fluids.' As well as being confused and frightened for his family, Mr Yah said he did not know what was being done for Mr Duncan. He said: 'They say the ZMapp is finished. So what will happen? Will he remain in hospital without medication for the rest of his life?' Mr Yah only actually met Mr Duncan for the first time when the Ebola victim arrived in America last month. He appeared fit and healthy, he recalled. The men came to know each other through Youngor's family – Mr Duncan stayed with Youngor's mother in Liberia and Mr Duncan's grandmother has provided care for their three youngest children at the now quarantined Ivy Apartments. Isolated: Mr Yah said that while his children have been told not to go to school under October 17, he has not been told by the CDC to stay indoors and was critical of the confusing advice they have given him and his family . Horror: Mr Yah last saw Thomas Duncan, above, on Sunday. He was lying in bed having been up all night with diarrhea. Mr Yah asked him how he was and Duncan replied: 'I'm not okay' The entire family has been exposed. Mr Duncan revealed: 'The last time I saw Thomas was Sunday, the day he went to hospital. I had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine, he had been just fine. 'But that day I passed by on Sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and I asked him how he was. He said, ""I'm not okay."" 'He said he had been having diarrhea all night. Later they came and took him to the hospital.' Reuters reported that he was seen vomiting wildly as he was strapped to a gurney and taken away. Ebola is only contagious when someone is showing symptoms which can be vague initially – fever, flu-like aches and abdominal pain progressing to vomiting and diarrhea. It spreads through close contact with a patient’s body fluids such as blood, sweat, feces, urine, saliva or semen. These fluids must make contact with a cut or scrape, or someone touching their nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands or beng splashed providing an entry point for the Ebola. Mr Yah revealed that he learned of Mr Duncan's diagnosis the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the Meadows Nursing home where he works as a nursing assistant. 'As a matter of fact I was on the phone to them talking about my shift when CDC called,' he said. Since that visit life has stalled for the family who are left in isolation and uncertainty. Antibacterial hand wash and wipes sit by the front door of the family's apartment. Mr Yah and Youngor repeatedly reapply both to their children's hands and toys. He said: 'It is hard. The children are very bored being indoors and all that we watch on TV is the news.' In the startling absence of any concrete information the family are left to watch rolling news for updates and to pray. Orders: While the family of Duncan (seen here picking up a food package) have been told to stay indoors specifically by a judge - Mr Yah's family have not and are left wondering what they should do . They have connected with a pastor in Liberia who learned of their plight through family members. Mr Yah said: 'We pray every day, every day.' Guided through psalms and prayers by Pastor Samuel who preached via speakerphone Mr Yah read aloud to his fiancée and children. The passages were filled with images of death, perseverance and suffering. 'By the sweat of your blood you will eat bread or food until you return to the ground since form it you were taken... from dust you come and to dust you will return.' And 'Dogs have surrounded me: a band of evil men has encircled me. They have pierced my hands and my feet.' And 'Yay though I walk through the Valley of death I will fear no evil…' Between each passage Pastor Samuel sought to comfort the family in these images of ancient suffering. Later the family prayed aloud, Youngor crying out with her hands raised: 'We present our family oh Father. Ebola does not belong here. Ebola does now belong in this home. 'We ask that you destroy Ebola. We ask for our children Oh God. We ask for America.' A tear streaked down her face as she said: 'Father there is nowhere for us to go. Take Ebola, we send it back to you oh God. Destroy it in the name of Lord Jesus.' But as well as their pleas to God, Mr Yah had demands of the CDC and FDA. Grim: A burial team loads the corpse of an Ebola victim in Monrovia, Liberia - where Duncan travelled from . Precautions: Authorities have stressed that Ebola is not infectious until a person shows symptoms. But that's not stopped concern over the freedom of movement of those who have come in contact with Duncan . He said: 'What is the CDC and the FDA really doing? What are they trying to do? What is the effort – not just here in America, this is not just here. It's worldwide. What are they doing?' As for his own family he admitted: 'I am concerned. I am worried. All we can do is pray. I can say it is not fair. But what is not fair happens. 'I know that some people can contact it and not get it. We just pray that everybody will be on that safe side.'","Aaron Yah, 43, from Dallas, last saw Ebola victim Duncan on Sunday - the day he was taken to hospital .

"The founder of UKIP has set up a new Eurcosceptic organisation for those who feel his old party have become 'racist'. Professor Alan Sked, 66, hopes the centre-left party, called New Deal, is a step away from the set-up under Nigel Farage, which he believes has become 'anti-immigrant and 'anti-intellectual.' He also hopes to challenge the Labour Party and has considered opposing Ed Miliband in his Doncaster seat at the 2015 General Election. New direction: Professor Alan Sked in 1993 when he launched The UK Independence Party. Some of the policies the organisation will push include the re-nationalisation of railways and the scrapping of the bedroom tax. He also believes many voters in Britain want to leave with the EU, but will not side with UKIP because they are too extreme. His criticism of Farage's party began after a number of council candidates were exposed for having extreme . right-wing links or homophobic views. The new party could pose a significant threat to Labour as leader Ed Miliband faces increasing criticism for weak leadership and being vague on policy. There are also plans for a candidate to stand against deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in his Sheffield constituency. Competition: Professor Alan Sked thinks UKIP have become too 'racist' under the leadership of Nigel Farage (left) and has considered standing against Ed Miliband in his Doncaster seat at the next General Election . Sked, a lecturer in international . history at the London School of Economics, told The Sunday Times he . wanted a party dedicated to leaving the EU but was not too . right wing. 'I think the majority of the people in this country want out of the EU,' said Sked. 'They would like a party devoted to the cause, but couldn't vote for one that was extremely right wing. 'They will now be given a serious alternative to the major parties and UKIP.' Despite plans from David Cameron to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU, Sked believes the Conservative leader is 'trying to pull the wool over the eyes' of the country and his party. The name New Deal is based on policies introduced in the United States by President Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1930's to lift America out of the Great Depression. The party's draft manifesto states . tolerance for minorities and is supportive of immigration which it . believes is 'fundamental to the growth of an economically prosperous and . civilised society'. Other . new deal policies will include the ending of welfare payments for those . earning more than £100,000 a year, oppose the privatisation of Royal . Mail and scrap the government's controversial high-speed rail plans. It was officially registered as a party last week by the Electoral Commission and intends to field candidates at the 2015 General Election. But, in contrast to UKIP, it will not be standing in European elections because Sked believed it would be 'hypocritical'. Sked pointed out that when he founded UKIP, it had very limited financial resources and is ready to raise funds to help boost the new party. His first involvement in politics was with the Liberal Party in Scotland but later rejected their pro-European stance. In 1993 he stood in two by-elections, one in Newbury where he was supported by Enoch Powell. He came fourth behind the major parties in both elections which prompted the Anti Federalist League (AFL) to change its name to UKIP. Last month Godfrey Bloom, UKIP MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, provoked outrage after referring to countries in Africa which received aid from Briatin 'Bongo Bongo land'. Sked added: 'These are the tired and false representations of a disappointed man.' The party, which has been led by Farage since 2010, denies being racist or anti-immigrant. A spokesman for the party said: 'Alan should be pleased with how well we are doing and the successes of the party he created.'","Professor Alan Sked, 66, says New Deal can challenge major parties .

Steven Fairbourn told FOX 13 that an internal investigation had been initiated to determine if the guard's 'equipment, facilities and personnel' was used in the calendar shoot. Concerns: Questions were also raised as to whether members of the Utah National Guard themselves were involved, as the group of models thanked them at the end of the video . Terrain: One of the shots was taken next to a boat as the models waded in the river . He said in a statement: 'An investigation was initiated by the Utah National Guard on October 14 to determine potential unauthorized use of military equipment, facilities, and personnel in the Hot Shots 2015 calendar production. 'Productions of this kind are not in keeping with the values of the Utah National Guard nor its members. 'Use of military equipment, facilities, and personnel in civilian for-profit endeavors such as this requires approval of National Guard Bureau Public Affairs through the respective state National Guard Headquarters. Vehicles: A statement from the National Guard said 'civilian for-profit endeavors' required approval from the National Guard Bureau of Public Affairs . 'There was no official approval for this project. The investigation will determine if Utah National Guard equipment, facilities, and personnel were used in the Hot Shots 2015 calendar production and required actions if this is the case.' House Minority Leader Jennifer Seelig, D-Salt Lake City, told the station: 'If this video was shot at a government restricted facility using government specialized military equipment, either leadership knew about this — or their security protocols aren't robust enough to keep a bunch of calendar girls and their crew and assorted groupies out' Mail Online have contacted the company behind the shoot and Help For Heroes for comment.

"Dwindling in numbers, whale sharks are protected in China - and black market salesmen are punished with hefty fines. But when fisherman Cai Chengzhu, 48, spotted this 16-foot-long, two-tonne beast, he could not resist having a go. He heaved it to shore and dragged it to the street. Then, incredibly, he dumped it onto a truck - and drove it for half-an-hour to the nearest market. Scroll down for video . All in a day's work: Cai Chengzhu was fishing in Xianghzhi, eastern China, when he found this 16ft-long whale shark - before lugging it onto his tractor and driving it for half-an-hour to a market in nearby Shishi . Regulation states the valuable whale sharks, which can live for up to 100 years, should be set free immediately if caught. But Cai, from Xianghzhi, in the far-eastern province of Fujian, admitted he planned to sell the creature from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan (around £1,000 to £2,000). He claims the fish was already dead by the time they reached the market in Shishi, 10 miles away, after accidentally getting caught in his fishing net. Trapped: The endangered mammal had broken into his fishing net and started eating all the fish he had caught . Despite strict laws against selling whale sharks, Cai could sell his (for £1,000) because it was already dead . He told local media he did not know it was a whale shark. 'The giant creature broke our net and got inside to eat the fish we caught,' he explained. 'As you can see it had eaten a fair few but after being trapped in the net, it had died. Valuable: The enormous creatures can live for up to 100 years and weigh around 20 tonnes at full maturity . Fascinated: Passers-by were astounded to see Cai, 48, trundling through the village with the whale shark . 'By the time we managed to free it, sadly it was too late. 'It was really unfortunate and we did our best to free it, but having caught it and because it was already dead, it seemed a shame to waste it. 'I asked the fish market officials that monitor this sort of thing, and they said that as it was already dead when we caught it and as it was there we may as well sell it.'","Cai Chengzhu drove 16ft, two-tonne whale for half-an-hour to market .

"Creepy details emerged today about the plot by a grown man to lure a 13-year-old girl he met over the internet across state lines. Police charged Jorge Garzon, 45, with sexual assault, child endangerment and child abuse after Alexandra 'Allie' Loftis was found in his Jersey City apartment, and a neighbor's account of their interaction is shedding light on the relationship between the apparent ill-matched lovers. Eduardo Morillo, who rents a basement apartment in the home Garzon lives in with his parents, testified that he met Allie when he was invited into Garzon's room to clear his computer hard drive. Arrested: Jorge Garzon, 45, of Jersey City was arrested and charged with sexual assault, child endangerment and child abuse . Mr Morillo, a computer engineer, did not know why the grown man wanted to erase his hard drive, but was able to easily clear the drive. Mr Morillo told The Jersey Journal that because the young girl looked happy and relaxed, he assumed she was a relative of Garzon, saying that they 'touched' and 'hugged' one another in a close way. Little is known of Garzon except that he is divorced, lives with his parents, and a father of two. 'They were acting as if it was a family together,' Mr Morillo told the paper. The truth is far more cringe-worthy. Efforts: Family of Allie implored volunteers to take to street corners in matching T-shirts handing out fliers on their missing daughter, all around the city . Unsuspecting: Eduardo Morillo went into Garzon's room to erase his hard drive and thought Garzon and Allie were related . Mr Morillo only learned that the pair were not actually related when a journalist came to his door after Garzon was arrested and asked if he had seen the missing girl. Police say Alexandra 'Allie' Loftis vanished from her Boston home for nearly two weeks after boarding a bus headed to New York City on November 4th, sending her parents on a relentless hunt to get their daughter back. Allie was located at Jorge Garzon's Jersey City residence and taken into police custody around 9am Wednesday, after police say they received a tip off. Garzon, who also goes by the name George Gonzalez, was arrested just over an hour after her recovery at the Jersey address. After their daughter disappeared, Mr . Loftis says she never turned on her cell phone or went on Facebook, . despite him describing her as tech savvy. 'We have left voice mail messages on . her cell phone until it got filled up. We’ve tried every method we think . possible but haven’t heard from her,' Mr Loftis told CBS after her . disappearance. Pleading, in hope that she may see . their efforts and pain online, the family devoted a Facebook site to . their missing daughter, posting a flood of photos of them together. That made it even more concerning for him, with his fear that Allie could have been held against her will. Custody: Police say Allie took a bus from Boston Massachusetts to New York City, disappearing for nearly two weeks before she was found Wednesday in Jersey City . Her father did confess his believe that she may have met someone online. Garzon, who Allie was found with, is . currently being held in custody in the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office . pending charges which have yet to be filed. Affirming Allie's father's fear, the two are believed to have met online, a sources close to the investigation told NJ.com. The circumstances surrounding both her . disappearance and the activities since she ran away are still under . investigation, according to police. Adventure: Allie, shown with her father and mother, had expressed frustration and boredom with their quieter Massachusetts community to her father, possibly building up to her New York City escape . Search: Allie's parents searched all the areas of the city they thought their daughter might go, focusing on Brooklyn where they knew she was more familiar .","Neighbour saw the pair 'hugging' and 'touching' in the man's room .

"Increase: Sales of drink to be consumed at home rose by 1.3per cent in terms of volume in the year (picture posed by model) Britons are getting goggle-eyed by following the example set by Gogglebox couple Steph and Dom. The couple are known for enjoying big measures of booze, particularly champagne, while commenting on TV trivia in the popular Channel 4 series. And it seems they are typical of a nation that is drinking more bubbly, particularly at home. Sales of drink to be consumed at home rose by 1.3per cent in terms of volume in the year to the end of July – turning around a long term fall. The trend was driven by the fact that many people have cut back on going to the pub because of the high prices, while the World Cup was also a factor encouraging people to drink more at home. The extra volume equates to 33.1million litres, while the value of drink sold for home consumption was up by 3.3per cent to £11.6billion. Sparkling wine has been the strongest performer, with the volume up by five per cent and the value of these sales growing by a higher 14.8per cent, as people traded up from cheap Cava to more expensive Prosecco and Champagne. Sales of sparkling wine rose by £70million to some £541million with more than 40per cent of people saying they had bought bubbly in the past year. Kevan Mulcahey, head of alcohol at Kantar Worldpanel, which collated the figures, said: ‘Shoppers are looking for something a bit special to treat themselves, and sparkling wine is a luxury product with an affordable price tag. Scroll down for video . ‘Shoppers are trading up from Cava to Prosecco and Prosecco to Champagne, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 14.8per cent compared with the same time last year. ‘Cava’s growth has gone flat with sales only growing by 0.1per cent whereas the more premium option, Prosecco, has enjoyed a 74.6per cent surge in sales over the past year alone, driving the increasing popularity of sparkling wines.’ Significantly, sales of bottles of Veuve Cliquot, the most expensive big Champagne brand sold in supermarkets, are up by 34.7per cent. Mr Mulcahey said: ‘Many retailers have cottoned on to this shift towards more premium alcoholic beverages and now stock high-quality own-label sparkling wines, making them very competitive options.’ Example: Steph and Dom from Gogglebox are known for drinking heavily while watching TV . Kantar said sparkling wine has become a popular choice for couples over the past five years. Some 13per cent is now consumed by couples, like Steph and Dom, who run an upmarket bed and breakfast from a £3.5million property in Kent, having a night in. ‘Motivations for sparkling wine occasions have become more about ‘having a laugh’ – with 15per cent of volume drunk on these occasions compared with 11per cent five years ago,’ it said. Figures detailing the rise in drinking at home were published in The Grocer magazine, which highlighted how Steph and Dom once had such a good night on the fizz and cocktails that they tipped up the sofa in front of the TV cameras. Kantar said: ‘There’s been a small fall in number of serves at home, but volumes are going up.’ The Grocer magazine said the figures suggest that people are pouring larger measures than they might have done in the past. The Kantar data suggest the drink by discount chains Aldi and Lidl to offer bargain bubbly is partly responsible for increased consumption. Sales through these stores are up by 25.4per cent in a year . ‘Even if you have not seen the show (Gogglebox), you will recognise the type because some of us seem to be becoming more like them,’ it said. ‘For all our good intentions, we are still drinking more at home. Even though the average number of drinks we serve at home is falling, volume sales are going up. ‘This could suggest we are simply pouring ourselves bigger drinks. Steph and Dom, known for their generous measures, would certainly approve.’ The Kantar data suggest the drink by discount chains Aldi and Lidl to offer bargain bubbly is partly responsible for increased consumption.

"This may be the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, but Venus Ebony Starr Williams was not going to rush for anybody’s rules. Her opponent, Kurumi Nara of Japan, was in her chair, baking quietly in the piercing midday sun. A sprinkling of spectators grew impatient and started a slow handclap. Finally, nine minutes late, out strolled the long limbs of Miss Williams. She walked over to her chair and promptly sat down. Determined: Venus Williams saw off Kurumi Narato move into the third round at Wimbledon on Wednesday . Now, Court 3 is situated between the . perimeter wall and the path to the first-aid centre, undeniably on the . edge of the club but hardly on another planet. So why this delay? ‘Was . I late?’ she pondered, before adding philosophically: ‘What is late? I . mean, I guess she got there early. I don’t know what time she got . there.’ Williams later . denied that a change of underwear from coloured to regulation white was . the cause, so we can only assume that cool hauteur had something to do . with it. Five times a champion in SW19, I’ll show up when I’m jolly well . ready. She even walked off after knocking up. But, the intriguing . preliminaries observed, it was rip-roaring tennis from the moment . Williams threw her Amazonian shoulders into the very first point: a big . forehand winner. Nara, just . 5ft 1in and a full foot shorter than her opponent, scampered, chased and . fought gamely. She barely made a mistake. Sometimes she was stretching . up to hit the ball at eye-level, whereas Williams collapsed her knees to . do so. Williams, who . suffers from the energy-sapping Sjogren’s syndrome, still struck the . ball mighty hard. Her first serve averaged 118mph; poor little Nara’s . 86mph. But Nara started . strongly, taking a 3-0 lead before Williams levelled the scores. The . pendulum swung towards Williams at 5-3, but the first set went to a . tiebreak. That, too, went one way and then the other: Nara led 4-1 . before Williams rattled off six straight points. Nara . needed treatment at the end of the first set, returning to the court . with a strapped left thigh. It did not seem to limit her too much — and . she did not blame the injury afterwards — but Williams won six . consecutive games to win 7-6, 6-1. Too powerful: Williams hits a forehand against Nara on day three at Wimbledon . What . an athletic specimen Venus is at the age of 34. Don’t take my word for . it; hear what she thinks. ‘Wisdom has served me well,’ she said. ‘I’ve . worn my sunscreen so I haven’t aged terribly. My knees are very tight, . not saggy. And the crow’s feet have been kept at bay. So I’ll give . myself an A+.’ But in truth . nobody expects much of the elder Williams sister these days. She is . seeded 30th here, and before had reached the third round only . twice in her last nine grand slams. Her most notable contribution of . recent times was to pose naked for ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue. Yet . her durability is magnificent given the Sjogren’s syndrome, an . incurable auto-immune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain — a . handicap in the world of high-performance tennis. She has fallen asleep . at the wheel of her car and is exhausted if she trains too hard. A vegan . diet and recuperation are her remedies. Brave: Nara fell short despite rallying during the second set against the five-time champion . VIDEO Wimbledon Day 3 review . So . is she contemplating drawing a line under her dazzling career? ‘Well, I . don’t like watching tennis on TV,’ she said, while wearing not so much . earrings as napkin rings. ‘I want to be out there. I’m not about the . easy life. Life is a challenge. ‘When . I leave tennis, I want it to be on my own terms. I want to know I rose . to every challenge. I want to look back with no regrets. So far I can do . that. Everyone messes up. Everyone chokes.  Everyone loses matches they . should have won. But as long as you walked out there and gave it your . all, you can look back with no regrets.’ Next . up is Petra Kvitova, the 2011 champion.

"She made her name writing psychological thrillers, including one that sees a couple struggling with the impact of an affair, but author Julia Crouch has herself been married for 25 years. Despite ups and downs, several different jobs and the birth and upbringing of three children, the Brighton-based writer is happier with her husband than ever. So what's the secret of her marital success? From spending time alone to keeping the spark alight between the sheets, she reveals how to make a long-term relationship work for you. Long term love: Author Julia Crouch has enjoyed 25 years of marital bliss - and says you can do the same . Happily married: Author Julia Crouch has been married for 25 years and with her husband for 31 . This year, the Old Man and I will celebrate our silver wedding anniversary by spending a few days in a luxury hotel in Venice. But 25 years is not the whole story: This August we will have actually been together for 31 – it took us a while to get around to tying the knot. We are practically unique among our friends for having such a long relationship. It helps, of course, getting together when you are very, very young (we were aged 19 and 21), but I’m often asked how we have managed to stay together for so long. Clearly, the first answer is choose a good ‘un in the first place. But that’s quite difficult, because when you fall in love, you're always pretty sure you’ve picked the right person. So take your time to see if it still feels right. If the other one starts giving you grief, send them packing. Once you’ve established that, how do you keep that love going through all the curve balls life throws at you? I only have my own experience to go on, but it’s worked so far, so here’s how we’ve stuck together. One of the main reasons the Old Man and I still canoodle is that we have pretty separate, independent lives, which means that we do not rely solely on each other for our happiness. That’s not to say we’ve always both had fabulous careers outside the home. In fact, I spent many years when our oldest two children were little (they’re now 24 and 22), looking after them at home and working part time. I have had many different careers, in fact, to fit around our children. I started off as a theatre director and playwright, became a teacher, did a bit of book-keeping, then I retrained as a graphic designer before turning to writing. I’ve adapted and survived like this because the Old Man works in theatre and is away a lot. I chose to stay at home and earn a regular income while he went off. Happy: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson (left) and Michael J. Fox and Tracey Pollan have been married for 26 years . Some friends have implied that they think I have sacrificed my career for my husband’s, but my reply is that I have really enjoyed everything I have done, and every choice has been made gladly. I wanted to be there for my children, so that’s what I did, and I fitted work around them. It doesn’t make me any less of a feminist. It’s not always been a bed of roses, though: growing up together as we have, we’ve had serious downs as well as ups – times when we‘ve really had to question our relationship and commitment to one another. Happily for us, the outcome has always been positive, if sometimes hard-won, and the result is that, as we approach middle age, we know we are here by positive choice rather than passive default. Then there's the importance of maintaining a physical relationship. Look away kids, but whatever age you are, sex is important in a long-term relationship. Desire will come and go, and you have to appreciate that in each other, but I know that if it’s been a long time – say over a week – we begin to get irritable with one another. Only one thing is going to smooth things out, and I’m not talking about a nice cup of tea. But I think the main reason we’re still holding hands is that we share things with each other. We don’t have that big imaginary couples tally book where we owe each other favours: cooking, money, childcare. We do what we can and we are generous with one another. This probably comes from being pretty much skint for our first 15 years together. Sometimes I’d earn more, sometimes he would. We only had one bank account between us – well, it was more of a constant overdraft – and we threw all our pennies into the same hole. It has continued like that to this day. We are both self employed and our income, if slightly better than it was in the past, is still sporadic. But whatever and however we earn, everything we own is owned jointly. Some might say we’ve been lucky, and I would agree: we are not tied to regular jobs; we get to travel a lot, both independently and together; we have three funny, loving children; and we still love and fancy each other. But, they also say that you make your own luck. The key to a long, loving marriage? You’ve got to work at it - always.

"Government bureaucracy may lead to the deportation and stoning of an Iranian woman seeking asylum in Canada, as she may be forced back to her home country where he husband has accused her of adultery. Fatemeh Derakhshandeh Tosarvandan denies her husband's claims, but she fears she will not get a fair trial in Iran, and women convicted of adultery face death by stoning. Now, because her estranged husband didn't officially file the adultery claim until after she made her initial asylum plea to Canadian courts, the deadline for her to re-file is too soon to get the paperwork through. If the case keeps to the intended schedule, she will be forced to head back to Iran to face the adultery charges and the prospect of death. Tosarvandan, now 40, was set up via arranged marriage with her allegedly abusive husband Mahmoud Hafezi Mashhadi in Iran in 1993. Bureaucratic mistakes: Fatemeh Derakhshandeh Tosarvandan, 40, and her son Hessam Hafezi Mashhadi, 16, face trial in Iran because her estranged husband and his father claims she cheated on him . They had a son, Hessam Hafezi Mashhadi, and moved to Dubai three years later. Facing fraud allegations in 2009, her husband fled Dubai and returned to Iran. Tosarvandan flew with her son to Canada after her family in Iran told her that her husband had 'circulated information that I committed adultery'. Canadian newspaper The Star reports that when Tosarvandan originally filed for asylum, her husband hadn't officially registered his claims of adultery to the Iranian court, so they had not filed any formal charges at that point. Because there was no quantitative proof that she was being prosecuted in her country, her claim was rejected by Canadian immigration officials. In Canada, there is a law that does not permit a refugee to reapply for a second review of their case until one year after they received the initial rejection. The paper reports that in many instances, the authorities have disregarded this ban and allowed the refugees in question to remain in the country until their year is up so that they can put new evidence forward in their case. But now, following a tightening of the laws on June 29, Tosarvandan faces deportation in October even though she has new evidence since the Iranian court has formally filed the adultery charges against her. 'The fact that a removals officer can blithely tell me that he can’t wait to allow a risk assessment to be conducted based on the new evidence shows just how far (Canada Border Services Agency) has drifted from Canadian values,' Tosarvandan's lawyer Lisa Winter-Card told The Star. Being sent back: Now the woman and her son have to leave Canada by the end of the week . 'The average Canadian would be horrified to know that we’re going to send a woman to Iran to be stoned for adultery.' As it stands, immigration officials have rejected the lawyer's request to push back her deportation date to late October and have said that Tosarvandan and her now-16-year-old son must leave the country by the end of the week. Adding to the surprising decision, Canada formally suspended diplomatic relations with Iran two weeks ago, with foreign affairs minister John Baird saying that the middle eastern country poses 'most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today'.","Woman fled to Canada from Iran when her husband claimed she cheated .

"While most people who enjoy flying might draw the line at a souvenir jet or mug, Anthony Toth's obsession has really taken off. The airline sales director has spent two decades amassing an unmatched collection of memorabilia from Pan Am, which he has converted into a replica cabin at his home in Redondo Beach, California. Mr Toth has spent $200,000 salvaging Pan Am airliner first class cabin parts for his airline tribute, including working seatbelt signs, oxygen masks and even 18 matching cabin seats.

Commitment: Mr Toth has traveled as far as Bangkok in search of the exact parts for his well-researched Pan Am cabin . He has now turned his 625 square-foot garage into a first class cabin from the airline, which was one of the biggest in the U.S. until its collapse in 1991. As well as seats and other accessories, Mr Toth has equipped the Pan Am cabin in his garage with all other in-flight accessories, including socks, eyeshades and extra headsets. He says his favourite part of his unique collection is a winding staircase which led to a first class cabin on a Pan Am 747 in the early 1970s.

Mr Toth, Global Sales Director for United Airlines, said: 'To the people who live on the same street as me this is just the garage, but to me it's the Pan Am 747. 'What I really desire is, to be a part of what actually was the Pan Am cabin of the 1970’s and 80’s. ‘The great thing about Pan Am was that it was so identifiable – you could sit in that cabin and know exactly who you were flying with.' Safety conscious: Should there be an in-flight emergency, Mr Toth has gone to great lengths to make sure everyone in his garage is safe . Mr Toth's bizarre two-decade garage conversion has been featured on U.S. show My Crazy Obsession . In-flight comforts: Items of cutlery, paperwork and tray tables help are all part of the attention to detail from Mr Toth . Many of the pieces of regalia were collected from a salvage site for aircraft in the Mojave desert, California, where retired aircraft are stripped down for spare parts, but Mr Toth has also had to travel as far as Bangkok in Thailand to find the perfect additions to his creation. The collecter, who is now hoping that the cabin can be turned into a museum, isn’t as enamored by today’s first class service: ‘I didn't want to sleep when I flew,’ Mr Toth says. ‘I wanted to spend every minute enjoying everything that was happening.’ Mr Toth's bizarre collection has been featured along with other hoarders on U.S. programme My Crazy Obsession.

Clinton then quipped: 'I seriously considered calling and asking you to do a portrait of me until I saw the results of your sister's hacked emails. 'Those bathroom sketches are wonderful but at my age, I think I should keep my suit.' He was referencing self-portraits found in hacked Bush family emails which appear to show paintings of the former president shaving in the . shower and soaking in a bathtub.

Skill: His teacher, Bonnie Flood from Cummings, Georgia, said that the Republican was very passionate and talented . Range: Though he initially enjoyed painting dogs, Ms Flood said that she made him also paint landscapes like his ranch in Crawford, Texas . But Mr Bush admitted he was not overawed with his painting and does not think he has a real talent. 'Fortunately, I haven’t seen those reviews,' he said. 'Look, the signature is more valuable than the painting.' The two-term President has led a . significantly quieter life since leaving office in 2008 - spending much . of his time painting and going on mountain bike rides with groups of . veterans like Wounded Warrior.

Mr Bush spent four weeks in private lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic horizons. 'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood. She revealed that the former President loved painting pictures of dogs, though she eventually broke him of his habit and helped him paint pictures of his Crawford, Texas ranch. 'He picked it up so quick, it was amazing actually. His whole heart is in it,' the Atlanta-native told the local Fox News affiliate. His passion for dogs comes as little surprise, as his pet Scottish terrier Barney was a constant presence around the White House during his two terms and was the star of the annual Christmas tour video. 'I think he said he's painted 50 dogs,' Ms Flood said. As the library's opening approached, Bush and his wife embarked on a round-robin of interviews with all the major television networks, likely aware that history's appraisal of his legacy and years in office will soon be solidifying.","Bush mostly paints landscapes and animals daily at his Dallas mansion .

"George Clooney and fiancé Amal Alamuddin are busy making wedding plans. And while they’ve pretty much decided to walk down the aisle in September – the one year anniversary of when they met – they were still looking for on the perfect venue. Now they've zeroed in on Highclere Castle near London – the home of TV’s Downton Abbey! As MailOnline reported earlier this week, Clooney flew to London on Wednesday and whisked his fiancé away for a surprise mini holiday in the English Countryside. And one of George’s romantic destinations was Highclere, because he knows that while his lady love isn’t a big TV fan, she adores Downton Abbey. Scroll down for video . Royal wedding: Last week George took Amal Alamuddin to Highclere Castle - the home of Downton Abbey . ‘George became close friends with Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Robert Crawley, when they did Monuments Men together last year,’ says a source. ‘And they really hit it off. He contacted Hugh and asked him to arrange a private tour of the castle. Amal was blown away. ‘When he saw his bride-to-be’s reaction to the spectacular Victorian castle, set on 1,000 acres of parkland, he began making some discrete inquires about having their wedding performed there. And he was told they would be most happy to accommodate them!’ Spectacular: George loves the idea of marrying at the castle, because it's a glamorous place he could secure, says a source . Ornate surroundings: The smoking room at Highclere Castle . Highclere has been the residence of the Carnarvon family since 1679.  And it’s currently inhabited by the 8th Lord and Lady Carnarvon and their family. The castle does allow weddings, and prices to hire parts of the castle alone, begin at about $23,000 for one night. Couples can marry in the Saloon, with the bride descending the sweeping oak staircase featured on the series. That room can hold about 120 guests, but the dining room can accommodate up to 400 people. They will also provide Marquees on the grounds where guests can dine, dance and celebrate. The castle boasts an award winning chef in Paul Brooke Taylor, who prepares some of the Carnarvon families favorites, as well as vegetarian and vegan fare. They also specialise in authentic Victorian foods and they offer an extensive wine list. ‘George loves the idea of marrying at the castle, because it’s a glamorous place he could secure,’ says the source. ‘And the same way Kanye West and Kim’s wedding guests were given a private tour of The Palace of Versailles, a private tour of not only the castle and grounds, but of the famous Egyptian Antique Exhibition in the Castle cellars could be arranged.’ Channeling Lady Mary: When George saw his bride-to-be's reaction to the spectacular Victorian castle, set on 1,000 acres of parkland, he began making some discrete inquires about having their wedding there.  Lade Mary Crawley descended the grand oak staircase to wed Matthew on the series . In 1922, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon discovered the Egyptian tomb of the young Pharaoh Tutankhamen.  And although most of his findings are now housed in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, many of the artifacts still remain in the castle. When Shirley MacLaine was working on Downton Abbey, she was very impressed with the Castle’s current collection that includes jewelry, art, decorative jars, and the coffin of a 3,500 year old  Egyptian Nobel woman. ‘Amal’s Middle Eastern relatives would most certainly enjoy the exhibition, and the tour would make for a most memorable wedding,’ adds the source. Highclere would also be a perfect place for George and Amal to tie the knot because of its close proximity to London and the fact it’s only 50 miles away from Heathrow Airport. Bond: George became close friends with Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Robert Crawley on the PBS drama, when they did Monuments Men together last year. Bonneville arranged for the private tour . And while many of Amal’s family members live in Dubai, and Lebanon, her mother lives in London. ‘Amal grew up in London, and attended school in Buckinghamshire,’ says another source. ‘And she went to University at Oxford. She currently works in London so she has many close British friends. Her mother Baria has also been living in London for years – since the 1980s – and is the respected editor of a London – based Arab newspaper. Her father, Ramzi returned to Lebanon in the early 1990s, but he often visits London and can easily travel there. ‘There is still a lot to be decided in addition to wedding details, like where the couple will live,’ says the source. ‘And Amal would like for George to sell his Studio City house because it’s such a ‘guy place,’ and find somewhere more suitable to them start their life together.","The actor and his bride-to-be are ready to wed in September - the one-year anniversary of when they met .
During Clooney's surprise mini-holiday with Amal, they visited the English countryside and were given a private tour of Highclere Castle, where TV series Downton Abbey is filmed.

"It is said that women are from Venus and men from Mars, but the debate as to whether men and women’s brains really are different rages on. Tonight it is the subject of BBC’s Horizon, which will feature a number of experts arguing that male and female behaviour is driven by biological differences, and others claiming it is caused by social conditioning. The programme looks at the latest research  - from into whether hormones in the womb make a developing foetus' brain more ‘masculine’ to how children naturally prefer to play with gender 'appropriate' toys. Scroll down for video . Battle of the sexes: Tonight's Horizon will look at differences between men and women's brains (illustrated with a stock image). It will include the latest research about whether hormones in the womb make people’s brains more ‘masculine’ and analytical, as well as men and women’s tolerance to pain . Clasp your hands together interlocking your fingers and look at which thumb is on top. If your right thumb is on top, it suggests that the left half of your brain is dominant. The left hemisphere is associated with logic, analysis, facts and verbal ability and is viewed as being more masculine. If your left thumb is on top it suggests that the right half of your brain is dominant. Some studies suggest that a dominant right hemisphere of the brain makes a person more creative, intuitive and adept at analysing emotions - 'feminine' traits. All humans use a mixture of both hemispheres. This experiment forms part of a larger BBC quiz examining how the brain works. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen of Cambridge University, whose research will be examined in the programme, believes there are two different brain types: ‘empathisers’ who are good at reading what people are feeling, and ‘systemisers’ who are best at analysing situations. All humans are a mixture of the two, but men tend to be stronger systemisers than women, who are largely better empathisers, Dr Michael Mosley explained. This perhaps helps reinforce the stereotype that men are better at reading maps, while women are more adept at reading people’s emotions and multitasking. come. Professor Baron-Cohen’s latest research suggests that this is a result of exposure to hormones in the womb, and not social conditioning, the BBC reported. For his latest study, he followed a group of children from birth for 12 years. At 16 weeks gestation, samples of fluid in the womb were taken and the levels of testosterone in it measured. Size matters? A recent study by the University of Cambridge showed that men and women's brains are biologically different when it comes to differences in grey matter. Areas of larger volumes in women are marked in red and areas of larger volume in men are in blue . Professor Baron-Cohen found that the higher the testosterone in the fluid, the slower the child was to develop socially and showed less empathy at primary school. However, children exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb, displayed better spatial awareness and analytical abilities, which are traditionally seen as masculine traits, . He argues in tonight’s programme that male and female brains consequently develop differently, without gender influences imposed on children. Another recent study by the University of Pennsylvania will come under the spotlight. Researchers scanned the brains of 949 males and females between the ages of eight and 22 and found that male and female brains were wired differently. Men showed stronger connections between the front and backs of their brains than women. Professor Ruben Gurr of the university said that the connection means that men are ‘better able to connect what they see with what they do, which is what you need to be able to do if you are a hunter.’ The study also revealed that women have stronger wiring between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, which makes people with more feminine brains better at multitasking and reading people’s emotions. Dr Michael Mosley said that more research into the differences in male and female brains could lead to gender-specific medication (stock image) However, Professor Alice Roberts believes that differences in how men and women behave are largely down to social conditioning – how children are treated at a young age. She is concerned that claims that women’s brains are biologically different to men’s could discourage females from pursuing careers in science and engineering. ‘We live in a country where fewer than three out of ten physics A levels are taken by girls, where just 7 per cent of engineers are women…and where men still earn on average nearly 20 per cent more than their female colleagues.’ Dr Michael Mosely, who presents the programme, told MailOnline that culture undoubtedly plays a role in shaping whether people behave in a certain way, but said that he believes there are real differences in the brains of the two sexes. An experiment was specially conducted for Horizon, which involved experts giving monkeys a choice of ‘male toys’ such as cars and ‘female’ toys such as dolls to play with. They found that the male monkeys were naturally drawn to the cars, while the female monkeys automatically opted for the dolls. Researchers say it is natural for females to be drawn to the dolls because female primates raise their young, but they are not sure why the male monkeys wanted cars. Dr Moseley said that new research into male and female brains could be used to develop the next generation of painkillers that are gender-specific. Some experts believe that men and women process pain differently. For example men respond better to Paracetamol than women when in pain . Because drugs are typically tested on male animals, many drugs better suit men, but new pills could be tailored to women. Horizon: Is You Brain Male Or Female? Will be broadcast tonight (September 29) on BBC 2 at 9pm. Dr Michael Mosely (pictured),  told MailOnline that culture undoubtedly plays a role in shaping whether people behave in a certain way, but said that he believes there are real differences in the brains of the two sexes . Experts are divided as to whether male and female brains really are different. Neuroscientist Professor Gina Rippon says the sexes are not ‘hardwired’ in different ways and there is no evidence that men are innately better at reading maps or that women are better at multi-tasking. Any difference is due to society’s idea of gender, not to biology, and is deterring a generation of women from becoming scientists, she warns. Professor Rippon, of Aston University, Birmingham, said differences in the brain are formed in childhood by divisions in the games girls and boys play and stereotypes they conform to. She told the British Science Festival in Birmingham last month: 'We really cannot afford to sit back and accept the “essentialist” view that girls are not going to be interested in science subjects because of some “brain deficiency”. ‘We need more trained scientists and engineers but 50 per cent of our pool of talent is not engaging. ‘People who could study these subjects or do these jobs are choosing not to. This must not be explained away by misguided and misleading explanations in terms of unchangeable biological characteristics, or references to “the natural order of things”’. Her views - for which she has been labelled a ‘gender difference denier’ - are contradicted by a prominent study published last year. The study, in which the brains of 949 young men and women were scanned at the University of Pennsylvania, suggested that women had better connections between the left and right-hand sides of the brain, while men had better links between the front and back. The authors claimed their findings demonstrated that women are better disposed to deal with ‘analytical’ and ‘intuitive’ tasks at the same time. Men, meanwhile, were better at complex motor skills, they said. Professor Rippon dismissed the study as having neglected the idea that these changes were caused by nurture - not nature - and said there is no such thing as a ‘hardwired’ brain. ‘There is quite a lot of thoughtless science being done and quite a lot of overenthusiastic presenting. If you just look at gender differences - and not their experiences in life - then yes you might find differences. ‘But the brains of men and women are much more similar than they are different.’","Debate is the subject of BBC 2’s Horizon, which airs tonight at 9pm .

"The father of a Philadelphia nurse who was grabbed off the street said she befriended her abductor in order to survive. Carlesha Freeland-Gaither was found inside a parked car 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, three days after she was kidnapped. The 22-year-old's alleged abductor, Delvin Barnes, was arrested at the scene and indicted on a federal kidnapping charge yesterday. Scroll down for video . Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, left, was abducted from a street in Philadelphia and found 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, with suspected abductor Delvin Barnes, right, who was indicted yesterday . Carl Freeland told ABC News: 'I'm glad that my daughter was a friendly person and got him into being a friendly guy so he wouldn't harm her.' 'I give all the praise to my daughter. She's the hero.' He spoke after the City Council honored those who helped to find his daughter. Carlesha's grandfather Derek Alston added she had 'more or less convinced him to be her friend.' A massive manhunt was launched when Barnes allegedly grabbed Carlesha near a Philadelphia bus stop on November 2 and forced the struggling woman into his car. Federal agents found her three days later in his car in Jessup. The nurse's mother Keisha Gaither smiles, surrounded by family and friends, after a police press conference last week which announced her daughter had been rescued . Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, pictured left and right, only survived because she befriended her captor, said her father. 'I give all the praise to my daughter. She's the hero,' he said . Federal prosecutors initially charged Barnes, of Charles County, Virginia, the day after his capture. By law, most federal cases can't be prosecuted without a grand jury indictment. If convicted, Barnes faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. At City Hall yesterday, the Philadelphia City Council honored those who helped find the nursing assistant, who is still recovering from the ordeal and has not yet returned to work. Mr Alston, said: 'She's coming along. She's working, trying to readjust.' Barnes is also charged with attempted murder in the abduction of a 16-year-old girl in Virginia in early October. He allegedly hit the teen in the head with a shovel, put her in a trunk and took her to a mobile home, where he doused her in bleach and gasoline before she escaped. She broke free as Barnes was digging her grave, authorities said. Authorities were able to track the nurse down with the help of tips from the public, including the discovery of an empty bag of potato chips and a receipt . NOV. 2, 9.40 pm: Carlesha Freeland-Gaither is grabbed while walking along a Philadelphia street. She struggles to break free before being forced into what appears to be a gray Ford Taurus and apparently kicking out a rear window.

NOV 4, 7 pm: The woman who found the items in her driveway reports the discovery to police. Video footage from the Philadelphia supermarket shows a man matching the description of the person at the bank machine and mini-mart. NO DATE: Investigators from the Charles City County Sheriff's Office in Virginia examine surveillance photos and conclude man likely is Delvin Barnes. The office had obtained a warrant October 28 for his arrest on kidnapping, rape and other charges. They determine a gray Ford Taurus is registered to him. NOV 5: The Ford Taurus registered to Barnes is located in Jessup, Maryland. Barnes is found lying in the backseat, next to the victim. The rear passenger window is missing and covered by pieces of plastic. The FBI says Barnes admits to abducting the woman, and told them he didn't know his victim.

"A British businessman serving a sentence for two murders has been framed and the killings were carried out by executioners working for Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel, it has been claimed. Jhon Jairo Velasquez Vasquez - Escobar's chief assassin responsible for the killing of 300 people - has sensationally stated 75-year-old Kris Maharaj has been wrongly imprisoned just as lawyers battle to overturn his conviction. Maharaj was working in Miami, Florida, as a property investor in 1986 when he was convicted for the murder of father and son Derrick and Duane Moo Young at a downtown Miami hotel. Escobar's assassin, Jhon Jairo Velasquez Vasquez (pictured), has claimed British businessman Kris Maharaj was framed and the double killing was the work of hitmen working for the Medellin cartel . Maharaj, now 75, has spent almost three decades in a Florida prison for a crime he says he did not commit. Here he is pictured during this week's court hearing which his legal team hope will overturn his conviction . His legal team has been battling to have the conviction overturned in recent years with new evidence alleging the murders were carried out by hitmen working for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Now Velasquez, the kingpin's most feared assassin who is responsible for killing 300 hundred people, has claimed through his lawyers that Maharaj was wrongly convicted. Velasquez, who lives in a secret location following his release from prison in August, called a former agent for the US Drug Enforcement Agency to state his claim,The Guardian reported. Former agent Henry Cuervo said: 'Velasquez said he wanted to clear his conscience, he wanted to say who had killed the Moo Youngs. He said it was Pablo Escobar and his people.' Velasquez added: 'As a lieutenant of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, with whom I worked shoulder to shoulder, he told me directly that they had stolen his money and that of his partners and that therefore ""they had to die"",' the paper reported. Lawyers for Maharaj described the call in a court hearing which concluded this week. Velasquez (pictured in prison in 2009), was released in August in return for providing information on other murders carried out during the bloody reign of Pablo Escobar . Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar (pictured left on his son's book cover) ordered the deaths of thousands of people during his time at the head of the Medellin cartel. Velasquez is pictured right as a young assassin . Yesterday a Florida judge wrapped up the three-day hearing, which was held to re-examine Maharaj's conviction. His legal team, led by British civil rights lawyer and activist Clive Stafford Smith, hope to persuade Florida Circuit Court Judge William Thomas to overturn the conviction, saying  new evidence indicates the Moo Youngs were money launderers who stole from Escobar's Medellin cartel. Thomas has not said when he plans to rule, but lawyers said it could take several weeks. As well as hearing from Mr Cuervo, the court heard testimony from an alleged former Medellin cartel enforcer, Jorge Maya, in a taped Skype interview from Colombia claiming that Escobar ordered the hit. He said: 'I am 100 percent sure that ... Kris Maharaj had nothing to do with the assassinations.' Furthermore, a former U.S. government informant, Baruch Vega, said on Wednesday he learned at the time that the killings were arranged by a top cartel boss who had the hotel room across the hall from where the Moo Youngs were slain. An American pilot who flew cocaine shipments for the cartel also testified that he heard Escobar say he ordered the killing, telling prosecutors: 'You got the wrong guy.' A lawyer who investigated the Moo Youngs' finances for a life insurance company testified that their business records suggested they were money laundering, although they were depicted as legitimate businessmen in the 1987 trial. Prosecutors said the defense case consisted entirely of hearsay and unproven allegations. The Moo Youngs' financial records did not change the case 'one iota,' prosecutor Penny Brill said. The fingerprints of Maharaj, a once wealthy businessman who divided his time between Britain and Florida, were found in the hotel room where the murders took place and he had a long-running feud with Derrick Moo Young, prosecutors said. The money-laundering evidence was 'absolute rubbish,' said Shaula Ann Nagel, the daughter of Derrick Moo Young, who sat through some of the hearing. As for the new witnesses, 'why weren't they here 27 years ago?' she said.","Businessman Kris Maharaj was convicted of Miami double murder  in 1986 .

"Eamon Bradley (pictured) gave detectives an extensive account of his role in the Syria civil war, a court heard . A Northern Ireland man charged with receiving weapons training from opposition forces in the Syrian civil war has told police he was involved in battles against both Islamic State and the government regime. Eamon Bradley, from Londonderry, has given detectives an extensive account of his role in the bloody conflict earlier this year, the city's magistrates court was told. Bradley, 25, from the Creggan area of the city, was arrested in Derry on Thursday only days after returning from Syria. He appeared in court today under UK terror legislation with committing two offences in Syria - possession of explosives with intent to endanger life, namely a grenade, and receiving training in arms and explosives. Dressed in a black T-shirt, bearded Bradley, who the court heard converted to Islam five years ago, spoke only to confirm his date of birth and that he understood the charges he faces. He was remanded in custody after his application for bail was refused by District Judge Barney McElholm. A detective sergeant with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) told the judge he could connect the accused with the charges. The officer said Bradley answered all questions during two days of questioning at Antrim police station. 'During this account he stated, having converted to the Muslim faith and becoming aware of the conflict in Syria, he determined that he would travel to Syria to help the people,' he said. 'He described to police contact with people he doesn't identify on the internet which assisted him to getting to the Syrian/Turkish border, which is a known crossing point into Syria for the on-going conflict.' The officer said Bradley, an Irish citizen, flew to Turkey from Dublin in February and stayed at various locations near the Syrian border for two months. 'That's where he learned more about Islam and various groups and groupings in the area,' he said. The officer said Bradley told detectives he assembled with a group of men and went over the border into Syria via a river crossing. 'Mr Bradley has informed police that he attended a training camp under the control of a group called Jaysh Al Islam, which translated is Army of Islam,' he said. Bradley, 25, from the Creggan area of the city, was arrested in Derry on Thursday - only days after returning from Syria . 'He was there for a period of approximately two months. He stated he received training in this camp in AK47 firearms, he mentions other firearms, he also mentions mortars and other explosive weapons. 'He claimed that he signed up to be part of the Mujahedeen knowing they would be fighting to overthrow the Baath regime - the Syrian government - and fighting against Isil.' The detective added: 'During his account with police he stated he was actively involved in three battles in Syria - two against the Baathist regime and one against Isil. 'In course of those battles he was armed with an AK47 and numerous magazines of ammunition and a grenade.' The officer said Bradley had stressed to police that he did not use any of the weapons during the battles. He said the accused told officers he was in a group of around 20 men who were armed with heavy artillery including mortars and tanks. He said the opposing side was similarly armed but also had planes.

"A novice treasure hunter who bought a basic metal detector returned to the shop in shock weeks later, clutching part of the country's finest ever hoard of Late Roman gold coins. The man stunned staff by showing them 40 gold Solidi, before asking them: 'What do I do with this?' They contacted local experts and together got the permits they needed, headed back to the scene and pulled up another 119 gleaming pieces. The hoard could be worth more £100,000. These late Roman gold coins were been found by a metal detectorist on private land north of St Albans in Hertfordshire. The find is believed to be one of the largest Roman gold coin hoards ever discovered in the UK . David Sewell, the lucky shopkeeper who joined the second search party, said: 'It’s a staggering thing. 'We sold this guy an entry-level machine and he went off and pulled off one of the largest ever hoards of Late Roman gold coins. We believe it’s the second largest. 'He came up with approximately 40 coins to start with. He came to see us and we looked at it and thought: ‘Is this a stunt?’ 'I’ve heard in the past that the general reaction with things like this is that people are terrified. They don’t know what they (the artefacts) mean.' They advised the man to get in touch with the local finds liaison officer and armed with a JCB they went to the woodlands spot near St Albans, Hertfordshire, and continued the work. Mr Sewell, who founded metal detecting shop Hidden History with Mark Becher in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, last year, said: 'We went with them and took with us a couple of slightly more potent machines and we pulled 119 more coins out of the ground. 'These are 22 carat gold, they haven’t got any damage and they came out of the ground looking like the day they were made. All I can say is I was there and my heart was going at 10 to the dozen.' The find has been referred to experts at the British Museum to investigate and prepare a report for the local coroner . The man had bought a Garrett Ace 150, retailing at around £135 and described as being ideal for children to use for a hobby. Local heritage officials described the find as 'a nationally significant find.' The coins are a rare example of the Solidus, dating from the last days of Roman rule in Britain. The last consignments of them reached these shores in 408AD. Officials refused to identify the exact site of the discovery or the landowner to stop others from trying to cash in. They also would not name the person who found them, who could profit from a share of the proceeds from the coins. A spokesman for St Albans City and District Council said: 'A nationally significant find of 159 Late Roman gold coins has been found by a metal detectorist on private land in the north of the district of St Albans, in Hertfordshire. 'I've found bits and pieces but nothing . like this. I've got immense satisfaction that the guy came to us and . bought the machine from us but I would be lying if I said I didn't wish . it had been me.' Shopkeeper David Sewell . 'The find is believed to be one of the largest Roman gold coin hoards ever discovered in the UK.' Local museum staff, together with Hidden History, travelled to the rural site to confirm the find. 'Evidence suggests that the hoard was disturbed in the last couple of hundred years due to quarrying activity or plough action,' said the spokesman. Mr Sewell said the coins were found across about 15 metres of woodland. It is believed that the area was used during the Second World War to cultivate crops and it may be then that the coins were shifted. 'The interesting thing is there were no other artefacts there at all, no brooches,' said Mr Sewell. 'Oddly there was no vessel at all to hold them. It is quite a significant stash and I’m surprised that it would have been in an organic holder. The council has now referred the hoard to experts at the British Museum to investigate and prepare a report for the local coroner. They will also determine the value of the coins, which could fetch anything from £400 to £1,000 apiece. The coroner will then determine whether the hoard counts as treasure. David Thorold, curator of the prehistory to medieval section at the Verulamium Museum, in St Albans, said: 'Gold Solidi were extremely valuable coins and were not traded or exchanged on a regular basis. 'They would have been used for large transactions such as buying land, or goods by the shipload. 'The gold coins in the economy guaranteed the value of all the silver and especially the bronze coins in circulation. However, must people would not have had regular access to them. 'Typically, the wealthy Roman elite, merchants or soldiers receiving bulk pay were the recipients.' Mr Sewell, who resumed detecting three years ago after a 36-year gap, has himself found a number of items, including a rare silver Tealby Penny. He said: 'I’ve found bits and pieces but nothing like this. I’ve got immense satisfaction that the guy came to us and bought the machine from us but I would be lying if I said I didn’t wish it had been me. 'It beggars belief. Thanks to things like Time Team people’s interest in archaeology has really taken off. You do have the possibility to change history.'","Man returned to shop where he bought the detector with 40 of the coins .

"Electronic cigarettes can help smokers kick the habit boosting quitting rates by 60 per cent compared with nicotine patches, gum or relying on will power alone, new research has found. The findings, published today, follow a survey of 5,863 smokers in England who attempted to stop smoking without aid of prescription medication or professional support. Of those using e-cigarettes, a fifth reported having quit 'real' cigarettes at the time the study was carried out. The research, published in the journal Addiction, suggests that e-cigarettes could play a positive role in reducing smoking rates, say experts. A survey carried out by a team at the University of London found a fifth reported having 'quit' real cigarettes after using the electronic alternative . Study leader Professor Robert West, from University College London, said: 'E-cigarettes could substantially improve public health because of their widespread appeal and the huge health gains associated with stopping smoking. 'However, we should also recognise that the strongest evidence remains for use of the NHS stop-smoking services. 'These almost triple a smoker’s odds of successfully quitting compared with going it alone or relying on over-the-counter products.' The same team, chiefly funded by Cancer Research UK, also found that most e-cigarette use involved first-generation ‘cigalike’ products rather than newer devices that use refillable cartridges and a wider choice of nicotine concentrations and flavours. Co-author Dr Jamie Brown, also from University College London, said: 'We will continue to monitor success rates in people using e-cigarettes to stop smoking to see whether there are improvements as the devices become more advanced.' The study found the e-cigarettes are more effective in helping someone kick the habit than nicotine patches and gum . Prof West acknowledged that some quitters may want to keep using e-cigarettes indefinitely, and it was not clear whether or not this carried long-term health risks. But he added: 'From what is known about the contents of the vapour these will be much less than from smoking. 'Some public health experts have expressed concern that widespread use of e-cigarettes could ""re-normalise"" smoking. 'However, we are tracking this very closely and see no evidence of it. 'Smoking rates in England are declining, quitting rates are increasing and regular e-cigarette use among never smokers is negligible.' Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK’s head of tobacco policy, said: 'Smoking is the largest preventable cause of cancer and accounts for more than one in four cancer deaths in the UK - so helping smokers to stop is a vital contribution to the health of the UK. 'E-cigarettes may have a role in helping people to quit smoking but while the rapid rise in their popularity suggests a real opportunity, the evidence for their effectiveness is so far limited. 'Cancer Research UK is funding much-needed research into e-cigarette use to help inform policy development and individuals’ choices, and research such as this is helping to paint a clearer picture.' E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices marketed as a way of helping people quit smoking . Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices which simulates smoking. The design was patented in 1963, and uses a heating element known as an atomiser that vaporises a liquid solution. Some e-cigarettes contain a mixture of nicotine and flavourings, will others release a flavoured nicotine-free vapour. They . are sold in flavours like chocolate and strawberry that are banned in . conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to young people. The devices are largely designed to look like cigarette and are marketed as a method of helping people quit the habit. But experts have widely debated the benefits of e-cigarettes. A . recent study by scientists at the University of California's Centre for . Tobacco Control Research and Education in San Francisco has shown . teenagers who use the battery powered devices are more likely to smoke . traditional cigarettes and less likely to quit smoking, the research . showed. As the popularity . of e-cigarettes - promoted as a way to help people quit smoking - . increases, scientists have found that ‘the wild west marketing of . e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them, but also it is . promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth’. 'Despite . claims that e-cigarettes are helping people quit smoking, we found that . e-cigarettes were associated with more, not less, cigarette smoking . among adolescents,’ said lead author of the study Lauren Dutra. She . added: ‘E-cigarettes are likely to be gateway devices for nicotine . addiction among youth, opening up a whole new market for tobacco.’ A . study of nearly 40,000 youngsters in the U.S. found that e-cigarette . use among school students doubled between 2011 and 2012, from 3.1 per . cent to 6.5 per cent.","Survey of 5,863 smokers in England found e-cigarettes aid help people quit .

"Incest laws could be scrapped in Germany after the government's ethics council said sex between brothers and sisters should be legal and is a 'fundamental right'. The council recommended that the right of 'adult siblings to sexual self-determination' was more important then the 'abstract idea of protection of the family'. It comes after the case of Patrick Stuebing, who was jailed for more than three years after having four children - two of which are disabled  - with his sister Susan Karolewski. The German Ethics Council has suggested that sex between brothers and sisters should be legalised . Stuebing was put up for adoption as a toddler and only met his sister when he was 24 and she was 16. He was imprisoned for incest in 2008. He made an unsuccessful appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in 2012 over his right to a family life - as he and Ms Karolewski were split up and three of their children were taken into care. The youngest was allowed to remain with Ms Karolewski. The German Ethics Council said in a statement that 'criminal law is not the appropriate means to preserve a social taboo', adding that the risk of disability to children is enough to warrant incest being illegal. the suggestion of decriminalising incest comes after the case of Patrick Stuebing, who was jailed for more than three years after having four children - two of which are disabled - with his sister Susan Karolewski . 'Neither the consequences for the family nor the possibility for descendants from such incestuous relationships can justify a ban under criminal law,' it said. 'Incest between siblings appears to be very rare in Western societies according to the available data but those affected describe how difficult their situation is in light of the threat of punishment. Patrick Stuebing, born in Leipzig, Germany in 1977, was fostered at the age of three after being attacked with a knife by his alcoholic father, and did not meet his mother or sister again until he was 23. He says his relationship with Susan Karolewski became incestuous six months after their mother died from a heart attack in 2001, and Ms Karolewski gave birth to their first child in October of that year, when she was 16. Two of their children have severe mental and physical disabilities, and another has a heart condition which required a transplant. Stuebing was sentenced to 10 moths in prison after his second incest conviction, and then a further two and a half years for his third conviction. 'They feel their fundamental freedoms have been violated and are forced into secrecy or to deny their love. 'The Ethics Council has been told of cases where half-siblings did not grow up together and have only met in their adult lives,' The Independent reported it saying. Despite saying that sex between brothers and sisters should be made legal, the council recommended that sex between parents and children should remain against the law. It is believed that incest increases the risk of children being born with disabilities, but the Ethics Council dismissed this as an argument for it being illegal, saying that couples with genetic defects are not banned from having children. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party have been quick to push away the idea of legalising incest. Spokeswoman Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker said that it would give out the wrong signal, telling Deutsche Welle: 'Abolishing criminal punishment against incestuous actions within a family would go completely against protecting the undisturbed development of children.' Around two to four per cent of Germans have had 'incestuous experiences', according to an estimate by the Max Planck Institute reported by The Telegraph. Incest is illegal in the UK and most of Europe, though sex between consenting adults who are related is legal in France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands.","Council spoke of right of 'adult siblings to sexual self-determination'

"Mysterious bright lights in the sky have been baffling astronomers and amazing the public from coast to coast all weekend. Reports of unusual red and blue lights streaking across the sky from San Francisco to Washington DC have been coming in since Friday, with seasoned sky watchers claiming that they are moving too slow to be meteors. Some have speculated that they could be a secret missile test or space junk falling to earth, but as of Monday morning there was no word from NASA or the Defense Department to confirm either of these theories. Scroll Down for Video . What is it? The light lit up the sky from the West Coast of the country to the East Coast over the weekend . Social media lit up on Saturday on the West Coast as more than 100 people from British Columbia to San Francisco saw a strange streak of light tear across the night sky. 'I am used to seeing planes early in the morning with lights, but this was different,”' said one bystander. 'This had something coming out of it, it wasn’t just the light. I could see it spraying something.' On Sunday evening on the other side of the country, reports began coming in of a bright light in the sky witnessed from Pittsburgh to New York City. Lighting up the sky: According to experts the trail behind the light appears to be vapour and is too long to be a genuine shooting star . Unusual: The lights appeared to witnesses from over the weekend - but the US Air Force have denied any missile tests took place . Described as a bright white or yellow flash, the American Meteor Society was inundated with eye witness accounts. Despite there being two meteor showers taking place currently across the northern hemisphere, astronomers are unsure if the evidence points towards shooting stars. The Southern Taurid meteor shower usually produces shooting stars and the less well known Piscids usally peak in later September and October. Bing Quock of the Morrison Planetarium at the California Academy of Scienes said that he needs to see more evidence. 'Looking at the website of the American Meteor Society, it looks like there are several reports of a large bright object falling through the sky,' he said to CBS San Francisco. 'It’s rather unusual in that this one had a rather large tail following behind it.' Geral McKeegan of the Chabot Space and Sciene Center in Oakland had interesting conclusions. 'We’re thinking maybe it was either a piece of space junk that has fallen out of orbit and into our atmosphere or it might have been some kind of a missile test launch,' said McKeegan. However, the US Air Force Based at Vandenburg said no missile launches have taken place this weekend.","Sky lit up by unusual blue lights from San Francisco to Washington DC .

"The world's only surviving original Creme Egg has been unearthed and gone on display for the first time - although experts admit they don't know what it tastes like. Chocolate company Fry's launched the Creme Egg in 1963 before it was later rebranded by Cadbury when it took over the company in 1971. But the only surviving original example of the original Creme Egg has now been found in the archive of American food giant Kraft-owned Cadbury. The world's only surviving original Creme Egg has been unearthed and gone on display for the first time. The egg has not been unwrapped since rolling off the production line 50 years ago . Chocolate company Fry's launched the Creme Egg in 1963 before it was later rebranded by Cadbury when it took over the company in 1971 . Researchers unearthed the egg so it could be displayed in an exhibition called Chocolate! at the M Shed museum in Bristol. The egg has not been unwrapped since rolling off the production line 50 years ago. Graham Tratt, archivist at Bristol Records Office, spent six months researching chocolate for the exhibition. He said: 'This is the original, it is how the Cadbury Creme Egg started. We don't know what it tastes like because we don't want to unwrap it and spoil it. A second Fry's egg, dating from between 1963 and 1971 was found in the same container as the fully wrapped one. Right, Margaret Thatcher tours a Cadbury chocolate factory in 1979 . 'The Fry's eggs were launched in 1963 and rebranded as Cadbury's in 1971. The Cadbury's egg was very similar, although possibly a little bigger than the original.' Chocolate eggs filled with cream were first manufactured by the Cadbury Brothers in 1923 but the Creme Egg in its current form was not introduced until 1963. Containing white and yellow fondant filling, the eggs are only available during the Creme Egg season between January and April. Modern Creme Eggs are now the best-selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200million. However, recent sales figures have shown that the nation is falling out of love with the chocolate Easter egg. In 1919, Cadbury merged with J.S. Fry & Sons Limited so that both companies could compete against Rowntree . The number of shell eggs sold last Easter fell by some 4.15 million -  5.5 per cent – as part of a trend that is expected to continue this year. It is a sad decline for a tradition that dates back to the production of the first solid dark chocolate Easter eggs by JS Fry's of Bristol in 1879. Chocolate! displays a history of chocolate and the part Bristol played in it and runs at M Shed until May 6. There are 15 different brands of chocolate on show, including a tin sent out by Queen Victoria to a soldier during The Boer War. Cocoa, not alcohol: Cadbury family values . The Cadbury family were one of the driving forces of philanthropy in the late stages of the Victorian era, when society grew more reflective on what had been an age of growing social and economic division. The industrial revolution had driven prosperity and attracted millions of people to the cities in search of work. Yet millions of those workers lived in abject poverty as characterised in the works of Charles Dickens and other authors. As Quakers, the Cadbury family . believed tea, coffee and cocoa beverages could serve as an alternative . to alcohol, seen to be a cause of poverty and deprivation among the . working classes. Workers at Fry's Cocoa & Chocolate factory in Bristol in 1930 . The Bournville factory was built in 1879 and, in 1893, as part of the company's altruistic vision, saw the creation of a 120-acre village of better housing for its workers. The Cadbury family was particularly concerned with the health of its workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans, and encouraging swimming, walking and other sports. In the 20th Century, Cadbury brands seeped into the public consciousness thanks to products such as Dairy Milk bars (1905), Milk Tray (1915), Bassett's Jelly Babies (1918), Flake (1920), Creme Egg (1923), Crunchie (1929), Cadbury Roses (1938), Picnic (1958) and Wispa (1983 - relaunched in 2008 due to demand from an online campaign).

"From the moment this tiny penguin came face to face with a mighty leopard seal in icy waters off the Antarctic Peninsula, its fate was sealed. The threatened bird tried in vain to swim away, but the enormous seal attacked with lightning speed, clamping its jaws around the penguin's foot to thwart its escape. The ravenous seal then dragged its prey further into the depths of the ocean, where it made short work of devouring the spoils of its successful hunt. Scroll down for video . Staring death in the face: The penguin comes face to face with its predator, an enormous leopard seal, in the waters of Port Lockroy off the Antarctic Peninsula . The graphic images were captured in 2009 in the waters of Port Lockroy, a natural harbour on the north-west shore of Wiencke Island, where colonies of penguins are a familiar sight. Younger birds often venture into the shallow water to play, oblivious to the dangers that can lurk beneath the surface where hunting leopard seals lie motionless, only to strike when an unfortunate penguin unwittingly strays too near. The seals ambush the penguins, dragging them deeper into the sea by their feet and drowning them. No escape: The penguin tries to swim for its life, but the leopard seal manages to clamp its jaws around one of the vulnerable bird's webbed feet . Trapped: Young penguins often play in the shallow waters of Port Lockroy, unaware of the danger lurking beneath the surface where mighty leopard seals lie in wait . Lunge: When the young penguins get too close to the muscular leopard seals, the aggressive predators can attack with lightning speed . Feast: The leopard seal fastens its jaws around the penguin. The seals can devour up to 12 of the birds in a single day when they hunt in shallow waters . Ambushed: Leopard seals patrol the water around the edges of the ice at the Antarctic Peninsula, before grabbing the penguins by their feet and shaking the birds vigorously, then dragging their prey into deeper waters to be eaten . 'Young penguins go to the shallow water to play and they are not familiar with the leopard seals' ambushing act,' said Amos Nachoum, an Israeli Special Forces officer turned wildlife photographer who captured the incredible shots. 'The leopard seal gets into the shallow bay just before low tide and pretends to be a rock, placing its head in the water,' said Mr Nachoum, 63, who is a keen observer of the muscular predators. 'When the young penguins get too close the leopard snaps with lightning speed, catching a penguin, and in one smooth motion returns back to the deep water and proceeds to the drowning process.' The seals, also known as sea leopards, then strip the fur and feathers from the birds and devour them. When hunting in shallow waters, the sharp-toothed mammals can feast on up to 12 penguins in a single day. More often the leopard seals - the second largest species of seal in the Anarctic - hunt krill, squid and fish in the open sea. Feeding time: The second largest species of seal in the Antarctic, the sea leopard also feasts on krill, squid and fish, and occasionally other seals like crabeaters .

"A Mexican woman has become the oldest human to have ever lived after reaching the grand old age of 127 - but she lost her birth certificate four decades ago, it was claimed today. Leandra Becerra Lumbreras was said to have been born on August 31, 1887 - the year Queen Victoria celebrated her Golden Jubilee. She was 27 when the Second World War broke out, already a pensioner at 66 when Queen Elizabeth II ascended the British throne and 82 when man first set foot on the moon. Scroll down for video . Oldest human to have ever lived: Leandra Becerra Lumbreras was born on August 31, 1887 - the year Queen Victoria celebrated her Golden Jubilee . And the birthday girl's secret to a long life is eating well, sleeping for days on end and never getting married, according to her family. Miss Lumbreras reportedly fought in the 1910-1917 Mexican Revolution as a leader of the 'Adelitas' - women who went with their husbands to the battle front. The former seamstress, from the western Mexican city of Zapopan, has already buried her five children and several of her 20 grandchildren - the last died in 2013 aged 90. She also has 73 great-grandchildren and 55 great-great-grandchildren. Mexican authorities are now trying to provide a new birth certificate after she lost the original 40 years ago while moving house. Grandaughter Miriam Alvear, 43, told Mexico's El Horizonte newspaper that although she is now deaf and suffering from cataracts, Ms Lumbreras still often entertains her family with stories from a time long confined to history books. They include having to flee their homes and hide in caves to escape being forcibly recruited into the Mexican army. Extraordinary life: The birthday girl's secret to a long life is eating well, sleeping for days on end and never getting married, according to her family . Her only possessions help her remember years gone by - an old silver spoon made in 1847, a pair of gold earrings, a ring and an old pocket watch engraved with a steam train. 'She is entirely lucid. She blows your mind with her stories from the revolution. She was always a woman who fought' Miriam Alvear, grandaughter . She said: ‘She is entirely lucid. She blows your mind with her stories from the revolution. ‘She was always a woman who fought. She was still sewing and weaving until about two years ago. She never ceased to be active, that's why we think she's lived so long.’ According to Miss Alvear, she also talks about the three great loves of her life, one of which, Margarito Maldonado, was a famous revolutionary leader. Another granddaughter, Celia Hernandez, said that she sometimes sleeps for three days on end, but when she's awake likes to eat, talk and sing lullabies. Official record holder: Miss Lumbreras is 12 years older than Japan's Misao Okawa (pictured), currently the oldest documented living person in the world, according to Guinness World Records .

"Practicing hatha yoga three times a week could boost your brainpower, researchers have found. Researchers studied over 100 over 55s. They found after just eight weeks sedentary older adults' performance on tasks including information recall, mental flexibility and task-switching were improved. The researchers say skills 'that are relevant to everyday life were dramatically improved.' Hatha yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that involves meditation and focused breathing while an individual moves through a series of stylized postures. It has becopme the most popular form of yoga, and also its most basic. As a part of Hindu origin, tradition believes that Shuiva himself is the founder of hatha yoga/ . The findings involved 108 adults between the ages of 55 and 79 years of age, 61 of whom attended hatha yoga classes. The others met for the same number and length of sessions and engaged in stretching and toning exercises instead of yoga. At the end of the eight weeks, the yoga group was speedier and more accurate on tests of information recall, mental flexibility and task-switching than it had been before the intervention. The stretching-and-toning group saw no significant change in cognitive performance over time. The differences seen between the groups were not the result of differences in age, gender, social status or other demographic factors, the research team reported. Hatha yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that involves meditation and focused breathing while an individual moves through a series of stylized postures, said Neha Gothe, who led the study with University of Illinois kinesiology and community health professor Edward McAuley. The team reported its findings in The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences.. 'Hatha yoga requires focused effort in moving through the poses, controlling the body and breathing at a steady rate,' Gothe said. 'It is possible that this focus on one's body, mind and breath during yoga practice may have generalized to situations outside of the yoga classes, resulting in an improved ability to sustain attention. 'Participants in the yoga intervention group showed significant improvements in working memory capacity, which involves continually updating and manipulating information,' McAuley said. A second stretching-and-toning group saw no significant change in cognitive performance over time. 'They were also able to perform the task at hand quickly and accurately, without getting distracted. 'These mental functions are relevant to our everyday functioning, as we multitask and plan our day-to-day activities. 'Previous studies have found that yoga can have immediate positive psychological effects by decreasing anxiety, depression and stress, Gothe said. 'These studies suggest that yoga has an immediate quieting effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the body's response to stress,' she said. 'Since we know that stress and anxiety can affect cognitive performance, the eight-week yoga intervention may have boosted participants' performance by reducing their stress. 'The results of the study are only preliminary and involve a fairly short-term intervention, the researchers said. 'Further research is needed to confirm the results and reveal the underlying brain mechanisms at play.'","Illinois researchers found after just eight weeks sedentary older adults' performance on tasks improved .

"Hundreds of spectators were swept off their feet when the world's largest tidal bore surged up a river creating an exceptionally powerful wave. The victims were standing on the banks of the Qiantang River in China's Zhejiang province yesterday when the surge took them by surprise. The power of the river was exacerbated by Typhoon Trami, a devastating tropical storm which has swept across the region this week. Scroll down for video . Swept away: Bystanders were knocked over by a tidal bore which swept up the Qiantang River in Zhejiang province . Unbelievable: Those affected looked like they were in shock at the hugely destructive power of the surge . Unique: The tidal bore occurs roughly once a day but was significantly worsened yesterday by the arrival of Typhoon Trami . Bystanders were supposedly protected by barriers lining the banks of the Qiantang at the time of the surge. As well as knocking over spectators, the wave dragged off vehicles and flooded a water-treatment plant. The river had reached a height of 6.6m, with the surge adding an additional 1.3m. Surge: The wave overpowered the barriers and swept down into the town, drenching hundreds of spectators . Onslaught: The wave crashed over the levee and directly onto the car park where dozens of vehicles were standing . Aftermath: Cars, trucks and motorcycles suffered in the flash flood caused by the wave . The tidal bore in the Qiantang, which sees large waves created by the incoming tides from the East China Sea, is believed to be the biggest in the world and is the site of an annual Tide-Watching Festival.

"Former Arsenal frontman Gervinho has claimed manager Arsene Wenger showed no faith in him during two seasons with the Gunners. The Ivory Coast international flopped at the Emirates but has thrived since moving to Roma last summer. The 27-year-old believes his current employers have shown confidence in him, allowing him to show his full capabilities, something which he claims was not the case at Arsenal. Gervinho has thrived at Roma since leaving Arsenal and has claimed the Gunners showed no faith in him . The Ivory Coast international claims Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger didn't have confidence in him . Speaking ahead of Roma's Champions League clash with Manchester City on Tuesday, Gervinho said: 'I feel like a new player in Italy. It is very hard to have confidence in yourself when the coach does not have confidence in you - and it's clear at Arsenal that confidence was not shown in me. 'At Roma the coach and the staff showed confidence in me from the first day - and because of that I have been able to show exactly what I am capable of. ‘I don't feel like I have anything to prove in England. I think the proof of what I can do is shown by a coach that has confidence in me. 'Maybe Arsenal now think they should have shown more confidence in me - but that is not my problem. All my concentration is on a successful season with Roma.’ Gervinho scored 9 Premier League eague goals but was deemed a flop during his two seasons with Arsenal . Having helped Roma to a second-placed finish in Serie A last season, Gervinho is confident the Italians can progress from a Champions League group which includes Premier League champions Manchester City and Bundesliga title winners Bayern Munich. 'I can't think of any good reason why we should be scared of Manchester City - I don't see why we should fear Bayern Munich either,' said Gervinho. 'The way we are playing this season - there is no reason to think we can't beat anybody. The only team that we need to concentrate or think about is ourselves.

'The pressure is on them after losing their opening game - and we hope to take full advantage of that pressure - and leave Manchester with 3 points - which will put us in a great position to qualify.' ‘We want to win this group. We understand with the quality in the group that it will not be easy to win - but with the form that we are on anything is possible. Not just to win the group - but also to win The Champions League.

"Kim Lehmkuhl, 34, accused of not doing her job as City Clerk resigned on Monday in a biting email . A Pleasant Hill, California city clerk accused of tweeting during City Council meetings instead of taking minutes has resigned from her 'depressing' job with a biting email wishing 'good luck' to the 'schmuck' who has to take her place. Kim Lehmkuhl, 34, was elected as Pleasant Hill's clerk in 2012 and since has been criticized by the Mayor Tim Flaherty and other residents for writing opinionated Twitter updates during meetings instead of taking minutes. She was urged to resign. Lehmkuhl eventually left her position and not with a whimper but a fiery bang. IIn an email on Monday to Tim Flahrety she wrote, 'This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone.' Her burning email spewed even more pleasantries as she said, 'I wish the City the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by Council.' She called resident's comments during meetings 'racist' and filled with 'tinfoil hat' conspiracies. In her message, she also said sardonically to June Catalano, the city manager, 'Best of luck with your imminent unfunded pensions scandal.' 'This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone.' Martin Nelis, a spokesman for the City of Pleasant Hill, shared the letter today. Initially, Pleasant Hill Mayor Timothy Flaherty had replied graciously to Lehmkuhl's resignation, writing, 'Your decision is best for you and for the City of Pleasant Hill.' But at the council meeting Monday night, he was less diplomatic, according to Nelis, saying, 'Our municipal nightmare is over.' Lehmkuhl one threatened Flaherty by saying she would never resign. Nelis said Lehmkuhl's failure to produce minutes had been a source of friction, and he believes this is the first instance of a city clerk resigning in the middle of her tenure. 'It's been an embarrassment, if anything, for the city,' Nelis said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kim Lemkuhl called her job as City Clerk 'an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience' before taking a job in Washington D.C. Mayor Tim Flaherty along with Pleasant Hill residents are relieved that Kim Lehmkuhl has resigned . Residents had been urging the council to remove Lehmkuhl from office for months but since she was an elected official they could not immediately fire her. A Facebook page was created dedicated to tracking her lack of diligence in her job. Residents noted that Lehmkuhl would tweet opinionated and 'inappropriate' observations during meetings. Lemkuhl's Twitter as City Clerk has since been deleted. In March, the council had agreed to place a measure on the November ballot to change the clerk's position from an elected one to an appointed one. Despite her bitter exit, Lemkuhl once truly desired to work as City Clerk and even dedicated a website to her election for the position. Here is an image of the facebook page created by residents wishing to remove Lehmkuhl from her elected position . She wrote,'I would be honored to have the opportunity to serve our local community as your City Clerk.' She goes on to state her qualifications and says that she attended Columbia law school and worked for three years at a public interest law firm in Berkley. 'I am committed to helping Pleasant Hill residents stay engaged in our community, and to keeping City Hall accountable, ethical and transparent. I would appreciate your support,' she wrote on her site hoping to be elected. City Council member Micheal Harris told CBS that if he were Lehmkuhls new employer her would 'fire her on the spot.' Lehmkuhl took a job in Washington, D.C., with Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO that represents non-union workers according to her personal Twitter account.","Kim Lehmkuhl, 34, resigned as City Clerk on Monday after being criticized for not taking minutes and for tweeting during meetings .

"Relationship break-ups and embarking on the daunting search for a new job are two of the reasons behind a surge in tattoo removals in the U.S., experts say. Actresses Angelina Jolie, Megan Fox and Eva Longoria are among thousands of Americans, choosing to remove their body art. For mother-of-six, Jolie the co-ordinates of the birthplaces of her children were tattooed in place of her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's name. And actress Megan Fox had her Marilyn Monroe tattoo removed from her forearm, while Eva Longoria, Britney Spears and Pamela Anderson are among the Hollywood pin ups following suit. Scroll down for video . Actress Angelina Jolie had the tattoo bearing her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's name (left), removed, replacing it with an inking revealing the co-ordinates of the birthplaces of her six children . Revenue for tattoo removals has surged 440 per cent to an estimated $75.5 million over the last decade, Marketwatch reported. And the trend is catching on, with experts at IBIS World predicting it will peak at $83.2million in the next four years. Tattoo removal used to involve painful dermabrasion, acidic skin peels or literally cutting the image out and then patching the area with skin grafts. All these methods could leave horrendous scars. But such drastic action is no longer necessary. Laser technology was first used for tattoo removal 20 years ago and has come a long way since then. Tattoos are created by injecting ink about a millimetre into the dermis – the middle layer of your skin. As it doesn’t shed like the skin’s surface layers, the ink won’t wear away. The ink particles are too big to be broken down by the immune system so they remain there. The lasers work by splitting the ink into smaller fragments, allowing them to be broken down by the body and naturally excreted. Several colours of laser light are used to target different pigments. Transformers star Megan Fox has had a tattoo of Marilyn Monroe removed from her right forearm . Red light works best on blue, black and red inks; green light targets red and orange; near infrared works on dark pigments while another wavelength of infrared is absorbed by green and dark pigments. San Francisco-based plastic surgeon Michael Kulick, told Marketwatch most people opt for tattoo removals in their 30s and 40s. He said: 'What is attractive in your 20s is not so attractive in your 30s. 'The ideal color for removal is black because that tattoo will be at the same depth in the skin and the same wavelength for the laser to remove the ink. 'Now it’s very fashionable to have pastels and yellow, which is very difficult to remove.' He said common reasons for removal include relationship break-ups and job hunting. 'Increased social acceptability of and interest in tattoos has driven demand for them, which ultimately increased the pool of potential customers who may regret their initial decision and want their tattoos removed,' he added. And Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria is also among the Hollywood A-listers choosing to have their body art removed.

"Astronomers have discovered a black hole that is consuming gas from a nearby star 10 times faster than previously thought possible. The black hole, known as P13, lies on the outskirts of the galaxy NGC7793 about 12 million light years from Earth. Researchers say it is ingesting a weight equivalent to 100 billion billion hot dogs every minute. The black hole, known as P13, lies on the outskirts of the galaxy NGC7793 about 12 million light years from Earth, and researchers say it is ingesting a weight equivalent to 100 billion billion hot dogs every minute. The black hole, known as P13, lies on the outskirts of the galaxy NGC7793 about 12 million light years from Earth. Researchers say it is ingesting a weight equivalent to 100 billion billion hot dogs every minute. Scientists first noticed P13 because it was a lot more luminous than other black holes, but it was initially assumed that it was simply bigger. When Dr Soria and his colleagues from the University of Strasbourg measured the mass of P13 they found it was actually on the small side, despite being at least a million times brighter than the Sun. It was only then that they realised just how much material it was consuming. The discovery was published today in the journal Nature. International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research astronomer Dr Roberto Soria, who is based at ICRAR's Curtin University node, said that as gas falls towards a black hole it gets very hot and bright. He said scientists first noticed P13 because it was a lot more luminous than other black holes, but it was initially assumed that it was simply bigger. 'It was generally believed the maximum speed at which a black hole could swallow gas and produce light was tightly determined by its size,' Dr Soria said. 'So it made sense to assume that P13 was bigger than the ordinary, less bright black holes we see in our own galaxy, the Milky Way.' When Dr Soria and his colleagues from the University of Strasbourg measured the mass of P13 they found it was actually on the small side, despite being at least a million times brighter than the Sun. It was only then that they realised just how much material it was consuming. 'There's not really a strict limit like we thought, black holes can actually consume more gas and produce more light,' Dr Soria said. Scientists first noticed P13 because it was a lot more luminous than other black holes, but it was initially assumed that it was simply bigger. Dr Soria said P13 rotates around a supergiant 'donor' star 20 times heavier than our own Sun. He said the scientists saw that one side of the donor star was always brighter than the other because it was illuminated by X-rays coming from near the black hole, so the star appeared brighter or fainter as it went around P13. 'This allowed us to measure the time it takes for the black hole and the donor star to rotate around each other, which is 64 days, and to model the velocity of the two objects and the shape of the orbit,' Dr Soria said. 'From this, we worked out that the black hole must be less than 15 times the mass of our Sun.' Dr Soria compared P13 to small Japanese eating champion Takeru Kobayashi. 'As hotdog-eating legend Takeru Kobayashi famously showed us, size does not always matter in the world of competitive eating and even small black holes can sometimes eat gas at an exceptional rate,' he said. Dr Soria said P13 is a member of a select group of black holes known as ultraluminous X-ray sources. 'These are the champions of competitive gas eating in the Universe, capable of swallowing their donor star in less than a million years, which is a very short time on cosmic scales,' he said.","Black hole known as P13 lies  12 million light years from Earth .

"Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta has been offered a new one-year deal and is keen to extend his career at the club. Arteta signed three years ago from Everton for £10million and his contract is due to expire at the end of the season, by which time the Basque midfielder will be 33. Arsene Wenger’s standard policy for players over 30 is to offer them no more than 12 months at a time but this will suit Arteta, who inherited the captaincy from Thomas Vermaelen in the summer. Mikel Arteta is likely to extend his Arsenal contract, which expires at the end of the season . Negotiations are open and are unlikely to be affected by another niggling injury which will keep the skipper out of action until after the next international break. Arteta, ruled out for a month after twisting an ankle in Besiktas in August, hobbled off with a calf problem during Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham and faces another three weeks out. Aaron Ramsey pulled a hamstring in the same game and faces a month out, but there was a more optimistic medical bulletin for Wenger from Jack Wilshere, who hurt an ankle against Spurs but has been told there is no serious damage. The England midfielder has not yet been ruled out of facing Galatasaray in the Champions League tomorrow night.

"Samantha Lamb gave her husband one of her kidneys but he later walked out on her . A wife who saved her dying husband’s life by giving him one of her kidneys wants it back after he walked out on her. Andy Lamb was suffering from renal failure and was only being kept alive by dialysis sessions, until his wife Samantha persuaded him to take one of her kidneys. Mrs Lamb, 41, lost more than 3st in weight to make sure that she would be healthy enough for the transplant operation in October 2009. The couple were even filmed for a BBC show which documented the story of her gift  of love. But they did not live happily ever after. Just a few years after the life-saving procedure, their marriage was over when Mr Lamb walked out on his wife in August 2012. Mrs Lamb is adamant that her husband started having an affair with her friend – a claim he categorically denies. He moved his belongings out of their marital home one evening while she was working a night shift at Tesco. He also took the TV and stereo before posting the keys through the letterbox without a note or letter, she claims. The couple, from Ivybridge, Devon, met when they were both drivers for a private ambulance firm and started dating in 2004. After a brief split, when they had to live apart from each other for a short period of time, they decided to get married in 2007. However, Mr Lamb’s condition meant he soon became dependent on gruelling dialysis sessions. His wife explained: ‘He needed a new kidney or he would die. He was on dialysis three times a week. I told Andy he should go through with it [the transplant]. ‘He had children from an earlier relationship and he wanted to be there for them.’ Mrs Lamb says she now regrets donating the kidney to her husband and wishes she could have it back – if only to donate it to someone more deserving. She told the Sunday People: ‘I would definitely go through the operation again but I wouldn’t give the kidney to him. Samantha gave her husband her kidney to save his life but he ended the relationship . Happier times: Samantha Lamb and her husband Andy photographed in 2009 before the operation . ‘I hate him. If I could, then I would take it back and give it to someone else. ‘Obviously I don’t want people to be put off putting their names on the organ donor list. ‘But all I want from him is his name on the divorce papers.’ New life: Samantha Lamb pictured with her daughter Beatrice in May 2011 . Mr Lamb, 45, who denies having an affair with his wife’s friend, said: ‘I never wanted her to donate her kidney because it was a big risk. But she insisted and I’ll always owe her my life.’ He added: ‘I loved her but our relationship wasn’t working. We had big rows and her family never liked me. ‘Despite what Samantha believes, I have never been with her friend. I just helped her to train her dog.’ The mother-of-one now wants a divorce and says that she is trying to get on with her life – although she is reminded about the break-up whenever she sees her 4in operation scar. She does have one comfort, however, saying: ‘At least he always has to remember where his kidney came from.’","Andy Lamb was dying of renal kidney failure and was being kept alive by weekly sessions of dialysis .

"A woman was spurred into losing a third of her body weight after she had a stroke at the age of 21. Erin Townsend gained weight after having two children and ballooned to a size 20 on a diet of chocolate, chips and takeaways. At the age of just 21, she suffered a stroke and multiple blood clots - which medics blamed on her excess weight - and she was placed into an induced coma in order to save her life. Erin saw her weight rise to 15st 8lb after the birth of her two children and having the contraceptive injection . Erin was just 21 when she suffered a devastating stroke and blood clots, in part due to her weight (pictured left in hospital) She remained in the coma for three weeks as her brain started to swell and spent a further two months in hospital recovering. After regaining consciousness Erin had to learn to walk and talk again. It was during her recovery that she decided to shed the pounds. She joined a weight loss group and dropped more than five stone, reducing her diet to just 400 calories of milkshakes per day. Now aged 26, Erin has since married her partner Tommy and is committed to her new healthy lifestyle. She said: 'After I had the stroke I decided it was time to lose weight. 'I was just 21 years old when I had a stroke, it was a bit of a freak thing really, I had a load of blood clots as well. 'I was put into a coma because I kept fitting - it was just their way of giving my body a rest really. 'I was unconscious for about three weeks and I then had to spend a further two months in hospital in a bid to recover. Erin, pictured in hospital after suffering an obesity induced stroke, had tp spend two months recovering, including learning to walk again . After discharge from the hospital Erin began the Cambridge diet, which drastically cut her calories to kick start her weight loss . 'When I woke up the doctors told me I really needed to lose the weight or else there was a high risk that I would just have another stroke. 'When they were trying to explain why it might have happened they told me that my weight really didn't help things. 'When I left hospital I was in a wheelchair. I had lost my ability to walk and talk due to the coma and I had to start over again. 'Obviously I was aware that doctors told me I needed to lose weight but I couldn't walk which made losing weight quite difficult. 'It was about four months after I came out of hospital until I could really walk again, and then I started trying to lose weight.' Erin has now married her partner Tommy and is committed to her new healthy lifestyle . Erin, of Lincoln, saw her weight rise to to 15 stone 8lbs after the birth of her two children and having the contraceptive injection. At her largest she refused to go out with friends, would avoid looking in the mirror and would wear all black items of clothing to try to make herself look skinnier. She even refused to marry her long-term partner as she felt she was too fat to wear a wedding dress.

"A heavily polluted Paris was plunged into traffic chaos today as police handed out fines to drivers for using their cars illegally. A new policy introduced today means drivers in the French capital can only use their cars every other day - alternating for cars with odd and even number plates - in a bid to make the air cleaner.

"A self-styled 'ditzy' blonde TOWIE fan was today revealed as the one of the brainiest Essex girls around after it was discovered she has a higher IQ than Albert Einstein. Lauren Marbe, 16, stunned her teachers by scoring 161 on the Mensa brain test after she was entered with other pupils from her school. The teenager loves fake tanning, having blonde highlights, manicures and getting glammed up for TOWIE parties with her friend. But it appears that as well as being very pretty, she also has a beautiful brain. Bright spark: Lauren Marbe, 16, has an IQ of 161 which is smarter than Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking - but still loves trash TV like TOWIE . This daughter of a black cab driver and dreams of one day being a performer in the West End - like Essex celebrity Denise Van Outen. But her amazing brain test score means she is brighter than Professor Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and even Albert Einstein - who all have an IQ of 160. Brainbox Lauren has been enrolled in prestigious high-IQ society Mensa, which means she is officially in the top one per cent of cleverest people in the world. The schoolgirl, who is already predicted straight A's and A*'s for her GCSE's, and says she is delighted to have 'blown away' the Essex stereotype. Talented: Lauren could end up going to Cambridge but the pretty teenager dreams of being a star on the West End stage having already worked with Andrew Lloyd Webber . Lauren, of Loughton, Essex, said: 'It was such an achievement and I got a bit tearful to tell you the truth. Charles Dickens - 180 . Dr. David Livingstone - 170 . Charles Darwin -165 . Stephen Hawking – 160 . Quentin Tarantino – 160 . Bill Gates - 160 . Sharon Stone - 154 . Bill Clinton - 145 . Shakira - 140 . JFK - 119 . 'I was one of the last people to get my result and everybody before me had got around the 130 mark so that was the kind of result I was expecting. 'My teachers knew I was quite clever because of my grades but they had always thought I was blonde and a bit ditzy. 'Now they keep saying 'I didn't realise you were that clever'.' The teenager, who loves to look 'reem,' or great, added: 'I am blonde, I do wear make-up and I do go out. 'I love my fake tan and fake nails as well so I guess I am a bit of an Essex girl in that sense. 'I watch TOWIE and I love the programme, it's addictive but now most people do seem to think that's what everyone in Essex is like. 'I love living in Essex and I'm glad that I might be able to show people that we aren't all ditzy and blonde.' Passion: The 16-year-old hopes that she can use her brain to build a successful future but admits she was pleasantly surprised to have such a high IQ . Lauren, is a pupil at Roding Valley High School, Loughton, Essex, took the Mensa-accredited IQ test earlier this month along with other high acheivers at her school. The dedicated pupil - head girl of her primary school and currently a prefect - was already considered bright after scoring a double A* in her science GCSE, which she took a year early. But she was stunned when she received her results, showing she has a higher IQ than some of the world's greatest minds. She is now aiming to take A-Levels in art, physics and maths after her GCSEs, this summer, and would love to study architecture degree at the University of Cambridge. But the prodigal teenager has already performed in the West End for two years as part of the chorus for Andrew Lloyd Webber smash-hit Joseph, with Lee Mead, from 2007. Happy: Lauren admits that she is a typical Essex girl but hopes she can help change the reputation of young women from the county - who are often portrayed as dim . Her proud parents, father David Marbe, 45, a London cabbie, and mother Sue Marbe, 45, deputy head of a primary school, say they will be happy whichever path their gifted daughter chooses. Sue, 45, said: 'Living in this area there is a lot of pressure to be the stereotypical Essex girl but she has a a real nice support from the other girls. Teachers: 'They had always thought I was blonde and a bit ditzy', she said, but her IQ test has dispelled any myths about her intellect . 'Most of the time Essex gets a bit of a negative press. People think all girls are blonde and all girls are dim. 'Lauren is blonde but it does seem like she has shaken the stereotype that all Essex girls are stupid. 'She does love TOWIE but she sees it as what it is. A lot of the young people in Essex think that it is one of the only ways to be successful. 'Lauren and her friends aren't as bad as some of the girls in the area but they do like to dress up and look good. 'Essex girls are all well groomed and Lauren isn't any different. Her and her friends like to go out and get dressed up in nice clothes. 'There's nothing wrong with the TOWIE cast and everyone in Essex loves the programme but its just nice for us all to get a good reputation for academic success for a change.' 'Obviously I am really proud. I am quite shy and I don't like boasting but I am really pleased that she has done so well. 'All her teachers have been coming up to her and saying they didn't realise how intelligent se actually was. 'I don't know who she got it from. Me and my husband should get tested as well.' Einstein himself never took an IQ test as none of the modern intelligence tests existed during the course of his life. But experts have believed for a number of years now that the iconic scientist had an IQ of around 160 - just short of Essex's brightest teen. The Calculated IQ Estimates for 301 Historic Geniuses published by American Psychologist Catherine Cox Miles has calculated the IQ of Einstein and a number of other historic figures. The IQ test is designed to test a range of abilities to determine the level of intelligence of the student - in the UK the average score is 100. Enjoyment: Lauren says she likes to watch TOWIE and will sometimes dress like the women on the show . Lauren sat the Cattell III B test under supervision from British Mensa and achieved 161 - one point short of the maximum score you can get if you are under 18. Adults take the same test as the one Lauren sat but because they have more developed brains British Mensa will only score them a maximum of 161. This is because a different mathematical equation is used to convert an adult's score into an IQ rating, than is used to convert a child's. A number of different IQ tests exist and British Mensa will accept applicants into the exclusive group if they provide evidence of their exceptional performances in other respective tests. British Mensa Chief Executive John Stevenage said: 'Lauren Marbe achieved a score in the top two percent on a Mensa IQ test making her eligible to join Mensa. 'Lauren's school recently took advantage of Mensa's Schools Testing scheme allowing schools to offer IQ tests to pupils aged over 10 and a half within the school setting.'","Lauren Marbe, 16, wants to 'blow away' the negative view of Essex girls .

"Southern states have long been seen as the unhealthiest in the nation . Alabama and Mississippi regularly top the list as the 'fattest states in America' New study shows that there's a difference between recorded weights taken over the phone compared to those in-person . Tables are turned with 'truthful' southerners found to be less obese that their northern cousins . With some of America's tastiest, yet unhealthiest food, it's no wonder that for years, many have deemed people from the South to be amongst the fattest in the nation. Whether its because so much of the food is fried or simply because access to healthy food and vegetables is hard to come by, or because southerners don't do much exercise - the stereotype seems to have stuck. But a new study from the University of Alabama in Birmingham says that the South is not as fat as the rest of the world would have us believe. Epidemic: Rising levels of obesity is a major problem sweeping the United States . The journal Obesity, says that there’s a higher concentration of obese people in the Midwestern states of Minnesota, Kansas and North and South Dakota. The northern region of the country appears to have about 41 per cent obesity compared to 31 per cent in the southern states of Alabama and Mississippi. Just two years ago, the Center for Disease control claimed the two states were the fattest in the USA. Southerners definitely enjoy their fried chicken (not to mention fried steak, fried onions, fried green tomatoes, fried pickles and fried corn bread) but the northerners of states like Wisconsin and Illinois enjoy their fried cheese curds and deep dish pizzas. I'll have fries with that: Or maybe just fries on their own? The southern states are notorious for the unhealthy eating habits . Shocking: There are now 12 states where obesity levels are at 30 per cent or more . The region famous for its biscuits, barbecue and pecan pies has been struggling with its weight for years. So what are the reasons for this gut-busting turnaround? The journal believes that truth-telling has something to do with it. The Obesity journal believes those who took part in the CDC telephone survey in the South were simply more honest about their weight than those in the North. The University of Alabama conducted their survey in-person using actual recorded weights. Change in the numbers: Mississippi and Alabama found their obesity rate fall from 41 per cent to 31 per cent . Big statement: The report by the University of Alabama found that southerners were less likely to lie about their weight when asked over the telephone . They found the results to less than a similar survey which was carried out by the CDC over the phone. The UAB report suggests the results gathered by telephone may have been inaccurate with participants lying about the digits on their bathroom scales. In this latest survey, Mississippi was fourth and Alabama was in the middle of the pack. Truth be told: A study to measure obesity found that people who were asked their weight over the phone lied more if they were from the northern USA. George Howard, professor in the Department of Biostatics at UAB explained to Al.com his theory on why the results are so different. 'My speculation is that people in the South are telling the truth more. Perhaps there is not as much stigma connected to obesity as say someone in California, or in this case, Minnesota. The numbers shows the wide discrepancy between what people say on the telephone and the physical evidence of actually getting weighed. Everybody under-reports their weight but women do it more whereas men over-report their height, which makes them seem less obese.'","Southern states have long been seen as the unhealthiest in the nation .

"A woman who has been charged with rape after allegedly performing oral sex on a minor has stepped down from her position on a local school board. Molly Shattuck has resigned from her job on the board of the Baltimore School for the Arts in Baltimore, Maryland. Disgraced Shattuck was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors. Scroll down for video .

No job: Now, Shattuck is stepping down from her position on the board of the Baltimore School for the Arts (above) She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware. A spokeswoman for Baltimore City Public Schools told Fox News that Shattuck resigned from the board on Wednesday . The ill-feted relationship had begun at the end of May when Shattuck - the estranged wife of billionaire businessman Mayo Shattuck III - commented on a photo of the teen on Instagram. The victim replied with a private message of thanks, but Shattuck's son then forwarded his mother's cell phone number, saying, ‘You should text my Mom, she is obsessed with you,’ according to court records. The pair first met a month later while the teen was visiting a friend in her neighborhood, reports DelawareOnline. The inappropriate sexual relationship between Molly Shattuck, a former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader, and the 15-year-old boy reportedly happened in August 2013. Above Shattuck is pictured with her estranged husband Mayo and their three children . The meeting ended with a hug but no other physical contact between the 47-year-old mom and 15-year-old boy, court records said. Things soon moved up a gear as the pair started to meet for regular private trysts in Shattuck’s Cadillac Escalade. Court records show that a meeting at an AMC movie theater followed by another in a school parking lot. During July, Shattuck picked the teenager up from summer school ‘five or six times’ at lunchtime and they would ‘talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out,’ police said. It was during one of these incidents that Shattuck allegedly touched the teenager's penis. ‘Between their encounters, Shattuck asked for pictures via text message’ and he would send pictures of himself shirtless and one in his underwear, the victim told police. For Labor Day weekend Shattuck rented this beach house in Bethany Beach where she is alleged to have plied her 15-year-old victim with beer before performing oral sex on him at least twice . A holiday to remember? Shattuck tweeted about her trip to Bethany Beach over the Labor Day weekend . For Labor Day weekend Shattuck took her children and some of their friends - including the victim - to stay at a rented beach house in Bethany Beach.

Once back at the house, Shattuck is alleged to have performed oral sex on the boy at least twice - first outside the home while walking the dog and then again in her bedroom. The documents state '(the boy) described the undergarments (Molly) Shattuck was wearing when he entered her bedroom.' Shattuck is alleged to told the boy 'if he wanted to have sex she would. The boy opted out. He decided to leave. At that point, she told him to come back later but he did not go back.' The next day the boy's father collected him. Shattuck was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware . Molly Shattuck is separated from billionaire business executive Mayo Shattuck III, 60, the current chairman of energy provider Exelon . Shattuck is also alleged to have sent the teen pictures through Instagram of him taken at the beach over the Labor Day weekend. On September 26, the boy's family reported Shattuck to the police who executed a search warrant at her $2.5 million home on October 1. The search warrant led investigators to seize her cell phone and her computer. Detectives also specifically sought a pink lace bra and panties that the victim described her as wearing in the bedroom of her beach house. The grand jury indictment against Shattuck reveals that the two counts of rape in the third degree are for 'putting her mouth on his penis.' There four counts of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree are 'touching his penis,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her breasts with his mouth,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his hand,' and for causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his penis.' The three counts of providing alcohol to minors are for providing alcohol to three different minors. Shattuck is also a fitness consultant and advocate and published a book in February called Vibrant Living . Shattuck is separated from Mayo Shattuck III, 60, the billionaire former CEO of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Nuclear Group and the current chairman of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., also an energy provider. The couple have three children - Spencer, 15, Lillian, 11, and Wyatt, 8. 'This is a difficult situation for everyone involved,' her lawyers told DelawareOnline. In 2005, Baltimore native Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad on her first tryout. She cheered for two years and was a part-time coach for six more years. Police executed a search warrant at Molly Shattuck's $2.5 million five-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom Maryland home on October 1 . Shattuck is also a fitness consultant and advocate, who published a book in February called Vibrant Living. According to her website, which is currently in 'maintenance mode', she has implemented a 21-day plan for health and improved living with people, companies and groups across the U.S. for the past several years. A cached version of her biography on the site says she is an ambassador for the American Diabetes Association and works with the American Heart Association and United Way of Central Maryland's Access to Healthy Food Initiative. She's a trustee of the United Way of Central Maryland, and a member of boards for the Baltimore School for the Arts, the Johns Hopkins Children's Center and the National Children's Museum.

"Dark past: Delvin Barnes, 37, is accused of kidnapping, raping and setting alight a teenage girl in Virginia a month before allegedly abducting a 22-year-old woman in Philadelphia . Nearly a month to the day before career criminal Delvin Barnes allegedly abducted a 22-year-old nursing student in Philadelphia, police say he kidnapped, raped and burned a 16-year-old girl in Virginia. The 37-year-old man is now expected to face federal charges in the November 2 abduction, but first he will be extradited to Virginia in connection to the October 1 kidnapping in Richmond. Barnes was captured Wednesday in Jessup, Maryland, three days after surveillance cameras caught him shoving Carlesha Freeland-Gaither into the backseat of his Ford Taurus sedan in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. The missing nursing student was discovered in the suspect's vehicle three days later, alive but suffering from minor injuries. She was treated at an area hospital and released to her family Thursday. In the hours after Barnes' dramatic capture, new details have emerged about his violent past, reflected in his lengthy criminal record. Delvin Barnes was wanted on an outstanding warrant for attempted capital murder, abduction, forcible rape and malicious wounding with a chemical in Charles City County, Virginia. The 37-year-old divorced grocery store clerk from Henrico, Virginia, is suspected of kidnapping a 16-year-old girl from Richmond, who was reported missing by her family October 1, according to CNN. Two days later, the teenager stumbled into a business located two miles away from Barnes’ house, naked, bloodied and covered in third-degree burns. Charles City County Sheriff's Office Captain Jason Crawley said that the victim had been doused with bleach and gasoline, and then set alight by her attacker, later identified as Delvin Barnes. Scroll down for video . First crime scene: The home of Delvin Barnes sits unoccupied in Charles City, Virginia, where he allegedly raped, burned and attempted to kill a 16-year-old girl last month . Capt. Jayson Crawley, front at podium, of the Charles City County Sheriff's Office, speaks during a news conference in the county courthouse Thursday about the charges against Delvin Barnes . More than a month later, the girl remains in a hospital recovering from her injuries. When interviewed by police, the 16-year-old said that a stranger struck her in the head with a shovel and stuffed her into the trunk of his Ford sedan - the same vehicle that was seized in Jessup, Maryland, Wednesday evening following an FBI stakeout that resulted in Barns' arrest. The assailant then drove the girl down to his parents' home in Charles City County and sexually assaulted her. Two days later, the suspect dragged the girl into the backyard, poured bleach and gasoline over her, torched her clothes and dug a hole in the ground, according to police. ‘How do you want to die?’ he asked, the teen told detectives. When the kidnapper got distracted, the terrified girl used the opportunity to run away, fleeing into the woods. The girl later told police that in the course of her captivity, her attacker showed her pictures of other girls bragging that he had done the same things to them as he did to her. Gone girl: Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, (left and right), was rescued in Jessup, Maryland, three days after she was snatched by a stranger in Philadelphia on her way home from visiting her godson . Kidnapping in progress: Surveillance cameras captured the moment a man in a hooded jacket dragged Freeland-Gaither to his car . Key clue: The 16-year-old kidnapping victim in Virginia told police that her assailant stuffed her in the trunk of his Ford Taurus, believed to be the same vehicle seen here . Police are now trying to determine if there are more victims out there. Officials entered DNA evidence collected from the 16-year-old's body into a national database, and on October 28 - less than a week before the Philadelphia abduction - Delvin Barnes' name came up. The 37-year-old supermarket worker has had numerous run-ins with the law over the years, ranging from minor traffic violations to aggravated assault and false imprisonment. According to court documents, in November 2005, Barnes was arrested for holding his estranged wife captive in her home, repeatedly forcing her to have sex with him, viciously beating and choking her, attacking her parents who came to her rescue and threatening the woman with a knife. The wife, who had a restraining order against Barnes, was eventually able to run for help, prompting the attacker to flee. Barnes was captured by police the following day and convicted in 2006 of aggravated assault, criminal trespassing, false imprisonment, simple assault, reckless engagement and other counts. After serving eight years in prison, Mr Barnes resurfaced again this past July when he was arrested for making a bomb threat. The charge, a felony, was later downgraded to misdemeanor trespassing, and in late October the case was dropped altogether. 'He's a vicious predator, he's off the streets, and hopefully he'll be in jail for the rest of his life,’ Philadelphia Commissioner Charles Ramsey said during a press conference Wednesday night. Seized: A GPS device had been installed on the suspect's car by the dealer in case the vehicle needed to be repossessed .

Law enforcement officers Freeland-Gaither's house in Philadelphia Thursday, November 6 . Family friends arrive at the home of Carlesha Freeland-Gaither in Philadelphia on Thursday after her release from the hospital . Lamar Barnes, Delvin's uncle, told NBC Philadelphia that his nephew grew up in the family of a minister, but he has had 'problems with women' growing up. ‘It's hard for me to accept the viciousness of it, I'm not necessarily surprised,’ he said. Ironically, it was Delvin Barnes' bad credit history, not his expansive criminal history, that has led to his eventual downfall. Law enforcement officials got their big break when they saw the used-car dealer's name on a traffic-camera image of Barnes' vehicle and asked the dealership to turn on the GPS unit, said sheriff's Capt. Jayson Crawley of Charles City County, Virginia. 'We called the dealership and within five minutes they had the location,' he said. He said the dealership sells to customers with poor credit and routinely puts GPS devices on its vehicles so they can be easily located and repossessed if the owners fall behind on the payments. Carlesha Freeland-Gaither had been seen on surveillance video being grabbed by a man and pulled toward a car Sunday night as she struggled to get away. In the days afterward, police and federal authorities released a stream of images from surveillance cameras showing a man using Freeland-Gaither's bank card and walking through a gas station minimart in Maryland. Police did not disclose a motive for the kidnapping. Authorities said there was no indication Freeland-Gaither and Barnes knew each other.

A Maryland judge ordered Barnes sent to Virginia following a hearing at which the suspect, appearing by video, answered the judge's questions with ""Yes, sir"" and ""No, sir."" He did not have an attorney with him. No immediate charges were filed in the Philadelphia case. Agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents found his vehicle, its rear window kicked out, on a road in Jessup, with Barnes and Freeland-Gaither inside. A witness to her abduction had said the young woman kicked out some of the car's windows before it sped off. 'Carlesha is a very resilient and tough young woman,' Philadelphia police Inspector James Kelly said. 'She resisted to the best of her abilities.' He said her family told police she is doing well but 'needs some time and space to heal.'","Delvin Barnes, 37, charged with attempted capital murder in connection to October 1 kidnapping in Richmond, Virginia .

"He was a friend of James Dean and made a career from photographing the stars of Hollywood's Golden Age but photographer Dennis Stock never quite managed to achieve the name recognition of his stellar subjects. Now that could be about to change following news that the photographer's life story is to be turned into a film starring Robert Pattinson. But before the film is released next year, a new book devoted to his star-studded career has been launched and sheds light on his career following Dean's death. Portrait of an era: A striking photograph of the Venice Beach Rock Festival in California taken in 1968 . Rich and poor: A 1969 portrait of a farming couple (left) and a 1958 shot of jazz singer Louis Armstrong . Written by Tony Nourmand and Graham Marsh, the tome, Dennis Stock: American Cool, includes some of the late snapper's most striking images, among them his 1955 shot of a then unknown Dean walking through Times Square in New York. Stock's career-defining friendship with Dean is also the subject of director Anton Corbijn's upcoming biopic, Life, which is scheduled to arrive in cinemas next year with Pattinson in the lead role. But as the book reveals, there is more to Stock's oeuvre than his work with Dean. Following the actor's tragically early death, Stock went on to produce stunning photographs of Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and assassinated president John F. Kennedy among others. Later, he turned his attention to the world of jazz and produced some of the best images ever created of period singers such as Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Miles Davies and Louis Armstrong. Iconic: Stock's classic 1955 portrait of James Dean walking through a haunted looking Times Square . Relaxed: A 1959 photograph of American actor John Wayne on the set of the Western film, Alamo . Artist: The new book celebrating Stock's work (left) and the man himself next to one of his photos (right) Taken in smoke-filled rooms, listening intently to other musicians, totally relaxed and un-posed, they reflect Stock's ability to instill confidence in his subjects. 'He had the ability to see a shot, as well as react to unforeseen situations, and to produce a photograph that captured the situation or the essence of an individual,' explains Dr Michael Pritchard, director general of the Royal Photographic Society, who wrote the introduction to the book. And Pritchard isn't the only one to single out Stock's unerring eye and empathetic manner. 'I think what made Dennis such a magnificent photographer was his empathy, whether for the rich and famous or the downtrodden and anonymous,' adds former friend and colleague, Michael Shulman. Writing in the foreword to the book, he adds: 'He was never condescending but always aware of our shared humanity. 'We have his amazing photographs as evidence to remind us of the range of emotion and experience captured so poetically by his photographers' eye and sensitivity. He really was one of a kind.'

"Al Gore has decided to follow his former political partner's lead and has switched to a vegan diet. The former Vice President has expressed and investment interest in a food start up that is trying to develop a plant-based mayonnaise in an effort to cut down American's dependence on eggs. In a Forbes article about the eco-friendly company, Hampton Creek, it is revealed that Gore is a 'newly turned vegan'. No more meat products: Former Vice President Al Gore has recently switched to a vegan diet, meaning that he does not eat any animal products and only plants-based food (seen here in October of this year) Fluctuation: Al Gore's weight has changed dramatically immediately after he lost the 2000 election as many thought he was depressed (seen at left during the campaign, and at right less than a year later) The switch doesn't come as a massive surprise considering his weight has fluctuated over the years and recently admitted that he was trying to be healthier. During an interview with New York Magazine in May of this year, he was described as serving himself a vegetable soup and salad followed by a fruit salad for dessert. 'I have been eating more healthfully. I’ve been trying to get in much better shape, and I’ve enjoyed that,' he told the magazine. The switch to a completely animal-free diet does show a shift in ideology, at least on the personal level, for the politician-turned-environmental advocate. Gore has dedicated much of his career following the presidential defeat in 2000 to working against climate change and global warming, but he came under fire from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for not pushing for vegetarianism- or even being fully vegetarian himself. 'I'm not a vegetarian, but I have cut back sharply on the meat that I eat,' he said in 2009. Back in the day: Clinton and Gore, seen during their first bid for the White House in 1992, were noticeably heavier in their younger years and were omnivores on the campaign trail . Setting a good example: Their kick into health awareness started while in office, as then-First Lady Hillary Clinton imposed healthier options at the White House mess (seen jogging during the 1992 campaign) 'I've made those changes, and while I don't go quite as far as... saying everybody should become a vegetarian... it is a legitimate point of view.' Gore's former running mate Bill Clinton made a very public switch to a vegetable-heavy diet after a number of heart problems including quadruple bypass in 2004 and the implementation of two stents in 2010. While the former president has said that he considers himself a vegan since he largely abides by the plant-based diet, he did also reveal to the AARP that he has a serving of salmon or eggs once every week in order to get sufficient protein and iron. Changes: Clinton, who has had multiple heart scares, said that he changed his diet so he could live to see his grandchildren. He lost 30 pounds before Chelsea's wedding (seen together in 1995 at left and in July at right) Clinton has credited his improved health and dramatic weight loss- he is said to have lost 30 pounds in the months leading up to his daughter Chelsea's wedding- to the 'vegan' diet. 'It's just a good thing to do, it will be healthier for you and you put less stress on your cardiovascular system,' Clinton told fellow-vegan Ellen DeGeneres on her talks show in May of last year. While his fish and egg exceptions would still qualify him as a vegetarian, he does have one major cheat break coming up: he told CNN's Sanjay Gupta that in 2010 he broke all the rules and had turkey on Thanksgiving- but only one bite.","Bill Clinton switched to the plant-based diet in 2010 following a number of heart scares .

"A couple recruited a 15-year-old girl from a dating website to have a threesome with them as a 'gift' on their wedding day, a court has heard. Edward Chang, 34, and his wife, Thanaphat Ratanasirivillai, 25 from Longmeadow, Massachusetts allegedly arranged the encounter on OKCupid.com. The pair, who also met each other on the site, now face multiple charges including rape, assault and battery on a person over 14, and enticement of a child under 16. On trial: Thanaphat Ratanasirivillai, 25, (left) and her husband Edward Chang, 25, from Longmeadow, Massachusetts allegedly arranged the encounter with the 15-year-old on OKCupid.com . Suspect: Ratanasirivillai, a Thai national, was a graduate student at Cornell University's management school when she married Chang on December 31, 2012 . The alleged tryst that took place at the Red Carpet Inn in West Springfield, Massachusetts, became public after the alleged victim's father discovered evidence of the encounter on her iPhone. Chang had booked a special jacuzzi room at the venue, but the court heard that he was moved to another after the front desk worker saw he was with two women - as it is against hotel policy. According to Mass Live, defense lawyers are expected to argue that the girl was complicit in the alleged encounter, stating that she was 18-years-old on the site. Chang, who reportedly works for Nike in Taiwan, faces a 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence because of the age difference between him and the victim. Ratanasirivillai, a Thai national, was a graduate student at Cornell University when she married Chang on December 31, 2012. Location: The alleged tryst that took place at the Red Carpet Inn in West Springfield, Massachusetts, (pictured) became public after the alleged victim's father discovered evidence of the encounter on her iPhone . The couple started searching for a girl for their wedding night by changing their profile name to 'Threeway Cupid', the court heard. The alleged victim, now 17, told jurors she has had a longtime interest in acting and modeling, loves the boy band One Direction, and enjoys the 'Harry Potter' and 'Hunger Games' book series. She added that she joined OkCupid because she had been struggling to make friends at school and had been bullied because she was skinny and 'just different'. The girl then told jurors she met a girl called Pat on the site when she decided she wanted to engage with girls as well as boys. Lawyers said that Pat turned out to be Ratanasirivillai, who then persuaded the girl to meet them. Michael O. Jennings, a lawyer for Chang, told the jury: 'It's not a website someone uses to troll for youth to have sex with. I believe you'll hear it's a very popular website - because it's free. Inside: Chang had booked a special jacuzzi room at the venue, similar to this one, but the court heard that he was moved to another after the front desk worker saw he was with two women - as it is against hotel policy . 'They had an interest in including a third party in a sexual relationship.' Assistant District Attorney Clarissa Wright told the court that the trio had exchanged 'racy' messages before the encounter. In her opening statement, she said: 'The thing is, she's 15 and she becomes curious.' Testimonies will continue on Monday and the trial is set to finish in the middle of next week. According to OkCupid's website, it is against their policy for anyone under the age of 18 to become a member.","Edward Chang, 34, and his wife, Thanaphat Ratanasirivillai, 25 are on trial .

"Ukip are set to win their first Commons seat with a landslide 64 per cent of the vote following the biggest swing in modern political history. Turncoat MP Douglas Carswell is set to humiliate David Cameron at the Clacton by-election sparked by his defection, a  Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday has revealed. The figures – the first test of public opinion since the politician rocked Westminster by defecting to Nigel Farage’s party – predict a record 48 point swing towards Ukip. Scroll down for video . Shocking: According to the poll, London Mayor Boris Johnson would win 27 per cent against Mr Carswell's 60, cutting Ukip's lead by 11. But it would still leave Boris with a yawning 33 point deficit . And they put the anti-Brussels party a staggering 44 percentage points ahead of Mr Carswell’s former party in the  Essex constituency. If the results are repeated in the by-election, expected in October, the swing would exceed the current record 44 points achieved by Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes when he thrashed Labour’s Peter Tatchell, the gay rights campaigner, in a by-election in Bermondsey, South London, in 1983. The biggest anti-Tory swing to date is the 35 points achieved by the Lib Dems in the Christchurch by-election in 1993. The 48 point Ukip swing in Clacton is partly the result of the party not having stood in the 2010 Election, so their support has gone from nought to 64 per cent in one leap. The poll blow came as senior Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames fiercely criticised Mr Carswell. Former Defence Minister Sir Nicholas told The Mail on Sunday: ‘What Douglas Carswell has done is sheer madness. Staggering: The figures - the first test of public opinion since the politician rocked Westminster by defecting to Nigel Farage's party - predict a record 48 point swing towards Ukip . ‘It is rank disloyalty to a party that gave him a place in Parliament. ‘Douglas . is a very unusual MP and it has been clear for some time where his true . political sympathies lie.’ Tory chiefs plan to flood the seaside . constituency with Ministers and MPs in an attempt to hold back . Carswell’s  tidal wave of support. But the poll suggests it may be impossible. Mr Carswell’s lead means the Tories will need a miracle to retain the seat and stop him becoming Ukip’s first MP. Even charismatic Boris Johnson would have little chance of defeating strait-laced Mr Carswell. According to the Survation poll, the London Mayor would win 27 per cent against Mr Carswell’s 60, cutting Ukip’s lead by 11. But it would still leave Boris with a yawning 33 point deficit. Heading for victory: Douglas Carswell with Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Turncoat MP Douglas Carswell is set to humiliate David Cameron at the Clacton by-election sparked by his defection . Mr Carswell’s astonishing 64 per cent appears to be a reflection of  a combination of enormous local personal support for him – and  for Ukip. Of those who intend to vote Ukip, two-thirds said that they would do so because they liked the party, and one in three because they like Mr Carswell.  Fewer than one in ten said it was to protest against the Government. Fewer than one in five Tory supporters in Clacton believe he has ‘betrayed’ the party – half hail him as a hero. Mr Farage is close to being the most popular party leader in Clacton, polling 25 from all voters, one point behind Mr Cameron on 26. Mr Cameron's attempt to strike back at Farage by arguing that a vote for Ukip will make it easier for Ed Miliband to become Prime Minister is having no effect on Ukip's support . Nor is Mr Cameron’s attempt to strike back at Farage by arguing that a vote for Ukip will make it easier for Ed Miliband to become Prime Minister having any effect on Ukip’s support. Nearly seven in ten said such warnings had no impact; 15 per cent said they were less likely to vote Ukip with 16 per cent more likely.Mr Carswell’s reasons for defecting to Ukip also win strong approval: . Half or more agreed with the statements that Mr Cameron is ‘too keen’ on staying in the EU; refuses to ‘shake up  the Westminster clique’; has lost control of the UK’s borders; should cut both spending and tax; and should bring in new laws to make it easier for voters to sack MPs in between general elections. Likewise, the residents of Clacton, which is opposite the Belgian coast, heartily agree with Mr Carswell’s determination to cut the UK’s ties with Brussels. A total of 54 per cent say the UK should go it alone, more than twice the number who want to stay in the EU. Immigration is by far the biggest issue in Clacton. Nearly half say it is their main concern, followed by Europe on 13 per cent, cost of living six, jobs five and health three. While the Tories are by far the biggest loser in Clacton, the survey also makes grim reading for Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg. Labour support has halved to a mere 13 per cent since the 2010 Election and the Lib Dems are almost off the graph at a paltry two per cent, compared to 11 per cent  in 2010. Mr Miliband’s personal rating is eight per cent, with Mr Clegg on just three. A Tory official said last night: ‘Mr Carswell has had the benefit of huge publicity over the last few days. We were taken by complete surprise by his defection. ‘Once we have chosen a candidate and started to canvass in Clacton and can show that voting Tory is the only way to get a referendum in the EU, we are confident we will do very well in the by-election.’ Survation polled 700 people online on Thursday and Friday. This really IS a political earthquake, writes Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of poll firm Survation . Mr Carswell, pictured, has been accused of betraying his party, but that is not how the vast majority of his constituents see him . Political earthquake is an expression often used without justification, but not in the case of our Clacton poll result. It shows that the by-election triggered by sitting Conservative MP Douglas Carswell’s defection to Ukip could go down in British political history as one of the most dramatic of all time. Based on the poll, the 12,000 majority Mr Carswell won as a Conservative in Clacton in 2010 would turn into an even bigger one for Ukip of more than 15,000 on a similar turnout. It has alarming implications for David Cameron and the Conservatives. Mr Carswell has been accused of betraying his party, but that is not how the vast majority of his constituents see him. Today’s survey lays to rest the notion that Mr Carswell defected for cynical reasons after becoming convinced that if he didn’t, he would lose to Ukip. Such is his personal popularity that he would almost certainly have won the seat had he fought it with a blue rosette next May, rather than now in the yellow and purple colours of Ukip. Most worrying of all for the Prime Minister is the reaction of other potential Tory MP defectors to the likely outcome of the by-election. If Mr Carswell lost or won narrowly, other like-minded Conservatives toying with going over to Ukip would probably conclude it was far too risky. But if he wins with a record-breaking swing, as our poll suggests he could, they may decide it is more risky to fight the next election as a Tory candidate than as a Ukip one. And that could change the landscape of British politics.","Ukip set to win first Commons seat with a landslide 64 per cent of the vote .

"Amy Willerton has quickly established herself as the jungle beauty on ITV's I'm A Celebrity ...Get Me Out Of Here! - just ask her new admirer, Joey Essex. But the 21-year-old, who reached the semi-finals of the Miss Universe title in Russia recently, had a helping hand when it came to appearing bare-faced in the outback. We can reveal that Amy underwent a series of skin peels, vitamin injections, abdominal toning sessions and micro-needle treatments in preparation for her debut on the show, which was watched by 9.2m viewers. Tricks of the trade: Beauty queen Amy Willerton, who is currently a star on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, had a helping hand to achieve that bare-faced beauty look for her stint in the outback . Appearing in public without make-up was . something of a personal challenge for Amy, who experienced problems with . her skin as a teenager. 'Working as model, her face is her fortune so she recently underwent a facial preparation campaign . under the professional auspices of Dr Vincent Wong, who is an Advanced . Medical Aesthetics Practitioner,' said a spokesman. 'Amy suffered from chronic acne in her late teens and whilst it . has left her unscarred, she wanted to ensure it was in peak condition . for November,' explained Dr Wong. 'Her treatment also included a series of skin peels, vitamin injections and micro-needling treatments. Dr Wong told Femail: 'Signs of stress can show on the skin, even on someone as young as Amy.' Beauty queen: Amy was treated to a range of treatments from Slendertone, which claims to help enhance your complexion by ridding the face of toxins . 'We want to restore her skin radiance . and elasticity as well as preventing breakouts and dark circles from . forming as a result of excessive stress. We want her to look as . confident as she feels in her own skin.' The . 21-year-old beauty queen has been seeing Dr. Vincent Wong on weekly . basis since she was crowned Miss Universe Great Britain in June this . year. He . designed a unique skin treatment for her, named ‘Pure and Radiant’. Involving caviar and bird's nest extracts, it's due to be launched to . the general public in October, just in time for the festive season. Amy was also treated to a range of treatments from Slendertone. Dr Wong introduced Amy to Slendertone Face, a treatment that claims to stimulate facial circulation, improve complexion and bring about a glowing radiance. Facing up: Amy, who has been getting close to Joey Essex on the show (L), used the Slendertone Face device (R) to get her complexion in peak condition for her stint in the jungle . 'Amy used her Slendertone Face to improve the circulation, encourage the removal of toxins and ensure she radiates health and vitality from every pore.' Slendertone Face directs electronic muscle stimulation (EMS) via a headset to encourage natural muscle contractions, so exercising the face involuntarily. Facial muscles are directly attached to . skin and as they are correctly exercised by the Slendertone Face without contorting the . overlying skin, the blood flow to the dermis escalates which increases . oxygenation and clears the build-up of toxins . Speaking about her treatment, Amy said: 'Slendertone Face already gives me a lovely glow after I use it – I just pop on the headset and forget I am treating my face – which is great as I have so many things I have to do at the moment.' And Amy didn't just concentrate on her face. To prepare for the shower shots in the jungle, personal trainer Jarod Chapman designed a training programme to help tone her abdomen. As part of this, Jarod got Amy to use a £149.99 Slendertone Ab Belt every day for twenty minutes to improve her muscle definition and tone. Amy wore the belt - which contracts your stomach muscles to give them a work out - while getting ready to go out, as well as in the gym. But is Amy's beauty blitz safe? Dr Dennis Wolf, Cosmetic Doctor at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'This is a product which uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in an attempt to contract the muscles on the abdomen. This will probably create a similar sort of feeling for the user as is experienced after doing a series of sit ups or abdominal crunches in the gym. 'But while the technology will probably make the abdominal muscles feel slightly tighter for a few hours after wearing the belt, I am not convinced that we can confidently say the product offers any long-term benefits in terms of toning or tightening the stomach muscles.' Work out: The belt used by Amy creates a similar sort of feeling as is experienced after doing a series of sit ups or abdominal crunches in the gym, says an expert . Speaking about Amy's face treatments, Dr Yannis, MD of 111 Harley Street, said: 'Amy is a relatively young Slendertone customer, and at the age of 21 is taking a highly preventive approach to sagging skin. 'This gadget is most effective on women over the age of 30, the age when muscle volume and collagen starts to deplete within the face. 'In terms of safety, the Slendertone Face is a non invasive treatment that increases blood flow to the skin, a process which will have helped with Amy’s quest for glowing skin. However, the Slendertone Face is not an anti-acne treatment will not necessarily help to keep Amy’s skin spot free. 'I would recommend that Amy maintains a dedicated skincare regime throughout her time in the jungle to avoid breakouts.'","Amy, 21, had skin and tummy toning treatments before show .

"In an illusion that TV magician David Copperfield would be proud of, work is about to begin on building the world's first 'invisible' tower. Tower Infinity, a 450-metre tall glass structure, will use a series of state-of-the art LED lighting and cameras to create a 'reflective skin' on the exterior of the building to make it 'disappear', according to the architect behind the scheme. GDS Architects first began designing the tower on the outskirts of South Korea's capital Seoul and near the city's airport in 2004, but has only now been given the green light to start its construction. Futuristic: A combination of state-of-the-art lighting and cameras will create the illusion the tower disappears . Disappearing act: The green-light has been given for the world's first 'invisible' tower in South Korea . Landmark: The tower will be located in the Yongsan International business district on the outskirts of Seoul . The tower has been designed purely for entertainment purposes, and will feature the second highest observation deck in the world, standing 392 metres above the ground. The tallest observation platform will continue to be the Canton Tower in Guangdong, China, which stands at 488 metres. Tower Infinity will also have a roller coaster, water park, restaurants, wedding venues and landscaped . gardens, according to architect website Inhabitat. As well as having the honour of being the world's first 'invisible' tower, it will also be among the top 10 tallest buildings in the world, according to architecture website, Inhabitat. And it stands an impressive five times higher than the Statue of Liberty, which Copperfield famously made 'disappear' in 2009. Leisure: Tower Infinity is being designed for entertainment purposes, featuring restaurants and a water park .

In a statement, GDS said: 'Instead of symbolising prominence as another of the world’s tallest and best towers, it sets itself apart by celebrating the global community rather than focusing on itself. 'The tower subtly demonstrates Korea’s rising position in the world by establishing its most powerful presence through diminishing its presence.' According to architecture website Phaidon, the ground-breaking project 'aims towards invisibility through the use of specially positioned optical cameras and LEDs to create a reflective skin on the building'. People using the lifts will be treated to 'views from the world', in which images will be flashed up of the vistas from the tallest buildings in the world. Senior Associate at GDS Michael Collins was quoted as saying: 'Users enter the elevator and upon ascent to the observation level, begins a user experience where all walls transform into actual views at their corresponding heights from significant observation towers/buildings around the world. 'This simulated experience is not intended to replace the actual experience, but inspire people to travel to these worldly destinations and discover an interest in cultures other than their own.' GDS won the first phase of Korea Land Corporation’s design competition in March 2008 from 146 entries from 46 countries.

"A father who cradled his dead daughter in his arms after a car crash said her killer should have been given a life sentence. Annie Cochrane, 14, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene when the Rover 25 car in which she was a passenger hit a tree. Driver Michael Partington, 19, was sentenced on Friday to four-and-a-half years in a Young Offenders' Institution after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Devastating: Michael Partington killed girlfriend Annie Cochrane after crashing his car into a tree while driving 'like a madman' along a country lane in Wigan . But Annie's father, Andrew, said his punishment was not harsh enough. The 46-year-old suffered a heart attack from shock and grief after he went to the scene of the crash and got into the car to hold his daughter. He said: 'We expected him to get a similar sentence, but we did not expect him to be getting out in two-and-a-half years for good behaviour. 'I am old-fashioned and think taking a life should mean life. After the court case, we went up to see Annie at her grave and told her what Partington got.' Liverpool Crown Court heard that Partington, of Westhoughton, Bolton, had driven like a 'madman' after a dispute with his younger brother over drugs. He was heard to say: 'I am going to explode either through emotion or anger' before driving off with his wheels spinning. Scene of tragedy: Partington lost control on a bend in School Lane, Wigan, and crashed into a tree. He fled the area, but returned later . He reached speeds of 70mph on an unmarked, unadopted 20mph road, causing his passengers to fly off their seats while hitting speed bumps. After ignoring his passengers' screams to slow down, he lost control on a bend and ploughed through a verge and struck a tree. He fled the scene and threatened to kill himself, but later returned. The crash happened at 1.50am on Sunday, February 13, in School Lane, Wigan. Cabinet maker Mr Cochrane, of Horwich, said: 'When I got to the scene, I got to the car and was holding her in my arms. She was already dead but I didn't know. 'When I was told she was dead at Wigan Hospital, I had a heart attack, but discharged myself because I knew my son, Adam, needed me. I am on tablets to help me sleep now. 'We talk about Annie all of the time. She wasn't just my daughter, she was my best friend.' Liverpool Crown Court head how Partington said he was going to 'explode through emotion or anger' after a dispute with his brother over drugs . Partington's passengers Adam Clarke, 18, Adam Jack King, 17, and a 15-year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons, were also injured and have been left with post-traumatic stress and flashbacks. Brian McKenna, mitigating, said his client suffers from severe depression and anxiety and has lost a person close to him through his actions. Sentencing Partington, Judge Mark Brown said: 'It is apparent you were driving like a mad man at a very fast speed and completely ignoring your passengers. 'If you hadn't been driving in this way then Annie would have been alive today. It is clear the death had a devastating impact on her family and friends.'","Annie Cochrane, 14, suffered fatal injuries when car ploughed into tree .

"The stepson of an elderly man whose body parts were found strewn in creeks in rural Alabama has been charged with his murder, a sheriff's spokesman said on Wednesday. William A. Minton, 55, was charged with three counts - intentional killing, intentional murder and abuse of corpse - by police in the grisly death of 87-year-old Kenneth Hood in Millbrook. Minton lived with Hood and was apprehended by police while driving in a van through Millwood with Carolyn Hood, the victim's wife late on Tuesday. William Minton, 55, (pictured left) was charged with the murder of his 87-year-old stepfather (right) Kenneth Hood in Millbrook . Police were investigating at the home where the elderly man lived with his stepson - authorities believe that the dismemberment took place at the property . Investigators were digging through the victim's home and removed several bags of evidence, according to al.com. Police said that initial investigation revealed that the elderly man died of blunt-force trauma to the head, neck and chest. It is believed that the dismemberment took place at the home. Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack said Minton could face capital murder if evidence supports the charge. Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack said Monday that the torso was dumped in water underneath a bridge . Minton is listed on the Alabama Sex Offender Registry after being convicted in 1996 for four counts of sodomy and child molestation of a 14-year-old victim in Georgia.

"An extremist Libyan militia has captured twelve men who now face mutilation and execution for allegedly being gay. The militia stormed a private party in Ain Zara, a suburb of the capital Tripoli, late on Thursday night and took the men hostage. Pictures of the men with their hands up against the wall and their faces covered as well as one of a man's back with a henna tattoo have been posted on Facebook. Under threat of death: Twelve men face mutilation and execution after they were captured by an extremist Libyan militia . One of the pictures was accompanied by the Quranic call 'there is no power but the power of Allah!' Gay Star News reported that the group labelled the men the 'third sex' which is a term used in the Arab Gulf area to denote homosexuals. At the time of writing, the picture of the men received 133 likes, 138 shares, and 189 comments some of which were 'flog them hard!', ‘let them see bullets!’, ‘free Libya! [ie from gays]’ and ‘ride them like camels’. The militia call themselves the 'special deterrence unit' on their Facebook page and on it they boast that they caught the men doing the 'practices of the people of Lot' (i.e having gay sex) and that the men are to be mutilated and executed. The group also posted this picture of a man's back with a henna tattoo which has received 46 likes and 30 shares .

"The Queen has  joined the Twitter generation - sending her first ever tweet to declare a new exhibition at the Science Museum officially open. The royal tweet, with perfect punctuation, read: 'It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.' But now the account is being bombarded with questions from users desperate to grab the monarch's attention. One asked about her X Factor favourite while another urged the Queen, who he referred to as 'babe', to send out a selfie. Scroll down for video . The Queen takes off her glove to touch a tablet screen to send her first message via Twitter to officially open a new exhibition at the Science Museum in central London . The Tweet sent by the Queen via the @BritishMonarchy account, which was signed off 'Elizabeth R' The tweet has already seen the hashtag #TheQueenTweets trending on the social media site . New friends? Some Twitter users have been very personal with the Queen, asking her for a selfie . While other Twitter users were just happy to see the monarch using the site with one even asking who she was loving on X Factor . The Queen sent out the message on a tablet computer after touring the exhibition, which explores how breakthroughs have transformed the way people communicate over the past 200 years. The Queen's message was sent via the official @BritishMonarchy Twitter account, gaining its own hashtag #thequeentweets. As soon as the monarch pressed send, Twitter users were quick to send their own messages back. Many were sent by users welcoming the monarch to social media - with some encouraging her to embrace internet trends such as selfies and memes. However within just minutes of sending her first tweet, the Queen had already attracted her first troll. Four minutes after she tweeted, one user replied telling her: 'Welcome to twitter! Abdicate.' One Twitter user offered some advice to the Queen suggesting 'more kooky hashtags' and 'cat meme' for her next tweet . The parody account @Queen_UK tweeted their tongue-in-cheek disapproval to the monarch's first ever tweet . After Her Majesty sent the tweet, it appeared on the screen behind her for assembled guests to see . He then continued saying: 'I like the fact that being a republican is now lower-effort than ever.' While others were pleased to see her on the social media forum and seized the opportunity to ask what they've always wanted to know. One asked: 'Hey Liz, who are you loving on X Factor?!' While another said: 'When will your selfie be, please your highness?' This afternoon the tweet was being displayed at the top of the BT Tower in central London as BT are the lead sponsors of the new exhibition . The Queen's visit to the Science Museum in South Kensington comes after the opening of a new £15.6million gallery . During her reign the Queen has encountered many of the technological advances shown in the new exhibit . The Queen was accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh on her visit to the museum, where she was presented with a technology themed bouquet of flowers . She was also given suggestions on what to tweet next with users asking her for 'kooky hashtags' and cat memes. But one account that welcomed the tweet with caution was popular parody account @Queen_UK. The humorous feed, which has almost two million followers posted: 'Can't believe someone's started a sodding parody account', with a picture of the tweet. The Queen watches herself at the Coronation on a television set from the 1950s at the exhibition called 'Information Age' During her reign, the Queen has encountered a rapidly changing technological world. Here she inspects an aerial tuning inductor from Roughby Radio Station in 1943 . The tweet was sent at the £15.6 million gallery at the museum in South Kensington, London features more than 800 objects and explores how breakthroughs have transformed the way people communicate over the past 200 years. Normally a plaque is unveiled to herald the launch of a new project by a royal but this time the Queen, aged 88, sent the tweet, marking a technological milestone. For her visit to the museum she wore a vibrant blue coat and hat, with some on Twitter pointing out her colour choice was similar to that of the site's bird logo. During her reign the Queen has encountered a rapidly-changing world of technology from the advent of the colour television to the mobile phone and the internet. Television cameras were allowed inside Westminster Abbey in 1953 to film her Coronation and more than half a million extra television sets were sold in the weeks running up to the historic event. Five years later she made the first trunk call in the United Kingdom and when email technology was in its infancy, the Queen became the first monarch to send one of the electronic messages, in 1976 during a visit to an Army base. The concept of video-sharing website YouTube was explained to her by granddaughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie before she launched her own channel on the site in 2007 to promote the British monarchy. Her own website, www.royal.gov.uk, was launched in 1997 during a visit to Kingsbury High School in Brent, north west London. Other technological milestones for the Queen include personally uploading a video on to YouTube, during a visit to the Google offices in London in 2008. However, she isn't the first royal to use Twitter as her son, the Duke of York is the most prolific tweeter in the royal family and has an account under his own name. He signs off messages he has written with AY, for Andrew York. The micro-blogging site has also been used by her grandson Prince Harry, who sent his first official tweet in May, but he admitted during the summer he no longer has a personal account, when chatting to a group of students who were promoting his Invictus Games on social media. The Queen and members of her family are represented on Twitter by the account @BritishMonarchy, while @ClarenceHouse covers the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Queen isn't the only member of the royal family to have tweeted. Her son the Duke of York has his own Twitter account and her grandson Prince Harry has also used the micro-blogging site . The Queen launched her own website in 1997 during a visit to a London school while in 2008 she uploaded her first video to YouTube . The Queen's grandson Prince Harry has also used Twitter and sent his first official tweet in May . The prince sent the tweet to promote his Invictus Games, which was held in London for injured servicemen and women . Normally a plaque is unveiled by a member of the royal family to launch a new project, but this time the Queen decided to mark a technological milestone . The Queen made technological history again yesterday but she learned she will also have to roll with the inevitable punches of the internet age. Because just four minutes after sending her first ever tweet, the Queen became a victim of trolling. At 11:35am Her Majesty’s message went out from the @BritishMonarchy account to 724,000 followers on Twitter as she opened a gallery at the Science Museum in London. The tweet read: ‘It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.’ Initially the post was retweeted, or shared, nearly 7,000 times, with the Science Museum becoming the first to reply. ‘We’re honoured The Queen chose to open our Information Age gallery by sending her first tweet,’ their message read. But at 11:39am one user lowered the tone considerably, posting: ‘Welcome to Twitter! Abdicate.’ Sadly it was retweeted more than 100 times. The user later posted: ‘I like the fact that being a republican is now lower-effort than ever’, suggesting that they think they will be able to reach the Queen directly with their anti-monarchy views. Soon other Twitter users had joined in sending abusive messages, some of which are too unpleasant to publish here. Conor Burns, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, attacked the original ‘abdicate’ tweet. ‘People say things on Twitter that they would never dare say face to face,’ he said. ‘It’s incredibly disrespectful.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, added: ‘It’s an insult. We have a monarchy that’s living in the modern world and for anyone to respond in that way is scandalous.’ The tweet brought out her the Queen's first troll who after welcoming her to Twitter then told her to abdicate . Thomas Mace Archer-Mills, chairman of the British Monarchist Society, said: ‘It’s incredibly disrespectful. She is showing she is keeping up to date and embracing technology and change.’ Last night it was unclear which device was used to send the Queen’s tweet. Although she was pictured with an iPad, it was later claimed that an iPhone had been used, suggesting she had not sent it herself. However, a spokesman for Buckingham Palace confirmed: ‘The Queen tweeted this morning from the Science Museum.’","The Queen sent the tweet to declare a new science exhibition open .

"The hijackers of missing jet MH370 must have crawled through a trap door in full view of cabin crew to cut a key datalink with the ground, it was revealed today. Investigators said a system . called ACARS was switched off on the Malaysia Airways at some point between 1.07am and . 1.37am - after it vanished from controllers' radars. The flight is then believed to have flown into a navigational and technical black hole, a feat that could only be achieved by experienced pilots who had meticulously planned in advance. Pilots have revealed hijackers must have crawled through trap door in in flight MH370's galley in full view of cabin crew' to disable second communications system. This graphic shows whether trap door would be . Probe: Police in Malaysia have searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad . Shah (right) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (left) after officials confirmed the . plane was taken over by a 'deliberate act' ACARS is designed to transmit maintenance data back to the ground and was the second communications system to switched off on the flight. The first, the transponder, had been disabled in the cockpit two minutes after the last verbal contact was made with air traffic control. But pilots revealed today cutting the ACARS datalink would have been much more difficult and instructions are not in the Flight Crew Operating Manual. Whoever did so may have had to climb through a trap door in full view of cabin crew, people familiar with the jet say. Circuit-breakers . used to disable the system are in a bay reached through a hatch in the . floor next to the lefthand front exit, close to a galley used to prepare . meals. Another pilot, who did not want to be identified, said: 'Occasionally, . there are gaps in the communications systems and the guys in ground . operations may not think much of it initially. Experts have claimed the Boeing 777-200ER dropped 5,000ft (1,500m) to evade commercial radar detection . 'It would be a while . before they try to find out what was wrong.' Most of the pilots said it would be impossible to turn off ACARS from inside the cockpit, though two people did not rule it out. Malaysia . Airlines said 14 minutes elapsed between the last ACARS message and the . transponder shutdown that - in the growing view of officials - . confirmed a fully loaded jet was on the run. The ACARS must have been . disabled within 16 minutes after that. In the meantime a voice believed to be that of the co-pilot issued the last words from MH370 and the transponder went dead. By choosing one place and time to vanish into radar darkness with 238 others on board, the person - presumed to be a pilot or a passenger with advanced knowledge - may have acted only after meticulous planning, according to aviation experts. Malaysian Selamat Omar shows pictures of his son Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, an aviation engineer, who was onboard the missing flight, in Putrajaya, Malaysia . Malaysia's transport ministry released this satellite map of the north corridor of the possible location of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . The hunt: Malaysian Defence Minister and acting Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussin (right) show north corridor and south corridor maps . This graphic shows the location of the Boeing 777's ELT, in the rear of the plane . He signed off from Malaysian airspace at 1.19am on March 8 with a casual 'all right, good night,' rather than the crisp radio drill advocated in pilot training, a person now believed to be the co-pilot gave no hint of anything unusual. Two minutes later, at 1.21 a.m. local time, the transponder - a device identifying jets to ground controllers - was turned off in a move that experts say could reveal a careful sequence. 'Every action taken by the person who was piloting the aircraft appears to be a deliberate one. It is almost like a pilot's checklist,' said one senior captain from an Asian carrier with experience of jets including the Boeing 777. There is so far no indication whether the co-pilot was at fault or had anything to do with turning off the transponder. Pilots say the usual industry convention is that the pilot not directly responsible for flying the plane talks on the radio. Anxious wait: Erny Khairul, whose husband Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat was onboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, kisses her daughter inside a hotel they are staying at in Putrajaya . Anxious wait: Chinese relatives of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines are still waiting to find out happened to their loved ones . Hotel security officers guard at an entrance of a hotel room set aside for relatives of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane in Beijing . Police have searched the premises of both the captain and co-pilot and are checking the backgrounds of all passengers. Whoever turned the transponder to 'off', whether or not the move was deliberate, did so at a vulnerable point between two airspace sectors when Malaysian and Vietnamese controllers could easily assume the airplane was each others' responsibility. 'The predictable effect was to delay the raising of the alarm by either party,' David Learmount, operations and safety editor at Flight International, wrote in an industry blog. That mirrors delays in noticing something was wrong when an Air France jet disappeared over the Atlantic in 2009 with 228 people on board, a gap blamed on confusion between controllers. Yet whereas the Rio-Paris disaster was later traced to pilot error, the suspected kidnapping of MH370's passengers and crew was carried out with either skill or bizarre coincidences. Residents of Boeung Kak Lake light candles to spell 'MH370' during a Buddhist ceremony, praying for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370, in Phnom Penh . Cambodian residents of a community light candles as they pray for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 at their village in Phnom Penh . Whether or not pilots knew it, the jet was just then in a technically obscure sweet spot, according to a top radar expert. Air traffic controllers use secondary radar which works by talking to the transponder. Some air traffic control systems also blend in some primary radar, which uses a simple echo. But primary radar signals fade faster than secondary ones, meaning even a residual blip would have vanished for controllers and even military radar may have found it difficult to identify the 777 from other ghostly blips, said radar expert Hans Weber. 'Turning off the transponder indicates this person was highly trained,' said Weber, of consultancy TECOP International. The overnight flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur is packed year-round with business people, Chinese tourists and students, attracted in part by code-sharing deals, regular travellers say. Family members of passengers onboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 vote to talk directly to Malaysian government's representatives . Relatives of passengers of a missing Malaysia Airlines plane gather at a television viewing area to watch news programs in a hotel in Beijing . The lockdown of MH370 may have begun as early as 40 minutes into the flight at a point when meals are being hurriedly served in time to get trays cleared and lights dimmed for the night. 'It was a red-eye flight. Most people - the passengers and the crew - just want to rest,' a Malaysia Airlines stewardess said. 'Unless there was a reason to panic, if someone had taken control of the aircraft, they would not have noticed anything.' The north-east-bound jet took a north-western route from Kota Bahru in eastern Malaysia to Penang Island. It was last detected on military radar around 200 miles northwest of Penang. Even that act of going off course may not have caused alarm at first if it was handled gradually, pilots said. 'Nobody pays attention to these things unless they are aware of the direction that the aircraft was heading in,' said one first officer who has flown with Malaysia Airlines. The airline said it had reconstructed the event in a simulator to try to figure out how the jet vanished and kept flying for what may have been more than seven hours. Pilots say whoever was then in control may have kept the radio on in silent mode to hear what was going on around him, but would have avoided restarting the transponder at all costs. 'That would immediately make the aircraft visible ... like a bright light. Your registration, height, altitude and speed would all become visible,' said an airline captain. After casting off its identity, the aircraft set investigators a puzzle that has yet to be solved. It veered either northwards or southwards, within an hour's flying time of arcs stretching from the Caspian to the southern Indian Ocean. The best way to avoid the attention of military radars would have been to fly at a fixed altitude, on a recognised flight path and at cruising speed without changing course, pilots say. Malaysian officials dismissed as speculation reports that the jet may have flown at low altitude to avoid detection. But pilots said the best chance of feeling its way through the well-defended northern route would have been to hide in full view of military radar inside commercial lanes - raising awkward questions over security in several parts of the Asia-Pacific. 'The military radar controllers would have seen him moving on a fixed line, figured that it was a commercial aircraft at a high altitude, and not really a danger especially if he was on a recognised flight path,' said one pilot. 'Some countries would ask you to identify yourself, but you are flying through the night and that is the time when the least attention is being paid to unidentified aircraft. As long as the aircraft is not flying towards a military target or point, they may not bother with you.' Although investigators refused on Monday to be drawn into theories, few in the industry believe a 250-tonne passenger jet could run amok globally without expert skills or preparation. 'Whoever did this must have had lots of aircraft knowledge, would have deliberately planned this, had nerves of steel to be confident enough to get through primary radar without being detected and been confident enough to control an aircraft full of people,' a veteran airline captain said.","ACARS system was switched off between 1.07am and .

"Extra exposure to the sun could potentially reduce the risks of developing some forms of cancer by up to 50 per cent, according to experts. Previous studies by Professor Rachel Neale found those who had lived in areas with higher levels of UV rays had a 30 to 40 per cent lower chance of pancreatic cancer than those who had lived in areas with lower ambient UV rays. The professor from the QIMR Berghoffer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane is currently recruiting 25,000 Australians over 60 to participate in a study to examine if vitamin D can reduce the risks of ovarian, oesophageal and pancreatic cancers. Sun exposure could potentially reduce the risks of ovarian, oesophageal and pancreatic cancers . Professor Neale said it is very important to get some sun exposure, especially those who don't have enough time to go outside. Not enough sunlight may cause children to developing rickets, which is a bone disease that affects infants and youths, and osteomalacia or soft bones in adults. Professor Neale is currently recruiting 25,000 Australians over 60 to participate in a vitamin D study . The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that one in every four Australian adults had a vitamin D deficiency in 2011-12. 'Even if it's only for 2-3 minutes each day, it will be enough to get that source of vitamin D,' Professor Neale said. 'Exposing more skin in a short period of time is better than less skin in the long run. Go outside and lift your shirt or pants up – show your tummy and legs.' Vitamin D deficiency is more likely in naturally dark-skinned people, those who cover up for religious or cultural reasons and the elderly. People who are always indoors due to work, infants of vitamin D deficient mothers and patients with osteoporosis are also high risk. The Cancer Council reports that people should go outside without any protection around midday for 30 minutes a day to get enough vitamin D during winter. Professor Neale will coordinate a D-Health trial, which will observe two study groups of participants, randomly taking either the vitamin D tablet or a placebo tablet (no active ingredients) on the first day of each month for up to 5 years and they will not know which tablet they are taking during this study. The study will observe whether taking a vitamin D tablet changes the risk of a person being diagnosed with health conditions such as cancer, heart disease or infections. Not enough UV rays may cause children to develop rickets and ostemomalacia in adults . Her previous studies revealed hundreds of participants, linked high UV exposure to a 30 per cent reduced risk of ovarian cancer and a 40 per cent reduced risk of oesophageal cancers. Sun exposure was beneficial to those with more sun-sensitive fair skin, with 47 per cent reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, compared to those with a tan. Professor Neale said there is still insufficient evidence to suggest it is possible to achieve the full cancer-fighting advantage of Vitamin D pill supplements, or whether the apparent health benefits relied on the sun. 'We certainly are not hand on heart saying this is definitely true, in these types of epidemiological studies we are always very cautious about saying something is casual, but we do see an association between UV exposure and some cancers,' she said. 'We have tried to adjust for other factors that might influence their risk of cancer and the association remained.'","Sun exposure could potentially reduce the risks of ovarian, oesophageal and pancreatic cancers .

"The story of the 'Wolves of Wall Street' who ran a $200million stock market scam is about to hit the big screen after being turned into a blockbuster starring Leonardo Di Caprio. But Jordan Belfort and Danny Porush, the real-life fraudsters behind the audacious crime who between them spent five years in prison, are also living Hollywood lifestyles after setting up lucrative new businesses after their release from jail, it was revealed today. Porush lives in a $4million home and drives a Rolls-Royce convertible, while Belfort has been hanging out with Di Caprio, who is playing him in the film, directed by Scorsese. Scroll down for video . Scam: Danny Porush, left, and Jordan Belfort, right, defrauded investors in Stratton Oakmont of $200million . Star: Leonardo Di Caprio is appearing in a forthcoming film based on the scam, The Wolf of Wall Street . Belfort and Porush set up Stratton Oakmont, a 'boiler room' firm based on Long Island designed to 'pump and dump' shares by hyping their prospects and quickly cashing in once their price rose. They managed to rake in $200million from the fraud, which they spent on cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel. However, after the FBI caught up with them in 1996, Belfort spent 22 months in prison while Porush was sentenced to 39 months. Belfort, 50, has written a pair of memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street. High life: Belfort poses with his fiancée at the Melbourne Cup in Australia in November last year . Luxury: Belfort, right, pictured during his heyday; the pair have apparently resumed their glitzy lifestyles . Helicopter: Belfort admits, 'It's easier to get rich quick when you don't follow the rules' 'It's easier to get rich quick when you don't follow the rules,' he told the New York Post this week - but he is adamant that he has not profited from his crimes. He claims that all the proceeds of his book are going directly to the victims of the Stratton Oakmont fraud. 'I'm a wolf who became a more benevolent character,' he said. 'I refuse to glorify my past.' The memoirs are currently being adapted into a Hollywood film, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Di Caprio, Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, due to come out later this year. Glamour: Belfort, pictured with his second wife Nadine, has been spending time with Di Caprio . Blockbuster: Di Caprio is starring in the film alongside the likes of Johan Hill and Matthew McConaughey . Belfort bonded with Di Caprio during the filming of the movie, and said: 'I have tremendous respect for him.' The former scammer lives in California and now makes a living giving motivational speeches, including talks on 'wealth creation' and corporate training. Porush, 56, has started a business selling medical supplies in Florida, and appears to be able to support a glitzy lifestyle on its proceeds. He lives with his second wife Lisa in a $4million mansion, and the couple drive matching Rolls-Royce Corniche cars. 'I would never try to profit from a crime I’m so remorseful for,' he told the Post.","Jordan Belfort and Danny Porush set up 'pump and dump' firm in 1990s .

"These 1930s travel posters are advertisements with a difference - they are designed to encourage tourism to the USSR. The vintage posters were designed to advertise flights and train routes to the Soviet Union through the travel company Intourist - founded by Joseph Stalin in 1929. The posters - commissioned in the 1930s - were designed to encourage visitors to the Communist country, before the Second World War and ensuing Cold War closed off the Soviet Union to westerners. Soviet era tourism posters from Stalin's Intourist agency are up for auction at Christie's South Kensington location. Pictured: Odessa lithograph, expected to get between £800 and £1,200 . Designed by Maria Nesterova-Berzina, Summersport In Der Udssr is estimated to raise between £2,500 and £3,500 . Now the historic posters are up for auction with Christie's. In total 179 original posters will be offered, with estimates ranging from £800 to £50,000. The Russian posters are expected to fetch anything up to £5,000 each, with the TranSiberian Express advert expected to be a favourite with bidders. It promotes the route as 'the shortest way between Europe and the Far East' and the journey itself took 12 days in total. This lithograph encourages visitors to book a trip to the Russian capital - and could sell for up to £8,000 . The New Travel Land poster, which advertises the London bureau of Intourist, was created by Max Litvak and Robert Fedor . The Intourist agency - the official travel agency of the Soviet Union - targeted only an external audience, mainly in Britain and Germany, meaning the posters were intended to encourage inbound tourism from Europe. As such, there is a distinctly capitalist look to each image - the type of message that was generally deemed to be appropriate among those within the USSR's secretive internal workings. The examples in the sale were produced specifically for the English and German tourist markets and promote the USSR as 'The New Travel Land.' Designed by various artists working for the agency in the first half of the 20th Century, these tourism posters demonstrate the scope and breadth of the advertising campaign, as well as the emphasis on art deco colours and design in hopes of attracting the Western European traveller. This Transsiberian Express poster is of particular interest for collectors and could fetch up to £3,000 . Konstantin Bor Ramensky's By Air to USSR from 1934 could go for as high as £5,000 . Soviet Armenia, by Sergey Igumnov, is believed to have been commissioned in 1936 .

"Unidentified material that washed ashore in Australia and is being examined for any link to the lost Malaysian plane is unlikely to have come from the jet, an official revealed today. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau had been scrutinising photos of the object, which washed ashore six miles east of Augusta in Western Australia state. But Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the bureau, said an initial analysis of the material - which appeared to be sheet metal with rivets - suggested it was not from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

Australia's prime minister said today that failure to find any clue in . the most likely crash site of the lost jet would not spell the end of . the search. This was because officials plan soon to bring in more powerful sonar equipment that can delve deeper beneath the Indian Ocean.

Nothing of interest had been found. 'We do not consider this likely to be of use to our search for MH370.

"A young convert to Islam who killed a Canadian soldier in a hit-and-run had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey, authorities said Tuesday. Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the attack Monday was 'clearly linked to terrorist ideology.' Quebec Police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform. Police said the suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, called 911 to report his hit-and-run as police chased him in the Quebec city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu. He later was shot dead by police after his car flipped over into a ditch and he brandished a knife as he exited his car. A second soldier suffered minor injuries in the attack. Scroll down for video . The suspect's car is overturned in the ditch in a cordoned off area in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, where one of two soldiers hit by a car  died of his injuries early Tuesday . Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was killed by a young convert to Islam in a hit-and-run in Quebec . Couture-Rouleau, 25, was one of 90 people in the country suspected of intending to join fights abroad or who have returned from overseas, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson. He first came to attention of authorities in June because of Facebook postings that showed he had become radicalized and wanted to leave the country to fight, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Supt. Martine Fontaine. Police seized his passport at the airport in July when he tried to travel to Turkey, Fontaine said. He was arrested and questioned but there wasn't enough evidence to charge him with a crime, she said. Fontaine said police subsequently met with him several times, including as recently as Oct. 9, when she said he indicated that wanted to take steps to change. They also met his parents and the imam of his mosque and tried to exert a positive influence over him. 'Many interventions with him were carried out to try and avoid the tragic events,' Fontaine said. 'It's very difficult when someone is planning an act alone and there is no obvious preparation involved and used a vehicle as a weapon.' A knife stuck in the ground is located near an overturned car involved in a police chase in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu on Monday. The driver died, 25-year-old Martin Couture Rouleau, had become influenced by radical Islam . Fontaine said they couldn't arrest him for having radical thoughts. It was not known whether Couture-Rouleau had any ties to Islamic militant groups. 'He was part of our investigative efforts to try and identify those people who might commit a criminal act travelling abroad for terrorist purposes,' Paulson said. Canada raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday due to 'an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations like ISIL, al-Qaida, al-Shabab and others who pose a clear threat to Canadians,' said Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for the public safety minister. 'This increase is not the result of a specific threat,' de Le Rue said. Nobody answered the door at Couture-Rouleau's single story white brick home in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, where he lives with his father. Neighbor Daniel Fortin said he had known Couture-Rouleau since he was a child. Fortin said over the past year or so, he grew out his beard and began wearing loose-fitting Muslim clothing but that he never felt threatened by him. Fortin said Couture-Roleau's father was worried as he became increasingly radicalized and 'tried everything,' to help him. A Quebec business data base shows he started a water-pressure cleaning company in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in 2012 with two other people. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the slain soldier, 53-year-old Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, was a 28-year veteran with 'distinguished service.' 'This was a despicable act of violence that strikes against not just this soldier and his colleagues but frankly against our very values as a civilized democracy,' Harper said in Parliament. Martin Couture Rouleau's car is pictured after he was shot and killed by police . Police investigators take photos at the scene where two soldiers were struck by the suspect . Lapointe said the suspect sat in his car in the parking lot outside a veterans' support center for at least two hours before the hit and run. He said the other soldier is in stable condition with minor injuries. The case is similar to one in London last year in which an al-Qaida-inspired extremist and another man ran over a soldier with a car before hacking the off-duty soldier to death. Images of Michael Adebolajo, 29, holding a butcher knife and cleaver with bloodied hands in the moments after the May 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby shocked people around the world and sparked fears of Islamist terrorism in Britain. The Islamic State group has urged supporters to carry out attacks against Western countries, including Canada, that are participating in the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants who have taken over large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. Eight Canadian fighter jets, including two spares, are set to depart for the region Tuesday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf condemned the attack and said they have been in touch with Canadian officials. 'We deplore acts of violence toward military and law enforcement, and stand ready to assist our Canadian partners as they investigate this act,' Harf said.

'Important to remember Obama's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant APEC fashion. See Kerry, 2013,' she wrote, referring to the Balinese 'endek' woven shirt worn by Secretary of State John Kerry and leaders attending the summit in Indonesia last year. Meanwhile at the shoot, U.S. president Barack Obama appeared in no mood to break the ice with his Russian counterpart, and even looked away when the two crossed paths. Putin took centre stage at the official photocall, placed at the middle of leaders next to Chinese president and event host Xi Jinping.

"Opposition: Rowan Williams said a new marriage law for gay couples would amount to forcing unwanted change on the rest of the nation . The law has no right to legalise same-sex marriage, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared yesterday. Dr Rowan Williams said a new marriage law for gay couples would amount to forcing unwanted change on the rest of the nation. He also said it would be wrong to legalise assisted dying because of the threat it would pose to the vulnerable and because it would go against the beliefs of most people. In a key speech on human rights, the head of the Anglican Church put his weight behind other leading clergy who have launched a powerful campaign to prevent David Cameron from going ahead with his plan to allow the full rights of marriage to same-sex couples. Dr Williams’s predecessor in Lambeth Palace, Lord Carey, notably told the Mail last week that same-sex marriage laws would be ‘one of the  greatest political power grabs in history’. Dr Williams’s statement means the Prime Minister now knows he will face opposition from the liberal-minded leadership of the Church of England – as well as its determined traditionalists – if he continues on the track towards legalised gay marriage. The Archbishop said human rights law ‘falls short of a legal charter to promote change in institutions’. Dr Williams added: ‘If it is said that a failure to legalise assisted suicide – or same-sex marriage – perpetuates stigma or marginalisation for some people, the reply must be, I believe, that issues like stigma and marginalisation have to be addressed at the level of culture rather than law.’ Defiance: David Cameron declared that he was in favour of same sex marriages last Autumn . The Archbishop indicated to MPs earlier this week that CofE churches would never be used to solemnise gay marriages and Anglican officials underlined that the Church says marriage must remain a union between a man and a woman. Dr Williams’s intervention in the argument yesterday, in a speech to a World Council of Churches gathering in Geneva, echoed, in typically mild academic language, the sentiments expressed by Lord Carey. The Archbishop has long been a personal supporter of gay rights and his lecture yesterday insisted Christians must accept that gay equality laws are here to stay. But he has also listened to the concerns of traditional Christian believers since he began his career at Lambeth Palace in 2003 by refusing to allow an openly gay cleric to take a post as a CofE bishop. His remarks yesterday came after Coalition ministers insisted they would go ahead with a same-sex marriage law whatever the churches say. Equality minister Lynne Featherstone said last week the churches did not own marriage law. She added a same-sex marriage law would be ‘about the underlying principles of family, society and personal freedoms’. Mr Cameron declared for same-sex marriage last autumn, saying: ‘Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. ‘I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.’ A consultation document on how a gay marriage law would work is due out shortly. Dr Williams said in his speech that same-sex marriage law was wrong because it tried to impose cultural change. He added human rights language could be ‘confused and artificial’ when it strayed from protecting the vulnerable. It could become ‘an alien culture, pressing the imperatives of universal equality over all local custom and affinity’.","Archbishop also says wrong to legalise assisted dying because of threat to the vulnerable .

"Last month the world was stunned as Nasa's Antares rocket experienced a fault shortly after launching, falling back to Earth in an enormous fiery explosion. Now new footage has been released from up close that shows the demise of the rocket like never before. Remotely operated cameras recently recovered from the launch pad captured the explosion in incredible detail - and one even reveals footage from inside the resultant cloud of dust and debris. Scroll down for video . Cameras recovered from the launch pad in Virginia have shed new light on disaster (still image shown). An OrbitalSciences Antares rocket failed and exploded seconds after launching from Wallops Flight Facility on 28 October. Officials later explained that they detonated the rocket after a fault was spotted . The footage was compiled by websites Zero-G News and America Space. They explain that, as their cameras were so close to the launchpad, they had not been hopeful of retrieving much, if any, of the data. And they were also restricted from retrieving their data  after lift-off owing to the obviously hazardous conditions. The Antares rocket was due to launch an unmanned Orbital-3 Cygnus spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the International Space Station. This included science experiments, experiment hardware, spare parts, and crew provisions - as part of a £1.2 billion ($1.9billion) deal with Nasa. Outfitted with a new, more powerful upper-stage engine, the Antares rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds (2,293 kg) of supplies, science experiments and equipment, a 15 percent increase over previous missions. 'The initial liftoff looked flawless. Then, suddenly, the exhaust turned bright yellow and became far brighter than usual. 'That's when we knew things were about to get bad,' said Elliot Severn, a launch photojournalist for Zero-G News and StarTalk Radio. 'The vehicle seemed to hang in the air and started to burn, it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. 'It fell in a pillar of fire and exploded on impact, and we could feel the heat on our face from 1.5 miles [2.4km] away. Seconds later the shockwave hit, and we all ran for the buses to evacuate. We had little hope of any cameras surviving.' But amazingly four cameras from journalists working for the two websites did survive, 'and the footage is nothing short of spectacular' said AmericaSpace. The Nasa-funded rocket exploded (previous image shown) on its way to the ISS just six seconds after lift-off from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island in Virginia .The rocket exploded at 6:22pm EDT on 28 October, and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine . Organisations said more than £125 million ($200 million) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion (previous image shown). Orbital Sciences said it would 'likely' stop using the type of Russian engines that were employed when its unmanned Antares commercial supply rocket exploded . They explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras, but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the Accident Investigation Board. One of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion. As dust and debris flies around, the camera somehow manages to survive. The Nasa-funded rocket exploded on its way to the ISS just six seconds after lift-off from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island in Virginia.

Orbital Sciences said it would 'likely' stop using the type of old Russian engines that were employed when its unmanned Antares commercial supply rocket bound for the International Space Station exploded moments after liftoff last week. The company said its investigation of the crash is continuing, but preliminary results point to a failure in one of its two main engines involved in the first stage of launch. 'As a result, the use of these engines for the Antares vehicle likely will be discontinued,' it said. But the company still plans to fulfill its contract with Nasa to fulfill all its remaining cargo missions to the ISS by the end of 2016.","Cameras recovered from launch pad in Virginia shed new light on disaster .

"Six New Jersey residents have filed a federal lawsuit against Governor Chris Christie, the state of New Jersey, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and others over traffic jams in September that made them 'late for work.' The suit filed in federal court Thursday appears to be the first civil claim over traffic jams that appear to have been caused as political punishment for the Fort Lee mayor. The plaintiffs want it certified as a class action. Lawyer Rosemarie Arnold says she filed it after learning this week that lane closures on an approach to the George Washington Bridge were 'deliberate actions.' Scroll down for video . Bridgegate has prompted scrutiny of nearly every aspect of the Christie administration and his Port Authority appointees . She says that her clients were late for work and that one suffered a panic attack. Christie has denied involvement. His spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment. The news comes after a woman who died after her ambulance was delayed due to the road closures enacted by Christie's political aides was identified as a 91-year-old mother-of-two who moved to America from Italy for a better life. Florence Genova had a heart attack at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey, on September 9 last year but her ambulance took seven minutes to get there because of the gridlock. However, her family today said they don't believe that her death was due to the delayed emergency response caused by the George Washington Bridge lane closures ordered by Chris Christie's aides. Mrs Genova's daughter Vilma Oleri, 57, told the New York Times: 'I honestly believe it was just her time. 'We want to stay out of it. It's not political.' Garden State circus: Chris Christie fended off questions about his management on Thursday, taking responsibility for the bridgegate episode but blaming specific staffers who have now been fired . But angry friends neighbors have have expressed their outrage that her care may have been compromised in any way for what appears to have been an act of revenge on one of Christie’s political opponents. The 91-year-old was taken to the nearby Englewood Hospital where she died later that day. It is not clear if the delay in the ambulance arriving contributed to the death of Mrs Genova, a widow whose husband died five years ago. On Thursday, Christie said he was 'heartbroken and humiliated' as he apologized for his staff's 'callous' conduct leading to the 'Bridgegate' controversy that will either dampen his hopes at a run for the White House or strengthen his image as a no-nonsense executive who places a premium on accountability. The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election . Christie revealed at a two-hour press conference that he has fired Bridget Kelly, the deputy chief of staff who conspired to block vehicle lanes to the George Washington Bridge, snarling traffic and delivering a political blow to a New Jersey mayor who refused to back the governor's re-election bid. 'I terminated her employment because she lied to me,' he said. 'I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team.' Christie also dismissed Bill Stepien, his former campaign manager who just days ago seemed destined lead the state's Republican Party, saying that exercising leadership sometimes requires politicians to fire their friends. Stepien has also lost a lucrative consulting deal with the Republican Governors Association, which Christie leads. Christie, who appeared confident and traded barbs with reporters, could see his presidential hopes disappear if it is proved he knew about the affair. He insisted that he first learned Wednesday about a raft of emails that exposed his staff's conspiracy. 'I was blindsided,' Christie said. He also said that he never considered resigning over the issue. 'Oh my god. I didn't do anything wrong. That's a crazy question,' a bullish – but not bullying – Christie told reporters.","The suit filed in federal court Thursday appears to be the first civil claim over traffic jams allegedly orchestrated by the New Jersey governor's staff .

"Terrorism experts have called on U.S. authorities to refocus their attention on domestic right wing terrorism after it emerged the man behind the atrocities in Norway last week took inspiration from American extremists. Accused: Anders Behring Breivik wrote a 1,516 page manifesto posted on-line '2083 - A European Declaration Of Independence' and drew inspiration from several American groups . It has emerged that Anders Behring Breivik lifted words from 'Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski and took inspiration from a range of other American right wing and anti-Islamic groups in his rambling 1,500 page manifesto discovered after Friday's attacks. The fantasist also referenced co-founder of Stop the Islamisation of America, Robert Spencer, more than 50 times. Spencer - who . is synonymous with organising protests against the proposed Islamic . centre near Ground Zero - has frequently written and spoken against the 'threat' of Islamic fundamentalists. In one such article Spencer wrote: 'Traditional Islam . contains violent and supremacist elements.' In a further endorsement, Breivik wrote that Spencer would also be an 'excellent choice' for the Nobel Peace Prize. Police and Breivik's lawyer says he confessed to, but denied criminal responsibility for Friday's bombing at government headquarters in Oslo and the mass shooting later that day at an island summer camp organised by the youth wing of the ruling Labor Party. At least 93 people were killed in the attacks. According to experts, much of the manifesto outlining his reasoning behind the attacks was directly inspired by U.S. extremist groups - many of whom are directly quoted. Activist: Robert Spencer speaks at Protest against Mosque/Community Centre in Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn on March 13 2011 . Inspiration: Unabomber Ted Kaczynski (right) is frequently referenced in Breivik's violent 'manifesto', leading experts to worry that home grown extremists might carry out an attack similar to that of Timothy McVeigh (left) Speaking to NBC news, . security expert Daryl Johnson said: 'This attack in Norway should be a wake up for our decision . makers. 'We could have a similar attack here, and that’s my greatest fear. 'We could have a Timothy McVeigh-type . carry out a mass shooting event or a vehicle bomb attack that resulted . in mass casualties.' Part . of Breivik's manifesto was taken almost word for word from the first few . pages of the anti-technology manifesto written by Kaczynski, who is in . federal prison for mail bombs that killed three people and injured 23 . others across the U.S. from the 1970s to the 1990s. In . the writings, the Norwegian terrorist wrote of 'brutal and breathtaking . operations' in order to stop 'the ongoing Islamic Colonisation of . Europe.' Emotional: Hundreds of thousands of Norwegians packed city centres across the country yesterday evening to pay tribute to the people killed in twin attacks last week . Speaking to NBC news, Spencer denied  responsibility for what happened in Norway. He said: 'There’s nothing in any of my writings that is anything but a . defence of human rights, a defence of the equality of rights of all . people before the law. 'So if somebody gets from that that they should kill, well then he’s nuts.' In his 1,500-page manifesto, Breivik . styles himself as a Christian conservative, patriot and nationalist. Despite his own anti-Muslim views, he looks down on neo-Nazis as . 'underprivileged racist skinheads with a short temper.' Breivik changed a Kaczynski screed on . leftism and what he considered to be leftists' 'feelings of . inferiority' - mainly by substituting the words 'multiculturalism' or . 'cultural Marxism' for 'leftism.' For . instance, Kaczynski wrote: 'One of the most widespread manifestations . of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the . psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of . the problems of modern society in general.' Devastation: Work continues at the scene of the bomb explosion of the twin extremist attacks today . Breivik's manifesto reads: 'One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is multiculturalism, so a discussion of the psychology of multiculturalists can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of Western Europe in general.' In Internet postings attributed to Breivik on Norwegian websites, he blamed Europe's left-wing parties for destroying the continent's Christian heritage by allowing mass immigration of Muslims. He said he came into contact with like-minded individuals across Europe, and together they formed a military order inspired by the Knights Templar crusaders. Their goal: to conquer Europe by 2083 in a string of coups. Norwegian police couldn't say whether the group existed. Speaking to NBC, Heidi Beirich from . the Southern Poverty Law Center said: 'When you push the demonisation of . populations, you often end up with violence.' Repeat? This April 20, 1995, photo shows Federal law enforcement agents looking at the rubble of the Albert P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City . A . recently released report from the centre noted an upswing in . anti-Islamic attacks in the United States in the past few years, . including the burning of a mosque in Tennessee arsons and bombings in . Florida, Michigan and Oregon. Breivik wrote in his manifesto that he was a boy when his life's path began to turn. It was during the first Gulf War, when a Muslim friend cheered at reports of missile attacks against American forces. 'I . was completely ignorant at the time and apolitical but his total lack . of respect for my culture (and Western culture in general) actually . sparked my interest and passion for it,' the suspect in Norway's bombing . and mass shooting wrote in his 1,500-page manifesto. From . September 2009 through October 2010, Breivik posted more than 70 times . on Dokument.no, a Norwegian site with critical views on Islam and . immigration.

"This photograph shows the unique bond between a mother and her newborn son. But just two days after it was taken, moments after Lisa Parkisson gave birth to tiny Zac, the 35-year-old died suddenly in hospital. The new mother, who would have celebrated her 36th birthday today, was elated in the hours after her first child's birth. But just hours later, her family received a call from staff at the Royal Oldham Hospital, changing their lives forever - she had died on the post-natal ward. Just one day after this touching photograph was taken moments after Lisa Parkisson gave birth to her son Zac, the 35-year-old died suddenly on the post-natal ward at the Royal Oldham Hospital . Today Ms Parkisson's family are demanding answers over her death, as Zac's father Chris Harding along with her parents and sister plan his future without his mother. Ms Parkisson's sister Ally Ziemniak, 40, said: 'They said a midwife had gone into check at 8.30am and noticed something wasn't right and they tried to resuscitate her but couldn't. 'She was in bed, there was blood everywhere, it was so terrible.' Ms Parkisson went into labour on Friday evening and was admitted to hospital on Saturday, where staff found her baby was breech. It meant her planned water birth gave way to a caesarean operation and Zac was born at about 2.30am on Saturday. On Sunday, Zac was taken away to be observed in the neo-natal unit while Ms Parkisson rested after her operation. The . family returned home to Derker, Oldham, and expected to be joined by . the 35-year-old holiday cruise operator, in the coming days. But her father Mr Parkisson received a call on Monday morning to say there had been a medical emergency. Ms . Ziemniak, a mother-of-five, added: 'When we got there we expected to be . told she’d had to go into surgery but she was already dead.' Ms Parkisson, a cruise manager, went into labour on Friday night and had planned to have a water birth. But staff at the hospital discovered her unborn son was in the breach position, meaning he would have to be delivered by caesarean section . Ms Parkisson's mother Judith Smith, pictured left with her new grandson Zac, said: 'When I hold Zac in my arms I will be holding Lisa at the same time. He's beautiful like her.' Ms Smith, along with Ms Parkisson's sister Alison Ziemniak, right, and the rest of the family are today demanding answers over the 35-year-old's death . After the . caesarean, Ms Parkisson had told her mother of an ‘excruciating . headache’ in surgery - and her family hyave today questioned whether it was linked to her death. Ms Ziemniak, a mother-of-five, added: 'She went into labour on Friday night and it was supposed to be a normal birth but when we got there the hospital found he was in the breech position so she had to have a caesarean. 'She had the caesarean by epidural so she was awake while she had it done. While she was having the caesarean she developed a headache which she complained about. 'I am numb about what's happened. We will always talk about her to Zac, he will know everything about his mum' - Lisa Parkisson's partner Chris Harding . 'They said it was tied with her blood pressure and gave her an injection to decrease it. The headache eventually went. We don't know if it was anything to do with her death because we haven't had the results. 'She was so over the moon with the baby. She had to stay in hospital because shed had the caesarean. She was okay on the Saturday and Sunday. I spoke to her late Sunday evening and she was fine. 'The baby had gone to have observations so she was going to get some sleep while he was in the neonatal bit, then on Monday morning my dad got a phone call saying there had been an emergency and we all went to the hospital. 'All the way to the hospital I thought it was going to be that she had to go back to theatre or something but she was already dead. 'I never ever want to experience anything like the extent of that shock again. It was the worst thing ever. 'The staff said Lisa was checked through the night and she was asleep and apparently the midwife went round at 8am on Monday and she realised that she didn't look right and they thought they could feel a faint pulse and started resuscitation. Chris Harding (pictured with Ms Parkisson), paid tribute to his partner and the mother of his son, 'I loved Lisa so much and she loved me. I am numb about what¿s happened' 'They called in the crash team who were there within three minutes and they tried to revive her but couldn't. 'We just don't understand it. When she went into labour she was fine. Even going to the caesarean she seemed well. But she said she had never experienced anything like the headache she had. 'She said she felt like her head was going to explode. All she said on the Sunday was she was fine but her belly was a bit tender. 'I do take some comfort after watching her go through the pregnancy and build up that she was going to be a mum - even though it was for such a short time. I do take some comfort in saying she died extremely happy. As sad as it is, she died experiencing that and that does give us some comfort. 'When she was about to go into labour she was about to celebrate her 36th birthday. She said it was the best early birthday present she could ever have.' Ms Parkisson's mother . Judith Smith, 59, a retired teaching assistant from Derker, near Oldham, . said: 'I've been lying in bed and its going round in my head all the . time seeing Lisa in the hospital after she died. 'She only held Zac for one day, it's so tragic. She was the most beautiful girl' - Ms Parkisson's mother Judith Smith . 'The memory I can't get out is when I saw her lying in the bed I just looked at her and thought and just prayed she was asleep. 'I can't get her face out of my head. I keep praying and thinking that she didn't suffer. 'The . last memory I'm going to have of Lisa is so precious - when they . wheeled her back from the delivery room after the birth, they wheeled . her round and she presented at the door and her back was towards me. 'But she turned around with Zac and she had this beaming, absolutely beaming smile on her face of utter happiness. 'I had never seen her so happy in all my life and she said, ""mum, look, he's gorgeous"". She was absolutely over the moon. 'She only held Zac for one day, it's so tragic. She was the most beautiful girl. 'She . was the most beautiful, caring, funny, gorgeous girl you could ever . wish for. I'm so glad she got that chance to hold him and look at him. 'I . thinking about how to get through today the next day and the day after . that. I'm just going to keep thinking ""Lisa, you have left me the most . precious gift ever"". The Royal Oldham Hospital has launched an internal investigation into the death of Ms Parkisson, pictured left and right. A spokeswoman said staff were unable to resuscitate her, and the cause of death is unknown . 'That . little boy is her. When I hold Zac in my arms I will be holding Lisa at . the same time. She will never be away. When I hold him she will be . there. He's beautiful like her. 'Whatever . happens we are such a strong, big family and again, this is my comfort - . that little boy will never ever want for anything. 'He . will be loved by so many people. He will be loved and cherished and . will want for nothing. He is such a beautiful baby. I just wish I could . have them both here.' Ms Smith, added: 'We want answers about what happened. 'She was a beautiful light, so funny, so warm, so kind and loved. And now that light has gone out.' Baby Zac is still in hospital while his father and family plan his future without his mother . Cathy . Trinick, head of midwifery at The Pennine Acute Hospitals’ NHS Trust, . which runs the hospital, said they were unable to resuscitate Ms Parkisson. She added: 'This is a really tragic event and our thoughts and condolences go out to the family at this difficult time.' She said the cause of death was not known, the coroner had been informed and staff were carrying out their own internal clinical investigation. Ms Parkisson’s partner Mr Harding, 35, said: 'I loved Lisa so much and she loved me. I am numb about what’s happened. 'We will always talk about her to Zac, he will know everything about his mum. 'I lie in bed now with her dressing gown, trying to feel close to Lisa. I just wish she was still here.' Ms Ziemniak, said: 'Lisa always said she wouldn’t have a baby, she loved her job, loved travel and loved to party. 'So when she got pregnant we were all so surprised. But she couldn’t wait, she’d made so many plans and when she’d had him she was just perfectly happy. 'Zac is the only bit of Lisa we have left and he will be so loved.' Her mother Ms Smith, said: 'We’ve had more than 400 people call and send cards, there’s been an outpouring - she was so, so loved by so many people. 'We will tell Zac all about Lisa, how loving and warm she was. 'We are a strong family and we are all supporting each other. When one of us breaks down we are all there for each other and it will always be like that.' Mr Parkisson, added: 'We’ll tell Zac how she did everything at 100 miles an hour, how bonnie she was, how much she made everyone laugh.'","Lisa Parkisson gave birth to baby Zac at 2.30am on Saturday .

"A British woman has attempted to sue her former lawyers for professional negligence claiming they failed to properly explain to her that getting a divorce would end her marriage. Jane Mulcahy claimed that, alongside a number of other allegations, her solicitors failed to advise her that finalising divorce proceedings would officially end her marriage. The Roman Catholic argued that the lawyers should have clearly explained that a divorce would terminate her marriage. The woman claims lawyers failed to advise that finalising divorce proceedings would officially end her marriage . She claimed lawyers failed to take into account her faith and should have recommended judicial separation - a step away from full divorce - as an alternative course of action, the Independent reported. Her claims, which were made against two separate firms of solicitors, had already been rejected by the court, but Ms Mulcahy sunbequently appealed against the dismissal of certain aspects of the case. Thrown out: Judge Lord Justice Briggs dismissed the case . The presiding judge, Lord Justice Briggs said: 'The most striking of Mrs Mulcahy's many allegations of negligence against her solicitors was that, having regard to her Roman Catholic faith, Mrs Boots had failed to give her the advice which was requisite in view of her firmly held belief in the sanctity of marriage... '...either in terms of the alternative of judicial separation, or about the impossibility of pursuing divorce proceedings to a clean break settlement, without thereby inevitably bringing about the final termination of her marriage, which she wished to avoid.' Her case was rejected by the court. The curious case follows another bizarre divorce proceeding - a woman who is splitting from her husband over peas. Just one week after getting married, a woman in Kuwait has filed for divorce after discovering her husband prefers to use bread, rather than a fork, to eat peas. Traumatised by the 'shocking sight', she said she could no longer live with him, owing to his lack of etiquette. The Court of Appeal in London regularly hears bizarre divorce proceedings . The case of the 'shocking' peas, reported in the daily Al Qabas today, is not the only bizarre reason for wanting a divorce in Kuwait. One woman wanted a divorce because her husband insisted on squeezing the toothpaste tube in the middle and not the end. 'We are always arguing... He is so obstinate,' she said. Another woman divorced her husband on their wedding day because the groom had not made the costly arrangements that she had asked for.","Roman Catholic woman claims lawyers did not take her faith into account .

"Whistleblower: The tutorial Edward Snowden made for reporters on to avoid NSA email surveillance has been made public for the first time . Ordinary people must learn to scramble their emails, privacy campaigners said today, as an encryption how-to video made by Edward Snowden was made public for the first time. The former NSA employee who blew the whistle on the agency's all-pervasive online surveillance made the video to teach reporters how to communicate with him in secret. The 12-minute clip, in which Mr Snowden has used software to distort his voiceover, explains how to use free software to scramble messages using a technique called Public Key Encryption (PKE). The video's description on Vimeo says: 'By following these instructions, you'll allow any potential source in the world to send you a powerfully encrypted message that ONLY YOU can read even if the two of you have never met or exchanged contact information.' Mr Snowden made the video last year for Glenn Greenwald in an effort to get the then-Guardian reporter to communicate securely with him online so he could send over documents he wanted to leak. Viewers may find the video difficult to follow. Mr Greenwald himself admitted he wasn't able to finish it. It took him seven weeks and help from experts to finally gather the expertise to get back to Snowden. The video's publication comes as more and more internet users are adopting encryption techniques after the alarm caused by Mr Snowden's revelations about communications surveillance. He leaked documents which showed the NSA and its UK counterpart GCHQ were able to spy on virtually anybody's communications and internet usage, monitor social network activity in real time, and track and record the locations of billions of mobile devices. There was outrage when it emerged that, contrary to promises the NSA made to Congress, these technologies were being used to track U.S. citizens without warrants and to tap the communications of leaders of allied countries. One answer to the risks to freedom that such surveillance pose is to scramble online communications so that government agencies can no longer eavesdrop at will. However, the encryption technologies currently available can be difficult to use and privacy activists have called on internet companies to include them in their products at the source. Meanwhile, the campaign to end blanket surveillance continues as experts warn encryption tools are unlikely to make their way into the mainstream while internet firms continue to make their profits on the back of users' personal information. How-to guide: The video begins with a basic outline of the theory behind Public Key Encryption. It is voiced over by Mr Snowden, who has disguised his voice to avoid detection by NSA or GCHQ spies . Detailed: The video then explains how to use a free program called GPG4Win to scramble messages using Public Key Encryption then send them over Tor, software that allows people to use the internet anonymously . In Mr Snowden's video, he explains how traditional emails are sent as plain text - unencrypted by default - across the internet, allowing anyone able to intercept them to easily read their contents. 'Any router you cross could be monitored by an intelligence agency or other adversary [such as] a random hacker. So could any end points on the way there, a mail server or a service provider such as Gmail. 'If the journalist uses a web mail service personally or its provisioned by their company, the plain text could always be retrieved later on via a subpoena or some other mechanism, legal or illegal, instead of catching it during transit. So that's doubly dangerous . 'The solution to that is to actually encrypt the message. Now one of the problems with encryption typically  is that it requires a shared secret, a form of key or password that goes between the journalist and the source. 'But if the source sends an encypted file across the internet to the journalist and says ""Hey, here's an encrypted file. The passwork is cheesecake,"" the internet is going to know the password is cheesecake. 'But public key encryption such as GPG allows the journalist to publish a key that anyone can have based on the design of the algorithm, and it doesn't provide any advantage to the adversary.' The video goes on to specifically explain how to use a free program called GPG4Win to scramble messages using Public Key Encryption then send them over Tor, a piece of software that allows people to use the internet anonymously. It's lessons, as well as help from experts, allowed Mr Greenwald to communicate securely with Mr Snowden to publish what has since been called the most significant leak in U.S. history. It has been made public to coincide with the release of Mr Greenwald's book, No Place To Hide, in which he tells the story of the scoop. Privacy campaigners told MailOnline . today that all internet users should be now using encryption technology . to preserve their privacy and maintain freedom of speech in the face of . government spying. Javier . Ruiz, director of policy at the Open Rights Group, said: 'Emails are . like postcards and encryption is a tamper-proof envelope. 'It’s . probably obvious that journalists, MPs, doctors, lawyers or anyone . transmitting confidential information online should always encrypt their . emails to keep that information secure. Inside story: The video has been made public to coincide with the release of Glenn Greenwald's book No Place To Hide, seen here at a Miami bookshop . 'But since the Snowden revelations, more and more ordinary citizens are adopting encryption software to help keep their emails private. 'If encryption is to be used on a mass scale, it will require companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft to embed encryption in their tools.' But TK Keanini, chief technology officer at internet security firm Lancope, said that it was unlikely that major internet companies would begin including encryption functions in their services as standard. 'PGP and similar programs are just too complicated for the masses,' he said. 'Managing key pairs, understanding revocation and all that stuff is too complicated for most, and thus adoption over the past 20 years has been limited to the highly technical – the uber geeks. 'Now, if a service like gmail.com had an option in there to perform digital signing and encryption in a way that most people could use it, that would have a huge impact; but it will never happen because Google and other ‘free’ services make their money on the fact that your data is in the clear and they can use it to market services to you. 'People need to understand that when people offer free services, you and your information are the payment.' Mike Rispoli, a spokesman for Privacy International, echoed those sentiments, but added that there needs to be more pressure on government to stop them from snooping on the private lives of ordinary people. 'It is critical that people use all technology at their disposal to keep their communications private and secure,' he said. 'We should all support the creation and widespread use of these tools. Ultimately, however, people should never have to do more or go to extra lengths to protect their rights. 'This is why we need political, legal, as well as technological, solutions to ensure that our privacy rights are protected. 'While people can use technology to empower themselves, we must also challenge the policies of Government and intelligence agencies to end the unlawful mass surveillance of people around the world.'","Snowden made video to teach reporter how to speak with him securely .

"A website called Ghetto Tracker that rates city neighborhoods so users know which areas to avoid has launched and its name alone has already caused a PR nightmare. The startup wasn’t trying to be funny when it introduced its beta site on Tuesday, but just a day after Hacker News caught wind of it they unceremoniously changed the site’s name. Though its creators have rechristened Ghetto Tracker as Good Part of Town with a new website, even that's now been taken down amidst accusations of classism, racism, and insensitivity. Racist? Ghetto Tracker allowed users to rate an area's safety. Using those ratings, the site would dub the poorly rated neighborhoods 'GHETTO' in bold red . ‘If your goal was to inspire 100 ""what's wrong with tech"" articles, you named this perfectly,’ wrote prescient Hacker News contributor bendoernberg. ‘I would highly recommend changing the name and addressing the problematic aspects of red-lining neighborhoods before you get absolutely hammered by a million bloggers.’ When a user looks up a neighborhood, a red warning of ‘Ghetto’ pops up in areas that have been unfavorably rated by ‘locals and people familiar with the area,’ according to the site’s now-removed ‘About’ page. This has led many to accuse the site of being not just classist and uncouth, but also racist. ‘They should simply geotag by ethnicity and save people the need to subjectively ""rate"" certain areas,’ wrote Hacker News boards2x. Profile: The site's interface, while it still had one, asked for an area or business. If the the place had been rated poorly by users, it displayed as a red dot on a map with the word GHETTO . Greenwich Village? Ironically, the app may not have even worked. One of the neighborhoods, ranked as 'Ghetto' was Greenwich Village in New York City (pictured) Writer David Holmes at PandoDaily agreed. ‘It’s pretty detrimental to society when we reinforce the idea that poor or crime-heavy areas are places to be categorically avoided or shamed,’ wrote Holmes in a piece titled GhettoTracker Is The Worst Site on the Internet. Holmes asked Ghetto Tracker is the whole thing was a joke. ‘This was originally seriously developed as a travel tool and the name ""Ghetto Tracker"" was meant to be something that people would remember,’ replied an unnamed person at the website. ‘Well, it worked, but unfortunately, it appears to have brought a lot of negative baggage along with it.’ The source at the website formerly known as Ghetto Tracker, who refuses to be named, said the site was supposed to be ‘both a satire and functional at the same.’ Florida's Tallahassee Web Design and its owner Casey Smith have been identified in a Gawker post as the programmers behind the site, but Smith maintains he was merely hired to build the site. PR nightmare: After a backlash that began just two days after reports of its existence surfaced, Ghetto Tracker was redubbed Good Part of Town. Its side look like this, though even that's now been taken down . However, the backlash proves most people took it seriously. By Wednesday, just one day after word of the app first spread, Ghetto Tracker was redubbed Good Part of Town. A stock photo of a white family was replaced by a black family. That site was also quickly shuttered.

"A space entrepreneur and billionaire has teased plans for a 'hyperloop' super train which he claims will enable people to make the 380-mile journey between Los Angeles and San Francisco in just 30 minutes - faster than it takes to fly. Elon Musk claims his super train, which he describes as a cross between 'a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table', will travel at speeds twice as fast as a plane and make the trip in half an hour. He plans to reveal the full details, including how the train would work and the maximum running speed, next month but claims an engineer who tweeted a hypothetical drawing of the train and its tracks was the 'closest guess so far.' Scroll down for video . Elon Musk will reveal his 'alpha design' for a 'hyperloop' super train next month. Many people have tried to guess how the proposed transport system might work but engineer John Gardi's explanation (pictured) has come the closest so far, according to the tech entrepreneur . An alternative theory, put forward by physicist Brian Dodson, suggests the hyperloop could be a pneumatic transport system consisting of a closed tube making loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The idea was inspired by plans proposed during the early 1900s, pictured . While some may think his ideas plain loopy, Musk has a track-record of thinking big. He . is the CEO of SpaceX, the first private company to send supplied to the . International Space Station as well as founding PayPal and electronic . car manufacturer Tesla Motors. Musk said that he will publish an 'alpha design' for his ambitious transportation project on 12 August. Musk teased the plans initially during the D11 Conference in California in May. Many people have been trying to guess what Musk's hyperloop system might look like and how it might work. It currently takes around 12 hours on the Coast Line train to make the journey between the two cities. The journey can be done in around eight hours in a car and it takes just one and half hours to fly. The top secret hyperloop train will take passengers along a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco, pictured, in a mere half hour. In a tweet, the Tesla Motors co-founder behind the plans promised to publish the alpha design by 12 August . Engineer John Gardi tweeted his vision of how hyperloop could be realised and Musk responded to his drawing with a tweet that said: 'Your guess is the closest I've seen anyone guess so far'. Musk has been teasing his high-speed transport network plans for around a year and has previously described it as 'a cross between a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table'. Another idea about how the super-train might work came from Gizmag physicist Brian Dodson. Dodson ruled out two popular theories; that the train could involve a vacuum tunnel or could be accelerated along the track using an electromagnetic cable system. Instead, Dodson believes that Musk is proposing a subsonic train. He thinks the hyperloop will be a pneumatic transport system that 'consists of a closed tube making loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco and passengers would ride in capsules within the tube.' The tech entrepreneur claims that his hyperloop super train could be three to four times faster than a ballet train like this one from the East Japan Railway. However he has plenty of problems to overcome from finding a business partner to obtaining land for this ambitious transport project . Elon Musk claims that his hyperloop super train will connect the Californian cities of Los Angeles (Venice Beach is pictured left) and San Francisco (right) with journey times of just 30 minutes . He first talked about the hyperloop in July 2012 in an interview with tech site PandoDaily. He said that the system will never . crash, is immune to weather, is three or four times faster than a . conventional bullet train and travels twice as fast as the average speed . of an aircraft. He has also reportedly said that the . ambitious system could be powered by solar energy and even generate more . energy that it would use. Musk believes the super fast service would have a build cost of around $6bn. While this might sound like a lot, current plans for a bullet train service between L.A. and San Francisco with a time of around 3 hours is predicted to cost in the region of $68bn. Responding to questions on Twitter, Musk said that his first design and possibly the technologies involved will be open source and that 'critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated'. Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa before moving to Canada and later the U.S. He taught himself how to program a computer and by the time he reached 12 year's old he had created and sold his first software program - a space game called Blastar - for around $500. Musk started Zip2 - an online content publishing software - in 1998 with his brother, Kimbal Musk, which was bought in 1999 by Compaq's AltaVista division for a reported $300million. Musk then co-found X.com - an online finance and email payment company - and a year later this firm merged with Confinity, which later became known as PayPal. In October 2002, PayPal was bought by eBay for $1.5billion in stock and Musk, the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7 per cent of these shares. In June 2002 Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets and its first spacecraft is Dragon. SpaceX was awarded a billion-dollar NASA contract in December 2008, for 12 flights of their Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011. Initially, Falcon 9/Dragon will replace the cargo transport function of the Shuttle and astronaut transport will be handled by the Soyuz. Musk is also co-founder and head of product design at Tesla Motors. He was previously CEO of the company but due to reported layoffs in the company, he took a different position in 2008. He is reported to have a 32 per cent stake in the car company, which is currently valued above $12 billion, as of 29 May 2013. Additionally, Musk provided the initial concept for SolarCity, which was co-found with his cousin Lyndon Rive, and Musk is the company's largest shareholder and chairman of the board. SolarCity is the largest provider of solar power systems in the U.S His cousin Lyndon Rive is the CEO and co-founder. He said: 'I really hate patents unless critical to company survival. Will publish Hyperloop as open source.' He also suggested that he could consider a partnership if he can find someone with the 'shared philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & without wasting money on b******t' he tweeted. There is much speculation about how the grand project could work. According to The Register, the most likely scenario is a maglev train running in vacuum tubes. This type of train is non-contact and electric-powered so is not slowed down by friction and could reach incredibly fast speeds using a relatively small amount of power. The idea has been around for years but have never been really successful executed. As well as relatively new technology, the hyperloop transport system faces additional challenges, including securing land in a picturesque and expensive location. However, answering questions from the public about his latest venture, Mr Musk said that the super train will be safe to use in areas prone to earthquakes. Previous theories of how hyperloop might work include a series of conveyor belts and even pneumatic tubes to push passengers along the line.","Elon Musk will reveal how his 'hyperloop' super train works next month .

"A 42-year-old man has been sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison after suffocating his quadriplegic girlfriend and leaving their two-year-old son with her body for 16 hours. Angelo Sanchez smothered wheelchair-bound Melissa Torres, 32, with a blanket after she criticized him for 'getting high' on angel dust, or Phencyclidine (PCP), at their home in Brooklyn, New York. He then left her body in the bathroom alongside their son Elijaah Sanchez, who was screaming and crying for his mother to 'wake up', before smashing a safe open in a search for cash. Scene: Angelo Sanchez, 42, has been sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison after suffocating his quadriplegic girlfriend, Melissa Torres, 32, at their apartment in Clymer Street (pictured), Brooklyn . Elijaah, now three, was found by police wearing a soiled diaper in the bathroom of the apartment in Clymer Street a staggering 16 hours later, according to the New York Post. 'He was screaming for help, putting toys back and forth in the broken safe,' Assistant District Attorney Josh Charlton told Brooklyn Supreme Court. In a victim impact statement, Miss Torres' mother, Norma Santiago said the toddler still does not realize his mother has died; he simply believes she is sleeping. 'He says he's going to see her and runs around the house crying, ""I want to see Mommy. I want to see Mommy!"" He's a sweet angel,' she said. Court: Sanchez left Miss Torres's body in the bathroom of their home alongside their two-year-old son Elijaah, who was screaming and crying for his mother to 'wake up', Brooklyn Supreme Court (pictured) heard . Following the murder on August 4, 2013, Sanchez admitted via a handwritten confession that he had suffocated his girlfriend after she 'got mad' at him for going out and getting high. In relation to his son, he wrote: 'The baby woke up and came to the bathroom and tried to sit on his mother's lap. I picked him up, the baby was asking if his mother was sleeping.' During the sentencing, defense attorney Martin Marshak claimed Sanchez had cared for his girlfriend for more than 15 years and had killed her in a drugged-up state. But Judge Matthew D'Emic dismissed the claims, describing the incident as a murderous 'act of cruelty'. 'It doesn't get much worse than that.' he added. As he was led away by prison guards, Sanchez, who has an extensive criminal history, said he never wanted to get out of prison because his life was 'over'. Ms Santiago is now in the process of adopting Elijaah.","Angelo Sanchez, 42, attacked quadriplegic Melissa Torres in August 2013 .

"Matt Stevens has dismissed the notion that scrummaging is a ‘dark art’ and has called on officials to sharpen up so less time is spent re-setting the set-piece. Many spectators are left frustrated by the number of stoppages that - despite new IRB regulations to reduce the number of collapsed scrums - disrupt the flow of play and cause games to run well beyond 80 minutes. With 39 appearances in the England front row to his name, Stevens is in a strong position to comment. The new regulations put more emphasis on pre-binding than a powerful engagement and the former Saracens prop believes more clarity is needed with the referees. Matt Stevens, in action for the Barbarians, tackles Australia flanker Matt Hodgson at Twickenham . ‘I think there are a lot of good points about the new scrummaging laws,’ said Stevens. ‘We’ve got hookers hooking again and we’ve got scrums generally staying up more than when we had just a full out hit without the bind. It would be good to speed them up a bit, but how do we do that? ‘I hate this ‘dark arts’ label of no-one knowing what’s going on. If you speak to any bio-kinnetist of physiologist, it’s all about body positions and power vectors. If you’re a referee at the highest level today, you’ve got to know exactly what’s going on. It’s not an excuse to say that it’s just the front row so no one knows, because it’s not actually that difficult. It’s just a perception.’ The new regulations surrounding the collision at the scrum are also intended to reduce injury. A report in the British Journal of sports medicine found that in the 2011/12 Aviva Premiership season, before the new rules were introduced, 88 per cent of scrum-related injuries fell upon those in the front row. Stevens (right) tries to halt the progress of Wallabies fly-half Quade Coooper last Saturday . But England still have a high injury toll among their forwards – with Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero all among the front row absentees – and Stevens believes the added emphasis on scrummaging in the northern hemisphere is a root of the problem. ‘The Premiership is the toughest competition in world rugby in terms of playing good teams week in week out,’ said Stevens. ‘There’s not a huge amount of rest time and more you’ve got a set piece battle every single weekend. In Super Rugby there are big dynamic back lines and big physical ball carriers, but in the Premiership you’ve an extremely physical pack to deal with. I think it takes its toll. ‘I don’t know the nature of all of England’s injuries, but Cole’s is a neck injury, which is a scrummaging injury. He played a huge amount of Test rugby early on in his career. You battle it out you eventually get injured. In professional rugby that’s what happens.’ Former Saracens prop Matt Stevens was part of Warren Gatland's 2013 Lions squad that toured Australia .","Former Saracens prop Matt Stevens has won 39 caps for England .

"Today, Mars's surface is an arid desert - but the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft has returned strong evidence for an ocean once covering part of the red planet's surface. Using radar, the orbiter has detected sediments reminiscent of an ocean floor within the boundaries of areas previously picked out as ancient shorelines on Mars. The ocean would have covered the northern plains billions of years ago. The radar detected sediments reminiscent of an ocean floor inside previously identified, ancient shorelines on the red planet . The Mars Express spacecraft found evidence of sediment on the surface - possibly from earlier oceans . Jérémie Mouginot of University of California, Irvine, and colleagues have analyzed more than two years of data and found that the northern plains are covered in low-density material. 'We interpret these as sedimentary deposits, maybe ice-rich,' says Dr. Mouginot. 'It is a strong new indication that there was once an ocean here. The existence of oceans on ancient Mars has been suspected before - and spacecraft have previously identified 'shores'. The sediment deposits are further evidence of Mars's watery past - with researchers saying oceans might have covered the planet twice, once four billion years ago, when warmer conditions prevailed, and also the billion years ago when subsurface ice melted following a large impact. The orbiter's MARSIS radar scans the subsurface, and revealed tell-tale sediment that could have come from an ancient ocean . The scientists say that the most recent ocean on Mars, three billion years ago, would have dried too quickly to play host to life - but the older ocean could have contained life . 'Our radar penetrates deep into the ground, revealing the first 60-80 meters of the planet’s subsurface,t says Wlodek Kofman, leader of the radar team. 'Throughout all of this depth, we see the evidence for sedimentary material and ice.' The sediments revealed by MARSIS are areas of low radar reflectivity . Such sediments are typically low-density granular materials that have been eroded away by water and carried to their final destination. The second ocean, three billion years ago, would however have been temporary. Within a million years or less, Dr. Mouginot estimates, the water would have either frozen back in place and been preserved underground again, or turned into vapor and lifted gradually into the atmosphere. 'I don’t think it could have stayed as an ocean long enough for life to form.' In order to find evidence of life, astrobiologists will have to look even further back in Mars’ history when liquid water existed for much longer periods. 'Previous Mars Express results about water on Mars came from the study of images and mineralogical data, as well as atmospheric measurements. Now we have the view from the subsurface radar,' says Olivier Witasse, ESA’s Mars Express Project Scientist. 'This adds new pieces of information to the puzzle but the questionremains: where did all the water go?'","Oceans across north pole of planet .

"‘I’ve always wanted to be happy, so I decided to be’. Such are the prophetic words of the most unlikely kit man the game has ever seen. BBC Two’s drama Marvellous is the story of Neil Baldwin - professional clown, greeter of students, bird fancier and, as Lou Macari (played by Tony Curran) says in this fabulous tall tale of real life, ‘the best signing he ever made’. Baldwin is played with astounding heart by Toby Jones. But not all the weight is placed on this diminutive powerhouse’s shoulders. Former Stoke kit man Neil Baldwin had a drama named ‘Marvellous’ aired last Thursday about his life . Toby Jones plays Baldwin in the BBC drama that was watched by 1.5million viewers . Jones (left) shares Baldwin's (right) real-life experiences throughout the show . Tony Curran (right) also portrays Lou Macari (left) who was Stoke boss when Baldwin was the club's kit man . Baldwin (played by Jones) was  known as Nello due to his passion for wanting to join the circus as a kid . Because one of the great twists in the way this story is told, is that Toby’s Neil occasionally has a chat with the real Neil. As indeed does the real Macari. And it is a fantastic little dramatic device, because it serves to remind us that we are in fact seeing remarkable, life-affirming things that actually happened. Neil is one of life’s innocents, who has simply gone about his business with the assumption that if you ask for it, you’ll more than likely get it. We first see him as Nello the clown, because as a kid he wanted to join the circus. So he did. But when he falls out with the ringmaster, he makes his way home to Stoke-on-Trent and decides to pursue another course. First he turns up at Keele University to, well, welcome students. No one asked him to. He just thought he should. But then he meets Macari, the newly appointed manager of Neil’s beloved Stoke City. And before you know it, Nello the clown is the Potters' kit man. Baldwin (left) struck an extremely close bond with Stoke boss  Macari (right) during his tenure in charge . Baldwin (left) infamously lifted his kilt up once while Macari (right) was conducting a TV interview . Aside from his relationship with his ailing mum - beautifully played by Gemma Jones - this is the real soul of the story. Because we are seeing a very square peg in an extraordinarily round hole. He gets stick from some players. He gets abuse from the crowd. But Neil’s extraordinary ability to insist on always drinking from a glass half full means that he ultimately becomes something of a hero to both - while, at times, dressed in a chicken suit, or doing his Brian Clough team talks in top hat and tails. There is even a great actual clip of Macari being interviewed on the Stoke pitch while Neil sneaks into shot to show us what he’s wearing under his comedy kilt! Baldwin earned Stoke cult status (played by Jones - far right) for stunts such as dressing in a chicken suit . Gemma Jones plays Baldwin's mum in the drama - a figure who was dearly close to the Stoke kit man . This relationship between gaffer and kit man was clearly so strong, the real Macari confirms at one point to his actor counterpart that he did actually bring Neil on as a sub in a testimonial. Although as the real Neil tells Toby’s Neil when sitting together in the Stoke dug out, he didn’t actually score with the flying header that we see Jones tuck away with aplomb. So perhaps some things are just a bit too extraordinary. As has Neil’s life, Marvellous features some great little star cameos including Gary Lineker - who helped him recruit players for the Neil Baldwin Football Club - and Uriah Rennie, who turned up to ref a game for him. And as we see at the end of the programme, Neil Baldwin FC is still a team. Keele University presented him with an honorary degree and the Stoke crowd sings his name. And his church choir was happy to come together to perform a rendition of the club’s anthem ‘Delilah’. People, it would seem, just can’t help but like doing nice things for Neil.

"Talking shopping carts, free movie tickets and supermarket cooking classes are just a few of the latest recommendations the government is proposing to trim America's waistband. The new proposals were detailed in an 80-page report released this month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is focused on the 42million Americans receiving food stamps. However, it's uncertain if grocery stores will take up these new programs as First Lady Michele Obama is already coming under criticism for her health school lunches. The new recommendations are designed to reward healthy eating and change supermarket layouts and programs to highlight more nutritional foods. Talking carts: The USDA recently released a report this month which recommends grocery stores adopt new talking grocery carts that let shoppers know when they've purchased enough healthy foods. Above, healthy eating champion Michelle Obama pushing a cart at target in 2011 . 'Most Americans, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants, do not purchase enough whole grains, dark green and orange vegetables, and legumes, and purchase too many items with excess calories from fats and added sugars,' the report said. 'At the same time, the food retail environment is saturated with food marketing messages, including health and nutrition claims and information, advertisements, and promotions for many unhealthy food items,' it added. THE USDA first recommends that SNAP shoppers be rewarded for their healthy food choices with movie tickets or discounts. SNAP shoppers will be helped meeting their healthy food quote with high-tech shopping carts. These so-called 'MyCarts' Will be color-coded and physically divided by differently healthy food groups and notify when the shopper has enough to qualify for a reward. 'You achieved a MyCart healthy shopping basket!' it will say. However, it's uncertain how willing grocery store chains would be to invest $30,000 into the carts per store. Kids state dinner: President Barack Obama joins first lady Michelle Obama, the host of the ""Kids State Dinner' in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, July 18, 2014 . Washington's Free Beacon used chain Safeway as example, which would have to spend $40.04million to install the carts in all of its 1,335 stores. Other recommendations detailed in the report cooking classes held in grocery stores and employees who would act as 'ambassadors' to explain the different rewards programs. 'In this role, floor staff has the ability to re-direct consumer purchase towards more healthful choices by explaining the incentive or the nutrition labeling system,' the report said. The USDA hopes to implement these programs in order to 'change the choice architecture of the food retail environment'. It's uncertain how willing grocery stores would be to implement all of these programs into their stores, as first lady Michelle Obama is already receiving a lot of flak for her healthy school lunch program. The first lady went on the offensive Friday as she hosted the Kids State Dinner at the White House today. While congratulating the kid winners of a nationwide healthy recipe contest, Mrs Obama said their meals show that nutritious food has a place in school lunchrooms. Mrs. Obama was alluding to a dispute she's currently in with the School Nutrition Association over new federal standards to make school lunches more nutritious. The group says the rules are too strict. It wants Congress to relax them and a bill pending in the Republican-controlled House would do just that. The first lady and the nation's agriculture secretary say many schools are meeting the standards and oppose softening the rules. Mrs. Obama commented Friday at a White House 'state dinner' for the 54 winners of that national recipe contest. Mrs Obama defended her health school lunches at the event, saying the winning recipes show that healthy lunches do have a place in school .","Proposals detailed in 80-page report published by USDA this month .

'But there will only be a handful of officials and journalists. I feel sorry for the fans, some of whom haven't missed a single Bayern away match in 25 years.' Those very supporters are sure to be content with Pep Guardiola's side keeping their 100 per cent intact in Group E, however, even if they were forced to watch it on television. And ensuring their second Champions League win started with two of Germany's 2014 World Cup heroes. Gotze, who scored the only goal of the summer's final in Brazil against Argentina, was hacked down in the box by his name-sake Fernandes as he cut inside. That allowed Muller, the World Cup silver boot winner for Germany, to finish in typical fashion to gift Bayern a 1-0 lead after 22 minutes. The 25-year-old, up against  Igor Akinfeev, slotted the ball high down the centre of the goal as the CSKA goalkeeper dived to the right. It wasn't all comfortable for Guardiola, though, as CSKA were left to rue two wonderful opportunities to draw level before the break.

"An eccentric Australian businessman who is contesting this weekend’s general election claimed today that Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy ‘and that’s why Rupert got rid of her.’ Multi-millionaire Clive Palmer, 59, renowned for his plans to construct a replica of the Titanic in conjunction with a Chinese company and for his dreams of creating an animated Jurassic Park in Queensland, also said today that he was planning to sue Mr Murdoch. He was furious about an article in a Murdoch newspaper, The Australian, which questioned his wealth and whether he was a university professor and a mining magnate, as he claims. Claims: Clive Palmer, an eccentric Australian businessman who is contesting this weekend's general election claimed today that Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy 'and that's why Rupert got rid of her' In his attack on Mr Murdoch he did not exclude the media magnate’s former wife, Miss Deng - who will be remembered for her defence of her husband when she prevented a protester from smashing a pie into his face during the hacking inquiry before the House of Commons Select Committee in July 2011. ‘You know Rupert Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy and that’s been right across the world,’ he claimed during an interview on the Channel Nine tv network. ‘She’s been spying on Rupert for years, giving money back to Chinese intelligence. Outspoken: Multi-millionaire Clive Palmer, 5 also said today that he was planning to sue Mr Murdoch . Standing by her man: Wendi Deng (wearing pink jacket) is famous for punching the man who threw a pie at her husband's face during a parliamentary committee hearing . ‘She was trained in southern China. I’m telling you the truth. ‘Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy and that’s why Rupert got rid of her.’ Along with his claims, Mr Palmer, who . insists his Palmer United Party will win ‘a lot of Senate seats and a . lot of House of Representative seats’ in the upcoming election, said he . was going ahead with his determination to sue Mr Murdoch for the article . attacking his credibility. Outlandish: Mr Palmer is renowned for his plans to construct a replica of the Titantic in conjunction with a Chinese company and for his dreams of creating an animated Jurassic Park in Queensland . The Australian newspaper said that ‘contrary to the flim-flam and spin, Clive Frederick Palmer is not a professor, not an adviser to the G20, not a mining magnate, not a legal guru and not an advocate for freedom of speech. He’s probably not a billionaire.’ He accused Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who is now a US citizen, of ordering his reporters what to write and said the media magnate needed to be brought to account. ‘Murdoch will be sued by me today and will be brought to Australia to answer these questions in the Supreme Court,’ he told the Seven Network. ‘It’s time this fellow was brought to account, this foreigner who tries to dictate what we do.’","Multi-millionaire Clive Palmer, 59, made the claims on a television show .

"Russia's secret service has claimed that Al-Qaeda are behind spate of forest fires across Europe. The revelations come after deadly fires which have swept through forest . land in the EU over the past few months. Only last week a forest fire fanned by gusting winds forced the evacuation of some 2,000 people from a handful of small mountain towns in eastern Spain. In both Portugal and Spain thousands of residents have been forced to flee their homes as well as dozens of people killed. Devastation: A burning forest fire in Pedralba, near Valencia, Spain, last month . Flames: A tree burns during a forest fire in Domeno city, near Valencia in the early hours of September 24 . The Telegraph reported that the warning was at a meeting of heads of security agencies, by Director of the Federal Security Service Alexander . Bortnikov. He stated: 'One should note that setting fires to forests in the . countries of the European Union is a new tendency in al-Qaeda's strategy . of a 'thousand cuts.' He . explained that igniting fires allowed the terror group to inflict . 'significant economic and moral damage without serious preliminary . preparations, technical equipment or significant expenses.' Fighting the flames: Emergency services scrambled a massive operation to hold back the fires as they approached houses of the El Tanque village on the Tenerife island, Canary Islands . Scorched earth: A firefighter works to stop the spread of wildfires which sweept through parts of La Gomera, Spain, last month . Concerning: Smoke billows from a wildfire over the residential town of Chipude, near of the National Park of Garajonay . Ease: Mr Bortnikov explained that igniting fires allowed the terror group to inflict 'significant economic and moral damage without serious preliminary preparations, technical equipment or significant expenses' In May Al Qaeda called upon its followers to unleash massive forest fires upon the United States this summer. Published in an edition of the notorious terror magazine, 'Inspire', are graphic instructions for the creation and ignition of 'ember bombs' Detailed in the memorably titled, 'It is of your Freedom to Ignite a Firebomb', the magazine encourages any would-be terrorist to target Montana, because of the rapid population growth in its wooded areas. In May Al Qaeda called upon its followers to unleash massive forest fires upon the United States. Published in an edition of the notorious . terror magazine, 'Inspire', are graphic instructions for the creation . and ignition of 'ember bombs. In his statement Mr Bortnikov also said it was very difficult for special services to find and prosecute such arsonists. Last month wildfires forced thousands of people to flee their homes on the Spanish Canary Islands of La Gomera and Tenerife. Firefighters battled searing temperatures and stiff winds as the flames threatened a World Heritage site whose wooded land is 11 million years old. On La Gomera, the fires destroyed 7,400 acres forcing the evacuation of more than 4,000 people from 13 villages in the island's west and southwest. On Tenerife 2,200 were moved from their homes. In July dozens of people have been forced to evacuate their homes as wildfires sweep across the Portuguese islands of Madeira. Destruction: .

"UEFA referees' chief Pierluigi Collina says new concussion rules that came into force in the Champions League this week will clear up any doubts about when players are able to continue after suffering a head impact. The new rules agreed by UEFA and FIFA will affect all matches and give referees the ability to stop games for up to three minutes to allow the team doctor to carry out an on-pitch assessment of the injured player. Following that assessment, only the team doctor will have the authority to decide whether the player can continue or not. QPR's was taken from the field after 11 minutes against Southampton due to a head injury . Liverpool's Dejan Lovren is treated for a head injury against West Ham. Under new rules, coming into force during this weeks Champions League matches, only the team doctor could decide if he plays on or not . Collina said: 'I am pleased the new procedure in case of concussion will be implemented this week, just a few days after it was approved by UEFA's executive committee. 'In my opinion, the new procedure gives referees a clear view of who makes the final decision on whether a player can continue to play or has to leave the game - it is the team doctor and no-one else. I hope this will lead to improved health and safety of players overall.' The new rules follow several cases last season - notably Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira and Germany's Christoph Kramer at the 2014 World Cup, and Everton's Romelu Lukaku and Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris in the Premier League - of players carrying on despite suffering head injuries.

"The Socialist mayor of Paris has announced plans to ban smoking in city parks as part of a plan to cut down on tobacco-related illnesses. In a muddled announcement on national TV on Sunday, Anne Hidalgo said the move would be an experiment aimed at ‘teaching people about cigarette addiction’. This is despite the recent history of France’s capital being associated with famous Parisians puffing away in world-famous parks such as the Luxembourg Gardens and Tuileries. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the move was an experiment to teach people about cigarette addiction . Paris parks and gardens like Tuileries, above, and the Luxembourg Gardens, are world-famous smoking spots . Aware of the massive opposition that there will be to the move in a country where some 30 per cent of the country still smoke, Ms Hidalgo insisted that her ‘experiment’ would not be strictly enforced. ‘We are not into banning, we are experimenting,’ said Ms Hidalgo, who said parks in the unfashionable 14th arrondissement would act as ‘guinea pigs in this experiment’. But the move follows a new Socialist directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of Gallic culture is under attack. Traditionally liberal Parisians are renowned the world over for sitting outside smoking and drinking as they discuss the arts and philosophy. Under the plan Parisians and tourists, like Swiss visitors Manuel Schneiter, left, Nina Schmid and Miriam Dudler, won't be able to enjoy cigarettes in city parks . Smoking is already technically banned in cafes, restaurants, stations and museums in Paris . Smoking is now technically banned in all inside public places in France, including cafes, restaurants, stations and museums. But terraces and other places outdoors are not included in the ban, because the chances of smokers harming those sitting around them are considered miniscule. Smoking is also on course to be banned in public parks and other council-controlled outdoor areas in Scotland, under radical plans to make the country ‘smoke free’ by 2034. Tobacco-related illnesses are a leading cause of death in France, with an estimated 73,000 deaths annually. Despite massive taxes on cigarette sales, health warnings, and every more stringent bans, there are still some 16 million smokers in France. France is ‘paralysed’ and desperately needs reforms aimed at revitalising its crumbling economy, claims the country’s Socialist Prime Minister. Manuel Valls spoke out during the first day of a vital business summit aimed at creating half-a-million jobs and cutting public spending in return for lower taxes. The country’s unemployment rate has soared above the 3.3 million mark as entrepreneurs leave because of failing Socialist policies, including a top tax rate of 75 per cent. Mr Valls said reforms were desperately needed because France was ‘paralysed’ by fear of ‘blockages’. He said Socialist President Francois Hollande is determined to implement reforms, despite opposition from his own party. On Sunday night, Mr Valls told Socialists in Vauvert:  ‘Without reforms, we are threatened by the stalemate, stalled and thus in decline. To not move forward is to start losing.’ Mr Valls said his aim was to ‘set France in motion’.","Anne Hidalgo says the ban aims to teach people about 'cigarette addiction'

"Dressed in woolly tights, leggings, an all-in-one vest and fleecy top, nine-month-old Maddy Andrew seemed well wrapped up for winter. But that did not stop a passer-by dialling 999 to report her mother Paula for exposing a child to the cold. Two policemen were immediately sent to Scarborough seafront to question her about Maddy’s welfare. Paula Andrew was playing on the promenade with her nine-month-old daughter Maddy when a police van and two officers turned up and began to question her . ‘We’d not even been there ten minutes when the police turned up,’ said Mrs Andrew, who has two other children aged 12 and 14. ‘They could see everything was OK, but they told me that they’d had an anonymous call saying there was a little girl playing on the promenade and she was cold. ‘I explained that she was fine and Maddy certainly looked fine. I told them that we came out to the prom all the time to play. I am not convinced police should be harassing mums playing with their babies.’ Mrs Andrew, who refused to give her name to the officers, said one had claimed it was their duty to ‘keep an eye on these things’. The temperature was 6.7C when she was interrogated last Friday. The nutritionist, 43, who has two older children aged 14 and 12, was told an anonymous 999 call had alleged her baby daughter looked cold . The 43-year-old nutritionist said: ‘Maddy was covered up and wasn’t cold, that was clear. It simply didn’t merit the hassle. ‘Where do you draw the line? Do you police children wearing too many clothes on the beach in summer? Can people dial 999 if they suspect a parent hasn’t put enough sun cream on a youngster? They’d be better off policing McDonald’s and checking that children are not eating too much in there.’ Mrs Andrew was on the promenade with Maddy while her financier husband Mike, 49, was surfing off the beach. She added: ‘It can take more than an hour for police to turn up if I call in complaining about yobs at the back of my house and sometimes they don’t attend at all, but an anonymous call can send them racing to the promenade.’ When one of the policemen asked Mrs Andrew her name, she responded: ‘This is ridiculous.’ Mrs Andrew was with her daughter on the promenade, while her financier husband Mike, 49, was surfing off the beach at Scarborough. She had been out of the car for less than 10 minutes when the police arrived . After refusing to reveal who she was, Mrs Andrew, from Scarborough, was asked: ‘So you don’t want to co-operate?’ She said: ‘I told them that it was a mother’s right to play with her daughter and it wasn’t a co-operation thing. ‘I added that they’d be taking her to the social workers next if I gave them my details. I wasn’t doing anything wrong, so I walked off.’ A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said yesterday : ‘All reports concerning the safety of children are taken very seriously by North Yorkshire Police and must be properly checked out.’ But Stephen Hayes, an ex-policeman and writer, said the case typified what was wrong with modern policing. ‘This is by far the barmiest cold case I have ever come across,’ he added. ‘Do officers now need a thermometer to take children’s temperatures along with their truncheons? The mother is clearly not committing a crime by taking her child for a walk along the promenade. ‘In most areas it is easier to order a takeaway pizza and get it delivered than get a response to an emergency 999 call, so it is astonishing that, when there is a swift response, it is to a totally innocent lady playing with her baby.’","Paula Andrew was playing on promenade with nine-month-old daughter .

"Any mother would stick their neck out to defend a child. But this giraffe goes beyond the call of duty for her calf, taking on an entire pride of lions - and winning. The tall creature, filmed at the Olare Conservancy in the Masai Mara reserve, Kenya, was caught on camera as the ravenous predators saunter towards it. Scroll down for video . Let battle commence: The giraffe was approached by the gang of hungry lions, but kicked out at them . About turn: The pride of lions rush away when they are confronted with the giraffe's hard hooves . But the giraffe, which has its offspring sheltering between its legs, seemed in no mood for letting the lions win their meal. When the beasts, moving as one, start to bolt towards her, she fends them all off by aggressively waving her long legs towards them. A tense stalemate follows, after which the lions remember that discretion is the better part of valour and move on. The encounter was captured by tourists Bill and Barbara Westbrook on a visit to the Kicheche Bush Camp. Get back! The giraffe sends the lions into a panic after lunging forward with its legs . The patient hunter: The lions then try to approach from behind, but are repelled . Turnaround: The dramatic confrontation, in a Kenyan safari park, continued for around half an hour . The couple, from Queensland, Australia, often visit the park but say this is the most incredible encounter they have seen. Mrs Westbrook said: 'This was remarkable, going on for almost half an hour as the mother protected her calf ferociously from the young pride. 'It was heart-in-the-mouth stuff as we felt we might be witnessing something brutal as the casual menace of the sub-adult lions showed little signs of abating. 'Eventually the giraffes got away and we breathed again.' Kicheche Co-owner and photographer guide Paul Goldstein said: 'Somehow Barbara managed to keep the camera still during all this drama. 'I am supremely jealous of this encounter but also very happy for them, next time they come over I will stick to them like glue.'","Pack of lions try to saunter over to mother and baby in Kenyan safari park .

"Every year tens of thousands of people have nips and tucks in the pursuit of the perfect body. Unfortunately, while business is booming, so too are shoddy techniques, as the plastic surgery industry is unregulated. Of the 100,000 procedures performed in the UK last year, five per cent ended with botched results. Now, a documentary team has gone behind the scenes at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and met patients desperate to have their cosmetic catastrophes corrected. They reveal a horrifying picture of butchered breasts, deformed faces and unsightly scars. Claire, from Essex, had a breast reduction that went horribly wrong. She explains the terrible complications she experienced after her surgery and, pictured right, the bandage that covered her resulting open wound . Claire had felt self-conscious about her large breasts since her early 20s. Her family paid for her to have the longed-for surgery as a 40th birthday present . Claire, a cleaner from Essex, had thought having breast reduction would make her life easier, but suffered from a complication that left her with rotten tissue and open wounds. 'It was horrendous. It was like a crater of just open flesh,' she said. 'The nipple was just standing on its own. I was really scared at one point that I would lose my right breast.' Claire had felt self-conscious about her large breasts since her early 20s. Her family paid for her to have the longed-for surgery as a 40th birthday present. 'I was very excited. I was really over the moon. It was going to be a brand new start,' she said. However, just two days after the operation she noticed her right nipple had darkened and the surrounding area had turned blue. She was suffering from necrosis, when breast tissue begins to die after it is deprived from oxygen. It left her with open wounds on both breasts. She will have reconstructive surgery once they have healed, a process which may take another two years. 'You feel like you've been mutilated at times and that's quite a difficult thing to cope with - especially when you know it was your decision,' she said. Surgeon Nick Percival, who treated Claire, said: 'People always . assume they will be in the 95 per cent who don't have problems but the only people who . are 100 per cent safe are those who don't have surgery.' He added: 'To choose to . have cosmetic surgery and then to suffer a complication is a shattering blow. When every day things seem to be getting worse it is important to . have reassurance from your surgeon that he or she has experience of dealing . with problems like yours and it will get better in time' And it's not just women who suffer. The second part of the documentary, due to be broadcast next week, tells the story of Mark from Liverpool who has the same disastrous reaction to breast reduction surgery. Mark was left with what he called a 'pepperoni nipple' following a disastrous breast reduction. He is considering having a prosthetic nipple implanted once his scars have healed . Mark went under the knife because he was embarrassed about his moobs or man boobs . The 38-year-old's left nipple fell . off as a result of suffering necrosis. He then opted for a skin graft, . which also failed and left him with a 'pepperoni nipple'. 'It looks like I've been attacked by a shark,' he said. His scars are still currently . healing, and after consulting with surgeons, he is considering having a . prosthetic nipple attached. He said this could give him the confidence . to take his top off at the beach or during football practice with his . friends. Breast surgery is the most common cosmetic procedure in the UK, with 10,000 breast enlargements and 4,500 breast reductions taking place every year. Louise, a mother-of-five was one such woman who decided to have her sagging breasts lifted to boost her confidence. But the 33-year-old from Manchester was horrified when her breasts were left extremely lopsided and excruciating to touch. 'I can't take my children . swimming or hug them,' she said. 'I get pain in my right breast and it's rock solid at . the top. It's just ruined my life.' She had an extreme form of capsular contraction, the most common complication with breast surgery where scar tissue around the implants hardens and contract. This can occur at any time after the operation. Surgeons carefully removed her implants, followed by the capsule of scar tissue from her breasts. After flushing out the area they then lifted each breast in turn and put in new implants. Louise, a mother-of-five, was left with lopsided and hard, painful breasts after having a breast lift . But the drama wasn't yet over for Louise. She complained of extreme leg pain as she awoke from the operation and . surgeons realised she was suffering from compartment syndrome. This extreme reaction to an operation occurs when there is not enough blood flowing to the limb. If . untreated, it can cause muscles to die and may even lead to amputation. She underwent another operation to reduce the pressure on her leg . muscles and was given extra oxygen. Thankfully, her condition improved. Another growing problem for surgeons is the rise of bargain basement facelifts. Sarah, a 37-year-old student from the Middle East, had £3,000 injections to plump up her cheeks when she was 30. 'Everyone told me I didn't need filler and my face was very nice but I didn't care, I decided to have it,' she admitted.' A . year later they the filler began to move and left her in permanent . pain. Her face was no longer balanced and she was left with unsightly . lumps under the skin. She came forward for help after suffering three . facial infections in the past year. 'I wish I had never had filler. I'm very worried and afraid that I will be left with scars,' she said. A scan of her face revealed she had been injected with lakes of cheap permanent filler, which wouldn't dissolve away. Surgeons guided . a needle into her cheek using ultrasound and tried to remove the filler . using a syringe. However, when this didn't work they had to make two . small incisions and squeeze out the filler. The operation cost £4,500 . but at last her face is symmetrical and healing well. Sarah shows how she was left with painful lumps under her skin (left) after permanent filler injections. Right: After successful surgery to remove all the filler . The white areas show where the filler had spread under Sarah's skin . Leading cranio-facial surgeon Niall . Kirkpatrick at The Chelsea . and Westminster Hospital, said the cases highlighted the pressing need to regulate the private sector. He said: 'If we do not act to regulate the private sector this is . the future for the NHS.  The strain is just too much, not only on the . NHS – hospitals and GP’s – but on the economy.  Private cosmetic surgery . is rife for abuse without proper regulations; this is a serious problem . that will not go away.' Jazz Gowans, Managing Director at Transparent Television, who produced the documentary said: 'What is incredibly eye opening about this series is the pure power of anyone in a white coat... the trust that we all put in surgeons is rife for abuse in the wrong hands. 'People are still making mistakes and not asking questions or doing their research which means we are all sadly seeing an increasing element of our society, a generation of men and women, that will be disfigured forever.'The first of two episodes of 'Botched Up Bodies' will air on Channel 5 at 10pm tonight .","Five per cent of the 100,000 nip and tucks that took place in the UK in 2012 required further corrective work .

"An accountant who spent £25,000 on plastic surgery to achieve her dream body has been convicted of fraud – after funding her obsession by trying to sell fake gadgets. Maddison Hawk, 27, boasted she had ‘worked hard to afford my hobby’ when she hit the headlines for splashing out on a full-body overhaul including liposuction and breast implants before her 25th birthday. But her company is now facing an £8,000 bill after trading standards inspectors discovered she was offering fake GHD hair dryers and hair straighteners for sale on the internet. Maddison Hawk, who boasted of having her dream body after undergoing £25,000 worth of plastic surgery. Her company was trying to sell fake GHD hair dryers and straighteners . Maddison Hawk, pictured before and after liposuction and a breast enlargement. Yesterday her company was fined £8,000 at Oxford Magistrates' Court for trying to sell fake GHD products to fund her surgery . One of the imitation products from China burst into flames just seconds after being switched on, a court was told. Oxfordshire Trading Standards team leader Anu Prashar, who helped the prosecution, said a customer could have been seriously injured. She said: ‘It was extremely lucky that this happened during a test, rather than when somebody was using the product on their hair, as it could have resulted in serious injury. ‘People may be tempted when they spot cheap designer-branded products online and think that they are the genuine product. ‘Unfortunately, as this case shows, there are sellers out there who take advantage.’ Hawk told earlier this year about how she vowed to give her body a complete overhaul after she had her ears pinned back when she was just six years old. Hawk had spoken out earlier this year of how she 'worked hard' to fund the hobby of having a dream body . She drew up a list of treatments and operations she wanted and as soon as she turned 18 she spent more than £2,000 on semi-permanent make-up. Next came a host of chemical peels, countless lip fillers, regular teeth whitening and a £4,800 boob job boosting her from a 32C to 32H, aged 23. Hawk then booked in for liposuction on her tummy – and at the last minute decided to have the treatment on her whole body. Speaking at the time she said: ‘The way I see it, I’m £25,000 more beautiful than I was before. ‘I work hard to afford my hobby. I don’t go out every weekend but when I do go out, I want to show off my body.’ Oxford magistrates heard she helped to pay for the treatments by selling counterfeit GHD-branded products on shopping website Amazon through her company Perfect Strand. Prosecutor Sunyana Sharma said a trading standards officer posing as a customer paid £384 for four gift sets of hair dryers and straighteners on May 10 this year. Hawk, pictured before she spent £25,000 on plastic surgery. Yesterday, she admitted four trademark offences at Oxford Magistrates . She said they had GHD logos, but after checking with the company it was ‘very clear’ they were fakes and two were sent for safety testing. Miss Sharma said one of the hair dryers caught fire seconds after being switched on because it was missing a part which would have turned it off when it started to overheat. She added: ‘The appliance burst into flames because it did not have a thermal cut off, and for that reason it was deemed unsafe.’ James Reilly, defending, said his client had been ‘naive’, believed the products were genuine, suffered from depression and her company was now being wound up. Hawk, of Witney, Oxfordshire, admitted four trademark offence charges on behalf of her company and one offence of selling a product that breached safety regulations. She was ordered to pay a £2,500 fine and a total of £5,838 costs. Trading standards had discovered Hawk had been selling hairdryers and hair straighteners, claiming to be real GHD products.

Is it really so hard to understand that that doesn’t constitute . endorsement of either?’ Backlash: Some of the tweets written in response to Richard Dawkins. Many were outraged by his apparently casual use of rape, and argued that they made light of the suffering victims endured . The . professor finally withdrew from the argument after tweeting: ‘What I . have learned today is that there are people on Twitter who think in . absolutist terms, to an extent I wouldn’t have believed possible.’ But . Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People . Abused in Childhood, said the scientist had belittled the ‘devastating’ effect of sexual abuse. 'Date rape is bad. Stranger rape at knifepoint is worse. If you think that’s an endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think' Richard Dawkins . He . said: ‘What staggers me is that for such a self-proclaimed intelligent . man to even talk in these terms is to completely miss the point. 'There . is no such thing as mild or serious paedophilia. There is child abuse, . and the consequence for the victim is that they can be scarred for . life.’ Holly Dustin, . co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said Professor . Dawkins had ‘minimised’ abuse in his remarks. ‘Richard Dawkins is not . just engaging in light-hearted philosophical discussion when he talks of . “mild date rape” and “mild paedophilia”, but minimising these serious . offences,’ she said. Shami . Chakrabarti, of the human rights group Liberty, said even the most . intelligent Twitter users should sometimes ‘put their smartphones down . and count to 250’ before commenting on such sensitive topics. Response: Dawkins sent this tweet towards the end of the lively online debate, mocking some of the harsh criticism he had received . ‘There . is no mild rape, there is no mild paedophilia. These are terrible, . terrible crimes,’ she told the Daily Telegraph website. Professor Dawkins, an Emeritus Fellow at New College, Oxford, has previously triggered outrage with comments about child abuse. 'What staggers me is that for such a self-proclaimed intelligent man to even talk in these terms is to completely miss the point' Peter Saunders, National Association for People Abused in Childhood . He . said in an interview last year that he could not condemn the ‘mild . paedophilia’ he experienced at boarding school, adding: ‘We must beware . of lumping all paedophiles into the same bracket.’ However . in a statement on his website last night, he said he ‘was only talking . logic’, and had ‘no desire to make light of the seriousness of any kind . of rape or [sic] pedophilia’. In 2011, the then justice secretary  Kenneth Clarke faced a backlash after referring to ‘serious rape’ in a BBC interview. He later stressed that ‘all rape is a serious crime’ and that he had used the ‘wrong choice of words’. Controversial: Richard Dawkins . Professor Richard Dawkins has a history of sparking debate with his controversial views. In the past he has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits was as bad as 'child abuse'. The leading atheist said he was against the 'indoctrination of religion' and teaching it as fact. Professor Dawkins's best-selling book The God Delusion argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society. In . an interview, he claimed he had been told by a woman that while being . abused by a priest was a ‘yucky’ experience, being told as a child that a . Protestant friend who died would ‘roast in Hell’ was more distressing. In . remarks to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said: ‘Horrible as . sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the . long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up . Catholic in the first place.' Last . month he told an audience at the Cheltenham Science Festival that fairy . tales and believing in Father Christmas could cause children harm. He suggested it was 'pernicious to instil in a child the view that the world is shaped by supernaturalism.' In . 2013 he made headlines when he wrote on Twitter that a single college . at Cambridge University had won more Nobel Prizes than all the world’s . Muslims. His comments sparked fury on the social network where he was accused of disguising his ‘bigotry’ as atheism. He . responded to the barrage of ensuing criticism by telling his 782,000 . followers: ‘A statement of simple fact is not bigotry. And science by . Muslims was great in the distant past.’ He . also declared victory for Osama Bin Laden after he had a jar of honey . confiscated while he was going through airport security last November. Last . September, Professor Dawkins was once again embroiled in controversy . when he said that it was important to distinguish between varying levels . of paedophilia, and that cases involving rape and murder should not be . compared to 'mild touching up'.","Professor Dawkins used shocking rape examples to explain logical argument .

"Laura Ingalls Wilder penned one of the most beloved children's series of the 20th century, but her forthcoming autobiography will show devoted Little House On The Prairie fans a more realistic, grittier view of frontier living. Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography - Wilder's unedited draft that was written for an adult audience and eventually served as the foundation for the popular series - is slated to be released by the South Dakota State Historical Society Press nationwide this fall. The not-safe-for-children tales include stark scenes of domestic abuse, love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey. Scroll down for video . As a massively successful TV show in the 70s and 80s, Little House On The Prairie was aimed at all the family yet its original source material was much darker than what appeared on screen . Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder . Lane, herself a well-known author, tried and failed to get an edited . version of the autobiography published throughout the early 1930s. The . original rough draft has been preserved at the Laura Ingalls Wilder . Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri, for decades but hadn't . been published. The children's series never presented a romanticized version of life on the prairie - in Little House In The Big Woods, Laura and her sister Mary gleefully help dissect the family pig before bouncing its inflated bladder back and forth in the yard. But the series also left out or fictionalized scenes that Wilder deemed unsuitable for kids, including much of the time the family spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, and Walnut Grove, Minnesota, according to Pamela Smith Hill, a Wilder biographer and the lead editor on the autobiography. Video courtesy of The Pioneer Girl Project . Laura Ingalls Wilder, left, penned one of the most beloved children's series of the 20th century, but her forthcoming autobiography paints a more realistic and grittier view of frontier living. In the hit TV show, the character of Laura Ingalls was played by Melissa Gilbert, right . Pioneer Girl: The original version of Laura Ingalls Wilder's autobiography was likely written in the late 1920s and will finally be published this fall . 'So you can read Pioneer Girl as nonfiction rather than fiction and get a better feeling of how the historical Ingalls family really lived, what their relationships were and how they experienced the American West,' she said. Wilder details a scene from her childhood in Burr Oak, in which a neighbor of the Ingalls' pours kerosene throughout his bedroom, sets it on fire and proceeds to drunkenly drag his wife around by her hair before Wilder's father - Pa in the children's books - intervenes. Scenes like that make Wilder's memoir sound like it's filled with scandal and mature themes, 'which isn't exactly true either,' according to Amy Lauters, an associate professor of mass media at Minnesota State University-Mankato. 'It's just that that first version was blunt, it was honest. It was full of the everyday sorts of things that we don't care to think about when we think about history,' said Lauters, who has read the original manuscript and also is writing a book on Rose Wilder Lane. 'And it's certainly not the fantasized version we saw on Little House on the Prairie the television show.' The real-life Caroline and Charles Ingalls, known as Ma and Pa in the series: Pioneer Girl includes stark scenes of domestic abuse, love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey . The original manuscript of Pioneer Girl was written on tablet paper with lead pencil . Wilder's story will likely do well in South Dakota, since the author moved to De Smet in the late 1870s with her family, eventually meeting her future husband there. For fans, the autobiography is chance to see from where Wilder drew her inspiration, said Sandra Hume, a Wilder aficionado who published an internationally distributed newsletter for 10 years and now helps manage Laurapalooza, a conference dedicated to all things Wilder. 'I am very excited to see people have access to this, because her life story has been pretty muddled because people get mixed up with the TV show and it's nice to see an interest in people seeing basically what is the primary source ...' she said. The autobiography preserves Wilder's original rough draft - misspellings, idiosyncrasies and all - but adds extensive annotations. Little House lovers can learn about the three girls that Wilder combined to create the Nellie Olson character, or how extensive the damage was in Minnesota during the grasshopper plague of the 1870s, which forced Pa in On The Banks Of Plum Creek to set out in search of work. 'In some ways, I came to think of the annotations in Pioneer Girl as almost an encyclopedia about Laura Ingalls Wilder's life and work,' Hill said.","Hit TV series Little House On The Prairie was one of the most beloved children's shows of the 20th century .

"It is an old fortress on a tiny island, surrounded by pine trees and the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean Sea – the sort of property that looks like it should play host to the great and good. Indeed, for a long time, it has. Three years ago, Fort de Bregancon hit the international headlines when a pregnant Carla Bruni - wife of the then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy - was photographed strolling on its terrace. Island hideaway: The Fort de Bregancon was the holiday home of the French president from 1968 to 2013 . For over four decades, the Fort has been the very private holiday retreat of French leaders – a hideaway that has witnessed the private sojourns of the Gallic men (and women) of power. Now, after 45 years of being a restricted area, it is open to the public. The . current French president Francois Hollande has decided to break with . tradition and show the villa to the population for the first time – . as a symbol of a toned-down presidential lifestyle in tough economic . times. However, there are also suggestions that he has dispensed with the property because he is not enamoured with the lack of privacy it affords. Carla Bruni would surely agree. Sarkozy holiday retreat: The former French president and his wife Carla Bruni, were fond of the retreat, and pictures of her with a growing baby bump in 2011 were broadcast round the world . Favourite of French presidents: Francois Hollande (pictured with his ex Valerie Trierweiler in 2012) is also a fan of the holiday location but has opened the doors to the public . Images of her with a growing baby bump, captured by paparazzi in May 2011, broadcast news of her pregnancy to the world. The . property has no swimming pool – forcing bathers out to the beach, giving any lurking photographers better opportunities to take pictures of . presidential couples in swimwear. Sarkozy was fond of the fort, using it as a regular summer base, and was often seen cycling and jogging in its vicinity. But after . he married model-singer Bruni, he also liked to escape to her more . luxurious villa at Cap Negre. Dream hideaway. Or is it? Although based on its own island, the property falls within range of paparazzi lenses . The villa . is located on one of the most beautiful parts of the French Riviera, . some 25 miles east of Toulon, and a similar distance west of the gilded . resort of Saint-Tropez. It was a closed shop between 1968 and 2013 – but as of this summer, visitors can walk in its salons, dining rooms and offices. They . should not, though, expect the marble, gilding and elegant parquet . floors that you find in many French palaces. Instead, the white walls . and simple tiles on the floor – in the local Mediterranean style – make . it look like a family house. A certain simplicity: The property is more of a rustic Mediterranean retreat than a grand palace . The property’s simplicity is its main attraction, says Bernard Le Magoarou, the administrator of the fort. ‘It is the charm of the place,’ he says. ‘The president can live like ordinary people do, in a simple environment.’ Built in the Middle Ages, it became state property during the French Revolution of the late 18th century. Former president Charles de Gaulle made it the official residence after spending a memorable – if not very pleasant – night at the fort in 1964. ‘He had a terrible night, because of the mosquitoes and a bed that was too small. He decided to renovate it,’ Le Magoarou says. Taking a peek: The public are now able to visit a property that hosted French leaders for over four decades . Since then, every French president has ventured to the property to take time off from the demands of the Elysees Palace in Paris, to rest under the sound of the cicadas, and to enjoy the private beach and the spectacular view from the patio. Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette visited the island many times during his presidency (from 1995 to 2007), regularly meeting residents of the neighboring village. Not ideal: Some of the stylings in the property are decidedly dated - and its is very close to a public beach .","Fort de Bregancon hosted holidaying French leaders for almost 50 years .

"Crunch time. That’s how Dylan Hartley views the month ahead for England. He is well aware of the profound significance of the next four Tests at Twickenham in the run-up to the World Cup. The hooker and Northampton captain knows it is high time that the national team begin to establish a thunderous momentum as they build towards the home tournament which will define their careers. Stuart Lancaster’s men must attempt to do so against the might of the Southern Hemisphere, while the one encounter with supposedly lesser opposition pits them against Samoa - comfortably the strongest of the tier two nations. England hooker Dylan Hartley says the Autumn International are a chance to throw down World Cup gauntlet . Hartley (centre) passes the ball during an England training session as Pennyhill Park last week . It has reached a tipping point for England. They go into the QBE series on the back of a 3-0 defeat on their summer tour of New Zealand. They stood toe-to-toe with the All Blacks but couldn’t quite beat them and now Steve Hansen’s world champions are the first November visitors, on Saturday. England have beaten New Zealand only seven times, with the 38-21 win at Twickenham in 2012 standing out as the record victory. However, since then England have lost four in a row against the All Blacks. The stakes could scarcely be higher. No wonder Hartley sees the four weeks ahead in such stark terms. ‘It is getting down to crunch time now,’ he said. ‘We play Australia this series and next time we play Australia it is going to actually mean something. ‘It’s the same with Wales in the Six Nations. It is going to mean something so it is time to perform. Performance is the key word — hopefully the result comes with performance but performance is key for this whole series. ‘It would be nice to win all four but as long as we are performing and playing well, hopefully results come with that. This autumn series is going to be a step up.’ After the opening game against the All Blacks come the formidably powerful South Africans to confront an England team missing five Lions among their tight forwards, a worrying predicament with such a brutally physical contest in mind. England first face World Cup champions New Zealand on Saturday in the first of four autumn Tests . Hartley (left) dives to make a tackle for Northampton on Ospreys' Dan Biggar in the European Champions Cup . For Lancaster, losing both opening games would be a doomsday scenario, leaving his side on a run of five Test defeats just when they need to be making their HQ a place to be feared by all comers. At least one win from those two is vital with the bigger picture in mind. After Samoa, the autumn finale against Australia will serve as an important dry-run for the same fixture at the same venue in the pool stage of the World Cup. That match is about laying down a marker for the main event next year, against rivals who are in a state of flux. Five months ago England narrowly failed to undermine the All Blacks’ global supremacy. A weakened team dominated the hosts in their Auckland stronghold before losing 20-15 and a week later in Dunedin, Lancaster’s team lost by just a point after a stirring fightback. In the final Test England were routed in Hamilton, but they still had ample cause for hope amid the rubble. According to Hartley, there was further proof that New Zealand are not unbeatable — as South Africa subsequently proved in the Rugby Championship. Sonny Bill Williams returned to the All Blacks from rugby league in their match against the United States . ‘We take confidence but saying that, those Tests were at the end of our season,’ he said. ‘We were a little bit disjointed but that was the first time they had met up. It is the other way around now. They have been together for two months so they will be a well-oiled machine, but they are not invincible. People have run them close just like we did and beaten them.’ The grim night in Hamilton is one that Hartley, who was being watched by members of his family from nearby Rotorua, would like to erase from his memory. He added: ‘I want to forget about it. We got caught at the start and gave them three tries in 20 minutes. If you don’t front up early against the All Blacks they are going to run riot. Ultimately, what sticks in my mind is that we performed really well in the first two games and there is no reason why we can’t do that next week.’ England captain Chris Robshaw (left) leads newcomer Semesa Rokoduguni (second right) at training . For England, one powerful factor which will drive them on this month is the shattering memory of having landmark achievements snatched from them in cruel fashion. At the start of last season’s Six Nations they were closing on victory in Paris until a late lapse allowed Gael Fickou to score the try which ultimately prevented a first English Grand Slam since 2003. And in Auckland, it was Conrad Smith’s 78th-minute strike which denied the visitors the famous result that they emphatically deserved. Those episodes will keep the motivational fires raging. Hartley recognises the power of pain, from his experiences with Northampton. ‘If it hadn’t been for the last two minutes against France that competition (Six Nations) is completely different,’ he said. ‘Experiences like losing in France and losing at Eden Park in the last few minutes — that can only be good for the team. Gael Fickou scored for France to deny England victory in the last minute of the 2014 Six Nations match . England face Israel Folau (centre, charging forward in their tight win over the Barbarians) and Australia in the last autumn Test in a Twickenham fixture to be repeated in the pool stage of the 2015 World Cup . ‘At Northampton we lost three semi-finals, three years in a row, we lost the Heineken Cup final, we lost a Premiership final and I got red-carded. There are all these team things and these personal things. A few of us suffered like that, which is quite nice to have in the back of your head.’ Next weekend the Saints skipper is destined to line up as England’s only available first-choice front-rower in the absence of Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs and Mako Vunipola. Lancaster is also without injured locks Geoff Parling, Joe Launchbury and Ed Slater and flanker Tom Croft. Up front, the Red Rose stocks are depleted but Hartley believes they are still well-equipped to fight the good fight. ‘We are blessed at the moment in the England pack because we have depth,’ he said. ‘Anyone can come in and play. Look at Dave Attwood — he has been having a storming season. It’s unfortunate for some lads when they get injured but you need that experience of people playing these games now and being able to fill in if required.’ England are likely to exhaust their reserves over the next four weeks. It promises to be gruelling and enthralling and momentous. By the end of it, the World Cup host nation need their Sweet Chariot to be at full throttle, not stalling and in need of a service.","England hooker Dylan Hartley stresses the importance of the upcoming Autumn Internationals at Twickenham in the lead-up to the World Cup .

"People living in Seattle can no longer enjoy a brown bag lunch after city bureaucrats banned the term from official use for being racist. A memo sent out from the Office of Civil Rights also banned the word 'citizen', claiming it could lead to people feeling excluded in the multi-cultural city. The memo went on to offer politically correct alternatives that could be used in official documents and discussions. Politically correct: Seattle now has residents instead of citizens and sack lunches instead of brown bags . 'Luckily, we've got options,' Elliott . Bronstein wrote in the internal memo, according to Fox News. 'For ""citizens"", how about ""residents""?' Mr Bronstein defended the ban on a Seattle radio station, and said that the term 'brown bag' had historically been used as a way to determine skin color. Memo: Elliott Bronstein, of the Office of Civil Rights, has suggested alternatives to the terms . Paper bags had once been used as way to decide if African-Americans had what was considered to be a light enough skin tone to be admitted to certain college teams and houses. 'For a lot of particularly . African-American community members, the phrase brown bag does bring up . associations with the past when a brown bag was actually used, I . understand, to determine if people's skin color was light enough to . allow admission to an event,' Mr Bronstein said. The practice was described in Future of the Race by Henry Louis Gates Jr., who says he experienced the brown paper bag test when he started at Yale in the 1960s, according to the St Petersburg Times. The chairman of Harvard's Afro-American studies department, said: 'Some of the brothers who came from New Orleans held a ""bag party"". As a classmate explained it to me, a bag party was a New Orleans custom wherein a brown paper bag was stuck on the door. Anyone darker than the bag was denied entrance.' According to Seattle PI, Mr Bronstein claimed workers had raised concerns about the term brown bag in the past. To avoid bringing up its racist connotations, city workers in Seattle must now use 'sack lunch' or 'lunch-and-learn', according to Komo News. Many city employees have attended what used to be known as brown bag lunches - informal meetings where staff bring their own lunch to keep catering costs down. The ban is the latest in a list of terms that have been replaced in Washington state: . Brown bag - Sack Lunch or Lunch and Learn . Citizen - Residents . Freshman - First Year . Penmanship - Handwriting . Journeyman plumber - Journey level plumber . Citizens Service Bureau - Customer Service Bureau . Fisherman - Fisher . They must also replace 'citizen' with 'residents' because many people in the northwest city are not U.S. citizens. 'They are legal residents of the United States and they are residents of Seattle. They pay taxes and if we use a term like citizens in common use, then it doesn't include a lot of folks,' Mr Bronstein said. According to City Data, 94,952 - or 16 per cent - of the city's inhabitants are foreign, with most coming originally from Asia. The city had already moved away from using the word 'citizen' a few years ago, when it rebranded the Citizens Service Bureau as the Customer Service Bureau. Being politically correct is not just confined to Seattle. State lawmakers also voted earlier this year to change terms including 'freshman' and 'penmanship' to avoid gender discrimination. 'Words matter. This is important in changing hearts and minds,' Liz Watson, a National Women's Law Center senior adviser, said.","Seattle workers given list of alternative terms to avoid offending anyone .

"Honeymoon murder-accused Shrien Dewani is seen on newly released CCTV footage allegedly slipping away from a policeman and his father-in-law to secretly pay the driver he'd hired to kill his wife. Dewani failed to give an explanation for his seven-minute absence to either the father of his dead wife or an officer assigned to her murder, his trial heard. During the series of shots, the wealthy businessman is seen before, during and after the  meeting with Zola Tongo. It came three days after his new wife Anni was found dead in the back of Tongo's taxi, a bullet through her neck. Scroll down for video . Evidence: The opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the South African court shows suspect Shrien Dewani walking through the foyer of the Cape Grace hotel days after his new wife's murder . Suspicions: Dewani is in a corridor of the hotel, checking his phone and clutching a white carrier bag . Retail therapy: The bag is from a shopping trip to the nearby V&A Waterfront. The Western Cape High Court heard Dewani chose to shop for greetings cards over attending a Hindu ceremony to bless his wife's body . As well as revealing the exchange of money between Dewani and Tongo, the 13-minute sequence exposes a striking difference in body language between Mrs Dewani's obviously grief-stricken father and her apparently relaxed husband of two weeks. Dewani, 34, admits handing over R1,000 (£65) to Tongo during the short encounter, but says it was a tip, not payment for his wife's contract killing. Tongo claims he was short-changed by Dewani for organising hit men to kill the Swedish engineer, which the businessman had ordered to be disguised as a carjacking. The film, taken from a variety of locations around the Cape Grace hotel, begins with Dewani walking back from a shopping trip to the nearby V&A Waterfront, a small white plastic bag swinging from his hand. The Western Cape High Court has heard how Bristol-based Dewani chose to shop for African-themed greetings cards over attending a Hindu ceremony to bless his wife's dead body as it was prepared to be flown back to Britain. His father, Prakash, attended the ritual instead, which was organised by Vinod Hindocha, Dewani's father-in-law, and the two men are shown being dropped back at the hotel after the blessing at the mortuary. Dewani, left, is on trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his new wife Anni, right, on their honeymoon . Sad: Dewani's father Prakash and his father-in-law Vinod Hindocha return from the ritual to bless Anni's body . On the move: Dewani is shown again in the same location, this time clutching his laptop computer as well . Waiting: Dewani sits alone, peering at his laptop and mobile phone, in the hotel's closed in terrace . On his way: Cab driver Zola Tongo, dressed all in white, makes his way to his meeting with Dewani at the hotel. He claims he was recruited four days before by the newlywed to organise his bride's murder . Difficult: Mr Hindocha, Anni's father, arrives back on the hotel terrace after going to see his daughter's body. He is accompanied by a police officer who is carrying a newspaper splashed with news of Anni's murder . Read all about it: Dewani immediately snatches up the broadsheet and is seen scanning the front page . Time to go: Dewani apparently gets the message from Tongo that he's arriving at the hotel . Dewani, unshaven and wearing jeans, is shown carrying the small white bag and his laptop and settling down on a leather sofa in a quiet seating area of the hotel's closed-in terrace. The bag which came with the packet of greeting cards, is now holding the the money for Tongo, the court heard. At one point, Dewani looks behind him and up at the CCTV camera in the corner of the room. Earlier, Tongo told the trial that he had warned Dewani about the security camera as they met the morning after the township carjacking. They were waiting to hear news of Mrs Dewani, who had been driven off in the back of Tongo's taxi by two armed men, after the driver and Dewani had both been released unharmed. As Dewani sits peering between the screens of his laptop and phone, Tongo – who claims he was recruited by the newlywed to organise his bride's murder within minutes of dropping them at the hotel four days before – is seen on another camera making his way to get his payment, dressed from head to toe in white. One of the empty leather chairs opposite Dewani is then filled by Mr Hindocha, 65, who is accompanied by a police officer carrying a paper emblazoned with news of Mrs Dewani's murder. Dewani immediately snatches up the broadsheet and is seen scanning the front page, which shows a picture of the blood-smeared car from which her body was recovered. Shortly after Dewani is seen looking at his lit-up phone – Tongo messages to say he is nearby, the court was told – and stands up and leaves the room, the small bag of money is in his hand. He passes Captain Vinesh Lutchman who comes through the door - he was the first detective to investigate Mrs Dewani's murder, and was by this point the liaison officer for the grieving family as they prepare to fly her body home. On his way: Tongo is seen on camera walking towards the main entrance of the Cape Grace hotel . Entering the complex: He strolls up to the glass doors, which are opened for him by a doorman . A security camera in the lobby picks up the familiar figure of Dewani, in collared shirt, as he waits and paces while Tongo walks through the car park, just seconds away. As he comes through the imposing glass entrance, Dewani turns and walk off briskly, indicating that the driver should follow. In his testimony Tongo told the court, 'I saw the gentleman standing there. He was just standing at the beginning of the passage. He signalled me to follow him. I did.' The two men are seen heading down a deserted corridor and through the door of the hotel's small business centre, where they met for 90 seconds in private, away from any cameras. Tongo is seen leaving the room, his pocket bulging with the bag, and disappearing into a hotel lavatory - where he began to count the money. He told the court he had been expecting to get R4,000 (approximately £260 pounds), for recruiting the hit men and driving Mrs Dewani into danger. He said: 'I counted the money inside. There was only 1,000 South African rand [£65]. I was angry. I put it in my back pocket. I went outside.' Waiting: Dewani  is seen pacing back and forth in the hotel lobby in the moments before Tongo appears . Follow me: Dewani leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel which is not covered by CCTV . Paid, but apparently not in full... Tongo leaves. He says Dewani paid him R1,000, a quarter of what he expected . Dewani is then shown returning to his room upstairs, briefly, and comes back down the corridor with a large notebook – perhaps to use its retrieval as the cover for his absence - and re-joins his father-in-law and Captain Lutchman downstairs. He has been away for nearly seven minutes – but Captain Lutchman shook his head and replied, 'no, he said nothing,' when asked by prosecutor Adrian Mopp if Dewani had said where he had been been. Tongo was not a suspect in the carjacking by that point, the officer confirmed to the court. Dewani resumes his position in the leather sofa, opposite his father in law, and draws his computer on his lap to type. For most of the sequence, with the officer next to him busy with newspapers and police paperwork, Mr Hindocha sits entirely motionless, his head resting on his hands, his eyes staring at his lap. The body language between Mrs Dewani's husband and father could not be more conflicting. During the entire sequence, the two men are seen to exchange hardly a word. One last errand: Dewani is next seen returning to his room at the hotel . Just had to get this... He re-emerges from the room with a large notebook . Sumptous: Dewani carries the notebook back through the hotel's lavish surroundings . Mourning: He re-enters the enclosed terrace where his father-in-law is waiting, head in hand, sitting next to local police officer Captain Vinesh Lutchman who was acting as the liaison officer for the family . Keeping busy: Dewani fiddles with his laptop and phone as Mr Hindocha stays into space blankly . Dewani, his father, and Mr Hindocha left Cape Town the following day, accompanying Mrs Dewani's body. Three days later, Tongo confessed to his part in her murder, implicating her new husband as the chief conspirator in the plot. The driver turned state witness and told police how he had recruited two hitmen to help him stage a carjacking as the cover for the killing – a strategy allegedly devised by Dewani. Tongo was sentenced to 18 years for murder, hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe who confessed to his part was jailed for 25 years and Zolile Mngeni was convicted of murder following a trial and also jailed for 25 years, but died last month from a brain tumour. Monde Mbolombo is currently giving evidence against Dewani - he was a 'middle man' tasked by Tongo with recruiting the killers and spared prosecution in return for giving evidence at Mngeni's trial.

"An Oklahoma sheriff's deputy captured the heartbreaking moment a frightened puppy was found guarding its owner's body after Monday's tornado - and now he wants to adopt it. The black dog, splattered in mud, was discovered sitting in debris from a flattened home in the aftermath of the EF-5 twitter that barreled through the heavily-populated suburb of Moore at around 3pm. The sheriff's office initially released a picture of the shaken pet on its Twitter page with the comment 'scared, but this little pup survived.' Tragic: An Oklahoma sheriff's deputy captured the heartbreaking moment a frightened puppy, pictured, was found guarding its owner's body after Monday's tornado - and now he wants to adopt it . But today, they learned the brave little guy was actually guarding his deceased owner whose body was recovered beneath the rubble that was presumably once their home. The deputies took to Facebook to give the back story on the pup at around 5pm local time, and the photo has had almost 3,500 likes on the social-networking site. 'The dog was taken to a shelter and the deputy who found the pup, if possible, plans on adopting the dog,' the OCSO tweeted on Tuesday. 'Man's best friend to the end.' The news comes after survivors frantically try to reunite with their pets, displaced after the monstrous tornado. During an interview with CBS a member of the camera crew spotted the dog emerging from the rubble . Overjoyed: Both pet and owner were delighted when he emerged from the wreckage . Reddit users have established a missing pets thread and local business OKC Pups is also attempting to connect lost pets with owners. One success story is that of Barbara Garcia who found her lost dog beneath the rubble during a TV interview and their heartwarming reunion is bringing the internet to tears. As the Moore resident was speaking to CBS about the devastation the tornado had wrought on her town, her little pet emerged from the rubble of her home. Ms Garcia, who was clearly overcome with emotion, immediately declared God had answered her prayers. Another happy story involves the Hendrinks family, who were still missing two members of their household after the tornado flatted their Moore home on Monday: their pair of chihuahuas. The family's two other dogs were found under a pile of debris in the backyard but the Chihuahuas, Lola and Louie, were nowhere to be found until Tuesday morning, when owner Levi heard the faint sound of dogs whining under what used to be their home. 'That's how we pinpointed where they were at and started digging at that point,' Hendricks told NBC News. 'Their kennel was smashed down on top of them. The car was sitting on top of the kennel. We had to pry the kennel out from underneath the car and then pry the kennel apart to get them out.' Levi Hendricks and his two sons started digging and before too long the cute pets were free, and pretty happy about it. 'They were both wrapped around each other and inside a comforter. They were toasty warm,' he said. 'And both of them were just tickled to death to get out.'","The Oklahoma sheriff's office initially released a .

"Jonathan Davies believes his Wales team-mate George North can be a dangerous weapon against Australia following his forced switch to outside centre. An injury to Davies, usually the first choice No 13, prompted head coach Warren Gatland to re-deploy North from the wing to midfield for Saturday’s Test at the Millennium Stadium. The 22-year-old will line up against Tevita Kuridrani, the in-form Wallaby, but Davies is confident North has all the attributes to make a successful transition. Jonathan Davies suffered a shoulder injury playing for Clermont Auvergne against Sale Sharks in October . ‘He definitely won’t lack any size,’ Davies told Sportsmail. ‘He played a full Test against France and he was excellent that day. It shows the talent of the player that he can make that transition pretty easily. Everyone’s got confidence in him but I’m 100 per cent sure he’s a better winger than a centre – just to save my job! ‘On the wing you’re slightly more off the front line in defence and you trust your 13 to get there. Likewise, when you’re a 13 you trust your 12 to get there. It is slightly different defensively, but with George’s power and pace he can make up for it.’ Davies is among a group of Welsh players who play their club rugby in France. The 26-year-old joined Clermont Auvergne in the summer and admits he is still finding his feet across The Channel. Northampton Saints winger George North will deputise for Davies at outside centre against the Wallabies . He was left out of Clermont’s squad for the opening round of the European Champions Cup, but is still pleased with his decision to move to foreign shores. ‘I don’t have any regrets about moving to France,’ he said. ‘I love it out there and I’m getting pushed by world-class players everyday. I just have to make sure I find that consistency because I haven’t delivered as much as I’d like to. ‘One of the big things when negotiating with Clermont was my desire to continue my Welsh career. They were very understanding and I have full release for the four Tests in November, which I’m very grateful for. It’s a bit of a cloudy area.’ Clermont centre Davies believes his Wales team-mate North can be a dangerous weapon against Australia . Gatland confirmed on Thursday that all of his France-based players will be available for the final autumn Test against South Africa, having struck a deal with Racing Metro over Luke Charteris. ‘They are all available,’ said Gatland. ‘We released Luke Charteris back to Racing for this week and he is available for the South African week, so we have done a bit of a deal with them. The other French players are available to us.’ Dove Men+Care are proud to sponsor the Dove Men Series.

"Matthew Dewhirst was a much wanted and deeply loved son, who was conceived after nine gruelling IVF attempts. As his mother Sue, now 56, says: ‘We wanted a child so desperately, we’d have done anything. 'I kept thinking: “Next time it’ll be our turn to be lucky.” ’ ‘Everyone called Matthew the gentle giant. He was 6ft 2in in and 18st, and when he enveloped me in one of his enormous hugs, I fitted under his armpit,' said Sue Dewhirst of her son Matthew, who died two years ago . When she held Matthew in her arms for the first time, the endless hospital appointments were forgotten. ‘None of it mattered, because I knew from then on that our lives were going to be all about Matthew.’ He grew up to be musically gifted and mad about sport, and Sue would spend hours driving him to football coaching, rugby or guitar lessons. ‘Our lives — mine and his dad Chris’s — were really just about supporting Matthew to do whatever he wanted in life,’ she says. ‘And we loved every single minute of it.’ It’s been two years, four months, six days and a handful of hours since Matthew’s sudden death from an undiagnosed heart condition during rugby training at his school in Shropshire. He was just 17. Sue still struggles to comprehend how the life of the super-fit son she loved so much could be extinguished in an instant. ‘Everyone called Matthew the gentle giant,’ she says. ‘He was 6ft 2in and 18st, and when he enveloped me in one of his enormous hugs, I fitted under his armpit.’ The only shred of comfort Sue can find is in the belief that by telling Matthew’s story, other young people with undiagnosed heart conditions will be saved. ‘Matthew had symptoms — recurrent fainting during exercise — for nine years before he died, but we were constantly told: “You have only to look at him to see there’s nothing wrong with his heart.” ’ Tomorrow, the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) is unveiling a three-minute film to raise awareness of the risk of sudden cardiac death in young people, especially those involved in sports. Every week, 12 apparently fit young people under the age of 35 die of undiagnosed heart conditions — 600 every year. Many of them, CRY says, could be saved by specialist screening during childhood. This involves a simple electrocardiogram (ECG) that looks at the electrical activity of the heart. Sanjay Sharma, professor of inherited cardiovascular disease and sports cardiology at St George’s Hospital in London, oversees CRY’s screening programme. ‘Our lives — mine and his dad Chris’s — were really just about supporting Matthew to do whatever he wanted in life. And we loved every single minute of it,' said Sue . ‘Taking part in sport doesn’t cause young sudden cardiac death, but forcing the heart to work harder significantly increases the risk if there is an underlying and undiagnosed condition,’ he says. ‘In 80 per cent of cases there are no prior symptoms. But when symptoms do present, they include recurrent chest pain (particularly when exercising), palpitations, breathlessness, dizziness and fainting. ‘No one should ignore these symptoms, and if your GP is unconcerned, seek a second opinion with a specialist.’ Matthew played football competitively from the age of eight and that same year had the first of a series of fainting incidents. ‘The first time it happened was during a match,’ says Sue. ‘He’d passed out and stopped breathing. It was terrifying. ‘Chris and I ran out on to the pitch. Chris performed CPR and Matthew came round quickly. ‘We were assured by a paediatrician we saw in A&E that day it had been caused by a combination of migraine and stress, which he’d never suffered from before. 'Reluctantly, we accepted his opinion.’ Six weeks later, a private paediatrician examined Matthew, but he found nothing either. Eighteen months after that, Matthew collapsed on a cross- country run. Desperately worried, Sue, and Chris, 61, who works in the construction industry, took him to their GP: ‘He ran an ECG and assured us the problem was dehydration: Matthew wasn’t drinking enough when he exercised.’ From that point, Sue went to every game Matthew played and didn’t take her eyes off him for a second. ‘I never watched a match, I only ever watched Matthew,’ she says. In January 2011, just before his 16th birthday, he collapsed for the third time. According to Welsh Rugby Union rules — Matthew was playing an away match for his county — anyone who collapses during a game must be taken to hospital, so he was taken by ambulance from mid-Wales to Shrewsbury Hospital. The following day, a consultant cardiologist sent him for an ultrasound to check for structural heart faults and an ECG. Matthew grew up to be musically gifted and mad about sport . He was sent home with a heart monitor that he wore for three days to check whether the rhythm of his heart was normal. A week later, he performed tests on a treadmill. ‘I was so relieved,’ says Sue. ‘I thought we were going to get some answers. 'But we were told he was perfectly fit and that the problem was definitely dehydration.’ The day before Matthew died, on July 18, 2012, he came home complaining of chest pains. Sue, slightly exasperated, told him to drink more water. Ten hours later, she was in Sainsbury’s car park after work when her phone rang. It was the school nurse to tell her that Matthew had collapsed. ‘Sit him up and give him a fizzy drink ...’ Sue began. But without giving any detail, the nurse said: ‘I’m afraid it’s much worse than that.’ She rushed to the school, but the moment she saw the air ambulance on the pitch, she knew. Sue and Chris were too numb with shock even to cry. ‘It was July, but I just remember feeling so, so cold,’ Sue says. ‘All night long we shook with cold and shock.’ Professor Sharma says that though sudden cardiac death is rare, one in 300 people harbour a potentially fatal fault in the electrical system of their heart. These faults can occasionally result in very rapid electrical impulses. During these episodes the heart becomes stunned and stops contracting. The brain is then deprived of oxygen, causing the person to lose consciousness and collapse. The only method of restarting the heart is to deliver an external electrical shock to reset the electrical system. If this does not occur within ten minutes, the heart may never restart — which happened in Matthew’s case. A post-mortem showed his heart appeared normal and his family was told the most likely cause of death was an electrical fault. Professor Sharma says that many paediatricians and even some cardiologists may not have had the training or experience in reading these very rare, abnormal ECG heart traces, which is why CRY’s specialist team is so important. ‘These heart defects are either hereditary, which means they run in families, or congenital, which means the young person is born with something unique to them,’ he says. ‘They can affect the structure of the heart or the electrical apparatus. But if you have ominous symptoms, more tests may be required. ‘If a potentially life-threatening condition is detected, they may have to make lifestyle changes, have corrective surgery or take medication — and, in some cases, have an internal cardiac defibrillator fitted that shocks the heart into normal rhythm.’ Ollie Marsden, 21, had no symptoms before he died during rugby training in Totnes, Devon. On October 22, 2008, he left home at 7.40am for teacher training at a local primary school, followed by rugby practice that evening. His mother Linda was chopping vegetables for dinner when the phone rang. Ollie had collapsed. Linda, 59, the director of a building surveying practice, and her husband Kevin, also 59, a factory manager, drove the nine miles to the rugby ground. At the first set of traffic lights, Linda knew with a certainty she can’t explain that the youngest of her three boys was dead. ‘The moment we got to the hospital, we were shown to the bereaved relatives’ room. I just broke down,’ she says. ‘Ollie lay on an elevated hospital bed, wires and tubes everywhere, and I could see he was lifeless. ‘As a mother of teenage boys you wait for the call to say your child has been involved in a car accident or has fallen off his bike,’ says Linda. ‘You’re not expecting to hear a fit young man has dropped down dead playing rugby.’ A post mortem revealed Ollie had died of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — essentially his heart failed to pick up the impulse that makes it beat. ‘Ollie had no symptoms,’ says Linda. After he left school, he’d wanted to join the RAF. But at 6ft, he was too tall. ‘The irony is that if he had joined the Forces, he’d have had a full medical and the problem with his heart might have been found.’ Dr Stephen Cox, CRY’s director of screening, believes all 14 to 35-year-olds should be screened. ‘Though this will not identify all those at risk and there can be false positives as well as false negatives,’ he says. ‘In Italy, where screening is mandatory for all young people engaged in sports, the incidence of sudden cardiac death has been reduced by 90 per cent.’ Sue Dewhirst says: ‘If only I’d known about CRY I could have helped Matthew get specialist screening. 'But the first I heard about the screening programme was two days after he died.’ And Ollie’s mum Linda says: ‘It could have been avoided by a test that takes ten minutes and costs £35.’ She thinks all teenagers should have the test. 'Time doesn’t heal — you just get better at coping with the pain.’ For information about screening in your area, go to testmyheart.org.

"The New Mexico marital home once lived in by country music star Randy Travis has been put up for sale at $14.7million. The singer has had a tough time of it recently following a divorce in 2010, a stroke and subsequent brain surgery last year. He also pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was arrested in August 2012 when he was found naked after crashing his Pontiac Trans Am. He was sentenced to two years of probation, fined $2,000 and given a 180-day suspended jail sentence. Travis is now living in Texas and on the road to recovery but his ex-wife and former long time manager, Elizabeth Travis, has decided to sell the estate that she purchased in 2002. Three wooden crosses: The Travis estate features hundreds of crosses, including on the gate . The wife of country singer Randy Travis bought this 220-acre parcel from New Mexico¿s former governor and fashioned it into a luxury ranch . Until his 2010 divorce from longtime wife and former manager Elizabeth Travis, the Grammy winner parked his tour bus in the estate¿s bus garage and spent much of his time at the home . He even kept a pet buffalo on site, as well as horses and cattle. Travis now lives in Texas, where he is recovering from a stroke . Elizabeth Travis bough 220 acres from New Mexico’s former governor and proceeded to build a number of adobe structures which was to become their home for the next 12 years. She is now selling the 19,339-square-foot estate for a smaller home closer to central Santa Fe. Custom designed and built by the Travises, the ranch buildings are in the Pueblo Revival style with the main house consisting of 8,750 square feet with five bedrooms and eight baths. Travis included parking for his tour bus and tucked a bowling alley, shooting range and gymnasium into a building disguised as a traditional Adobe chapel. The good life: Randy Travis' estate includes 20,000 square feet of living space with features such as traditional tiled floors and beamed ceilings . Lofty ideas: Randy Travis and his wife Elizabeth designed the house themselves. Elizabeth is now selling the home to move to a smaller property in Santa Fe, New Mexico .

There was even space in the garage for Randy Travis to park his tour bus! The property also includes a bowling alley and gymnasium tucked into an adobe building that looks, from the outside, like a traditional New Mexico chapel . He even kept a pet buffalo on site, as well as horses and cattle. Elizabeth Travis decorated it with hundreds of crosses, including carved crosses on the estate’s gate. Also in the main house are ten fireplaces, fitness room, chef’s kitchen, hardwood floors, home theater, library and home office. There is a heated three-car garage attached.  Outside is a barn, guest house, heated pool, equestrian facilities, outdoor kitchen and views of the Sangre de Cristo and Jemez Mountains from the decks and patios. The pictures were displayed on TopTenRealEstateDeals.com. At age 55, Travis’ career has already spanned 30 years, selling 25 million records, 22 of which were number one hits with six number one albums, six Grammy awards and six CMA awards. Allan Watkiss from UKCountryRadio.com has his own thoughts on the property, 'His home sounds wonderful - but I'm not sure how many country music fans would be able to come up with the $15million to take it on. We wish him well in his recovery from surgery.' Enormous: The couple bought the 220-acre property from former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King and built a main home and guest suite with a total of 20,000 square feet of living space .

Elizabeth Travis sued Randy in April 2011, claiming he 'intentionally interfered with' her role as his manager. She was married to Travis for 19 years and managed him for 30, until, she claims, the singer and his attorneys terminated her contract without any written notice.

"Vern Cotter is determined to begin his BT Murrayfield reign with a bang — and believes unleashing the Gray brothers for the first time together in Scotland colours will go a long way to ensuring it. As exclusively revealed by Sportsmail earlier this week, 20-year-old Jonny will join his older brother Richie, 25, in the second row of the team that takes on Argentina on Saturday. They will become the 21st set of siblings to pull on a Scottish jersey in the same international match and the head coach insists they more than deserve their chance to face up to the Pumas. Jonny Gray (left) will start alongside his brother Richie for Scotland against Argentina on Saturday . ‘We have got the two Gray brothers starting against Argentina and what a great occasion it will be for them and their family,’ said Cotter, whose first four matches in charge of Scotland were away from home. ‘Richie has been playing very well for Castres in France and Jonny has been working away as well at Glasgow Warriors, adding bits to his game over the last year or two, and he will call the line-outs. They are both very mobile, both very capable of picking the ball up and carrying it. ‘I have told them what a great occasion it will be to play a Test match with each other. It’s been done here at Murrayfield before but it’s great to see it happen again. They will be playing for each other and I’m looking forward to it. Scotland coach Vern Cotter has named a youthful squad for his side's opening game at Murrayfield . ‘Being brothers may help them play together but the fact of the matter is that they have made it very easy for me to pick them together because they have been playing very well. That’s the key to their selection.’ As also revealed by Sportsmail, Cotter has given a first cap to Glasgow Warriors centre Mark Bennett and has brought in his club-mate Adam Ashe at No 8. And the Kiwi has urged his young team — seven of the match-day 23 are 22 years old or under — to take the game to Argentina. ‘I’m looking to see them have a go as they’re really good players,’ said Cotter. ‘We’ll be focusing on creating line-breaks and scoring points from our attacks. “Take the ball up, having a good look in front of you and go for it” is what I have told them. Glasgow Warriors No 8 Adam Ashe is set to win his first cap for Scotland against Los Pumas . ‘We’ve got a great surface here and we’ve got players who are really excited about playing on that. Hopefully we can get some speed into the game. ‘Also, I want to see my players enjoy their rugby and play for each other as best they can. ‘On a personal level, I’m absolutely excited about this game, which is my first at Murrayfield, and really looking forward to see the team run out for the match and to experience the atmosphere at my first home game.’ Cotter said he was confident that Bennett and Ashe, whose only cap came against South Africa in the summer, would be able to cope with playing in front a passionate home crowd and the fact there were so many of their Warriors team-mates in the starting XV would help them both. ‘Mark has been developing his performances week in, week out with Glasgow and has waited patiently for his chance,’ said the head coach, who has picked 10 Warriors in his starting line-up. ‘You can see his determination and the way he breaks the line and scores tries for his club. I am confident he will do well for Scotland. ‘Adam gives us the ability to connect the play of forwards and backs and defensively he has really improved. ‘He likes hitting hard and he will be looking forward to this game to show his qualities.’","Castres lock Richie Gray and Glasgow second row Jonny Gray become the 21st set of siblings to pull on a Scottish jersey .

"A 22-year-old social networking pioneer and Internet privacy advocate who dared to challenge Facebook and Google is dead. Ilya Zhitomirskiy died Saturday after San Francisco police were summoned for a reported suicide, police spokesman Officer Albie Esparza said. Mr Zhitomirskiy was one of the founders Diaspora*, a new social networking service meant to give users more control of their information online, and sought to lure people away from bigger sites like Facebook, Google and Twitter. Scroll down for video . Pioneer: llya Zhitomirskiy believed he could change the world by giving users more privacy and more control in social networking . Police would not release other details of his death and a medical examiner's report could take weeks before it becomes public. Mr Zhitomirskiy and three friends, Daniel Grippi, Maxwell Salzberg, and Raphael Sofaer, launched a trial run of Diaspora* last year that attracted the attention of The New York Times and National Public Radio and left the tech world buzzing. They were all students at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Mr Zhitomirskiy described himself on his Twitter account as a ‘free culture and open web enthusiast. Now one of the four Diaspora* bros.’ Despite their desire to compete with Facebook, the company's founder Mark Zuckerberg praised the group, telling Wired last year: 'I think it is cool people are trying to do it. Coder: Mr Zhitomirskiy was obsessed with Internet privacy, but focused on drawing 'normal' people to his social network site . 'I . see a little of myself in them. It’s just their approach that the world . could be better and saying, ""We should try to do it.""' Friends and fans of Mr Zhitomirskiy have . written tributes on Twitter after hearing of his death, with one . posting: 'Death of a young entrepreneur is a great loss to the . community.' Mr Zhitomirskiy wasn't the only programmer to achieve great things in his early years: . The four students announced their . software programme in April 2010 and raised more than $200,000 for the . project through the online fundraising system Kickstarter. The project even inspired Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to donate money to the project. In November 2010 the foursome released a consumer alpha version of the programme, while still making further developments. Diaspora* is based around privacy concerns related to centralised social networks by allowing users to set up their own servers to host content and then interact with others by sharing status updates, photographs and other data – much like Facebook. Four friends: Four New York University students launched Diaspora*: (from left to right) Maxwell Salzberg, Daniel Grippi, Raphael Sofaer and Ilya Zhitomirskiy . But Diaspora* is different because sites like Facebook and Google store user data within their own networks and own whatever data users upload. Admirer: Facebook chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg donated money to Diaspora*, even though the project aimed to put him out of business . Mr Zhitomirskiy was a hardcore computer programmer, obsessed with Internet security and maintaining privacy online. But since he began working on Diaspora*, . he began focusing on user interfaces and started thinking about how to . lure 'normal' users away from Facebook. 'We want to move people from websites that are not healthy to websites that are more healthy, because they’re transparent,' Mr Zhitomirskiy told New York magazine last year. 'Even though a nontechnical person may not understand it, they’ll know there’s a community that has said, this is okay.' Co-founder Raphael Sofaer told the New York Times last year: ‘In our real lives, we talk to each other. 'We don’t need to hand our messages to a hub. What Facebook gives you as a user isn’t that hard to do. 'All the little games, the little walls, the little chat, aren’t really rare things.

"The dark, disturbing secrets of a picturesque Australian valley where unwashed children born from generations of incest lived with physical deformities in a 'cult' of 40 adults and youngsters emerged today. Incapable of intelligible speech, some of the children had oddly-formed features as the result of being born to parents who were themselves related. Brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts had sex with one another over four generations, raising childen in squalid conditions who themselves grew up to become intimate and have more inbred children. The children found living in filth in sheds and broken down caravans had numerous disabilities from their inbred births, including a boy with a walking impairment and severe psoriasis, another with hearing and sight problems and yet another boy whose eyes were misaligned. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: The 40-strong 'cult' was found in the picturesque countryside of New South Wales (file photo) A nine-year-old girl, who could not hear or write and had fragmented and stunted speech, was unable to bathe or dry herself and did not know how to use a toilet or what toilet paper was. The shocking discovery of the family's depraved life in the valley, lying south west of Sydney, were reminiscent of the inbred hillbillies featured in the movie Deliverance. Sickening details of generations of child abuse were published today by news.com.au , drawing on a judgement from the New South Wales Children's Court which, in a rare step, agreed to make its findings public. The name of the hidden valley has been kept secret and the family has been given the pseudonym Colt in order to protect the identity of the minors. But details of the debased lives of adults and children have been released because it is understood the court felt the nation should know about the worst case of incest it had ever heard. Across four generations of intimate . relations, the family moved around the country, from South Australia, to . Victoria, Western Australia and then back across the continent to the . fertile valley south of Sydney. The . debauched lives of the current generation of adults might never have . been found if residents of a nearby town had not reported that there . were children living in the hills who had not been attending school. In the nearby town, the name of which . has been suppressed, one local resident said people used to make jokes . that if anyone came from that valley 'you'd be inbred'. The man told the Sydney paper that on . occasions two women with 'about ten children' would emerge from a car . that had interstate plates, buy something in the shops and leave. 'They . were never clean looking,' said the man. And there was 'nothing' on the . blocks of land where the family lived - 'no electricity, no water, just . scrub.' Police and child . care workers were stunned when they arrived at the cult camp, some 20 . miles from the nearest town and surrounded by trees where 19th century . bushrangers once roamed. They found 40 adults and children living in two . broken-down caravans, two sheds and tents, where there was no running . water or sewage. The . Telegraph reported that dirt caked the surfaces of stoves and cooking . facilities, rotten vegetables lay in a refrigerator and a kangaroo was . sleeping on one of the children's beds.Chainsaws, bags of rubbish and exposed electrical wires lay about. There were no toilets, showers or baths. 'I'll never get over what I saw there,' a female police officer later reportedly told one of her colleagues. The case happened near Sydney (pictured) where authorities said it was one of the worst ever seen . But at the time even she did not . realise that the 'family cult' was a throwback to a pair of great-great . grandparents who were a brother and sister. Down through the . generations, the family continued to regenerate itself, the children . beginning to have sex with one another as soon as they were old enough. The . result, the court documents revealed, was that some of the children . seemed developmentally delayed, cognitively impaired or physically . handicapped - the shocking result of sex between brothers and sisters, . uncles and nieces and fathers and daughters. According . to the documents, the children were sexually involved with each other . and only one - a five-year-old girl, the youngest - had parents who . weren't related to each other. The . Telegraph said that what the police and community care officials . witnessed was 'a social time bomb exploding before their eyes.' The . five family groups comprised sisters Rhonda, 47; Martha, 33; and Betty . Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie. There were also two of Betty's daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents. Betty's son Bobby, 15, who had . severe psoriasis and needed urgent dental work, could not talk in a way . that could be understood, he wet and soiled his bed and his learning . ability was at kindergarten level. The valley was in picturesque New South Wales. Pictured: The Blue Mountains National Park . Martha's . sons Albert, 15, and Jed, 14, also had speech problems, no personal . hygiene and teeth that were in need of urgent dental work. Betty's . son Billy, 14, was underweight and not growing properly, as well as . having hearing and sight problems, spoke unintelligibly, had an . intellectual disability and could barely read or count. Fourteen-year-old . Kimberly Colt was underweight and could not clean her teeth, use toilet . paper or comb her hair. She had problems with hearing, speech, sight, . could not read or write and did not know how to use toilet paper or comb . her hair. When approached by one of the officers who had called at the 'camp' Kimberly threatened to cut off the officer's fingers. Betty's . son Brian, 12, had extensively decayed teeth, had borderline normal . hearing and did not understand showering. His eyes were misaligned and . he could not read, write or recognise numbers. On July 18, 2012, police and social workers removed 12 children from the valley - and after careful questioning, harrowing tales emerged. Kimberly told of sexual contact with her uncle, Dwayne, who was 9 years old, while her aunt, Carmen, 8, watched. Sisters Ruth, 7, and Nadia, 9,  had sexual touching with their brothers Albert, 15; Jed, 14; and Karl, 12. In one sad story, social workers were told how three brothers aged 14 and under tied their sister, 8, and niece, 13, naked to a tree. The court documents revealed that clinicians and geneticists who took mouth swabs from the children deduced five of them had parents who were themselves 'closely related' to one another while another five had parents who were 'related'. But the complex tale of intimate relations was found to go back to Betty, Martha and Rhonda's maternal grandparents, who had been brother and sister. Betty had 13 children, some of whom were probably fathered by her father, Tim, and her brother, Charlie. Along the way one of Betty's daughters, Tammy, 27, died from a genetic disease known as Zellweger syndrome. Since the discovery of the shocking events in the hidden valley, some children have since been placed with foster families, while others are in treatment programmes for sexualised behaviour and psychological trauma. They are said to be making progress with schooling and hygiene, but Betty Colt, said the Telegraph, appears to be in denial and her lawyer has disputed the court's findings.","Case in New South Wales, Australia, described as one of worst in history .

"Cleared: Teaching assistant Helen Turnbull, 35, arrives at Teesside Crown Court yesterday . A married teaching assistant who kissed a schoolboy and sent him seductive messages walked free from court yesterday. Helen Turnbull’s marriage fell apart when it emerged that she had been having secret trysts in her Mini with a 16-year-old boy. It can now be revealed that the teaching assistant had a fascination with teenage boys, had previously been unfaithful to her husband with a youngster and is currently in a relationship with another former pupil – 23-year-old professional boxer Greg O’Neil. Turnbull, 35, sobbed in the dock yesterday as a judge told her that grooming the child at the Catholic secondary school in Durham had cost her a career and her family. She was given a four-month suspended sentence and told to sign the sex offenders’ register after admitting kissing the boy. But she was cleared on charges relating to allegations she had sex with him. The jury was read a slew of provocative messages from Turnbull to the 16-year-old boy, in which she talked about ‘power sex’ and said kissing him was one of the perks of her job. Friends of Turnbull last night described how the relationship ‘spiralled out of control’ as they repeatedly pleaded with her to stop meeting the schoolboy. Yet years before the affair with the pupil, suspicion had already been raised about her activity with children when her husband caught her kissing another teenager in the family home. Ben Turnbull, 38, was left stunned when he found four boys in the house, one of whom was locked in an embrace with his wife in the kitchen. Mr Turnbull had planned to tell the court how he stumbled upon the incident but the judge ruled the evidence inadmissable as it did not have any direct bearing on the defendant’s behaviour with the teenager. Despite having a bitter argument about the incident, the couple continued their relationship and it was never reported to the authorities. The marriage came to an end when Mr Turnbull accused his wife of having an affair after he discovered a picture online of her and the boy at the centre of the trial. After a drunken night at her school’s prom, Turnbull changed her Facebook profile picture from one of her three-year-old daughter to an image of her ‘cuddling’ the 16-year-old. Ex-pupil: Helen Turnbull's current boyfriend, 23-year-old professional boxer Greg O'Neil . Outside court: Turnbull told the jury that the lewd messages were ‘all talk’ and that sex never happened . In comments posted alongside the image, Turnbull, who friends described as ‘insecure’ and ‘a lonely person’, asked the pupil if she should wear an ‘itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini’ on a school trip. When her contact with the boy stopped, the teaching assistant soon started a relationship with another former pupil. Turnbull first met Mr O’Neil during intimate study sessions involving only three other pupils at the school. She regained contact with him while socialising in a pub following the breakdown of her relationship with the other pupil. Mr O’Neil, who left the school in 2007, became a professional boxer in 2012. A source close to Mr O’Neil confirmed Turnbull was his girlfriend and said the boxer’s family ‘really like her’. During the eight-day trial, Teesside Crown Court heard how Turnbull had sent the schoolboy a slew of flirtatious and suggestive messages. Turnbull (pictured yesterday) was cleared by a jury at Teesside Crown Court of having sex with a 16-year-old pupil . Court building: The trial of Turnbull was heard at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) in Middlesbrough . In one, she asked the schoolboy what knickers she should wear before a secret meeting. But the affair turned sour when the pupil went ‘cold’ and Turnbull allegedly told him that she would have him murdered by a notorious gypsy family if he left her. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Armstrong said Turnbull’s 13-year-old son now refuses to see her and she had limited access to her daughter, who is five. He said: ‘You feared the worst at the time this was happening but you were unable to stop yourself from getting involved with this young man.’ He ordered her to complete 200 hours of unpaid community work and put in place a restraining order to stop her contacting the boy or going near her former school. Anne Richardson, defending Turnbull, said: ‘She clearly has suffered greatly for this utterly foolish and out-of-character behaviour.’ Friend Lauren Musgrove, 23, said Turnbull developed an interest in the 16-year-old boy for ‘excitement’ because her marriage was in disarray. ‘She was having a bad time. I think she wanted some excitement,’ she said.","Mother-of-two admitted sending boy photo of herself in her underwear .

"An ex-Portland State University student is suing the school for more than $1.2million, claiming she was sexually harassed by a professor. Former graduate student Whitney 'Theda' Orlando, 27, is accusing 52-year-old professor Marcia Klotz of becoming so obsessed with her sex life that the pressure gave her an irregular heart beat, according to the lawsuit filed last year. After learning about Orlando's past work as a BDSM model, Klotz went on to exchange more than 200 emails with her student, asking for details about her sex life which Orlando claims 'blurred professional and personal boundaries' While the university acknowledges many of Orlando's claims, they deny a connection between the student's health problems and her coursework. Lawsuit: Former Portland State University graduate student Whitney Orland (left) is suing the school for more than $1.2million, claiming she was sexually harassed by professor Marcia Klotz (right) The student-teacher relationship allegedly started in  the fall of 2009 when Orlando took Klotz's class on Feminist Literature and became more intimate when the student began sharing pictures of her modeling work. Klotz complimented Orlando on the pictures and asked more about her life in the BDSM industry, trying to use her student's connections for interviews and  to 'locate new sexual partners interested in BDSM-style encounters'. The relationship became even more intense when Orlando invited Klotz to go see a documentary about a BDSM website. Orlando, Klotz and Klotz's husband watched the film in January 2010 and Orlando says the atmosphere was so 'sexually charged' that it made her feel uncomfortable and that her relationship with the teacher 'was becoming increasingly romantic and sexualized'. Klotz even wrote an academic paper on the documentary and referenced Orlando in the paper without naming her. But Klotz published the paper without ever informing Orlando. Sexual tension: Orlando claims that Klotz became so obsessed with her sex life that the stress caused her to develop an irregular heartbeat . Even Klotz admitted that their relationship had become unprofessional in emails, and eventually attempted to 'conceal inappropriate messages' by corresponding with Orlando on her private email instead of university email. At one point, Klotz learned that Orlando had been sexually abused by a middle school teacher but still continued their sexually-tinged relationship nonetheless. Separated: After 10 years teaching at Portland State, Klotz (pictured) took a job at the University of Arizona in June 2013. Orlando is now studying at nearby Marylhurst University . The relationship began to impact Orlando physically in January 2012 when she started work for the Robert E McNair Scholars Program. Klotz had recommended her for the research course and insisted she take up a topic related to her child abuse. In the course of Orlando's research, Klotz made her read the court file on her own childhood sex-abuse case as well as audiotapes from other similar prosecutions in the area. But the stress of uncovering childhood wounds proved too much for Orlando who was admitted to the hospital the following September for an irregular heartbeat. She blames the heart problems were brought on by the stress of the research and tried to change the topic of her coursework - something Klotz was strongly against. When Orlando switched mentors and submitted a paper on stress management instead, Klotz allegedly told the McNair program coordinator that she believed the paper had been plagiarized since it was 'too polished'. Those allegations led to another visit to the hospital for Orlando who is now claiming the scandal surrounding the paper damaged her reputation in the academic community and hurt her career opportunities. She is suing the school for $250,000 in lost income and non-economic damages of $1million for attorney fees and costs. Orlando has since transferred to nearby Marylhurst University while Klotz, who taught at PSU for 10 years, is now teaching at the University of Arizona. The university does have a policy against harassment, discrimination and retaliation, but say Orlando never formally complained about Klotz before the lawsuit. In a strange twist, Orlando wrote a rave review of Klotz on the POrtland State website in 2012, saying she never would have considered persuing her PhD 'without the persistent encouragement that I received from Marcia Klotz, PhD. It is to her that I owe my academic fervor'.","Student Whitney Orlando, 27, met professor Marcia Klotz, 52, when she took a feminist literature course in 2009 .

"This is the moment that 15-year-old Patrick Otema, from Kampala in Uganda, found his voice for the very first time. Patrick, who was born deaf,  was unable to even express himself to his family and, had things not changed, would have been condemned to a life of silence. But thanks to a pioneering new programme, he has finally been taught to communicate using sign language. Scroll down for video . Patrick's transformation in the class is nothing short of breathtaking as he finally learns how to communicate . Only two per cent of Uganda's population is deaf, but the disability carries huge stigma in the country with the disabled dismissed as 'kasiru', which translates as mentally deficient and useless. But Patrick has been lucky. His teacher is Raymond Okkelo who is deaf himself - and who is one of the few Ugandans to use sign language. 'In the past I was also like him,' he explains. 'I couldn’t use sign language, the only thing I could do was hide in fear.' Raymond became deaf as a child after a bout of malaria but six months ago, he travelled to the Ugandan capital Kampala for intensive training in sign language. Now able to communicate with the outside world, Raymond is determined to change the lives deaf people in sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom have never been taught sign language. Raymond has set up the first sign-language school in the area and convinced Patrick to attend . Many of the pupils – aged from nine to 80 – have walked miles to attend Raymond's course . Raymond, who stars in tonight's episode of Unreported World, has also opened the very first sign language school in the country - which Patrick now attends. But nothing is as heart-warming as the moment that Patrick finally realises he can communicate, with joy spreading across his face as he grasps the significance of what he has learned. Patrick's transformation is nothing short of breathtaking. In the space of just a few hours he goes from a hunched over terrified looking boy who can barely make eye contact to beaming and standing confidently in front of the class as they choose his new sign name. But Patrick won't be the only deaf child to benefit. Buoyed by the success of his first cohort of students, Raymond hopes to take his school on tour and help many more children on the way.

"Agony: Yang Hu, pictured in hospital, severed his own penis because he thought it was surplus to requirements since he couldn't find a girlfriend . A Chinese man frustrated at being single cut off his own penis then, in agony, decided to cycle to a hospital for treatment. When he arrived doctors told him they couldn't help save his manhood and ordered him to cycle back home to get the penis before he could be treated. When Yang Hu, 26, eventually arrived back at the hospital with the severed member, doctors told him that it had been without blood for too long, and it was impossible to reattach it. Yang's friends said that he had been increasingly depressed about the fact that since moving to the city he could not find a girlfriend. What was worse, they said, was that he was doing such long hours in a clothing factory in Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province in east China, that he doubted he would ever have a chance to meet a woman. His depression grew so bad that after returning home after work at 9pm on October 27 to his rented room he had suddenly decided to cut off his member as there was no use for it anyway, and believing it would stop him thinking about getting a girlfriend.

"ITV and BBC pundits have been ridiculed online after they took contrasting approaches to fashion for the World Cup final last night. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Alan Hansen and Rio Ferdinand plumped for suits and ties for the occasion in their studio in Rio de Janeiro. While Adrian Chiles, Martin O’Neill, Ian Wright, Lee Dixon and Glenn Hoddle were on Ipanema beach in open shirts and shades. Both teams were lampooned for their fashion sense with some wondering if the ITV team were 'on a lad's holiday' and the BBC boys were 'off to a funeral after the match'. The BBC team were described as ‘looking like sales reps’ and even Ferdinand joked later that his outfit made him look like a pilot for budget airline easyJet. Scroll down for video .

The decision to take to the beach particularly backfired for the ITV team according to viewers. With sharp sunshine still blazing in Brazil, Dixon, Wright and Hoddle needed sunglasses to shield their eyes as they discussed Germany and Argentina’s chances ahead of kick-off. Later, as the game ran into extra time, the ITV team were left sat in near darkness still sat on the Rio sand. Viewers also said the sound of crashing waves was so loud that the pundits could not hear eachother.

"A new report on the family of the two accused Boston Marathon bombers reveals that Tsarnaevs claimed they came to America after the father was kidnapped and tortured by Russian mobsters who then cut off their dog's head and left it on their doorstep. After struggling to find a place in America, the older brother Tamerlan turned to conspiracy theories and radical Islam while the younger brother, Dzhokhar started stealing marijuana - earning $1,000 a week and sometimes carrying a gun to protect his stash. The Boston Globe claims that the Tsarneav brothers appear have been motivated less by Islamist ideology and more by their own personal failings and inner demons - making the April 15 bombings more like the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater than an al-Qaeda terrorist plot. Alienated: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev became alienated by the failures after a decade living in America, the Boston Globe reports. It is believed that helped drive them to allegedly commit terrorism . Failed family:  Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the suspected bombers, (right) told neighbors that the boys' father Anzor (left) had been kidnapped and tortured - causing them to flee the country . Family friends, including some who are medical professionals, believe that Tamerlan possibly suffered from schizophrenia - which could have driven him to extremism. The report gives some insight about why the two brothers to allegedly plant a pair of homemade pressure cooker bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon this spring. The blasts killed three and injured more than 260 people. The brothers then allegedly murdered an MIT campus police officer three days later as they engaged police in a running gun battle. Tamerlan was killed and Dzhokar was badly wounded by arrested after a daylong manhunt that shut down the city of Boston. The Tsarnaev family moved to Boston from Kyrgastan after claiming that they were being persecuted because they were Chechen Muslims. Tamerlan and Dzhokar's mother Zubeidat told friends and neighbors that she and her husband Anzor were lawyers in their native land and that Anzor worked as a prosecutor, according to the Globe. The brothers allegedly plotted the April 15 bomb attack together. Three people died and more than 260 were wounded in the twin Boston Marathon bombings . Zubeidat claimed that when Anzor tried to prosecute a Russian mob boss, the gangster kidnapped Anzor and tortured him for a week. Before they dropped him, barely alive at a hospital, the mobsters killed the family's German Shepherd and dumped its head on the family doorstep, according to this story. 'Zubeidat went to the hospital and when she saw how horribly beaten he was she said that she realized they had to get out of the country,' a family friend told the Globe. The Globe posits that none of that story was likely true. Neither Zubeidat nor Anzor had law degrees, the newspaper reports. It's likely that Anzor had been smuggling cigarettes and fell afoul of the local organized crime syndicate, friends say. Alternatively - the family saw the glamorous life in America portrayed in Hollywood movies and decided they wanted a piece of it. Surrender: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen bloody and wounded, was captured after he was found hiding in a boat days after the bombing . Anzor's brother was already in the United States - finding success as a lawyer. The family submitted an application requesting asylum, claiming that they had been persecuted in their homeland for being Chechen Muslims. 'He made that up … so that the Americans would give him a visa,' Badrudi Tsokaev, a family friend say of claims that Anzor had been persecuted. Mark Kramer, a Harvard University researcher who frequently testifies in asylum cases for family from post-Soviet states said he found 'no basis for being granted asylum at all' in the Tsarnaev case. In America, the family fell apart - despite grand ambitions. Neither of the parents was able to find success. In August 2011, Anzor and Zubeidat divorced. Anzor returned to Dagestan in Russia. Zubeidat soon moved back there, as well. Tamerlan, left, had a promising career as a boxer - but eventually gave up the sport . The Tsarnaev brothers struggled, too. Tamerlan, who was 26 when he was killed, had ambitions of becoming an Olympic boxer and found some success in the ring. But he eventually dropped out of training - just as he dropped out of school time and again. He became increasingly focused on his Islamic faith and withdrew of society. He stayed home and took care of his daughter and surfed Islamist websites online while his American wife worked as a home care nurse and was responsible for the family income. He mentioned to several people that he had begun hearing voices. 'He was torn between those two people,' Donald Larking, 67, who attended mosque with Tamerlan for two years, told the Globe. 'He said that several times. And he did not like it.' Dzokhar, meanwhile, became obsessed with drugs. In high school, he had been captain of the wrestling team and a decent student. He smoked a lot of marijuana in high school, friends said, but once he went away to college, he began selling it. He flaunted his stash, weighing it out on the desk in his door open. At the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, he gained a reputation as having some of the best weed on campus, the Globe reports. Friends said he often hauled in $1,000 a week in cash. He sometimes carried a handgun to protect the stash, too, friends told the newspaper. But his fast lifestyle and focus on drugs meant his grades were sinking rapidly. He had a D average and was on the verge of being kicked out of school when he and his brother allegedly planted the bombs in April.","Family of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarneav told harrowing story about father's torture by gangsters in Kyrgyzstan before coming to America .

Cruden - who on Thursday admitted to feeling ‘nervous and apprehensive’ about his reintegration in to the squad - had established himself as first-choice All Black No 10 in the absence of the injured Dan Carter during the Rugby Championship. But he was axed by head coach Steve Hansen for New Zealand’s final two games in Argentina and South Africa as pictures emerged of him drinking at a bar in Auckland the night before they were due to leave for Buenos Aires. Cruden missed the assembly time for the departure and Hansen announced he had been dropped on arrival in Argentina.

All Blacks fly-half Cruden evades the tackle of Ryan Crotty during the squad's training session in London . Cruden will direct matters from fly-half against Stuart Lancaster's England side at Twickenham . On Saturday, having been named in Hansen’s squad to tour England, Scotland and Wales, Cruden’s rehabilitation will be complete after he was chosen to start ahead of Beauden Barrett at Twickenham. ‘I wasn’t expecting it (to start) but when I got named I was really happy,’ Cruden, 25, said on Thursday. ‘It’s pretty hard watching at home, the team you love playing for and the guys you love playing with.’ Cruden poses for a picture near the All Blacks' team hotel in London on Thursday . Cruden (right) and All Blacks scrum-half Aaron Smith speak to the assembled media in London on Thursday . When asked if he was worried at any stage he wouldn’t get back in the side, Cruden admitted: ‘Yes, absolutely. You’d be silly not to and that certainly was the case. ‘That probably alludes to my point about not being expected to be named in the starting XV for this weekend. I guess you never know, putting yourself in a little bit of jip like that, what you could potentially lose.’ Cruden admitted: ‘I was pretty nervous and apprehensive coming back in after what I had done, as Shag (Hansen) has often said, it’s a little bit like a family and that’s exactly what we are here. Cruden chases down England centre Kyle Eastmond (left) during New Zealand's 36-13 victory in the summer . Cruden kicks a late penalty to secure a last-gasp win for the All Blacks over Ireland last autumn . ‘I know I stuffed up and I’ll be working hard over these next couple of weeks, and already since I’ve been back in the environment, to earn back the respect that I lost, not only to the people in this team but the rugby fans back home. ‘This weekend is the first opportunity to really do that and I’m really excited by it.’ Hansen used the same metaphor when discussing Cruden’s recall on Thursday. ‘Our team is like a family,’ he said. ‘If one of the family members mucks up, you don’t stop loving them. You just don’t like what they did, the behaviour. Team: I Dagg; B Smith, C Smith, S B Williams, J Savea; A Cruden, A Smith; W Crockett, D Coles, O Franks, B Retallick, S Whitelock, J Kaino, R McCaw (capt), K Read. Replacements: K Mealamu, B Franks, C Faumuina, P Tuiipulotu, L Messam, T J Perenara, B Barrett, R Crotty . ‘So you address the behaviour and then you carry on. And that’s what we’ve done. ‘He’s not being treated any differently and he’s not acting any differently - other than he’s ditched that behaviour. He’s in the leadership group and he’s leading well. ‘It’s not a matter of having a clean slate or a dirty slate it’s just a matter of being Aaron Cruden.’ Carter returned from a three-month injury lay-off to come off the bench against the United States on Saturday but this game comes too soon for the All Black icon.","Aaron Cruden will start at fly-half for New Zealand less than two months after serving a two-game ban for missing a team flight to Argentina .

"A footballer who 'died' in his sleep when his heart stopped for 25 minutes has made a miraculous recovery, making it back on to the pitch. Louie Shields, 23, from Blackpool, suffered a cardiac arrest when he was in bed. His mother Karen McAuley, 51, was forced to give her son CPR, desperately battling to save her son's life as his girlfriend Kirsten Jones, 21, dialled 999. He was rushed to Blackpool's Victoria Hospital where doctors said he had been clinically dead for 25 minutes before he was put on a life support machine. Louie Shields, 23 suffered a cardiac arrest - which means his heart stopped - in his sleep. His terrified girlfriend Kirsten Jones, 21, immediately dialled 999 so he was rushed to hospital . Mr Shields' heart stopped for 25 minutes. He was put on a life support machine and went into an induced coma for four days . Mr Shields, who plays for Poulton FC and works in a gym, spent four days in an induced coma before being released from hospital three weeks later. Now he is back playing football and spends his spare time raising money for charity and speaking to young people about how to spot the signs of a cardiac arrest. He said: 'I don't have any memory of what actually happened - it's all a complete blur to me. 'I had a fit at about two in the morning and my girlfriend woke up as I started shaking. 'She raced downstairs to get my mum who came up to my room and had to give me CPR while Kirsten called for an ambulance. 'My whole body had turned blue and no matter how hard my mum tried she couldn't resuscitate me. 'Paramedics were giving me CPR in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and by the time I arrive I had been dead for nearly half an hour. 'It's incredible that I'm alive - my mum, girlfriend and paramedics were incredible.' A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system, caused by an abnormal rhythm. Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system. It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia. Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning. Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing. In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked. This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert. In the hospital, Mr Shields' petrified relatives were asked by doctors if he had taken any drugs before the fit as they were unable to find the cause of the problem. But doctors later discovered that Mr Shields was born with an extra pathway between the upper and lower chambers of his heart. He said: 'They we're struggling to find out why I had the fit but they eventually found out it was something I was born with. 'Doctors had to ask my mum if I had been drinking or if I had taken any drugs that could have made me ill. 'But they apologised to my mum when they knew the condition was something I was born with. 'I'm just glad to have survived the whole thing and be able to be with my family and friends again. 'I definitely appreciate things a lot more now. 'I feel incredibly lucky to be alive, let alone to be back in work and playing football again.' Former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during an F.A. Cup tie against Tottenham in March 2012. The 26-year-old received lengthy treatment on the pitch before being rushed to hospital as the match was abandoned by referee Howard Webb. Doctors said his heart had stopped for 78 minutes but he survived after months of hospital treatment. He announced his retirement from professional football in August 2012 after taking advice from medics. Mr Shields returned to the pitch five months after his cardiac arrest and now speaks to young people about the importance of good health and spotting the signs of a cardiac arrest. He has also raised £4,000 for the Lancashire Cardiac Centre by hosting a black tie ball in Blackpool. Kathy Ancell, head of fundraising at Blue Skies Hospitals Fund, said: 'We are delighted to hear that Louie has recovered so well.

'Charitable funds allow the cardiac centre to enhance patient care above and beyond what can be provided from core NHS funds, for the benefit of patients from across Lancashire and South Cumbria.' Mr Shields said: 'It was a good night and I think it went very well. It was really important for me and my family to be able to say thank you. 'It means a lot after everything the people at the Lancashire Cardiac Centre did for me - I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them.

"Plus-size fashion is a hard market  to crack. Many women are left frustrated by designers that seemingly have  little knowledge of the female form or how women want to dress. And that is exactly why  Evans, who pioneered the first-ever plus-size fashion week, want to change that. The high street store, which falls under Sir Philip Green's Arcadia umbrella, has set up an initiative with universities to teach students how to design plus-size clothes for the brand's Cut for Evans range. They've cracked it: Cut for Evans is a new range designed for fuller-figured women by two university students (cardigan, £45) Evans Head of Design Rebecca Vann Reicher wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus-size. So, she asked students from Nottingham Trent and Kingston University to design a 6-piece collection that was fashion forward and not limited by size. A judging panel of industry experts collectively selected a winner from each University and included: Trish Halpin (Editor at Marie Claire), Jess Spiring (Lifestyle Editor at Now Magazine), Laura Puddy (Stylist and Plus Size Columnist), and Georgina Horne (Fuller Figure, Fuller Bust Blog). Each of the winning designs will receive a £1,000 cash prize and see their collection launched in selected Evans stores and online across the UK, US and Europe this week. Changing face of fashion: Evans Head of Design Rebecca Vann Reicher wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus-size (top, £50, trousers, £45) Winning: Each of the winning designers, including Ellie Northway from Nottingham Trent, whose designs are pictured, will see them land in stores . Rebecca said of the project: 'Cut is an exciting opportunity for students to learn and develop as designers and challenges what they have been taught. 'It pushes them to create something that can be bold yet beautiful, regardless of size that empowers and delights all at once and ultimately changes attitudes about plus size and its fashion credentials.' Eve Turley is a second year student from Kingston University studying a BA (Hons) in Fashion Design. She took inspiration from vintage fabrics to create a sophisticated yet technical collection of wearable knitwear. Whilst Ellie Northway, a BA (Hons) Fashion Design student at Nottingham Trent University, created a collection of vibrant kaleidoscopic prints drawn from portraits of inspirational women throughout history. A spokesperson for Evans, which stocks sizes 14-32, said: 'We are dedicated to changing attitudes about the plus industry and our commitment to Cut for Evans highlights how we believe great fashion design can be aspirational and inclusive.' So what do the plus-size industry think? Rivkie Baum, editor  SLiNK magazine, an aspirational fashion and lifestyle for women with curves, said: 'We feel that The Cut for Evans is possibly the most important and exciting collaboration of any plus-size brand at the moment. 'As a former design student, I have been long aware and exposed to the fact that our university programs aren't preparing designers for the plus-size market, a retail industry that is currently booming. 'The Cut for Evans is both an educational experience for design students as well as a really exciting way of breathing new life into the  industry. By inviting students to design for Evans, they are opening their eyes to designing for varying body shapes and a consumer, not just a fantasy subject. 'From the results of both the last collaboration and the new collection, they are producing some really great prints and designs that are both wearable and beautiful, showing that plus-size women don't have to shy away from print and colour.' All wrapped up: Eve Turley is a second year student from Kingston University who took inspiration from vintage fabrics to create a sophisticated yet technical collection of wearable knitwear . Cosy knits: A spokesperson for Evans, which stocks sizes 14-32, said: 'We are dedicated to changing attitudes about the plus industry' Fashion writer Simon Glazin said of the range: 'Plus-size fashion has thankfully come on a long way, the days of just awfully cut, boxy shapes and elasticated waist trousers are long gone. From this brilliant design project, Evans are offering plus-size women some amazing pieces that can be dressed up and down, for all occasions. 'As someone who used to be very big, I struggled to find anything that was fashion forward. I lived in black. Bigger girlfriends had the same problem. But Ellie Northway's brilliant prints put an end to all that. And who ever said knitted dresses were not for big people can think again...Eve Turley's must-have dress cleverly contours the body, drawing in the eye to the smallest part of the waist. 'Both these collections are worth investing in: having separates like these in your wardrobe means you can create multiple outfits. That red knitted longline sleeveless cardigan is the ultimate for this season! 'Well done Evans.'

"European migrant jobseekers should be barred from claiming the Government’s new  benefit, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The Work and Pensions Secretary insisted access to universal credit, which is replacing all the main unemployment and sickness handouts, as well as tax credits, should be ‘much tighter’. Mr Duncan Smith, the most Eurosceptic member of the Cabinet, suggested there should be an indefinite ban on unemployed EU incomers looking for work from claiming. Scroll down for video . Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, wants jobseekers to be barred from claiming the Government’s new out-of-work benefit . ‘We have already introduced a series of measures to tighten up access to benefits: no longer can people come here from abroad and expect to get something for nothing. But there’s still more to do, which is why I am proposing that under universal credit EEA [European Economic Area] jobseekers will not be eligible to claim,’ he said. ‘Universal credit is much tighter because if you are unemployed and you come here you will not be able to claim… so that cracks down on benefit tourism. ‘The Prime Minister has made it very clear that he is determined to get changes made so that countries like Britain can limit the number of people who come to Britain over time from different countries - and that will affect universal credit.’ Mr Duncan Smith predicted most British benefit claimants will transferred onto the universal credit scheme by the end of 2018, a slower timetable than originally proposed. He said employers have long found those on benefits unwilling to accept part-time or temporary jobs, since they risk losing tax credits, housing benefit or other handouts for positions that may not be secure, and turned to foreign workers. But Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit, which guarantees that claimants are always better off working, even part-time, was creating a new boon in such positions for the British unemployed. David Cameron is facing a fight to curb EU immigration and foreign workers' access to benefits after the new European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said he would not 'compromise' on Brussels' freedom of movement rules . Universal credit will generate £7 billion a year in economic benefits, largely due to up to an additional 300,000 households finding work once the programme is fully implemented, he said. The new benefit combines income-based jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit and housing benefit in an attempt to simplify the Byzantine welfare system. Crucially, it means it is always worth people’s while to take a job or more hours if they already have one. Mr Duncan Smith also revealed that as universal credit is rolled out across the country, he plans to impose new conditions on those working part-time to push them to do more.","Work and Pensions Secretary said universal credit should be restricted .

"The man accused of pushed a Bronx man into the path of a subway train says he can't remember grisly killing. Kevin Darden was arrested three days after he was allegedly caught on CCTV shoving Wai Kwen Kwok in front of a train in Highbridge, Bronx, New York City. Footage showed no fight between Mr Kwok and his assailant leading to the push, and police were unable to ascertain a motive. Darden allegedly fled the scene before authorities could arrive. Scroll down for video . 'I don't remember': Kevin Darden, left, 34, has been charged in connection with the death of Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, who was pushed in front of a subway train while waiting with his wife at East 167th Street Station . Identified: Darden was arrested three days after he was allegedly caught on CCTV shoving Wai Kwen Kwok in front of a oncoming southbound D train on November 16 . Today Darden, 34, speaking from Rikers Island jail, told ABC's Channel 7 he would 'never do anything like that.' 'I don’t remember anything about [last] Sunday, I didn’t do anything,' he insisted. It was 8.45am on Sunday November 16 and Mr Kwok, 61, was with his wife, Yow Ho Lee, 59, at East 167th Street Station waiting for a train to Chinatown to celebrate her birthday. It was then, apparently without warning or motive, that a man shoved the Chinese immigrant into the path of the oncoming southbound D train. Mr Kwok's visibly shaken widow can reportedly be seen in surveillance footage as she's taken to an ambulance and sent to a local hospital to be treated for shock. Darden was also said to have been caught on camera. He was seen not long after the deadly attack boarding a BX35 bus, then exiting a few moments later to go into a bodega. He left the store smoking a cigarette. Kwok was reportedly with his wife waiting on the train at 8:45 a.m. Sunday when he was shoved onto the tracks at the station on 167th Street and Grand Concourse . Kevin Darden was caught on camera leaving the scene, boarding a bus, then smoking on the street after stopping in a bodega . Darden said he had been left confused by the situation. 'I don’t know what to do or say; I’ve never been in this type of situation before,' he said. Darden has more than 30 prior arrests on his record including charges for robbery, assault, drugs and allegedly trying to set fire to his brother's home. According to police, on November 6 before Mr Kwok's killing, in a separate incident, Darden 'pushed a 51 year old male to the ground causing an injury to the victims hand and back. 'The victim was transported to NYU Medical Center where he was treated and released.' He was last arrested on Sunday, November 9, after allegedly pickpocketing someone in Manhattan.

Dr Craig Spencer receives a hug from head physician Dr  Laura Evans at a news conference after he thanked her personally for taking such good care of him . Dr Spencer appeared at a news conference on Tuesday morning where he described his time spent working for five weeks in Guinea, at the heart of the Ebola outbreak. He said: 'During this time,​ I cried as I held children who were not strong enough to survive the virus. 'But,​ I also experienced immense joy when patients I treated were cured and invited me into their family as a brother upon discharge.' After thanking the teams of medical staff who cared for him along with his friends and family, Dr Spencer said: 'While my case has garnered international attention, it is important to remember​ that my infection represents but a fraction of the more than 13,000 reported cases to date in West Africa - the center of the outbreak, where families are being torn apart and communities destroyed.' Spencer, who traveled to West Africa with Doctors WithoutBorders, was joined by Mayor Bill de Blasio, cityofficials and Bellevue staff. Dr Craig Spencer leaves hospital on Tuesday with an army of doctors and health officials along with the New York mayor and his wife. The doctor was the last known person in the U.S. to have contracted Ebola while working in West Africa . Spencer's diagnosis followed trips on the subway to eat out . and go bowling with friends in Brooklyn, provoking public alarm about the . possible spread of the virus in the city. Dr Spencer thanked medical teams at Bellevue, Doctors Without Borders and his friends and damily as he was discharged on Tuesday . Dr Craig Spencer initially told officers that he had isolated himself in his Harlem apartment after returning from Guinea, where he had been treating people for the illness. It was only when cops checked his MetroCard and bank statement that they realized he had been roaming the city for nearly a week, visiting a sandwich shop, taking an Uber cab, and going bowling. Officers rang Dr Spencer and confronted him with the evidence leading him to confess that he had been out and about, according to the New York Post. During his time holed up in Bellevue, Dr Spencer has been playing the banjo and practicing yoga, it emerged last week. The doctor was also reportedly keeping in shape by riding a stationary bicycle in his hospital room. Another source told the New York Post he has been playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' among hospital staff. Neighbors who have not seen Spencer since he was . hospitalized three weeks ago said they were happy to hear he may . be headed home soon. 'I'm glad to hear he's well enough for that to happen,' one . woman told NY1 television. 'The building's been through a lot and I'm sure they have . been through more,' she said, referring to Spencer's fiancée, . who was quarantined in the apartment until recently. Dr Spencer's condition was upgraded from serious to stable after he received a blood transfusion from fellow US Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol, a missionary who contracted the disease in Liberia. The method was also used to treat Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, Dr Nancy Writebol and Dr Rick Sacra.

"Nancy Snyderman has yet to return to NBC News after being quarantined in an Ebola scare in October. The doctor and chief medical correspondent was one of a group of people forced into mandatory isolation for 21 days after cameraman Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with Ebola while the crew documented the spread of the virus in Liberia. She prompted a storm of criticism when reports emerged stating she had violated the team's original voluntary quarantine order by driving to a cafe. Despite planning to return in November, Snyderman remains absent from the channel and executives do not have a return date for her, CNN reported. Scroll down for video . Questions:  Dr Nancy Snyderman is mysteriously absent from NBC after viewers complained she was 'arrogant, dismissive, and untrustworthy' for allegedly violating her Ebola quarantine in October . Following the three-week quarantine, the 62-year-old was told to take some time off and spend some time with her family. A statement from NBC said: 'While in Liberia Dr Nancy and her team delivered first class, first-hand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story. Their subsequent departure from Monrovia, their return to the U.S. and period of quarantine has been a challenging time. 'We have encouraged them – and they have agreed – to take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives. We very much look forward to their return next month.' The statement added that the network were relieved to say that Dr Snyderman and the rest of the crew were 'healthy and symptom-free'. Snyderman, a surgeon who spent 17 years reporting for ABC News before joining NBC in 2006, came under fire for allegedly violating her quarantine and then refusing to explain what happened. The confusion sparked a furious response from thousands of viewers writing to the station to say they no longer trust Snyderman. It left NBC with a major PR and credibility problem with bosses having to decide whether the medical editor's credibility can survive the incident. The network would not comment. Snyderman was ordered into mandatory quarantine until Wednesday October 22 with the rest of her broadcast team after she allegedly violated their voluntary isolation. New Jersey health officials ruled that her quarantine should be mandatory after Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant. NBC won't give details about who went into the restaurant or how many of its employees were being quarantined. Snyderman issued a statement saying 'members of our group' violated their pledge. Quarantined: Snyderman was placed in mandatory quarantine after covering the Ebola outbreak in Liberia . Suffering: Cameraman Ashoka Mukpo contracted the disease while working with the team and is now cured . More than 1,100 people have subsequently written on Snyderman's Facebook page, many expressing anger. There were suggestions she should be fired or lose her medical license, and some viewers said they wouldn't trust her again. Snyderman's failure to be more specific about the lapse or take greater responsibility was another flashpoint. Snyderman's 'arrogance and dismissiveness' create a huge PR and credibility problem for NBC, said Kelly McBride, an expert on ethics for the journalism think tank the Poynter Institute. 'People are so freaked out about Ebola that the problem NBC has now is that whenever they put her on the air, some news consumers are going to see the woman who put others at risk, rather than the reporter and professional with great experience,' McBride said. McBride suggested that Snyderman 'lay low' or take a leave of absence. Certainly she should not report on Ebola anymore for the network, she said. Future: Snyderman faced calls from viewers to leave the network which she joined in 2006 . Susan Dentzer, a longtime health journalist and commentator for National Public Radio and the PBS 'NewsHour,' said people shouldn't forget that Snyderman put herself at risk to travel to Africa and cover the story. The public is reacting to a fear of Ebola instead of science, she said. 'She and her team clearly should have observed the terms of their quarantine, and she has said clearly that they made a mistake,' Dentzer said. 'But let's put it in a broader perspective.' Before Snyderman's trip for takeout, ABC News' medical expert arguably had bigger problems. ABC health editor Dr. Richard Besser was in Africa at the same time as Snyderman and did not quarantine himself upon his return. That led ABC News President James Goldston to send his staff a memo explaining that the network was following medical advice. Still, Besser was disinvited to a speaking engagement at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, he wrote last week in the Washington Post. Some colleagues have avoided him. 'I've been surprised by how many colleagues have waved from across the room and quickly made an exit,' Besser wrote. 'Others won't enter my office.'","Dr Nancy Snyderman said she would return in November but didn't .

Denny Peterson, who worked at Edison High School in Stockton, California, is now facing a charge of corporal injury to a child . In the clip, filmed by another student, Peterson is seen dragging the girl across the tiled floor towards the pool as she resists . The teenager, who asked not to be named, but whose mother permitted Inside Edition to interview her, said: 'It makes me want to cry seeing the video. I was really upset'.

The incident took place in August after the girl refused to get in the pool because she had, had her hair done that morning and had an event to attend that night . Peterson, who has been employed by the school district for more than 10 years, was put on paid leave for a month immediately following the incident . The video goes on for 95 seconds and one point a student throws water on the pair . The teenager, who asked not to be named, but whose mother permitted Inside Edition to interview her said: 'It makes me want to cry seeing the video. I was really upset. 'I was embarrassed and angry that he was doing all of this in front of people, just putting his hands on me.' Her mother Susie Garcia said: 'You don't expect a teacher to do this to your child when she goes to school.' Gilbert Somera, a Stockton attorney representing the girl and her family said: 'Regardless of her participation (in the class) it should disgust you how this man put his hands on a 14-year-old girl. 'She said multiple times, ""my top is falling down,'' Somera said. Somera added to Inside Edition: 'No means no, and stop certainly means stop. This was carried on for more than a minute and a half, two minutes. He dragged her down from the stairs. She's got big bruises on her leg. At some point as an adult you have to say, ""What am I doing?""' He is preparing a claim and likely a lawsuit over the struggle. Peterson, who has been employed by the school district for more than 10 years, was put on paid leave for a month immediately following the incident. But he was then reassigned to another Stockton campus. He was placed on leave again after News10 notified the school district Peterson was facing a misdemeanor charge of corporal injury to a child.","Denny Peterson is now facing a charge of corporal injury to a child .

"When Pickles the puss grew to the size of a dog, he found himself in a bit of a pickle. At 21 pounds and more than three-feet long, he couldn't find an owner with a heart - or home - big enough to take him in - so he was forced to roam the streets in search of scraps to suppress his almighty appetite. But the monster moggy - nicknamed Catasaurus Rex - has finally found a place to live after a young Boston couple saw an advert online and took pity on him. Andrew Milicia and girlfriend Emily Zarvos say it was love at first sight when they met Pickles at the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals last month.

"Iain Duncan Smith says that the latest figures show that welfare reforms are working . The number of workless households has fallen by its sharpest rate since records began. There are now 3.3million homes in which no one has a job, a drop of more than 270,000 in a year and the biggest fall since 1996. However, it still means that one in six British households are unemployed. The fall in benefits-dependent families was heralded as a sign that the Government’s welfare reforms – designed to make it less lucrative to live off the State rather than find a job – were working. While overall 16 per cent of households have no adults working, this rises to 21 per cent in the North East. In the South East, the figure is just 12 per cent. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of children living in workless households also fell by 132,000 from a year earlier, to 1.5million. This equates to one in eight children, compared to one in five almost 20 years ago. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘There is no better example of welfare reform in action than giving children the economic security of living in a household where people are bringing home a regular pay packet. ‘My priority has always been to get people back to work who had been left behind – people for whom work was not part of their life. ‘These record figures show that not only are we successfully helping people to escape worklessness and turn their lives around, but we are also giving hope to the next generation.’ Workless households are defined as homes where no one aged 16 or over is employed, either because they cannot or will not find a job, or because they are unable to work due to family or studying commitments, retirement, sickness or disability. The data showed that single parent households with dependent children were most likely to have no one in work. The level of workless households has fallen to 16 per cent, the lowest level since records began in 1996 . Married men, or men living with a partner, were the most likely to be employed. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of jobseekers’ website Adzuna, said: ‘The jobs market has come on leaps and bounds. However, the headline numbers gloss over some subtleties of the recovery. ‘Lone parents with dependent children are still the least likely to be employed – more could still certainly be done to help single parents break back into the workforce.’ He also pointed out the regional variations, saying: ‘The recovery is uneven throughout the country, with the proportion of workless households in the North East remaining high. ‘Areas like Sunderland are still in the first throes of recovery. There are still 11 jobseekers searching for every available role in the city. ‘Compare this to cities like Cambridge, where vacancies outnumber jobseekers, and job-hunting in the North East looks somewhat bleak.’ Earlier this month, ONS data showed the biggest fall in UK unemployment for 40 years. It fell by 538,000 in the past year, the largest drop since records began in 1972, while employment rose to record levels of 30.7million.","In 16% of homes no-one has a job, Office for National Statistics says .

"A 16-year-old boy died trying to save his 13-year-old brother after he fell from slippery rocks into a creek on Tuesday. The 13-year old boy whose identity has not been released fell into the water at Lasells Stewart Picnic Area in Wildwood Falls on the Row River in Oregon. The 16-year-old boy whose identity is also not being released lowered himself to the rocks to try to hold onto his brother who was nearly washed away by the rapid moving water. A 16-year-old boy died trying to rescue his younger 13-year-old brother from a creek at Wildwood Falls (pictured) on Tuesday . Due to the speedy current of the water, the 16-year-old was unable to grasp his younger brother and so he lowered himself into the creek in attempt to help him survive. Unfortunately both brothers fell down a narrow chute of water and only the 13-year-old emerged alive. The older brother never returned to the surface of the water, reported KVAL. Lane County Search and Rescue Divers searched the area and later recovered the older brother's body after they removed a large log from the water chute. The Mail Online attempted to contact the police department to learn the boys' identities but no one was available for comment. The condition of the 13-year-old's health is unknown though he is still alive.

"A finance director stole £78,000 to pay for his son and daughter’s boarding school fees after his salary was hit in the economic down turn. Kevin Ballinger, 43, turned to fraud after he lost his job during the financial crisis in 2008 and feeling  'under pressure to provide a particular lifestyle' for his family. He found another position at Ambac Assurance UK in 2010, an American insurance firm, but the salary was not enough to cover the £30,000 a year fees to Brighton College - previously England's Independent School of the Year. Kevin Ballinger stole £78,000 from his employer to cover his children's school fees after he lost his banking job . Ballinger instead siphoned the money from Ambac, making transfers for tens of thousands of pounds to Brighton College over two years to cover his children's fees. But in October last year bosses discovered  suspicious payments had been made and in November he was sacked. Ballinger had tried to cover up the deception by making the transfers using a junior colleague’s computer and work profile. He has now been forced to sell his family home to repay the money and his daughter has moved to a state school. Ballinger took money for his children's fees at Brighton College,  England's best Independent School 2011-12 . The Recorder of London, Judge Brian Barker QC, said: ‘You were under pressure to provide a particular lifestyle for yourself and your family. ‘You were living, prior to the banking crash, in pretty substantial circumstances and it may be you felt it necessary to provide that level of lifestyle for yourself and your family. ‘It is a tragedy to see you here. Like others you were caught in the banking downturn. Previous to that you had a substantial lifestyle but you were re-employed and you had a new job and a new start.' Ballinger, of Horsham, West Sussex, pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud by abuse of position involving a total of £78,767. He was jailed for 15 months. Judge Barker QC added: 'The seriousness of this case is the breach of trust over a two year period. 'You cast suspicion on your colleague who now feels betrayed by what happened. ‘It was a sophisticated operation and you went to considerable lengths to cover up what you have done.’ Lewis Power QC, representing Ballinger, told the court Ballinger had been trying to maintain a certain lifestyle for his family. He said : ‘Although dishonest he was doing his level best for his family.’ Since his dismissal Ballinger has been helping out at the job centre and making wooden planters.","Former city worker Kevin Ballinger lost his well-paid job in  economic crisis .

"Dr Anthony Madu made thousands by working as a locum when he was also receiving sick pay . A doctor faces a potential jail term for secretly moonlighting in other jobs while claiming more than £29,000 in sick pay from his own hospital. Dr Anthony Madu, 45, carried out well-paid locum work at other hospitals around the country while on sick leave from his job with the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in Wales. NHS bosses had to pay £20,000 to other doctors to cover Madu, meaning the bill for his dishonesty came to around £50,000. He was convicted of six counts of fraud today and was remanded in custody until he can be sentenced next month. Madu was given the specialist registrar obstetrics gynaecology post at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in August 2009. But he was suspended two months later over allegations about his conduct towards other staff and claims he had falsified his training record, the court heard. From January 2010, he then submitted sick notes on three different occasions, saying he could not work because of stress. Madu then made 'tens of thousands of pounds' while working for Sandwell General Hospital in Birmingham as well as Scarborough General Hospital and The Royal Oldham Hospital in Greater Manchester, the jury heard. Prosecutor Christian Jowett said: 'He was legally obliged to tell his employers about his work but he did not do so. 'He was also legally obliged to tell two locum agencies that he was on extended leave and had been granted sickness leave. 'But he continued to work and receive payment from both Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and his work in England. 'This was a very costly business for the NHS and very lucrative for Dr Madu - that's why he did it. Madu had been irresponsible as well as dishonest.' The prosecution said the total cost to the Welsh NHS for covering his absence was £49,000 and Madu received more than £100,000 for working as a locum and £29,000 in sick pay. He was convicted of failing to declare to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (CVUHB) he had taken secondary employment, that he had failed to tell two different agencies, Medacs and JCJ, he had been signed off sick and that he did not declare to either agency he had been suspended. Remanding Madu in custody at Cardiff Crown Court today, Judge David Wynn Morgan said: 'It may well be a tragedy has been avoided by the timely actions by the health board.' Madu will be sentenced on November 28. The frauds were committed after Dr Madu was given the specialist registrar obstetrics gynaecology post at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff (pictured) in 2009 . Madu was previously criticised as an 'unimpressive witness' and 'unreliable' by a coroner investigating the death of a newborn baby . It emerged today that Madu was taken on by the Cardiff and Vale health board just weeks after he was involved in the care of a first-time mum whose baby Mikhael was born unresponsive and died 11 days later. An inquest into baby Mickael Morales was not held until October 2012 when a coroner ruled that his death was caused by his mother Sheryl Morales being given too much of a drug during her labour at the Royal Bolton Hospital. Madu, a locum doctor on duty at the Royal Bolton at the time, had said he could not remember signing the prescription for the drug - but investigators said the signature was definitely his. At the hearing, Assistant coroner Kevin McLaughlin singled Madu out for criticism saying he was an 'unimpressive witness' and 'largely unreliable'. The Bolton hospital apologised to the baby's parents Sheryl and Leonard Morales. Madu is currently suspended by the General Medical Council, which has been engaged in a long-running investigation into him. High court papers show that the GMC has accused him of misrepresenting his postgraduate training record, behaving inappropriately to colleagues and patients, working in medicine in breach of previously imposed restrictions and failing to co-operate with investigations. Madu has contested all the allegations made by the GMC.","Doctor was suspended after starting work at hospital in Cardiff in 2009 .

"Surrounded by music and neon lights, they gathered nightly near a US military base in South Korea. Now, more than 120 women who used to work as prostitutes outside the complex in Uijeongbu City, Gyeonggi Province, are seeking compensation from the Korean government. The former prostitutes, who are aging and poor, claim their county's authorities actively facilitated their work in a bid to keep American forces happy, while ignoring their own welfare. Speaking in a community center in a ramshackle 'camp-town' next to the base, they tearfully explained how they are now planning to sue the government for $10,000 each. Military base: More than 120 women who used to work as prostitutes near a US military base in Uijeongbu City, South Korea, are seeking compensation from the Korean government. Above, Camp Stanley, east of the city . 'We worked all night long. What I want is for the Korean government to recognize that this is a system that it created... and also compensation,' a group of women told the BBC. The pensioners said that although it was their own choice to work as prostitutes - unlike Japan's 'comfort women' - the government instituted a system of compulsory sexual health check-ups. This system - along with 'Western etiquette' courses and their desperate need for money - helped facilitate a prostitution culture that has left them even further in poverty in their old age, they said. They added that the government welcomed their prostitution because it needed foreign currency and was worried in the 1970s that Washington would pull its troops out of the country.

""There was this talk going round about earning dollars by working in the clubs, and that that would would make you a patriot - somebody who was a hard-working Korean,' one woman said. 'We did earn a lot of dollars in the camp town.' Kathy Moon of the Brookings Institution, an expert on prostitution in South Korea, added: 'In the 1970s some Korean officials from the central government did go to these camp-towns. '[They did] try to persuade these women who were working as sex workers to co-operate with the US military command.' Despite the women's claims of a blameworthy system, the sexual health clinics set up by the South Korean government replaced an unofficial network of (often, poorly qualified) doctors. Tearful: Kim Sook-ja, 70, cries whilst recalling her life as a prostitute serving personnel at Camp Humphreys . Serving the military: Kim stands outside a now-bankrupt hostess club for US soldiers in Pyeontaek in July . If it is taken to court, the government may well argue that these clinics helped to protect the women. However, Ms Moon argued the clinics' staff were more concerned with 'maintaining the health and well-being of the US troops not the Korean women'. In recent years, US Forces Korea has implemented a 'zero tolerance' attitude toward servicemen using prostitutes, while South Korea officially outlawed prostitution in 2004. It comes three months after a group of elderly South Korean women sought  some solace for their pain seven decades after Japanese soldiers forced them into prostitution during World War Two. Upset: It comes three months after a group of elderly South Korean women - including Lee Yong-soo (pictured) - sought some solace for their pain 70 years after Japanese soldiers forced them into prostitution in WW2 . Lee Yong-soo, 86, and a group of other former 'comfort women' sat in the front row during the last Mass of the Pope Francis's five-day trip to South Korea in August. The group was hoping to push Japan for a new apology and compensation, as well as a chance to share with the pope their feelings on the brutality they suffered as girls. 'Today's Mass is first and foremost a prayer for reconciliation in this Korean family,' Francis said as he prayed with the women on August 18.","More than 120 former prostitutes seeking $10,000 each in compensation .

"Since launching last Friday more than 10 million people have picked up the iPhone 6 Plus, Apple’s ‘bigger and better’ version of the iPhone 6. But for some, bigger isn’t necessarily better and the larger screen can pose a problem when trying to use the device with one hand. With that in mind, a Japanese company has devised an extension for your thumb that lets you access the entire screen while holding the phone in one hand. Scroll down for video . Tokyo-based Thanko Inc has released a thumb extender for smartphones (shown). Called the Yubi Nobiiru - which translates as 'finger growth' - the hollow silicone device helps you reach the entire screen with one hand. This is especially useful for larger phones like the iPhone 6 Plus . Tokyo-based Thanko's thumb-shaped style, called the Yubi Nobiiru - which translates to ‘finger growth’ - retails for £8.51 ($13.63). Made of silicon, the fake digit weighs 0.024lbs (11g) and is hollow inside so it can be worn on a thumb or finger. At its tip is a small black conductor, which ensures that modern touchscreens can register it when it makes contact. Wearing the extender means that, with one hand, most people will be able to access the entirety of a phone screen with one hand. This will also reduce instances where a palm accidentally brushes the screen and registers an input. So-called phablets, the mid-point device between phones and tablets, such as the iPhone 6 Plus are becoming increasingly popular in Asia. In 2013, phablets overtook shipments of laptops and tablets for the first time in Asia. To make them appeal more to people used to smaller screens, Apple included a ‘reachability’ feature with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. When the home button is double tapped, the screen shifts down to the lower half, making things easier to reach with one hand. The iPhone 6 Plus is 7.78cm (3.06 inches) wide, while other large phones include the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is 7.92cm (3.12) inches wide. Of course, that’s just from side-to-side - diagonally the 6 Plus is 14cm (5.5 inches), and the Note 3 is 14.5cm (5.7 inches). The average male thumb is 6.96cm (2.74) inches long and for women it’s 6.32cm (2.49 inches). Clearly this poses a problem, as the average thumb cannot stretch from one side of a phone to the other without part of the palm touching the screen, which can accidentally register an input. Using the Yubi Nobiiru thumb extender, though, 0.6inches (1.5 cm) is added to the length of the thumb. This means people can more easily reach from side of the phone to the other - as long as they don’t mind wearing the extender. The fake thumb extender is placed on the end of a thumb or finger and extends the reach (left) by 0.6inches (1.5cm). A black conductor at the end (right) ensures its touch is registered on the screen. The device retails for £8.51 ($13.93) and weighs 0.024lbs (11g) The gadget is somewhat reminiscent of the 'Fing-Longer' from the TV show Futurama. In the episode 'Anthology of Interest I' Professor Farnsworth (picutred) uses a 'What If' machine to humourously imagine how useful a device might have been - if he ever invented it . The company said this is especially useful for commuters travelling by train who often stand up while holding onto a handrail. Attempting to use a larger phone in this scenario can be difficult - a problem they say is solved with this thumb extender. And it’s not just for the iPhone 6 Plus that the thumb is designed; other larger phones, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, can also make use of it. ‘This wasn’t specifically designed for the new iPhone but for overall smartphones because screen sizes are getting larger and difficult to handle,’ a spokesperson for Thanko Inc told the Wall Street Journal.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is ‘adamant’ that Raheem Sterling will stay at the club despite reported interest from Europe’s finest, but on current form it will be equally important for him to tie down Jordan Henderson for the long-term at Anfield. Sterling’s future has been the subject of interest from the likes of Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. The 19-year-old set up the decisive goal for Henderson as Liverpool returned to winning ways. Liverpool know the £30,000-a-week deal they agreed with Sterling 18 months ago is low for an international regular and, while Rodgers revealed discussions have started about a new contract, no agreement appears imminent. Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling shows his speed against West Brom's Stephane Sessegnon on Saturday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) is 'absoultely adamant' Sterling will stay at Anfield . ‘It’s not a big issue for us. Ian Ayre (Liverpool’s chief executive) has spoken with his representatives and he is quite relaxed,’ said Rodgers. ‘The club is dealing with the agent so everything is calm and the boy is remarkably happy here and there are no secondary thoughts about anything else other than continuing to play for Liverpool.’ Asked directly if he thought Sterling wanted to stay, Rodgers replied: ‘Yes. Absolutely adamant. His agent is a good agent and he understands this is the perfect place for him.’ So far, the contract situation surrounding Henderson has gone under the radar. But that won’t last for long when he produces man-of-the-match performances like he did at the weekend, setting up Liverpool’s opener for Adam Lallana with a delightful flick and then scoring the 61st-minute winner with a low drive to earn his club their first league win since August. Henderson, 24, is inside the final two years of a £40,000-a-week deal he signed when he joined from Sunderland in 2011. Jordan Henderson's electric form for the Reds makes his contract renegotiation a priority for the club . Henderson (right) celebrates scoring Liverpool's second goal against West Brom, set up by Sterling . No concrete offer has yet been made, but he will hope that changes after Daniel Sturridge signed a new five-year contract last week. Rodgers will be glad to have Sturridge back from a thigh injury for their next fixture against QPR on October 19. In the striker’s absence, he started Rickie Lambert on Saturday and sent on Mario Balotelli in the second half — but neither could beat Albion keeper Ben Foster despite a number of attempts. Albion have their own sharp-shooter, England Under 21 forward Saido Berahino who scored his sixth goal of the season when his penalty briefly got his side back to 1-1. Berahino had his problems last season, but manager Alan Irvine insisted: ‘His approach to his job is fantastic.’ A 44,000 crowd at Anfield included the agent of ex-Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who has been linked with a January move to Liverpool.

"A former police officer suspected in the deaths of two women whose bodies were found in suitcases dumped on a rural Wisconsin highway said he killed the women during separate meetings at hotels to have rough sex, a detective testified Thursday. Steven Zelich, a 52-year-old security officer, has been charged with two counts of hiding a corpse in Walworth County, where the suitcases were found June 5 by highway workers cutting grass. Authorities there have said they expect homicide charges to be filed in the counties where the women died, but Zelich's public defender Travis Schwantes said Thursday in court that the deaths were accidents that may not merit additional charges. Judge Phillip Koss disagreed, saying the fact that Zelich hid the bodies, first in his home and car and then in tall grass along the road, indicated Zelich knew a crime had occurred. Suitcase bodies: Steven Zelich appears in a Walworth County courtroom for his preliminary hearing Thursday, July 3, 2014, in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. The former police officer has been charged with hiding a corpse after the bodies of two woman were found stuffed in suitcases deposited along a rural road in Wisconsin . Admission: A detective testified in court today that Zelich said he killed the women during separate meetings at hotels to have rough sex. The judge Zelich held for trial on the hiding a corpse charges and murder charges could follow . 'If there's purely no crime, I'm not sure why one doesn't call 911 immediately, but beyond that, if there's no crime, it's not clear why these need to be hid at all,' Koss said as he ordered Zelich held for trial on the charges of hiding a corpse. Walworth County Sheriff's Detective Jeffrey Recknagel testified that Zelich told him that he met both women in online chat rooms, set up dates for sex at hotels and killed the women after bondage sessions. Recknagel said one woman, Jenny Gamez, 19, of Cottage Grove, Oregon, spent several days with Zelich at a hotel in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, before he killed her in 2012. The other woman, Laura Simonson, 37, of Farmington, Minnesota, died in November at a hotel in Rochester, Minnesota, authorities said. Zelich kept the bodies hidden in suitcases before discarding them in early June, the detective said. 'He told me that he had been storing these bodies in the trunk of his vehicle and the smell was so strong that he decided he had to get rid of them,' Recknagel said. Scroll down for video . Victims: The bodies of Laura Simonson (left), 37, from Farmington, Minnesota, and Jenny Gamez, 19, of Oregon were found in suitcases in rural Wisconsin . Internet dates: Zelich met Jenny Gamez, an Oregon teenager identified Monday, June 30, 2014, as one of two women whose bodies were found in suitcases in Wisconsin online and met her at a hotel, say police . Tragic mother: Laura Simonson is pictured here with six of her seven children. Her seventh, a girl named Alyssa, passed away last year . Zelich worked for the West Allis Police Department from February 1989 until his resignation in August 2001. A . police report says a woman told officers in May 2001 that she met . Zelich in a bar, went home with him and tried to flee when she thought . she heard him get out handcuffs. The report says Zelich said the woman, a prostitute, tried to steal from him and their struggle was his attempt to get the money back. Zelich resigned from the department in August 2001 over the incident. His attorney, Travis Schwantes, said he had not seen the report and could not comment. He . had been working as a private security officer when he was arrested . June 25, the same day detectives wearing hazmat suits removed a . refrigerator and large brown bags of evidence from his apartment in West . Allis, a Milwaukee suburb.Walworth County authorities have said the . women were killed elsewhere and they expect homicide charges to be filed . in those other counties. Recknagel . says Zelich told him he killed the women accidentally after separate . sexual encounters that were rough and included bondage. Zelich's public defender has said the deaths may have been accidents. The bodies were discovered June 5 in suitcases discarded along a rural road in Town of Geneva. Investigators believe Gamez, who grew . up as a foster child and had recently won a college scholarship, was . killed in Wisconsin in late 2012 or early 2013 and that Simonson was . killed in November 2013. Gamez had moved from her home in Cottage Grove, Oregon, to be closer to a community college about 20 miles north in Eugene. She lived with friends and visited her family, but eventually fell out of touch, said her foster mother, Lorraine Eriksen. 'I was surprised that I didn't hear from her,' Eriksen said. 'I . knew she spent some time in California with friends, but her friends in . Cottage Grove said she stopped texting with them, and after that we . could not get in touch with her.' She said Gamez, who had been in foster care with numerous families since she was five, 'was a joy to be around'. Gamez gave birth to a son in 2008, and the boy's father gained sole custody in 2010, court records show. Hot trail: Detectives wearing hazmat suits removed bags of evidence and a refrigerator from the suburban Milwaukee apartment of Steven Zelich . Mr  Zelich, a security officer and former cop, has been charged with two counts of hiding corpses . She . then went to live with Eriksen, who last saw her more than a year ago . when Gamez visited her. Erikson had been . wondering where the teenager was when police turned up on her doorstep . asking for a hair sample. Laura Simonson's father, Richard Wierson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his daughter had placed escort ads on Craigslist. Wierson . said she had struggled with mental illness since adolescence, and that . her seven children were placed in foster care with him in 2010. One of . her daughters, Alyssa, passed away last year. Break in the case: Steven Zelich, 52, was arrested in connection to two female corpses found stuffed in suitcases found in Wisconsin in June . A . missing persons investigation initiated by the Farmington Police . Department determined Simonson was last seen November 2 in Rochester. She was reported . missing by her mother November 22, 2013 - about three weeks after she . parked her van outside her family's home in Farmington. Police . in Rochester announced they have evidence suggesting that Simonson was . killed at the Microtel Inn and Suites in town where the victim and . Zelich allegedly stayed together on the night of November 2. The next day, Zelich checked out of the motel but Simonson was no longer with him, police said. Following Simonson's disappearance, . an ad was placed on the site SecondCityClassifieds.com claiming that . the divorced mother of seven was mentally disabled and had been enslaved . and tortured by Steven Zelich. The ad titled 'Steven Zelich is a predator' described the former law enforcement officer as a 'sadist' who had enslaved Simonson, keeping her 'naked, handcuffed, shackled, and caged.' 'He has no intention of ever releasing this poor woman who suffers from various mental disabilities. She has been whipped and tortured by Steven Mark Zelich since November 2, 2013,' the ad read. The writer provided Zelich's cell phone number and email address, urging online users to harass the man and flood his inbox with messages. The ad also revealed Zelich as an avid practitioner of sadomasochism who had been active on the site Collarme.com under the user name 'mrhandcuffs.' That profile has since been deleted, but on the website Collarspace.com dedicated to the S&M lifestyle, a user by the nickname 'Mrhandcuffs' described himself as dominant and touted the virtues of having a long-term slave. The profile was accompanied by a photo of a middle-aged man strongly resembling Zelich seated on a white couch. 'There is nothing better than a slave, tied tight, gagged, blindfolded, hooded, chained, caged...' he wrote. 'The slave I seek understands the incredible connection between owner and owned.' According to Chicago Tribune, . the 52-year-old licensed security officer also had been active on an online . discussion board titled MasterB Slave Club, where he posted a similar message . about 'seeking perm enslavement... ideally in a farm/caged situation.' Mr Handcuffs: Zelich has been active in the S&M community, posting on websites dedicated to that lifestyle under the name 'mrhandcuffs' about his desire to own a permanent slave . Gruesome find: Highway workers cutting grass outside Lake Geneva, Wisconsin on this road found two suitcases in tall weeds in a ditch. They were moved them to the side of the road. Officers investigated and found a body in each suitcase . According to a criminal complaint, Zelich told investigators he met the women online. He said he killed Gamez in late 2012 or early 2013 in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, and Simonson in November in Rochester, Minnesota. Gamez was identified through dental records, said Kurt Picknell, undersheriff in Walworth County, which includes Town of Geneva. A . highway worker first came across the suitcases containing the female . corpses June 5 as he mowed the grass in Geneva, about 50 miles southwest . of Milwaukee. At around 3pm that day, another person saw the dumped bags by the road and called the police department. Those . suitcases contained decomposing human remains. Passersby say they saw . flies when they got out to investigate the suitcases. 'It is one of the more horrific crimes I've been involved in,' said Geneva Police Chief Steven Hurley, who has worked for 36 years in law enforcement. 'It has taken a lot of twists and turns in the past few weeks.'","Steven Zelich, 52, licensed security officer and former cop, charged with two counts of hiding corpses .

"George Zimmerman is hiding in a secret safe house in Seminole County, Florida, protected 24 hours a day by a private security team. The former neighborhood watch volunteer has stepped up his security after being released from jail on $1 million bail because he is forced to stay in the same community where he killed Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's supporters say he has received thousands of death threats since the shooting in February in Sanford, Florida, which he claims was self-defense. Scroll down for video . Freed: George Zimmerman, centre, leaves Seminole County Jail after posting a million dollar bond . Out: The bond had been set less than 24 hours earlier. His previous bond of $150,000 was revoked for misleading the courts about his finances . Zimmerman's . lawyers were able to post the bond with help from an influx of $20,000 . in donations to their client's defense fund after a desperate plea on . its website, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The $20,000 added . to the balance of $211,000 in the defense fund, which was more than . enough to cover the 10 per cent non-refundable portion charged by . bonding companies. 'He is very happy . to be out. It's been a very sobering experience spending the last month . in jail,' Zimmerman's attorney Don West told reporters on Friday . afternoon. Another attorney for Zimmerman, Mark O'Mara, said that the team had secured a temporary safe house for his client. He . is required to stay in the county and must be electronically monitored, . can't open a bank account, obtain a passport or set foot on the grounds . of the local airport. He has a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He will be required to pay $9.50 a day to the sheriff’s office for the cost of the monitoring. The terms of Zimmerman’s release include tighter restrictions than before, including a requirement that he remain within Seminole County, though his attorney said they were going to petition the judge to be more flexible on where he can stay due to safety aspects. West told Dave D'Marko of Central Florida News 13 that the defense team had taken steps to protect Zimmerman but that off-duty officers are not being paid to shield him. A . judge set Zimmerman's bond at $1 million on Thursday. His previous . $150,000 bond was revoked after prosecutors presented evidence to that . he had misled the court about his finances. The . statement pleading for funds on Zimmerman's legal defense fund website . had contained some of the most urgent language yet from the legal team. In cuffs: Zimmerman is pictured returning to jail on June 3 after his bond was revoked . Accused: Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, is accused of murdering Trayvon Martin . 'We . steadfastly maintain that George Zimmerman acted in self-defense and . that he is not guilty of second degree murder,' the statement read. 'For those that . think Mr. Zimmerman has been treated unfairly by the media, for those . who feel Mr. Zimmerman has been falsely accused as a racist, for those . who feel this case is an affront to their constitutional rights – now is . the time to show your support.' The . statement added Zimmerman had to pay a bail bond company $100,000 . dollars – 10 per cent of the $1 million dollar bail – and be able to show he . had collateral worth $1 million. The bond was . raised to $1 million dollars after it emerged Zimmerman . had allowed his wife Shellie to mislead the court about how much money they . had during an April 20 bond hearing. The couple failed to disclose at least $130,000 in donations, made through a PayPal account. Uproar: The killing of Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed when he was shot dead in February, has sparked a national debate about race, guns and self-defense laws . Reenactment: In a video taken a day after the attack, Zimmerman claimed Martin had pushed him to the ground and went for his gun. Zimmerman said he fired the weapon in self defense . Prosecutors argued . Zimmerman and his wife talked in code during recorded jailhouse . conversations about how to transfer the donations to different bank . accounts. Zimmerman at one point asked how much . money they had. She replied '$155' but prosecutors allege that was code for . $155,000. Shellie Zimmerman faces arraignment at the end of the month on a perjury charge; she was freed on bond. During Zimmerman's second bond hearing, his . attorney, Mark O'Mara, said that his client was confused, fearful and . experienced a moment of weakness when he and his wife misled the court. But the judge didn't buy it and accused . Zimmerman of making plans to flee to avoid prosecution, misleading . O'Mara by not disclosing his money and trying to manipulate the judicial . system. 'The evidence is . clear that the Defendant and his wife acted in concert, but primarily at . the Defendant’s direction, to conceal their cash holdings,' Judge Kenneth Lester wrote in his statement on Thursday. Second chance: On Thursday, Judge Kenneth Lester gave Zimmerman a second opportunity to be released while he await trial by setting the bond. The judge had revoked his bond last month . Zimmerman is charged with . second-degree murder in Martin's death. He shot the unarmed youth dead on February . 26 in a gated community but has claimed he acted in self-defense when . Martin knocked him over and began smashing his head against the ground. Zimmerman's release comes after Martin's mother said she was disappointed by the judge's . decision to give Zimmerman another chance at posting bond and . leaving prison before trial.

"Nadezhda Popova, who died this week aged 91, was one of the last of the Night Witches. The Soviet bomber pilots who terrorised the Germans in WWII . The Nazis dubbed them the 'Night Witches', on account of the way they would cut their aircraft engines to silently swoop in before dropping their bombs. The 'whooshing' noise they made as they passed overhead was said to resemble a witch's broomstick. In 1941, as the Soviet Union struggled desperately to stop the German advance, Stalin ordered the formation of three all-women air force units. Among the first volunteers was . 19-year-old Nadezhda Popova, who would go on to become one of the most . celebrated heroes of the Soviet Union. Popova, . who died this week at the age of 91, flew 852 missions against the . Germans in rickety wooden biplanes and was shot down several times, . Her unit, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment was equipped with obsolete two-seater Polikarpov PO-2 biplanes. The aircraft, made of wood and fabric, were slow and cumbersome. They had no radio, no guns and no parachutes. To navigate, the pilots used a stopwatch and a map. They were too vulnerable to fly during the day so only flew night missions. Their job was to harass the German positions, taking out the troops' encampments, storage depots and supply lines. While . they were unable to inflict any strategically important damage, the . psychological damage on German morale was said to be immense. Obsolete: The Night Witches flew ancient Polikarpov po-2 bi-planes that were equipped with no guns or parachutes and were only able to carry two bombs . Downtime: Female soviet pilots of the 46th Guards Air Force Regiment relax between missions against Germany during World War II . The Nazis viewed them as such a menace that an Iron Cross was promised to any Luftwaffe pilot who shot down a 'Nachthexen'. Because the Polikarpov planes were . only capable of carrying two bombs strapped under their wings the pilots . had to fly multiple missions every night, returning to base to collect . more bombs. Nadezhda Popova once famously flew 18 in a single night. According to her obituary in The Times, it was the freezing cold weather that she remembered the most. Action stations: Night Witch pilots receive orders before a raid on the Byelorussian front in 1944 . Nadezhda Popova (second from right) with (from left) Squadron Navigator Yekatrina Ryabova, Flight Commander Raisa Yushchina,  Navigator Mira Paromova and (far right) Squadron Commander Marina Chechneva read a fashion magazine in eastern pomerania, in 1945 . She recalled: 'When the wind was strong it would toss the plane. 'In . winter when you'd look out to see your target better you got frostbite, . our feet froze in our boots, but we carried on flying. Soviet hero: Nadezhda Popova flew 853 missions against the Germans in WWII . 'You had to focus on the target and think how you could hit it. There was no time to give way to emotions. 'Those who gave in were gunned down and they were burned alive in their craft as they had no parachutes.' The tactics was to fly in formations of three with two of the planes breaking off to act as decoys and attract the searchlights while the third slipped in to drop its bombs. On . one occasion after crash landing in the North Caucasus she joined a . retreating Soviet column in which she met another downed pilot Semyon . Kharlamov. His head was . heavily bandaged so only his eyes were showing, but he charmed he with . jokes and after meeting up several times over the course of the war, . they married. Nadezhda Popova was born in Shabanovka on December 17, 1921. The daughter of a railwayman, she was bitten by the flying bug after a plane landed near her house. At 15 she joined a flying club and at 16 she made her first parachute jump. She volunteered to become a bomber pilot after her hometown was occupied by the Germans and her brother was killed fighting at the front. She rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel before returning to her job as a flying instructor after the war. She and her husband Semyon Kharlamov stayed together until he died in 1990. She is survived by a son who is a general in the Belarussian air force.","WWII Soviet hero Nadezhda Popova died this week aged 91 .

"A convicted fraudster and old friend of the Mayor of London has boasted how he flew 6,000 miles to London to assault a journalist who insulted his wife. Darius Guppy, 49, who has known Boris Johnson since they were students together at Eton and then Oxford, was so enraged by a newspaper article about him that he believed 'humiliated' his wife, Sunderland-born Patricia, he flew from his home in Cape Town to exact revenge. Notoriously vengeful Guppy, who served time in prison for faking a jewel heist, tracked the journalist down to his home, lay in wait for him and then knocked him to the ground as he left the house before tipping a sack of horse manure over him. Darius Guppy, pictured with wife Patricia, sought revenge on a journalist over a perceived insult . In an article boasting about his attack on the man, Guppy - a former friend and Oxford peer of both Boris Johnson and Earl Spencer, wrote: 'I waited for him to emerge from his house, chased him, and then, having knocked him to the ground, emptied over his head a sack of horse manure rendered slurry by the addition of bottled water - a concoction made possible courtesy of Hyde Park Riding School and the springs of Evian. 'The aim had been not to hurt him but to humiliate him as he had sought to humiliate my wife. 'And humiliate him is exactly what I did, in front of his neighbours who had poured out on to the street at the sound of his screams.' Writing in the New Statesman, Guppy said he had two friends with him filming the entire incident, but he says he chose not to put the footage onto the internet as he did not wish to hurt the journalist's family. His article, entitled Who Will Bully The Bullies? names neither the journalist nor the article that upset him, although earlier this year an article appeared in a broadsheet newspaper that cast an aspersion on Mrs Guppy's past. Boris Johnson has said of his old friend that he lives by 'the Homeric code of honour, loyalty and revenge'. Darius Guppy, back row, fourth from right, was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club at Oxford University with Boris Johnson, centre front . In a recent BBC interview with Eddie Mair, the London mayor denied tracking down a tabloid journalist 20 years ago whom Guppy wanted beaten up over probings into him for an article. The affair that the journalist, Stuart Collier, was looking into was the fraud that resulted - eventually - in Guppy going to jail. Guppy and Spencer were best men at each other's weddings - this was at Earl Spencer's wedding to model Victoria Lockwood . Angry with insurers Lloyd's of London after his father lost his home and money in the 1990s financial crisis, Guppy and his fellow Oxford graduate Ben Marsh hired a stooge to tie them up in their room at the Halloran House Hotel in New York and shoot a mattress. When police arrived they convinced them they had been the subject of a jewel heist - Guppy 'sobbing like a baby' for effect. Lloyd's paid up for the 'stolen' jewels within weeks, but the stooge, Peter Risdon, was angry at the small sum he had been paid for his part in the fraud.  Collier started looking into the incident, and Guppy got wind of it. Risdon recorded a conversation between Guppy and Boris Johnson in which they discussed finding the journalist and Guppy said: 'There is nothing I won't do to get my revenge'. In 1993 Guppy was jailed for five years and ordered to pay a £533,000 fine.  Guppy said he had no money and declared himself bankrupt, and was ordered to stay in jail until the fine was paid. But a mystery benefactor lent him £165,000 to get him out jail - a man many suspected was his old friend Charles Spencer.  Guppy was freed in 1996 and moved first to Ireland and then to South Africa. Guppy still lives in South Africa with his wife, with whom he has three children, but has fallen out with his old friend Charles Spencer over unfounded suggestions the latter had tried to seduce his wife. Today there were calls on Twitter for Guppy to be arrested over the alleged assault, but a Met Police spokesman told MailOnline they had not been asked to investigate any such incident.","Guppy, 49, says he flew from Cape Town to London to exact revenge on man .

"An aspiring actress died in a tragic car crash after the car she was driving crashed into a tree. Sophie Spencer, 24, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, travelling along the Macclesfield Road, near Alderley Edge at the time of the collision. Police confirmed that Ms Spencer's silver Peugeot 206 was overtaking a car when she swerved to avoid a black Fiat Panda heading in the opposite direction. Sophie Spencer, pictured, died after her car collided with a tree near Alderley Edge, Cheshire, Tuesday night . Fire brigade officers used specialised cutting equipment to remove Ms Spencer, pictured, from her car . Ms Spencer, pictured, was taken to Macclesfield Hospital, where she later died . Cheshire Police are keen to talk to the driver of the car which was being overtaken by Ms Spencer's vehicle at around 7.35pm on Tuesday. Firefighters used specialist cutting equipment to remove Ms Spencer from her car and rushed her to Macclesfield Hospital, where she later died. Heartbroken friends paid tribute to the 'beautiful' young woman who had began her career by starring in three low-budget dramas. Director Andrew Walkington, founder of the Co-operative British Youth Film Academy, worked with Ms Spencer on 2011's The Limelight, As You Like It and Re-Evolution. He said: 'Sophie was an exceptionally talented young lady with a wonderful manner. 'She was such a giving and generous woman and she would always befriend anyone she worked with. 'Sophie would have been than happy to work in any television drama. She was a lovely lady and she will be missed.' Friends also took to social media to leave their memories of the 'always smiling' actress. Hannah Blakely posted on Facebook: 'I am so upset. 'Sophie you were beyond lovely. Deliberately drove the long way home from work to avoid that road. R.I.P' Karly Jade Ayre said: 'Sophie Louise Spencer you were my best mate from the start when we first met each other I'm in great shock right now, you were my closest friend. 'I'm gunna miss you. My great friend they took you too soon babes. I miss you.' The collision happened on the Macclesfield Road, near Alderley Edge, Cheshire, pictured, on Tuesday night . Nikki Breen said: 'I had the pleasure of working with Sophie and what a talented, kind, beautiful soul she was. 'Always smiling and brightening up a room. Keep smiling girlie. You'll be forever missed' Janet Gee said: 'Farewell to one of our beautiful Macc calendar girls. So very, very sad.' The former Fallibroome Academy pupil fell in love with acting at school before  studying theatre and performing arts at South Cheshire College. She also won the a recording session and £500 in radio station Key 103's Sound of Salford singing competition in 2012. Ms Spencer was a former member of the Co-operative British Youth Film Academy where she got her big break in film and worked a beauty consultant for Arbonne UK. Mark Hudson, from the Manchester School of Acting, said: 'Sophie was a smart, quirky, funny, playful, popular and gifted member of a terrific group of students. 'Our hearts go out to her family and friends at this difficult time.' Police are now appealing for witnesses and are keen to trace the driver of the vehicle that was overtaken. Premier League footballers like Wayne Rooney and former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson are residents of Alderley Edge and it is popular with the 'Cheshire set'. The village is famous for its rich and famous residents and is home to successful multi-millionair businessmen and women. It is one of the most expensive places to live in Britain outside Central London. Anyone with information should call PC Paul Burke from Cheshire Police on 101, quoting incident 803 of November 24.","Aspiring actress Sophie Spencer, 24, died after her car struck a tree .

"Best known for its abject cold, WW2 death camps, and occasional, tenuous sightings of the Yeti, Siberia is not the first place you might associate with glamour and fun. But the Russian ski resort of Sheregesh, where temperatures can reach -40C, is doing its best to reinvent the notion that one doesn't go to Siberia for a good time. Not only does the up-and-coming resort have 'the best snow in Russia', according to the World Snowboard Guide, it also boasts comparatively balmy weather which has led to a new sport: bikini snowboarding. Scroll down for video . You really don't want to fall over: Bikini-clad snowboarders enjoying the Siberian snow - and sun . She will need a vin chaud at the bottom: Temperatures can reach -40C in the depths of the Siberian winter . The bikini snowboarders would be stuck if it snowed but Sheregesh is known for its relatively balmy climate . Tempted to hit the slopes in your bikini? The newly-fashionable resort of Sheregesh lies in southern Siberia . And not surprisingly, it has proved a hit both with women keen to tan while they ski, and men happy to watch them doing it. As these pictures show, the snow in Sheregesh is so good that it lasts from November until May, when the warmer Spring sun encourages skiboarders to strip off. And it's not just the young women: plenty of men have taken advantage of the sunnier conditions to strip off and ski bare-chested. Whether they are as appealing to the opposite sex as the bikini-clad girls, remains to be seen. Tanning while she snowboards: The bikini snowboarders have proved an unexpected attraction in Sheregesh . Balmy conditions: The snow in Sheregesh lasts til May, so holidaymakers can ski in the warm sunshine . It must be cold on the chairlift, though: The snowboarders wear just bikinis and ski boots . The World Snowboard Guide says that despite Sheregesh's 'famous Siberian frost, lack of apres-ski', and tedious eight-hour trek from Moscow, the powder is 'dry and fast' and its reputation as a relaxed and fun ski resort means it is fast becoming a fashionable place for Russia's jeunesse doree to go. Another attraction of the resort is the forthcoming Yeti Park, based on the mythical 'abominable snowman' that some claim to have spotted in the Russian mountains. Two years ago, a conference on . bigfoot-type creatures, also known as Sasquatch, was held at Tashtagol, . down the road from Sheregesh, attracting experts from around the world. This video grab shows a young woman enjoying snowboarding in the warm sunshine in beach attire . Where are your salopettes? Bikini snowboarders certainly save money on the expensive ski-wear . Fashionable new craze: The bikini snowboarders of Siberia need to keep their wits about them to avoid wipe-out . Frostbite is the freezing of the skin and other body tissues when exposed to the cold.  The first signs of frostbite are whitening of the skin and numbness, and the skin then beings to feel waxy and firm. Sunburn can be a big problem in ski resorts as the sun's rays reflect off the snow.  In the absence of protective clothing, wear a good quality sun block and reapply frequently. Hypothermia occurs when your core body temperature dips below 35C.  Shivering and disorientation are classic symptoms of this and sufferers may become so confused they try to take their clothes off which makes the problem worse.. Delegates heard how . evidence had been collected in the mountains nearby that pointed to a . '95 per cent certainty' of Yeti habitation in Mountain Shoria, and local . residents said they had seen a bigfoot-type being in the Azasskaya . cave. A 60-bedroom hotel complex and amusement park based on the creature will offer families packages of skiing and yeti-hunting. There will also be a museum devoted to the mythical creature in the Yeti Park, which is expected to take three years to build. Igor Idimeshev, 48, deputy head of Sheregesh's local council, said: 'We are building the Yeti Park now, and of course there will be a chance for people who come here to see the creature.' In the meantime, the less-hairy and rather more attractive snowboarders of Sheregesh are likely to be the main crowd-pullers. One for the girls: Male snowboarders also go without their shirts, but they don't have quite the same glamour .","Snowboarders strip to bikinis in freezing Russian ski resort of Sheregesh .

"No wonder bed bugs are rife. A new survey has revealed that the average single man changes his bed sheets just four times per year. And it's the younger single lads who are best avoided, with the grubbiest age group being revealed as those aged 18-25. That's gross! A new survey has revealed that the average single adult male washes his bed sheets just four times per year; averaging a change once every three months . Coupled-up Britons change their sheets . most frequently according to the results, averaging a sheet swap every two weeks, while single women change theirs every 2.5 weeks. Unsurprisingly, it's women who take charge of the laundry in 81 per cent of relationships. The study also narrowed down results to look at cleanliness by age group. Of those who claimed to wash their sheets once every three months or less, 55 per cent were aged 18-25, with men accounting for 71 per cent of the respondents. In contrast, those who claimed to wash their sheets once a week on average were predominantly aged between 35-50; 62 per cent were female. Some 17 per cent of the single men taking part claimed that a prospective partner has been 'put off' by the cleanliness of their bed sheets . Those who claimed to change their bed linen once every three months or less were asked why this was the case. The majority (49 per cent) simply claimed that they felt this was an ‘acceptable gap’ to leave between sheet changes, while 22 per cent ‘didn’t see the need’ to change them more frequently. Just under a fifth simply ‘didn’t care.’ Women are chief bed sheet changers in 81 per cent of relationships, and the single ladies change theirs every 2.5 weeks on average . However, 17 per cent of the single men taking part claimed that a prospective partner has been ‘put off’ by the cleanliness of their bed sheets in the past, compared to just 2 per cent of the single women taking part. When asked whether or not they always changed guest bed sheets after having guests to stay, just 32 per cent said ‘yes’. Of those who didn’t, two thirds claimed that they left the same sheets on until they’d had ‘several guests’ to stay in them. Single male respondents were asked how many different bed sheet sets they owned, to which the average answer was ‘one set’ for just over half of those taking part. In contrast, single female respondents claimed to own an average of three sets, according to the majority. Jed MacEwan, Ergoflex UK spokesperson, who carried out the survey, said: 'We were quite alarmed at the apparent lack of basic hygiene from some respondents. 'Unclean bed sheets contain the tens of thousands of dead skin cells that we shed every night, and by going months without cleaning them you’re risking some distinctly unpleasant consequences every time you go to bed. 'Dust mites would find a perfect habitat in such unhygienic bed sheets, and it's well documented that they can cause allergic flare-ups, asthma, rhinitis and other physical reactions. 'Also, by allowing your bed to become so unclean you’re almost asking for a bed bug infestation, which could prove to be a high price to pay for simply not washing your sheets more regularly.'","Average British single man changes bed linen once every three months .

"Iconic: The famous Playboy bunny ears will soon be seen in India . Playboy is about to introduce its risque bunny ears to India - but the club plans to remove the sex and play up the glamour in a country where even kissing in films is a touchy subject. The club's promoters will launch the . country's first club in Goa in December - a 22,000 sq ft open-air . property in the Candolim Beach tourist hot-spot. But the bodices, bunny ears and . cotton tails familiar to Playboy patrons are likely to be absent, instead replaced with demure bunnies in an 'aspirational' setting. The Indian club's chief executive, Sanjay Gupta, said he wanted to create a club which his wife would feel comfortable visiting - a far cry from the other 40 or so Playboy clubs in the world. The club scheduled to open in mid-December, followed by a . second club in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad early next year. Gupta added the bunnies will still be present - . but their costumes for the moment are 'confidential'. He said: 'Bunnies are an integral part of Playboy . culture. We . will have bunnies but keeping in mind Indian sensibilities, we are . toning down the costume. 'We are working very closely with Playboy to . design a bunny outfit for India.' Though Indians may soon get to mingle . with bunnies on the beach, they still cannot buy Playboy magazine, which . is banned in India. English bunnies: Last year, Founder Hugh Hefner brought Playboy back to the UK after a 30 year absence . Honey bunnies: Waitresses pose at the Playboy Club at the Sands Casino in Macau . PB Lifestyle is a Mumbai-based . company with an exclusive license from Playboy Enterprises to open . Playboy clubs, hotels, bars and cafes and sell Playboy branded . merchandise in India. Gupta . said he wants to separate the powerful Playboy brand from its adult . associations, remaking it as an aspirational lifestyle brand for the . growing Indian middle class. He . pledged to build clubs his wife would want to visit and plans an . aggressive advertising campaign to strip his venture of any adult . associations. 'We will dissociate from nudity completely,' he said. 'We are positioning it around lifestyle, aspiration and glamour.' It . is a far cry from the Playboy clubs dotted across the world, such as . London's original Playboy Club at 45 Park Lane, which opened in 1966 and . became a noted hangout for celebrities and the wealthy. It closed in 1981 after gaming licences were revoked and London was without a Playboy Club for 30 years. Although the magazine is still one of America's . best-selling titles, sales have dropped to about three million . an issue from around seven million in 1972. New bunny hutch: The tourist-heavy Candolim Beach is set to be the newest P)layboy hot-spot . With the Indian club, the company has so far been vexed in the effort to get away from its international image. Media . outlets have plastered photos of Sherlyn Chopra, the first Indian woman . to pose nude for Playboy magazine, next to articles about the club. 'I . have nothing against her, but as an Indian lady she is associated with . Playboy magazine,' Gupta said. 'PB Lifestyle has nothing to do with . that.' He said the . company plans to invest $37.5 million to open clubs, bars and cafes over . the next five years, with a goal of opening 120 outlets, including . retail stores, over the next decade. Local officials will be monitoring Gupta's efforts with interest. 'Assuming there is going to be vulgarity and activities that are not in tune with the Goan culture, their proposal will not be granted permission,' said Nikhil Desai, Goa's director of tourism. 'However, they could be setting up a perfectly decent club.' However Goa tourism . minister Dilip Parulekar said the state government will not permit a . Playboy Club in Goa. He said the state is already fighting the menaces . of prostitution and drug peddling and is not willing to attract any more . issues. 'We will not entertain anyone who is here to spread obscenity and nudity,' he said.

"As any woman knows, a spot of make-up can work wonders by seemingly turning back the clock. But exactly how many years does that foundation, mascara and  blusher knock off? Now research suggests that when applied well, it can make the wearer look almost a decade younger. The beauty myth: Respondents to the survey said Carol, 51, looked 53 with no make up, but just 46 - seven years younger - when she chose to wear a full face of cosmetics . Madonna, 54, took seven years off her 'bareface' age . Demi Moore, 49, lost six years thanks to make-up . Those who go out in their warpaint appear to be between five and nine years younger than when they are bare-faced. Kate Moss, 38, and Carol Vorderman, 51, were shown to have the most age-reducing regimes, with both looking nine years younger after applying make-up. Meanwhile, 54-year-old Madonna managed to shave seven years off her age and Cindy Crawford, 46, took off six. The research – which you won’t be surprised to hear was conducted for a beauty retailer – involved showing respondents images of well-known women, first bare-faced and then with make-up. Respondents were asked to identify a ‘make-up age’ and a ‘bareface age’, with the collective results making an average for each. Britney Spears, 30, managed to look five years younger with make-up on. Demi Moore, 50, was the only woman whose ‘bareface age’ was below her real age at 47 – but with make-up on she looked even younger, at 43. Respondents were also asked about their own make-up, with 70 per cent of over-30s saying it makes them look younger. 100 per cent of 60-69 year olds say they look younger in make-up . and... 73 per cent of 40-49 year olds . 62 per cent of 30 - 39 year olds . Of that, 36 per cent thought that make-up made them look one to three years younger, while 29 per cent thought it could make them look three to five years younger. An optimistic 2 per cent thought make-up took ten years off their real age while 18 per cent thought it took off five to seven years. Only women under 21 thought that a slick of black kohl and some lipstick actually added a few years. The survey by Escentual.com showed that the older you are, the more reliant you are on make-up to turn back the clock. Only 60 per cent of those aged 30 to 39 thought they looked younger with make-up, compared with 100 per cent of those aged 60 to 69.","A full 100 per cent of 60 to 69 year olds thought that make-up made them look younger .

"A morbidly obese woman put her life in danger by refusing to walk after her gastric bypass surgery - even though she was warned that she could develop a blood clot from her lack of physical activity and die. When Pauline Potter, 51, from Sacramento, California, joined TLC's obesity series My 600lb Life, she weighed nearly 700lbs and was completely dependent on her 21-year-old son Dillon. But after finally realizing the severe impact her weight was having on her health, she and Dillon decided to make the move to Houston, Texas, so that Pauline could receive treatment from obesity specialist Dr Younan Nowzaradan. But despite claiming that she was committed to shedding her excess weight after undergoing a gastric bypass – saying that she determined to do so for the sake of her son – Pauline quickly started making excuses to avoid getting out of bed following the procedure. At risk: Pauline Potter, 51, started crying after she was told that she could develop a life-threatening blood clot if she didn't get out of bed and start walking . Doctor knows best: Obesity specialist Dr Younan Nowzaradan grew frustrated with Pauline's excuses. 'I want to see you walk out of this room,' he told her . 'She still has to make the decision to be healthy on her own,' Dr Nowzaradan told the cameras. 'If she doesn't the surgery will be a waste. This is her last chance. I hope she takes it.' Although Dr Nowzaradan explained that she was putting herself in danger of developing a life-threatening blood clot, Pauline tearfully refused to get up. 'I pulled a muscle in my stomach,' she told him. 'I know you always think it's an excuse, but if it's hurting me, it is there.' She added: 'I am only on day five of a really big surgery.' Dr Nowzaradan reminded her that patients are typically discharged just two days after having gastric bypass. 'You are making excuses that are not acceptable,' he said. 'I want to see you walk out of this room.' But Pauline continued to make excuses for her frustrating behavior, tearfully telling her doctor that he couldn't – and shouldn’t – expect such fast results. No choice: Before her surgery, Pauline depended on her niece Megan to come to her house to wash her hair . Limited options: Pauline also had to have Megan give her sponge baths because she couldn't fit into the shower . Slow travels: Because she had trouble fitting into cars, Pauline would travel to the grocery store in her electric wheelchair . Because she wouldn't walk, she had no other choice but to undergo another high-risk surgery to put a blood clot filter into her leg. And after spending several months in the hospital, Pauline was finally ready to be discharged – but still refused to get up at her doctor's request. Dr Nowzaradan, who was concerned that Pauline would end up undoing the results her surgery, noted that she had been a difficult patient throughout her stay. 'Her attitude is her biggest problem right now,' he said. When viewers first met Pauline she was being cared for by her son and her niece Megan. She wasn't able to do anything on her own except 'feed and wipe' herself. 'I am absolutely trapped in this body,' she explained. 'I let myself get way out of control. I feel like I am dying every day.' While her niece washed her hair and gave her sponge baths, Dillon had the full-time job of being her primary caregiver. Final choice: Pauline and her 21-year-old son Dillon moved from Sacramento, California to Houston, Texas, so they could meet with Dr Nowzaradan . Fast food: Dillon, who was Pauline's primary caregiver, can be seen handing his mom the McDonalds order she had requested . Healthy eating: In order to prepare for her surgery, Pauline was admitted into the hospital and put on a limited 800 calorie-per-day diet, which included lean meats and vegetables . 'I do feel bad for Dillon just because it doesn't seem like he has had much of a life,' Megan said, explaining to the cameras that his relationship with his mom is more like that of a client and their caregiver. Although she felt like a burden, Pauline said she couldn't stop eating and called it the 'highlight' of her day. Pauline explained that she had been struggling with her weight since she was a child. When her parents had gotten divorce, she often went hungry because her mother was a homemaker and unable to buy them food. After her parents got back together and food was readily available, she started 'overdoing it'. Pauline said she began to get 'chubby' when she was eight-years-old, and by the time she was 17, she weighed nearly 300lbs. She hit the 500lb mark at 29 - the same year she gave birth to Dillon. Drastic changes: Dr Nowzaradan performed gastric bypass surgery on Pauline, pictured, after she lost 40lbs during her hospital stay . Help me: Pauline only attempted to walk once after her surgery, despite being warned that she was at-risk of developing a fatal blood clot . Repercussions: Pauline had to have another high-risk surgery, so Dr Nowzaradan could put a blood clot filter into her leg . 'I’ll probably die in my bed one day and I don’t want my son to find me,' she told the cameras tearfully. 'I feel like I’ve done enough damage to him that that’ll be the final straw.' But eight months after she started her journey, not much had changed for Pauline or Dillon. Although she had gotten down to 535lbs, she wasn't losing weight like she was expected to. She also stubbornly refused to do anything but limited activities of her choosing. She skipped several physical therapy appointments and opted to go swimming instead. 'The pool is safer than the physical therapist's office,' she said. 'If I fall it would be a dangerous situation.' While Pauline was thrilled that she lost nearly 150lbs, Dr Nowzaradan reminded her that she should have dropped at least another 60lbs since leaving hospital. Getting angry: Dr Nowzaradan reprimanded Pauline for not losing enough weight since her surgery . Stubborn woman: Pauline continuously canceled her physical therapy appointments because she thought swimming was safer . Slow progress: A year after she had vowed to lose weight, Pauline was still unable to walk on her own . Dr Nowzaradan said it was clear that she had not changed her dangerous eating habits, adding that she was nowhere near achieving the sort of weight loss expected of someone in her situation. He later learned that Pauline was refusing to see the physical therapists who had contacted her multiple times and that still wasn't walking. Despite voicing his worries that she wouldn’t survive for another year, after putting her body under such strain for so long, Dr Nowzaradan admitted that there was little left he could do for Pauline if she wasn’t willing to make any changes to her lifestyle. 'She has no intention to change right now,' he said. He added: 'You want every patient to be a success, but that's not reality. Hopefully, Dillon won't end up burying his mother soon.' Pauline noted: 'I feel like I am making the progress that I want. I do have to take it at my own pace. I know I will get there that way.'","Pauline Potter weighed nearly 700lbs before having gastric bypass .

"Two British favourites have been combined to make the ultimate breakfast - but at more than 1,200 calories this battered bacon buttie with the trimmings is a real belt-buster. The sandwich features white bread, bacon, egg and mushroom all dipped in chip shop batter and deep fried by a British restaurateur who wants to take the taste of the UK - with a twist - to America. But at more than half the 2,000 recommend daily calorie intake for women, and a substantial chunk of the 2,500 for men - this big breakfast should probably only be eaten once in a while.

First bite: The sandwich has a crunchy outside although its creator admits that the bread can get a bit soggy . Standard: Of course, if you were watching your weight you could just go for the unbattered version! Staff also deep fry slices of pizza, . chocolate bars, macaroni cheese or ingredients supplied by customers, . such as slices of cake, pieces of fruit, or New York hotdogs.

Chris said: 'We like to experiment and a battered breakfast seemed like a good idea for a treat. 'Fish and chips is still my favourite though.' All requests for the fryer are considered, as long as the items do not explode in hot oil, like oranges. Deep . frying a food item doubles its calorie content, and adds a little on . top, explained manager Suzanne Hackett, from Birmingham. In time for Halloween, Chris has also tested some new American ingredients, to find a treat for his US diners. First, he tried deep frying a whole pumpkin, then he battered chilli peppers, stuffed with pumpkin, bacon and cheese, which were a big success. But the chosen dish, which will . feature as a special on his menu, is a battered American corn muffin, . stuffed with traditional American sweets called Candy Corn. 'They're hard yellow and orange sweets, which everyone eats at Halloween,' said Chris . 'But the heat from the frier melts them, and it makes a really gooey filling inside the corn muffin.'

For Lauren and her parents, her recovery has been an uphill battle punctuated by setbacks. Recently, Lauren’s doctors have discovered blood clots in her legs and lungs. Her speech is still slow and she moves around the house with a walker, but Lauren and her mother, Kameron George, are certain that she will come out on the other side stronger than ever. ‘Because God had more than one opportunity to take her if he wanted her,’ the mother said. ‘If she gets no better than she is now we are so lucky. She is so lucky.’ On her part, Lauren George said she 'shouldn't have survived,' and that the only reason she is still among the living is because she has a greater purpose in life. Justice or Lauren: Kevin Gutierrez (left) and Terry Searcy (right), both age 18, have been charged with robbery and assault in connection to the shooting . The two suspects in the shooting that nearly ended Ms George’s life, Terry Searcy and Kevin Gutiérrez, both 18 years old, have been charged with first-degree robbery and assault. According to a witness account, Lauren got into an argument with one of the suspect before she was shot in the head. Her mother said this week that no prison time for the alleged robbers would satisfy their family. 'Because of the life-altering events that have taken place, their punishment can never be enough for what we've endured and what we will still endure,’ she said.","Lauren George, 20, had the left side of her skull shattered by a stray bullet outside her home in Montevallo, Alabama, in January .

"One Australian reporter has discovered first-hand the perils of chasing down a difficult interview when she was attacked with a cooler full of water on Thursday, leaving her soaked from head to toe. Nine News' Alex Bernhardt was at a Gold Coast man's home in Queensland's south east after police allegedly found a hand grenade at the address during a raid earlier in the day. Bernhardt arrived at the residence with her camera crew as the man was filling up his cooler. But when she asked about the hand grenade, the man made it very clear that visitors weren't welcome.

"Premature: Lily Burrows, pictured with mother Gillian, had just a 5 per cent chance of survival when she was born prematurely at 23 weeks. A significant number of babies born at 23 weeks now survive . Medical advances mean significant numbers of premature babies are surviving being born at 23 weeks – a time when they could still legally be aborted. Improvements in specialist neo-natal care are likely to reopen the debate over the abortion limit. Pro-life groups have long argued that no healthy baby should be aborted while they have a chance of life. Current laws allow babies to be aborted at up to 24 weeks. Some who defend the current threshold argue that the survival rate remains poor if a baby was born at that point. A commonly cited study, based on evidence gathered in 2006, suggested that just 19 per cent of babies born at 23 weeks survived. But new research shows that many British specialist neo-natal units have vastly improved on those survival rates, and some even see the majority of babies born at 23 weeks surviving. Data from 25 hospitals over the past four years shows that 120 babies born at 23 weeks survived. The figures, obtained via Freedom of Information laws by the Sunday Times, show that at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, six of eight babies born at 23 weeks last year survived. Six of seven babies born at 23 weeks at University College London Hospitals last year lived. All five born at that point at North Bristol NHS Trust last year also survived. The national rate of survival is likely to be far lower, especially at smaller hospitals without readily-available specialist care, but the figures demonstrate that if given the best care, babies are frequently surviving very premature births. Around 560 babies are aborted at 23 weeks’ gestation every year. Dr Ngozi Edi-Osagie, clinical director of neo-natal services at Central Manchester University Hospitals, said: ‘It is a concentration of expertise, both in medical and nursing, that contribute to making a difference in survival at this very low gestation.’ The advance will trigger a renewed debate over abortion rules. Pro-life groups have long argued that a foetus’s development is very advanced by 23 weeks and aborting a baby at that point is wrong. Many have called for the limit to be reduced to as little as 12 weeks. Fiona Bruce, Tory MP and member of the all-party parliamentary pro-life group, said: ‘I do not understand why there is not more outcry about the fact that we allow viable babies to be aborted. Tiny: Lily was just 1lb, 3oz when she was born at 23 weeks - a time when she could still legally be aborted. Pro-life groups have long argued that no healthy baby should be aborted while they have chance of life . The new figures support what we have known for a while: that advances in pre-natal care make a mockery of our 24-week abortion limit.’ However, MPs have so far shown little appetite to change the rules. They were given a series of free votes on the issue in 2008, with new suggested limits ranging from 12 to 22 weeks. The proposal for a 20-week limit was defeated by 332 votes to 190. The closest vote, on a 22-week limit, was defeated by 304 to 233. It was the first major challenge to Britain’s abortion laws since 1990, when the legal limit was lowered from 28 to 24 weeks. David Cameron, then Leader of the Opposition, voted in favour of the reduced limit at 22 and 20 weeks. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg voted to leave the limit. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Parliamentary practice is that any proposals to change abortion laws come from backbench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes.’ Little girl who defied doctors' predictions . When Lily Burrows was born at   23 weeks, doctors gave her mother heartbreaking news. Weighing 1lb 3oz, little Lily had just a 5 per cent chance of  survival, they said. Even if she did survive, they said her body was so under-developed that she would have long-term health problems and may need lifelong medical care. But, now aged five, Lily is now thriving as she starts school. Thriving: Even if Lily did survive, doctors said her body was so under-developed that she would have long-term health problems. But, now aged five, a happy and healthy Lily, pictured with her mother, is starting school . Her mother, Gillian Lindsay, 30, said: ‘To see Lily racing about so excited at starting school, you’d never believe how tiny she was at birth and what a battle she has faced to live. ‘Doctors told me she had less than a 5 per cent chance of survival and at one point she was so poorly, they even talked about turning off her life support. But Lily had other ideas.’ Lily stayed at Edinburgh Royal Hospital for 101 days after her birth in March 2009. She is now starting at St Mary’s Primary School in Bonnyrigg, near Edinburgh – and there is barely a clue as to her difficult start to life. Her mother said her daughter was a ‘very clever, very active and very loving little girl’. She added: ‘I owe so much to the midwives, doctors and nurses who looked after her in those early days.’","Significant numbers of premature babies born at 23 weeks now survive .

"Police have raced to the home of hate preacher Anjem Choudary and evacuated his family to protect them from attack, it emerged today. Officers helped them flee their East London terraced house after threats from people wanting vengeance for the Woolwich murder of Lee Rigby. Choudary, who believes that 'war monger' David Cameron's 'crusade' in Afghanistan is turning young British Muslims to terrorism, allowed his wife and children to be rushed to a car and whisked away to a secret location at around 2pm yesterday. Help: Critics say the police should stop Choudary's hate-filled speeches on the internet, rather than running up costs protecting his family from threats following the Woolwich terror . Evacuation: A member of Choudary's family carries two pink bags before the children are ushered out as police shut the property's door . Baby: A woman, believed to be Anjem Choudary's wife, is escorted from the house by a female police officer, while carrying a young child . Two Scotland Yard officers then stood guard at the property for several hours afterwards. Choudary himself was not at home, with a neighbour saying he had left the property earlier that morning. Scotland Yard today refused to discuss the operation, but it is understood that it was linked to a threat of violence. A group called Britain First posted a video message online calling on police to arrest Anjem Choudary by 6pm or they would come to detain him themselves. Members also claimed they knew where he lived and security sources confirmed they decision to move his wife and children was because of safety fears. Choudary today blamed David Cameron for a 'crusade' against Islam which is turning young British Muslims into potential terrorists. Aggressive foreign policy in Afghanistan and oppressive tactics employed by police and security organisations in Britain are responsible for isolating British Muslims and leading them to adopt the extreme ideology that results in violent attacks, according to Choudary, who admitted knowing Michael Adebolajo who butchered soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week. 'By ignoring the link between what took place in Woolwich, by blaming Muslims, by trying to silence voices who oppose him and by justifying his rotten foreign policy, David Cameron has foolishly and inadvertently become the biggest radicalising tool for Muslim youth both in the UK and abroad,' he said. 'For the war monger David Cameron and his lackeys to suggest that no one can make such a link is not only complete rubbish but also highly irresponsible. 'After all the British regime is supposedly charged with the security of the British people as opposed to being charged with engaging in some sort of Crusade against Islam and Muslims on the behest of the American regime around the world.' Rally: Michael Adebolajo (circled) pictured at a demonstration in Paddington Green, London, in 2007 with Anjem Choudary . Suspects: MI5 are investigating links between . the two Woolwich murder suspects Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael . Adebowale (right) and controversial preacher Anjem Choudary . Yesterday Choudary backtracked on . comments he previously made about his links with one of Drummer Lee . Rigby's suspected killers in the face of an MI5 investigation. Choudary . said he has not been in touch with murder suspect Michael Adebolajo . since 'before 2007' after it was revealed MI5 investigators were looking . into the amount of contact, if any, he had with the two suspects. But last week Choudary said he last saw him in 2011 and described him as a man of 'impeccable character' in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News. Refusing to condemn the killers of Lee Rigby, the British drummer crushed by a vehicle and then hacked to death with machetes, Choudary even suggested that ‘one man killed in a street’ was hardly proper vengeance for those killed by ‘Britain and the U.S.' in wars overseas. On Twitter, Choudary said: 'I can challenge the war monger David Cameron to an open debate on 'Whether Muslims should promote hatred or love against UK Foreign policy?' 'In reality David Cameron is clearly not able give any cogent argument as to why the UK regime continues to follow the US in killing Muslims!' Meanwhile Michael Adebowale has arrived at court for the first time since being charged with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby who was hacked to death outside his army barracks in Woolwich last week. Fallen hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, from Manchester, was described as 'cheeky and humorous' in tributes. He was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich last week . Accused: Michael Adebowale arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday in the back of a police van after being charged with the murder of soldier Lee Rigby . Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, was driven in the back of a police van to Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he also faces a charge of possessing a firearm. He is due to appear before magistrates this morning . Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command said last night they had been authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to charge him over last Wednesday's attack. His alleged accomplice, Michael Adebolajo, 28, remains in a stable condition in hospital under armed guard, after being shot by police.","Officers took away his wife and children to safe house after alleged threat .

"Thousands of ethnic Hazara women are refusing to bury their loved ones until the Pakistani government takes action against plotters who bombed a market and killed 89 people. Shia Muslim Hazaras say they receive no protection from the police or the army in the face of repeated attacks on their minority group. Saturday's blast in a food market was the second large-casualty attack on the group in a month. Today, thousands of women took to the streets to demand protection from the Sunni militants who have long targeted them because they do not view them as 'real Muslims'. The refusal of the Hazara women to . follow the customary Islamic ritual of burying the dead as soon as . possible is seen as 'the last stand' of the persecuted minority. Pakistani Shiite Muslims gather to protest against a devastating bomb in Quetta and to demand protection . Young women join in the protest by Shiites, many of them Hazaras, against the way they are targeted by Sunnis . Around 4,000 Hazara women staged a sit-in protest in Quetta, blocking a road and refusing to move until action was taken against those behind the bombing that . killed 89 people. Local Shia leader Qayyum Changezi told journalists that the protesters 'will not bury the dead until a targeted operation is launched'. The Hazaras had carried the bodies of the blast victims to a local mosque but then began chanting and protesting instead of proceeding with the burials. Meanwhile, militants wearing suicide . vests and disguised as policemen attacked the office of a senior . political official in northwest Pakistan, killing six people, police . said. Pakistan has been besieged by militant attacks in recent years, many of them carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, who have been waging a bloody insurgency against the government. Pakistani Shiite Muslims gather around the coffins of bomb attack victims as they demonstrate in Quetta today . Thousands of Hazara women stood up to be counted in today's protests from a long-persecuted minority . Radical Sunni militant groups have also increasingly targeted the country's Shiites because they do not view them as 'real Muslims'. As a result, say the Shiites, they are living in fear. Many of these sectarian attacks have occurred in southwest Baluchistan province, which has the largest concentration of Shiites in Pakistan, many of them Hazaras, an ethnic group that migrated from Afghanistan over a century ago. The bomb that ripped through a food market on Saturday in Baluchistan's provincial capital of Quetta was the second mass-casualty attack targeting Shiites in the city in a little over a month. A double bombing of a billiards hall in January killed 86 people. A young Shiite Muslim holds a photo of a murdered relative while another asks for an end to the persecution . The death toll from the most recent blast, which was caused by a bomb hidden in a water tank, rose to 89 today after eight people died of their wounds, said Baluchistan's home secretary, Akbar Hussain Durrani. Outrage over the attacks has grown in Pakistan, and protests were held in over a half dozen other cities today. But it was unclear whether the demonstrations will be enough to get the action that will make the Shiites any safer. Rights groups have criticised the government for not doing enough to crack down on the attacks. They blame past connections between the country's military and anti-Shiite militants, and also allege the sectarian groups are seen as less of a threat than the Taliban because they are not targeting the state. Shiite Muslims mourn the death of a relative on the second day of protests after Saturday's devastating bomb . Despite this criticism, the Shiites in Quetta see the Pakistani army as their only potential saviour and are demanding the generals be given control of the city. They blame the provincial government and police for failing to protect them and want the army to take targeted action against sectarian militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which claimed responsibility for both the recent bombings in the city. Shiite leader Amin Shaheedi told journalists: 'We will not bury our martyrs until our demands are fulfilled.' An estimated 15,000 protestors poured into the streets near the attack site carrying signs and chanting slogans against terrorism. Saturday's bomb exploded in a market in Hazara town, an area dominated by Shiites on the outskirts of Quetta . Others remained inside a mosque beside the bodies of their relatives, which were covered with white sheets. One young girl wrote on her face, 'Don't kill me. I am Shia.' After the bombing in January that killed 86 people, Shiites camped out in the street for four days alongside the coffins of their loved ones. Eventually the country's prime minister ordered a shake-up in the regional administration, putting the local governor in charge of the whole province. But the governor has expressed frustration, saying the recent bombing was the result of a failure of the provincial security and intelligence services. Provincial home secretary Akbar Hussain Durrani said the government had no plans to call in the army and will continue to rely on the 3,000 members of the paramilitary Frontier Corps who are deployed in Quetta, as well as the police. Smoke rises above Quetta following the explosion in a food market there that has so far claimed 89 lives . People gather around the bodies of the victims of Saturday's blast that targeted Shiite Muslims . Today's most significant protests outside Quetta occurred in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, located on the country's southern coast. Hundreds of protesting Shiites paralysed key areas of the city by blocking major roads, including the one that leads to the airport. Violence in Karachi risked exacerbating sectarian tensions. Gunmen opened fire on a restaurant in the city, killing two people, said police spokesman Imran Shaukat. A spokesman for a Sunni extremist group, Ahle Sunnat Waljamaat, said two of its activists were killed in the attack. Members of the group clashed with police following the shooting, he said. In the eastern city of Lahore, gunmen on a motorcycle shot to death a Shiite doctor and his 12-year-old son, but it was unclear whether the attack was sectarian in nature, said senior police officer Malik Ovais. The agony of loss: A Pakistani man comforts another mourning for a relative killed in Saturday's bomb . The target of Monday's attack in the northwestern city of Peshawar was the office of the top political official for the Khyber tribal area, a major militant sanctuary in the country. The militants were disguised in the same type of uniform worn by the tribal policemen who protect the compound. At least five militants attacked policemen protecting the compound with assault rifles and hand grenades, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister for surrounding Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Some managed to slip inside the compound, and two blew themselves up. Officials are trying to determine what happened to the other attackers, he said. Six people were killed in the attack, including four tribal policemen and two civilians, said senior police officer Shafqat Malik. Thirteen people were wounded, including some who were inside an office that collapsed from the force of the explosions.","Estimated 15,000 Shiites protested over Saturday's bomb in a food market .

"Scam: Advertising for the so-called Raspberry Ketone Diet used fake endorsements from celebrities including singer Adele, pictured . An internet celebrity diet scam which uses fake endorsements from famous names such as Adele, Victoria Beckham and Lorraine Kelly is raking in millions of pounds. Even images of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have been used by rogues behind the so-called Raspberry Ketone Diet. Thousands of women in Britain and around the world have been duped by the scam, which is being promoted by paid for advertisements on Facebook. Consequently, Facebook itself is profiting from a rip-off that is using the power of celebrity to target thousands of women who are trying to lose weight. A number of company names are being used by the rogues behind the scam, including Slimzene, which apparently operates via an address in Scotland and has American owners. Images and comments from the celebrities appear on Facebook alongside links encouraging people to sign up for what appear to be free or cheap trials of supplements which make ludicrous and inconsistent claims about speeding metabolism and weight loss. However, customers, who are asked for bank direct debit details, then find they have signed up to pay around £80 a month for repeat supplies of the supplements. Many people find it extremely difficult to get through to the company to cancel the payments with the result it is making millions of pounds from victims of the scam. The Advertising Standards Authority( ASA) issues a ruling today banning internet ads for Slimzene which featured doctored images of Adele and a faked endorsement. The watchdog said: ‘A paid-for ad on Facebook for Slimzene showed a photograph of the singer Adele and stated ""Adele loses 27Kgs/month - See how Adele loses 27 Kgs/month  with one simple trick"".' No recommendation: The Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Victoria Beckham, right, were among 'celebrities' who were falsely said to have endorsed the product . Clicking on the ad linked to the home page of a website for fatshred.com, which carried what appeared to be a magazine style article about Adele’s weight loss and the effects of two weight loss products. The headline promised a new series called ‘Diet tips from the stars’ and information on how Adele had dropped four dress sizes. There were two faked before and after images of the singer. The article said she had recently put the Raspberry Ketone Diet to the test and quoted her saying: ‘I lost 32kgs in four weeks with No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise!’. It added: ‘We found the diet not only helped with weight loss and getting rid of belly fat, but it seemed to boost energy levels, and also helped Adele sleep better and to wake-up more rested.’ Legal advice: Lorraine Kelly told her twitter followers that her lawyers were looking into the company's claims that she had endorsed their product . Customers were then invited to order Slimzene and Pura Cleanse tablets under a free trial with reduced shipping charges. Further text on the web page carried the ludicrous claim that ‘Raspberry Ketone has been found to increase metabolism, boosting weight loss by 800 per cent’. In fact, Adele has nothing to do with Slimzene. The company also failed to defend or explain its claims when contacted by the ASA. The watchdog said Slimzene failed to show that Adele had used or endorsed the product, failed to prove that raspberry ketone could contribute to weight loss and failed to make clear what appeared to be an article about the singer was actually an advertisement. As a result, it ruled that the entire promotion was misleading and should be banned from the wed. This ban will rely on Facebook refusing to take these paid for advertisements. In December, the ASA upheld complaints about a similar internet ruse featuring images of the Duchess of Cambridge. Then a company calling itself SlimTonePlus, which also has an address in Scotland, was promoting a raspberry ketone diet supplement claiming Kate Middleton had lost 7kg in a week. A number of celebrities have signalled they are considering legal action against diet product companies that are using their names without permission and faking endorsements. The presenter of ITV Daybreak, Lorraine Kelly, has issued a warning via Twitter. She wrote: ‘This is nothing to do with me. Please ignore - lawyers on to it.’ Slimzene did not respond to a request for a comment.","Fake endorsements from a variety of celebrities were used to promote the Raspberry Ketone Diet .

David Pocock (centre) is pictured with Leard Blockade activists Cliff Wallace (left) and Rick Laird (right) It has been claimed that Australia's carbon emission will go up by nearly 10 per cent should the Whitehaven-owned mine go ahed. This is due to the fact that more than 4,000 hectares of forest would be cleared to make way for the mine. Each year, 13 million tonnes of coal will be taken from the ground and transported to Newcastle for export. According to 350.org, this cycle will continue for the next 30 years. Pocock's wife Emma also live tweeted her protest at the mine site. Pocock's wife Emma posted a photo to her Twitter account from a 'paddy wagon' She tweeted that she had been arrested six hours ago and posted a photo of her riding in a 'paddywagon' with her campaigning pal. 'Hey guys, I'm tweeting while under arrest. That's weird, right?,' her Twitter post said. She also tweeted that the protest was in it's eighth hour over two hours ago. Pocock has not tweeted since he posted a picture of campaign manager Rick Laird speaking to the media three hours ago. Laird has been protesting against the mine for the past 4 years. Speaking to the ABC, the young player said he hoped his presence at the protest would spike the interest in the younger generation in the environment. Pocock's wife live tweeted her arrest from the protest . 'This mine is about so much more than climate change,' he said. 'This is something that's beginning to impact the community, and will have far greater impacts in the future in terms of the water table, the health implications of living next to a coal mine. 'I would be doing this regardless of what career I had.' he said.

"Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Sunday that gun laws proposed after the 2012 Newtown school massacre in his state could have prevented deranged mass-murderer Elliot Rodger from taking six lives Friday night in Santa Barbara, California. But tourists in Washington, D.C. for Memorial Day told MailOnline that they aren't buying what Blumenthal is selling. The former Connecticut governor wants Congress to take a second bit at the apple after gun control legislation failed in the Senate. Senator Richard Blumenthal has kept the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in the front of Washington's minds, addressing participants of an annual 400-mile bike ride 'in support of common sense legislation to reduce gun violence' Sign advocating gun control have sprung up in Santa Barbara, California in the days since 20-year-old UCSB student Christopher Michael-Martinez and five others died in a shooting and stabbing rampage . 'The legislation that failed to pass – . it got support from 55 senators – would have provided a mental health . initiative with more resources, greater ability for the Santa Barbara . police to intervene, to use the sheriff's word, to have professionals . trained in diagnosing and detecting this kind of derangement,' he said on 'Face the Nation' 'Obviously, . not every kind of gun violence is going to be prevented by laws out of . Washington. But at least we can make a start, and I am going to urge . that we bring back those bills,' he told CBS News guest host Major Garrett. He added that a new approach might 'reconfigure them to center on . mental health, which is a point where we can agree that we need more . resources to make the country healthier and to make sure that these . kinds of horrific, insane, mad occurrences are stopped.' 'Congress . will be complicit if we fail to act,' Blumenthal insisted. The failed 2013 gun bills included provisions for bans on so-called 'asault' weapons, a maximum legal capacity for ammunition magazines, and an expanded background check system for prospective gun buyers. The handguns guns and ammunition found near Rodger's body on Friday night were all purchased legally. He had a long history of mental health disorders. and authorities had had three contacts with Rodgers in the past year, including an April 30 home visit at his family's request. But deputies reported back he was socially awkward but not in immediate need of mental health intervention. Those factors, under current law, were not sufficient to limit his legal access to firearms. Blumenthal has emerged as a major anti-gun legislator, pushing for new laws in his home state that are now some of the most restrictive in the country . Outpouring: Thousands of people marched through the UCSB campus on Saturday during a candlelight vigil for the victims . A renewed emphasis on mental-health qualifications for gun ownership, however, is the only feature of last year's legislative failure that could have made a difference. None of the Glock and Sig Sauer semiautomatic pistols Rodger used were covered by the proposed gun bans. None of his three guns used a nonstandard magazine. British-born student Elliot Rodger, 22 -- son of 'Hunger Games' film director Peter Rodger -- murdered six people in the Isla Vista district of Santa Barbara, California on Friday night . But members of the general public have been quick to point out that he also stabbed three people to death before his shooting rampage started. 'Sure, it's time for knife control,' said Charles Robinson, a Washington, D.C. visitor from Wisconsin who spoke to MailOnline on the National Mall in Washington. 'People are strangled with panty hose. Good luck convincing my wife it's time to ban those.' Kathy Nowitsky from Ohio, picnicking on a blanket near the Washington Monument, said that 'lunatics will be lunatics. You can't go creating a Nerf planet for everyone by putting government in charge, and it seems to me that the U.S. Constitution is there to make sure no one can try.' Blumenthal signaled his intent to renew talk of gun control measures, particularly those aimed at mental health requirements. The bill he supported last year, he said, would have given Sheriff's deputies more latitude to intervene. The lawmaker also said when he heard Richard Martines, the father of one of Friday night's casualties, blame 'craven politicians' and the National Rifle Association for his son's death, he heard echoes of Sandy Hook Elementary School parents. 'That gut-wrenching, heartbreaking statement is a reminder of how we felt in the wake of Sandy Hook on December 14 a year and a half ago,' Blumenthal said, 'when it seemed like we were on the verge of, potentially, legislation that would stop the madness and end the insanity that has killed too many young people – thousands, tens of thousands since Sandy Hook.'","Connecticut Sen. Richard Bumenthal said post-Sandy Hook gun bills in Congress would have given authorities more room to intervene .
But ordinary Americans in Washington, DC for Memorial Day said cynically that 'knife control' and bans on panty hose – used to strangle people – would come next .
'Lunatics will be lunatics,' said a tourist from Ohio: 'You can't go creating a Nerf planet for everyone by putting government in charge'
Blumenthal insisted Sunday that tighter mental health screening could have saved lives, but Republicans in the Senate blocked it in 2013 ."
"Socks are a Christmas stocking staple but while the majority of us are happy with plain old wool, for those who can afford it, FALKE have launched a £726 vicuña pair. The socks, which come with their own presentation box, are only available in golden-brown as the vicuña, an illama-like camelid that hails from Peru, produces wool so delicate that the dyeing process would damage it beyond repair. But those who want a pair will need to place their orders quickly, as just 10 pairs of the luxury socks have been made. Luxurious: The limited edition socks are made from vicuña wool which is quite literally worth its weight in gold . The socks are part of German hosiery specialist FALKE's autumn/winter collection, which also includes 20 limited edition pullovers, each worth approximately £2,015, created from the same fabric. The range, which offers a choice of roll or v-necklines, offers a luxury spin on the brand's mainline menswear collection, most of which crafted from merino wool, silk and cashmere. 'The fine wool and thermal properties communicate the uniqueness of the yarn,' explain the company in a description on the website. 'FALKE is the first clothing manufacturer producing socks made of this premium wool. Vicuña wool is the rarest and most expensive wool in the world, being softer, lighter and warmer than any other wool. 'Since the fibres are very delicate, the wool’s natural golden colour remains unchanged.' Expensive: The £726 socks come in a special presentation box and only 10 pairs of the footwear have been made . Endangered: Vicuñas, which live in the Andes and can only be shorn once every two years, are protected by law . The vicuña is a small endangered camelid that lives in the Peruvian Andes and produces some of the most expensive wool in the world. Related to the illama and the alpaca, the fineness of vicuña makes it stand out from that of its less expensive cousins. Additional value is created by its rarity - and its mountainous habitat. Just to make getting your hands on vicuña wool even more difficult, each animal can be shorn just once every two years under Peruvian law. Dubbed the world's most expensive fabric, vicuña wool is quite literally worth its weight in gold because of its rarity and the difficulty involved in obtaining it. Vicuñas, a relative of the illama and the ancestor of the alpaca, are the national animals of Peru and live high in the Andes mountains. Their wool is the finest of all animal-derived fibres, is just 12 micro-metres in diameter and cannot be dyed because it is so delicate. An endangered species, vicuñas cannot be domesticated, so all wool is taken from wild animals, which can only be caught and sheared once every two years. If that wasn't enough, each animal produced just one pound of wool each, making the wool rare as well as hard to get hold of. But for those who can afford to splash out £726 on a pair of socks, rarity is likely to be just as much of a reason to buy as keeping their feet warm.","Vicuña is the world's most expensive fabric and is worth its weight in gold .

"The Earth’s nitrogen-rich atmosphere made life possible, but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery. Now, scientists believe they have found the answer: that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes, also made the atmosphere habitable. Geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in Earth’s atmosphere three billion years ago. Tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and streams of lava from volcanoes (pictured) also made the atmosphere, a new study says. Geoscientists studied the chemistry of what goes on beneath volcanic rocks to work out how so much nitrogen was created . Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Carnegie Institution of Washington researchers explained that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis, as well as tectonic activity. While scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen, which makes up one fifth of the Earth’s atmosphere, the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery. The study explains that when a mass of land is  subducted – or dragged down below the continental crust – it releases volatile elements into the rock above. A subducted tectonic boundary is pictured . To investigate the problem, Dr Sami Mikhail and Professor Dimitri Sverjensky studied how nitrogen travels through rocks in the Earth’s crust, before being vented by volcanoes,The Conversation reported. Volcanoes spew large quantities of nitrogen into the air, as well as sulphur, steam and carbon dioxide. They say this happens because when a mass of land is subducted – or dragged down below the continental crust – it releases volatile elements into the rock above. These elements include nitrogen, which is either locked inside rock or released as a gas in an eruption. Dr Mikhail and Professor Sverjensky say that nitrogen in the Earth’s crust tends to form ammonium ions which are often incorporated into silicate minerals - rock-forming minerals that make up 90 percent of the Earth’s crust. The process is thought to have affected most of the nitrogen on Earth and almost all the nitrogen on Venus and Mars. On Earth, the silicate minerals react in the presence of oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds. When this happens, the ammonium molecules break down into water and nitrogen, which works its way to the Earth’s surface through volcanic vents. The researchers believe that this would explain why Earth’s atmosphere differs so much to Mars and Venus’. The alien planets have no plate tectonics and little nitrogen, which led to the evolution of plant and animal life on Earth. The study also adds weight to the theory that plate tectonics were already active on Earth before nitrogen started to build up in our atmosphere.

"The Disney Channel has pulled an episode of its popular children's show Jessie, after thousands of parents complained the storyline ridiculed young people with food allergies. During the May 17 installment titled Quitting Cold Koala, a nine-year-old character named Stuart Wooten stated that he could not eat plain flour pancakes because he was gluten-free. Instead of supporting his needs the rest of the cast made snide remarks and one child even threw pancakes in his face. Scroll down for video . Controversial: The Disney Channel has pulled an episode of its popular children's show Jessie, which ridiculed a nine-year-old gluten-free child . In response, one dismayed viewer launched a Change.org petition calling for Disney to 'stop bullying gluten-intolerant characters'. In just a few days it attracted 2,137 signatures. The online appeal was started by mother-of-two Amy Raslevich from Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Both her son Sam, eight, and daughter Laura, 11, were diagnosed with celiac disease 18 months ago. The digestive disorder triggered by consumption of the protein gluten, which is primarily found in foods such as bread and pasta, causes damage to the small intestine and stops the body from absorbing nutrients from food. Unpleasant symptoms include abdominal . pain, weight-loss, fatigue and diarrhea. There is no cure and the only . known effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet - meaning any . foods or products containing wheat, rye and barley should be avoided. 'We need to stress that being gluten-free is to keep our kids safe, it is not a ""trend"" or ""fad""' Mrs Raslevich said . that her children were distraught after watching the Jessie episode . which 'made fun of, humiliated and isolated' the gluten-free child. Expressing her outrage on her Change.org page she wrote: 'In the Jessie episode, a young boy was said to require a gluten-free diet. 'The other characters snickered at this requirement, and in fact . threw a pancake at the child, which could have actually triggered a . severe skin rash known as dermatitis herpetiformis. 'The boy was made to . be annoying, sniveling, and demanding, repeatedly teased and excluded by . the other children. Outrage: Amy Raslevich, pictured with husband Jeff Kelly, said that their children, Sam, eight, and Laura Kelly, 11, were distraught after watching the Jessie episode - both have celiac disease and eat a gluten-free diet . 'For my kids, this is real. They have . had friends make fun of their food, been disinvited to parties because . of their diet. 'They have been made to sit alone, have had waitstaff roll . their eyes and snidely comment about their requests to make their food . safe for them to eat.' Another mother, Viviana Cardona from Ossining, New York, was equally offended. She added: 'My son is gluten-free due to being ALLERGIC to gluten / wheat / oats / barley. 'I guarantee . if it was a peanut allergy, they wouldn't have had them throwing peanuts . at him' 'He is severely allergic and an exposure . is potentially fatal. This is my husband and my daily worry, that he . will be ""poisoned"" by a bully. 'We need to stress that being . gluten-free is to keep our kids safe, it is not a ""trend"", ""fad"" [but] a . means to keep our children safe.' A thread started on the website Reddit . also touched on the issue. One commentator simply stated: 'I guarantee . if it was a peanut allergy, they wouldn't have had them throwing peanuts . at him. This is ridiculous.' In response to the backlash, the Disney network has now pulled the episode from air. A statement on its official Facebook page posted last Friday read: 'To our viewers, we received your . feedback about tonight's 'Jessie' episode which some of you accessed . early on Video-on-Demand. Insensitive: At one point a cast member throws pancakes at the gluten-free child . 'We are removing this particular episode from our regular . programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten . restrictions in the character's diet. 'Please accept our apologies for . the upset this episode caused you and your family. We value your . feedback and thank you for watching Disney Channel.' A 2012 study estimated that around 1.8 million people in the U.S. have celiac disease, and 1.4 million may not even know about it. While gluten-free diets are necessary for people with celiac disease, they have also become a fad diet for some with about 1.6million excluding gluten from their diets for no medical reason. People who do not need to be on the strict diet may develop vitamin deficiencies and other side effects. Celiac disease is a digestive condition triggered by consumption of the protein gluten, which is primarily found in bread, pasta, cookies, pizza crust and many other foods containing wheat, barley or rye. People with celiac disease who eat foods containing gluten experience an immune reaction in their small intestines, causing damage to the inner surface of the small intestine and an inability to absorb certain nutrients. Celiac disease can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. Eventually, the decreased absorption of nutrients that occurs with celiac disease can cause vitamin deficiencies that deprive your brain, peripheral nervous system, bones, liver and other organs of vital nourishment. No treatment can cure celiac disease. However, sufferers can effectively manage the condition by changing their diet.

"Craig Kieswetter may discover this week whether his professional cricket career is likely to be ended by the eye injury he suffered last summer. Former England wicketkeeper Kieswetter suffered the damange to his eye socket batting for Somerset against Northamptonshire. He returned for his county towards the end of the season but, while playing in his native South Africa in early winter, he realised his vision was still impaired. Former England wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter is to discover the full extent of his eye socket injury . Kieswetter suffered damage to his eye socket while batting for Somerset against Northamptonshire last year . The 27-year-old has already ruled out any realistic prospect of playing next summer, and is due to discover a likely longer prognosis in an imminent consultation with a specialist. Somerset director of cricket Matthew Maynard spelled out that much may depend on Kieswetter's latest medical update. Kieswetter before he suffered the injury, playing for England in a one-day international with South Africa . Kieswetter in a picture posted on his Twitter account shortly after surgery last year . He told BBC Somerset: 'We're hoping that after he sees the specialist he'll have a method of getting his eye back to 100 per cent. 'The feedback we get from that will be quite instrumental, but potentially it could be career-ending. 'If we were to get him back that would be a huge lift for everyone. But we are planning for him to not be around this season.'","Former England wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter suffered damage to his eye socket batting for Somerset against Northamptonshire last year .

"Drug-driving motorists will be named and shamed on Twitter if they fail police ‘walk the line’ tests. Suspects are often asked to prove they are fit to be behind the wheel by carrying out tasks such as negotiating a straight line on foot or standing on one leg. Those who cannot do so and are later convicted can then expect to be publicly named and shamed online. Scroll down for video . Motorists who are caught driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be named and shamed on Twitter by police officers over the Christmas period (file image) The video or picture evidence of drivers could be posted on the internet within days of the offence. Courts are setting aside extra time to try to convict defendants within ten days of being stopped – enabling police to post footage as soon as the case has finished. As part of the joint campaign between police in Surrey and Sussex, officers have released a video of a driver high on the horse tranquilliser ketamine who was stopped a few days before Christmas last year. Jason Fray, 29, was ordered to prove he was fit to drive by walking in a straight line – but can clearly be seen weaving unsteadily as he tackles the task. The operation aims to crack down on all motoring offences in the run-up to Christmas and officers will also tweet details about when and where motorists are pulled over for both drink-drive and drug offences. Warning posters will be placed at the spot where drivers were arrested during last year’s campaign, while the public are being encouraged to text officers with details of anyone they suspect of drink or drug-driving. To raise awareness of their campaign the forces have released footage of Jason Fray, arrested last year . Sergeant Jane Derrick, the head of roads policing across Sussex and Surrey, said a ‘small minority’ of motorists refused to believe the law applied to them. Last December, 211 were arrested on suspicion of drink or drug-driving in Sussex. Just 135 have so far being convicted of offences. Another five are still going through the courts. In a move to tackle such delays and get rogue drivers off the roads quickly, extra time is being set aside at Crawley Magistrates’ Court in West Sussex to deal with those charged from tomorrow. It could result in charged motorists being banned from the roads within ten days of being caught, according to police. The footage shows Fray spectacularly failing a roadside test after being stopped in Billingshurst . Struggle: After being told to walk in a straight line by a female officer, 29-year-old Fray is seen missing it completely and has to steady himself before failing the task entirely . Drug use: Fray is seen shrugging his shoulders as if unaware of why he cannot perform the basic tasks before admitting he had been using horse tranquilliser ketamine . Sgt Derrick added: ‘There is often a delay of a matter of weeks between an individual being charged and them appearing in court. But these slots mean those charged with offences early in December could be dealt with by magistrates and banned from the roads in time for Christmas. ‘There is no excuse for driving while over the limit or after taking drugs but there remains a small minority who refuse to believe that the law applies to them.’ Fray, from Southwater in West Sussex, was convicted of being in charge of a vehicle while unfit through drugs and was banned from driving for four months, fined £250 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £25 victim surcharge.","Sussex and Surrey police officers will 'name and shame' those charged .

"Shake up: Theresa May is particularly worried that there are major variations between forces in the number of searches that end in arrests . Police are wasting hundreds of thousands of hours stopping and searching people who have done nothing wrong, Theresa May will warn today. In a statement to MPs, the Home Secretary will promise to restrict the use of controversial ‘sus’ laws. Mrs May fears that, as well as devouring huge amounts of police time, overuse of the powers is harming community relations, with young black men seven times more likely to be targeted than whites. Last year police conducted 1.2million . stops and searches but only 9 per cent – 107,000 – ended in arrest, . leaving more than a million ‘pointless’ sus checks. In . some parts of the country, the figure is as low as 3 per cent, raising . huge question marks over whether the power is being used properly. Mrs May will tell MPs that conducting a search, then filling in the paperwork afterwards, takes an average of 16 minutes. Last year 312,000 hours were consumed in this way – the equivalent of 145 full-time officers doing nothing else. The number of hours spent on stops and searches that did not end in arrest was almost 300,000. Mrs May says that, in many cases, this represents a ‘dreadful waste of time’. The . Home Secretary will stress that the Government has no intention of . scrapping the power altogether because it is a vital tool in the fight . against crime. In London, it led to the arrest of 45,000 suspected criminals last year, many of them carrying drugs, guns and other weapons. Crackdown: Theresa May will tell MPs that the use of controversial 'sus' laws must be restricted to improve the use of police time and community relations . But she is launching a two-month consultation on how to restrict its use in future. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, which has been reviewing stop and search, is to help formulate a new regime. Proposals will then be published later this year for a major shake-up of the law. Mrs May is particularly worried that there are major variations between forces. In Cumbria, only three in every 100 stops ends in an arrest. This compares to 19 per cent in Kent, 17 per cent in Northumbria and 16 per cent in Cleveland and Sussex. Officials believe it is possible to slash the number of searches and still continue to cut crime and protect the public. In London, the Met has improved training and set a target of at least one in every five searches ending in an arrest or drugs warning. This figure has almost been achieved. In . the borough of Hackney, the ratio was more than 26 per cent. The number . of searches in the capital is down from 500,000 to 350,000. Selective: Young black men are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by police officers than white people . There is significant concern in Whitehall that the power is being used too liberally, damaging community relations. A Home Office source said: ‘Stop and search is a really important power for the police in the fight against gangs, knife crime and drug offences. ‘But with only 9 per cent of the more than one million stop and search incidents leading to an arrest, and black and ethnic minority people up to seven times more likely to be searched than white people, we must face up to concerns about its use. ‘It needs to be used fairly, in a way that builds community confidence in the police rather than undermining it. 'And if it is being used too much or with the wrong people, then that is a dreadful waste of police time.’","Young black men are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than a white person .

"A former Australian prison employee is locked up in a New York jail accused of conspiring to sell large quantities of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine through the black-market internet bazaar, Silk Road. Peter Nash, 41, was extradited from Australia to the US last week and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in the American jail system if convicted. He is being held in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center ahead of an expected appearance in a Manhattan federal court this week. Scroll down for video . Peter Nash, 41, was extradited from Australia to the US last week accused of conspiring to sell large quantities of drugs through the black-market internet drug supermarket Silk Road . 'Silk Road was used by several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to well over a 100,000 buyers,' the indictment against Nash and two co-accused. New York's top federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, announced a year ago the unsealing of the indictment against Brisbane-based Nash and the two other alleged site administrators, Virginia's Andrew Jones, 25, and Ireland's Gary Davis, 26. Silk Road's alleged San Francisco-based owner and operator, Ross Ulbricht, known by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested on October 1 last year.

Nash, a former behavioural scientist at Queensland's Wacol Prison, was allegedly known on the site by aliases 'Batman73' and 'Samesamebutdifferent'. He was the primary moderator on the Silk Road site, sent Ulbricht a 'weekly report' of his work and was paid between $US50,000 and $US75,000 a year, according to prosecutors. As well as selling drugs and other illicit items, the Silk Road site provided the platform for the sale of computer hacking software, including 'password stealers, keyloggers and remote access tools'. Nash is charged with narcotics conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, if convicted. Nash was the primary moderator on the Silk Road site and was paid between $US50,000 and $US75,000 a year, according to prosecutors . He is also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking and one count of money laundering conspiracy. They carry maximum sentences of five and 20 years' prison respectively. Silk Road allegedly operated via the 'deep web', an area of the internet off limits to standard search engines, and involved a Tor hidden service designed to allow users to browse and buy items anonymously. US authorities shut the site down in 2013 when Ulbricht was arrested and another, known as Silk Road 2.0, came online soon after, but was also closed by authorities.

"It is one of the most famous lines in cinema history, but the legendary introduction, 'Bond... James Bond', might never have existed. An early draft from 1952 of Ian Fleming's first Bond book, Casino Royale, reveals the author had originally intended his hero to call himself James Secretan when on undercover operations. 'Ian's first idea was to give James Bond an assumed name as his cover,' revealed his niece Kate Grimond, whose family owns the draft. What's in a name? Author Ian Fleming (left) had originally intended his famous spy hero to call himself James Secretan in the first 007 book Casino Royale . 'Ian typed it up that way when he [Bond] first met Felix Leiter, the CIA agent, in the casino at the Hotel Splendide.' In the typed manuscript the CIA operative introduces himself to 007 with the words: 'My name's Felix Leiter. Glad to meet you.' Rare: Fleming's first draft of Casino Royale is owned by his niece . He replies with the disappointingly long-winded: 'Mine's Secretan. James Secretan.' But thankfully, Fleming later crossed out Secretan and handwrote the catchier 'Bond' above it, to make it simpler for his readers. Grimond said: 'Ian must have realised it would cause confusion if he had Bond known as Bond to friends and the security services in London, but as Secretan for his cover name to strangers or people he didn't want to know he was a spy.' The 'Bond... James Bond' line appeared a decade later in the first Bond film, Dr No. The hero spy, then played by Sean Connery, uses it to introduce himself to one of the women he later seduces. This draft extract from the novel was made public for the first time this weekend, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the publication of Casino Royale. Grimond believes that the name Secretan comes from the 19th Century Swiss philosopher, Charles Secrétan, who Fleming would have studied while at Eton College and when he went to universities in Germany and Switzerland. 'I've no proof but I do know Ian was interested in philosophy,' she said. 'He also often chose names from people he knew or had heard of — sometimes an amalgam of more than one person.' Cinema history: The 'Bond... James Bond line was first used on the silver screen by Sean Connery in Dr No . Leiter came from an American friend . called Marion Leiter. And James Bond itself is generally acknowledged to . derive from the the American ornithologist of the same name, who was an . expert on Caribbean birds. Fleming who was a keen birdwatcher himself, was known to draw on his own encounters and interests in his work. In the draft of Casino Royale, he initially called M's secretary in London 'Miss Pettavel' or 'Petty' for short. The name and character were based on Kathleen Pettigrew, personal assistant to Stewart Menzies, the then director-general of MI6. 'But Ian again had second thoughts and changed it to Miss Moneypenny,'  Grimond said. Inspiration: The name is thought to come from Charles Secrétan, who Fleming studied at Eton College . In another letter released to the public this weekend, Fleming complains to Jonathan Cape, the publisher of Casino Royale, that the suggested cover price is too low. He said in October 1952: 'I am not in favour of reducing the price of the book to 10/6d. 'Hardly a novel is published today under 12/6d, and I think it would be a mistake for your first thriller to seem to be given away.' He added: 'Moreover it [the lower price] would whittle down still further my already meagre financial expectations from the book.' Fleming lost the battle: the price stayed at 10/6d.","1952 Casino Royale draft has been revealed by Fleming's niece .

"A man who spent two years in solitary confinement after being arrested for drunk driving has finally received a $15million settlement, one of the largest federal civil rights awards in history involving an inmate. Stephen Slevin, 58, from New Mexico, sued after Dona Ana County . jail essentially forgot about him between 2005 and 2007 following his arrest for . driving while intoxicated. During his incarceration, Slevin was forced to pull out his own tooth because he was denied dental care by guards and developed bedsores. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Stephen Slevin, pictured left near the time of his release, was held in solitary confinement for two years in New Mexico and forced to pull out his own tooth. He looked remarkably different in August 2005,  at the time of his arrest for drunken driving . He had originally been in line for $22million for the violation of his constitutional rights last January but Dona Ana county appealed the verdict. Mr Slevin's civil rights attorney Matt Coyte told NBC on Wednesday: 'His mental health has been severely compromised from the time he was in that facility. 'That continues to be the same. No amount of money will bring back what they took away from him.' Mr Coyte said that his client had shown great courage throughout the trial. Mr Slevin, who is battling lung cancer, is to receive $6million this week and the rest of the money will come in installments. At his original trial last year in Santa Fe, Mr Slevin said it was never about the money for him but more about sending a message that prisoners should be treated more humanely. He suffers from Post Traumatic . Stress Disorder stemming from what he says was physical and mental . mistreatment by corrections officials. Justice: Stephen Slevin, pictured in 2012, said it was never about the money for him but more about making a statement that it was not acceptable to treat prisoners in this way . Mr Slevin was arrested in . August 2005 and charged with driving while intoxicated and receiving a . stolen vehicle near Las Cruces. His lawyer said that, due to his history of mental illness, he was placed into solitary confinement. Mr Coyte revealed it was here that his client started to deteriorated. He said: 'They threw him in solitary and . then ignored him. 'He disappeared into delirium, and his mental illness . was made worse by being isolated from human contact and a lack of . medical care.' While Mr Slevin was in solitary . confinement, his toenails grew so long they began to curl around his . feet, he developed bedsores, fungus and dental problems and lost a lot . of weight, according to the lawsuit. He was eventually released after 22 months as a pre-trial detainee and the charges against him were dismissed. It was upon his release that he filed . the lawsuit, claiming his rights of due process were violated since he . was not given a hearing before being placed in solitary confinement.

"Born five weeks premature, twins Amelie and Ava only just made it into this world after being resuscitated with oxygen. But they’re not the only ones who are lucky to be alive. Their mother Angela Cottam almost died after a suspected fingernail or hair from one of them passed into her bloodstream during their birth. Lucky to be alive: Angela Cottam with Amelie and Ava who were born five weeks premature. Mrs Cottam almost died after a suspected fingernail or hair from one of them passed into her bloodstream . The rare condition – which affects only one in 80,000 births – caused 32-year-old Mrs Cottam to suffer severe internal bleeding and her lungs collapsed. The primary school teacher lost seven pints of blood, needed 22 transfusions and spent 12 hours in a coma, when her family was told she might not pull through. Mrs Cottam, who is married to Peter, 33, said: ‘I feel so lucky to be here and really blessed that both the girls are with us because it could have been so different. ‘There are moments when I’ve been on my own and I’ve had a little cry and thought “What if?” But I try not to dwell on that and just thank my lucky stars the doctors and midwives on duty that day recognised what was happening. A rare condition, which affects only one in 80,000 births, caused Mrs Cottam to suffer severe internal bleeding and her lungs collapsed . ‘Knowing that I almost died has changed my perspective on life, I’m more laid back and I am enjoying being a mum more than ever because I know we were so close to losing so much.’ Mrs Cottam, who also has a four-year-old daughter Olivia with her husband, was admitted to the Countess of Chester Hospital suffering from pre-eclampsia – the potentially fatal condition which causes high blood pressure and swelling in pregnancy. Doctors decided the babies, now aged eight months, needed to be born before the condition worsened, so Mrs Cottam was induced. The labour was progressing normally and Mrs Cottam asked for an epidural. But shortly afterwards a midwife became concerned that Mrs Cottam was coughing and struggling for breath. Medics realised Mrs Cottam’s lungs were collapsing because she was suffering a rare complication, known as an amniotic fluid embolism, where fluid from the sac surrounding the babies leaks into the mother’s bloodstream through blood vessels in the womb. Cells – such as a fingernail or hair – from the unborn children, that were in the fluid, travelled to her lungs, prompting a severe allergic reaction. Doctors immediately began giving Mrs Cottam oxygen and rushed her to theatre for a caesarean section to try to save the babies. Happy family: Mrs Cottom with her husband Peter, four-year-old daughter Olivia and twins Amelie and Ava . Amelie was the first to be born, weighing 4lb 2oz, followed by Ava, weighing 4lb 10oz a minute later. ‘Ava was very, very touch and go,’ said Mrs Cottam. ‘They told us afterwards she was three minutes without oxygen and they really had to work on her to resuscitate her.’ After successfully delivering the girls, however, medics realised Mrs Cottam was haemorrhaging because her blood had lost the ability to clot. She was given 22 blood transfusions and it wasn’t until three hours later, at around 2am, that doctors managed to stabilise her. Mrs Cottam was taken to intensive care in a coma and placed on a life-support machine. Doctors told her husband, a technical manager, that she could be in a coma for days or even weeks. Fortunately, however, Mrs Cottam, of Flintshire, Wales, woke up around 12 hours later. She managed to hold the twins for the first time a day later and was well enough to go home the following week. The twins spent a fortnight in hospital and haven’t suffered any lasting effects. Dr Usha Rao, the consultant obstetrician who treated Mrs Cottam, said: ‘Amniotic fluid embolism is a unique, catastrophic condition. ‘Although we know it is more likely to occur in twin pregnancies or women who have their labour induced, they are not the direct cause. It is unpredictable, unpreventable and very rare.’","Angela Cottom almost died after a nail or hair passed into her bloodstream .
