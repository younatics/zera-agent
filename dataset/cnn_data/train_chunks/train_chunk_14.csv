"(CNN) -- British author J.G. Ballard, whose boyhood experience in a World War II internment camp became the novel and film ""Empire of the Sun,"" died Sunday at age 78, his literary agent said. He had suffered from cancer for several years. Ballard's semi-autobiographical ""Empire of the Sun"" was made into a movie by Steven Spielberg. ""J.G. Ballard has been a giant on the world literary scene for more than 50 years,"" Margaret Hanbury said Monday. ""His acute and visionary observation of contemporary life was distilled into a number of brilliant, powerful novels, which have been published all over the world."" Ballard was born in a Western enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai in 1930. The Japanese occupied the city in 1937, and Ballard and his family were placed in a civilian internment camp in 1943. He began writing science fiction in the 1950s, with his work taking on a strongly psychological, apocalyptic bent in later decades. But, ""Empire of the Sun,"" his semi-autobiographical account of the war years, became his best-known work, and it was made into a film by director Steven Spielberg in 1988. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg adapted another of Ballard's novels, ""Crash,"" in 1996. Its plot -- people sexually aroused by car accidents -- drew the novel an initial reaction of ""beyond psychiatric help"" from his publisher and an adults-only rating for the film.","Celebrated author J.G.

"(CNN) -- Five Filipino soldiers were killed and 24 others wounded during an overnight gun battle with a faction of a Muslim separatist group in the Philippines' southern region, a military spokesman said. Filipino soldiers check weapons captured from Moro Islamic Liberation Front militants in November. The fighting in Basilan province broke out after ongoing peace negotiations with rogue members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) hit an impasse, said Maj. Ramon Zagala. Early reports indicated the fighters were from a rogue faction of the front, but the military later identified them as members of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, which has been linked to the al Qaeda terrorist network, Zagala said. Abu Sayyaf members were seeking refuge in MILF-controlled towns, drawing a military response, Zagala said. The militants retaliated Sunday with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, he said. The splinter group originally believed to have been involved in the firefight, the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces, issued a statement accusing Filipino troops of using artillery and ""indiscriminately"" launched airstrikes.The statement, posted Monday on a pro-Moro Website, included no report of casualties. The government of the Philippines has been involved in peace negotiations with Moro Islamic Liberation Front since 2003. CNN's Tess Eastment contributed to this report.","NEW: Abu Sayyaf members drew military response, military spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The pilot who made a treacherous crash-landing on New York's Hudson River look like a routine maneuver got a hero's welcome Saturday in his California hometown. Chesley B. Sullenberger was honored Saturday with a celebration in his hometown of Danville, California. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger put his US Airways jetliner down on the Hudson minutes after both engines failed, then walked the length of the drifting Airbus A320 twice to make certain that all 155 people on board got off safely. He was greeted by several thousand cheering people gathered around the town square in Danville, California, for a celebration in his honor. Mayor Newell Arnerich presented Sullenberger with a ceremonial key to the city, an upscale suburb near San Francisco. Sullenberger, who has avoided public comment since the January 15 incident, made very brief remarks. He thanked the crowd for an ""incredible outpouring of support."" ""Circumstance determined that it was this experienced crew that was scheduled to fly on that particular flight on that particular day,"" Sullenberger said. ""But I know I can speak for the entire crew when I tell you we were simply doing the jobs we were trained to do. Thank you.""  Watch Sullenberger address the crowd » . Sullenberger's wife, Lorrie, fought back tears as she spoke of her husband. ""I have always known him to be an exemplary pilot. I knew what the outcome would be that day, because I knew my husband,"" she said. ""Mostly for me, he's the man that makes my cup of tea every morning."" Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board continue to piece together details from the double engine failure that hit the plane after it took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport for Charlotte, North Carolina. The jet's left engine, which apparently tore away from the plane on landing impact, was raised from the bottom of the Hudson on Friday. Sullenberger reported to air controllers that his plane had hit birds shortly before both engines shut down. On Saturday, the NTSB said a preliminary examination of the left engine found evidence of ""soft body impact damage,"" the same kind of damage reported on the right engine. An NTSB spokesman said that there was no evidence of organic material such as a dead bird in the left engine but that was not surprising because the engine had been under water for a week. Although the NTSB has not officially confirmed reports of a bird strike, the agency's findings and statements have not done anything to discount the bird-strike reports. Both engines will be shipped to the manufacturer in Ohio, where NTSB investigators will tear them down completely for examination.","NEW: Left engine shows evidence of ""soft body impact damage,"" NTSB says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Senior North Korean officials say the communist regime has ""weaponized"" its stockpile of plutonium, according to a U.S. scholar, in a move suggesting that North Korea may have significantly hardened its stance on nuclear negotiations. Selig Harrison said North Korean officials claimed to have enough plutonium for four or five warheads. Selig Harrison, one of the few U.S. scholars granted access to senior North Korean officials, said at a news conference in Beijing that the officials told him they had weaponized 30.8 kilograms of plutonium, enough for four or five warheads. The director of the Asia Program at the Center for International Policy, who just returned from a five-day visit to Pyongyang, said senior North Korean officials told him the warheads will not be open for inspection. If it is true, the news portends a gloomy outlook for the future of the six-party talks that began in 2003 with the goal of getting North Korea to end its nuclear program. ""It does change the game,"" Harrison said. South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia are participating in the talks. A 2007 agreement calls for scrapping nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula in return for energy aid to the North, normalized relations between the North and the United States and Japan, and a formal peace pact.  Watch a report on North Korea's nuclear negotiations » . The North Koreans told Harrison they want the rest of the fuel aid that Japan has promised them. North Korea had agreed to disable the reactor that had produced plutonium for nuclear weapons. But the United States and its allies have asked it to give up the plutonium it already has, an estimated 30 kilograms, as well as details of any other bomb-producing programs. Harrison said one possible reason for Pyongyang's tough new stance could be the declining health of leader Kim Jong Il, who reportedly suffered a stroke last year and may no longer be involved in day-to-day decisions. ""People I talked to have many indications that some important things are submitted to him, but he is not working in the way he used to,"" Harrison said. He said military hard-liners have taken the lead in demanding from the United States a full declaration and verification of all nuclear weapons sent to South Korea between 1957 and 1991. The hard-liners also seek full normalization of relations with Washington before more talks about scrapping their nuclear arsenal. On Tuesday, during her Senate confirmation hearing for the secretary of state position, Sen. Hillary Clinton made it clear: de-nuclearization first, then diplomatic normalization. President-elect Barack Obama has stated his willingness to talk to the North Korean leader. Harrison also said the North demanded the completion of the light-water reactors as compensation for the dismantling of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. The light-water reactor, which is not capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, was promised to North Korea in the early 1990s for the North giving up its nuclear weapons. Its construction has been suspended. North Korea has long considered its nuclear program integral to its national security. North Korea tested a nuclear weapon in 2006. In June, it acknowledged producing about 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium. CNN's John Vause contributed to this report.","News may bode ill for future of talks to end North Korean nuclear program .

"(CNN)  -- Ukraine's Security Service launched a raid on the country's state-run gas company Wednesday, searching for documents related to a gas deal with Russia, a spokesman for the company said. Ukrainian security service agents let employees leave a room at Naftogaz's headquarters. A group of about 30 gunmen wearing masks and carrying machine guns entered the offices of Naftogaz and took control of every floor of the company's building in the capital of Kiev, Naftogaz spokesman Valentyn Zemlyansky said. Operatives from the security service then began a search for various company documents, including those pertaining to the Russia-Ukraine gas deal signed in January to end a weeks-long gas dispute, Zemlyansky told journalists, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. The Security Service opened a criminal case on Monday into alleged misappropriation of 6.3 billion cubic meters of transit gas worth over 7.4 billion hryvnia ($880 million) by a group of Naftogaz officers, Interfax reported. Taras Shepitko, a deputy chief of an Energy Regional Customs division under the State Customs Service, was detained as part of the case. Ukrainian Security Service operatives confirmed to Interfax that the operation was related to that criminal case. The armed troops were there simply to protect the investigators, the service told Interfax, citing attempts to hinder the investigation. Naftogaz called police when the armed men stormed in but the police retreated soon after they arrived, Zemlyansky said.

"(CNN) -- Every time her cell phone rings, Christy Harness thinks of her husband. More consumers download ringtones to their cell phones than  full-length songs. The 34-year-old native of Jackson County, Georgia, set her ringtone to Sugarland's ""All I Wanna Do,"" a song that, she says, perfectly expresses the way she feels about him. ""I kind of put myself in [the singer's] place because ... she's in love with this guy. If he's not around, she misses him. Basically, I think the song relates to me and [my husband] and our relationship,"" Harness said. These days, ringtones do much more than alert mobile phone users of a call. Ringtones seem to have become vital fashion statements, a way for people to showcase their personalities and even their feelings about who is calling. According to a 2008 study by Ipsos MediaCT, a marketing research company, approximately one-third of mobile phone users download ringtones, and about 40 percent of users change their ringtones frequently. Ipsos research shows that ringtones are the most common type of mobile music content downloaded by users, compared to full-length songs and ringback tones, tones that replace the typical ringing signal heard by the caller. ""I find regular ringtones kind of dull, so I wanted something exciting,"" said Gordy King, a 51-year-old from Salt Lake City, Utah. King said he gets a kick out of annoying his mostly Republican co-workers with his Barack Obama ringtones, even playing them over the intercom at the electrical supply warehouse where he works. ""It's fake news people saying 'Barack Obama has won the election,' "" he said. ""I really like Barack Obama. I think [my ringtone] probably says that I'm nonconventional and it says I lean a little more liberal. I don't know anyone else who has that ringtone."" Using a ringtone creator application on Facebook, King said he also makes his own ringtones by downloading sound files onto his computer and editing them to be shorter and louder or softer. Donald Kaplan found a perfect fit with his ringtone choice. Kaplan, of New York, changed his ringtones often before finally settling on the theme song from ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" ""I'm thinking of sticking with it. I notice that when people hear my phone ring they get amused ... I think that people really connect with that movie,"" Kaplan said. But that's not always the case. Kaplan said one of his co-workers wasn't exactly pleased with the ringtone. The co-worker sent a mass e-mail to the office, telling everyone to keep their cell phones on silent. ""The ringtone drove him crazy and he tried to be tactful but I knew that [the e-mail] was directed specifically to me,"" Kaplan said. ""I could tell that this particular ringtone just drove him up the wall ... just the repetition of the sound."" For some, one ringtone simply isn't enough. Many mobile phone users set specific tones to specific people so that the tones act as audible caller IDs. ""I group people,"" said Natasha Khan, a 26-year-old from McLean, Virginia. ""I group all my best girlfriends together, the people I don't want to talk to together, work contacts together, and family together."" Khan said when her best friends call she hears ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,"" by Cyndi Lauper, and when she gets a call from people she doesn't particularly like, her phone rings ""Bugaboo"" by Destiny's Child. ""Bugaboo,"" about a woman irritated by a male caller, contains such lines as, ""It's not hot that you be callin' me."" ""The 'Bugaboo' ringtone has gotten me in trouble,"" Khan said with a laugh. ""This guy -- I forgot that he was on that list and I told him I needed his number and he said, 'Oh, I'll call you' and he realized he was on the list."" Customizing a phone with multiple ringtones can be expensive. Depending on the wireless carrier or the service plan, ringtones cost anywhere from $0.99 to $2.99. That may not deter cell phone users. Analysts at Screen Digest, a UK-based firm covering global media markets, predicted that mobile music sales will double from $1.6 billion in 2008 to $3.2 billion in 2012. But there are also free ways to get ringtones, like the ringtone creator application on Facebook -- one of several ringtone applications on the social-networking Web site -- that make setting ringtones all the more appealing. ""The ringtone creator was fun,"" said King. ""No matter how big or little the song or sound effect ... you could select a snippet and edit it."" Many mobile phone users like to be creative and have fun with their ringtones, and their ringtone choice can reveal much about their personalities. Khan's default ringtone, she said, is typically an upbeat dance song like her current one, ""Forever"" by Chris Brown. ""I think the day can be so mundane and work can bog you down, so I like any chance I can get to get some joy,"" Khan said. ""It's just a break in the day to feel good randomly.""","Ringtones are one way for people to showcase their personalities and feelings .

"(CNN) -- Muzak, the company that put pop, string-filled arrangements of rock songs in your elevator, filed bankruptcy papers Tuesday after it missed a $105 million payment to creditors. The Muzak company is best known for background music piped into places such as elevators. The pipeline of easy listening will continue to flow as Muzak restructures its debt during the Chapter 11 process, the company said. ""Muzak is a solid business with an outstanding customer base, but we are burdened with substantial debt obligations established over a decade ago,"" Muzak CEO Stephen Villa said. Muzak's cash flows doubled in the last three years, Villa said, ""demonstrating that our business continues to perform well even in today's challenging environment."" Along with its ubiquitous elevator offerings, Muzak and its 14 affiliates -- all privately owned -- produce on-hold messages and install sound systems, digital signs and drive-thru systems for retail businesses. Bankruptcy documents showed Muzak owes its largest creditor -- U.S. Bank, as indentured trustee -- about $370 million, nearly all of it due this year. Muzak spokeswoman Meaghan Repko said the filing was voluntary and in cooperation with the creditors. The weakened global economy was not a factor, she said, noting the company's profits have been rising in recent years. The Chapter 11 protections will allow Muzak time to restructure the debt, which was incurred a decade ago, she said.","Muzak creates musical material often called ""elevator music""

"(CNN) -- Jon Opsahl said he doesn't think domestic terrorist-turned-housewife Sara Jane Olson served nearly enough time for his mother's murder, but he's relieved the saga ended with Olson's Tuesday release from prison. Sara Jane Olson was released from a California prison Tuesday after serving seven years. Olson, a member of the self-styled revolutionary Symbionese Liberation Army -- perhaps best known for kidnapping Patricia Hearst -- was released from a California prison after serving seven years, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. She was released to her husband just after midnight and is expected to serve her yearlong parole term in Minnesota -- over the the objections of police unions and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Her sentence stems from her involvement in the 1975 attempted bombings of two police cars and the slaying of Myrna Opsahl during a bank robbery that same year. Back then, Olson went by her birth name, Kathleen Anne Soliah. After her 1976 indictment in the attempted bombings, she changed her name and started a new life in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was not apprehended until 1999. ""I've really got nothing to say. She did her time, as minimal as that may have been,"" said Jon Opsahl, who was 15 when his mother was killed. ""One of those years -- just one -- was for the murder of my mom and the bank robbery up in Carmichael."" Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four, was depositing money at the Crocker National Bank for her church when she was shot by Olson's co-defendant Emily Montague Harris, according to court documents. Harris was sentenced to eight years; she served four and was released on parole in February 2007. Jon Opsahl, now 49, said he never understood why it took so long to bring his mother's killers to justice. While charges were filed in the bombings within months, no charges were brought in his mother's murder until 2002. ""You expect thugs to do what thugs do, but you don't expect the district attorney to turn a blind eye to the murder of an upstanding citizen,"" Jon Opsahl said Monday. Olson's release Tuesday will cap an oft-strange storyline that spans more than three decades and which saw Olson wear the hats of college student, 1970s radical, housewife and philanthropist. Attorney Andy Dawkins met Olson, now 62, shortly after she moved to St. Paul through friends in the reggae band, Pressure Drop. Fred Peterson, Olson's husband, played trumpet in the band, Dawkins said. ""She did good deeds everywhere. She raised three wonderful daughters. It was always a shock to all of us that the Sara we know had that past,"" Dawkins said. After attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, Olson moved to Berkeley in the early 1970s. There, she met Angela Atwood in 1972, and the two became best friends and roommates, Olson told L.A. Weekly in a 2002 interview shortly before she was imprisoned. After Atwood and five other SLA members were killed in a 1974 gunfight with the Los Angeles Police Department, Olson appeared at a memorial in Berkeley's Ho Chi Minh Park to eulogize her friend. ""SLA soldiers, although I know it's not necessary to say, keep fighting. I'm with you, and we are with you,"" Olson told the crowd. Almost a year later, Olson took part in two bank robberies to help fund the SLA, according to court documents. During the Carmichael robbery, Olson ""entered the bank with a firearm and kicked a nonresisting pregnant teller in the stomach. The teller miscarried after the robbery,"" the documents said. In August 1975, Los Angeles police found homemade bombs under two squad cars. They were designed to explode when the car moved, but neither device detonated. Authorities cast the attempted bombings as payback for the bloody shootout that left Atwood and other SLA members dead. A probe into the gunbattle helped police arrest Hearst, the granddaughter of publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst, who claimed she had been kidnapped, raped and brainwashed by the SLA. In her book ""Every Secret Thing,"" Hearst put Olson at the center of the Carmichael robbery. Olson soon left California. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ""she evaded capture for 23 years, and in the meantime, became a doctor's wife, mother of three, community volunteer, veteran of charity work in Africa and practicing Methodist living in an upscale neighborhood in St. Paul."" Though authorities said a 1999 ""America's Most Wanted"" episode marking the 25th anniversary of the L.A. shootout led to Olson's arrest, the show's Web site mentions neither Olson nor Soliah among its almost 1,100 ""captures."" Her Minnesota friends and neighbors were shocked, even incredulous, when she was arrested. They pleaded with a judge to grant her bail. The Sara Olson Defense Fund began selling cookbooks, titled, ""Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes."" It would help that Olson was generous with her time. She was active in the church. She volunteered for political campaigns. Dawkins said he had a blind client to whom she used to read The New York Times. Olson's philanthropy, coupled with the connections of her husband, a respected emergency room doctor, made raising the $1 million bail relatively easy, said Dawkins, who remembers that some members of the community had so much faith in Olson they put up their children's college funds. On October 31, 2001, Olson pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to ignite a destructive device or explosive. She later tried to rescind the plea, saying ""cowardice"" prevented her from telling the truth. A superior court judge, however, denied her request and in January 2002 sentenced her to 20 years to life in prison, a sentence the parole board later reduced. Olson was charged with Opsahl's slaying that same week and pleaded guilty in 2003 to second-degree murder. Olson received a sentence of five years to life. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement that Olson's sentence was reduced for good behavior and for her work on a maintenance crew that cleaned the main yard of the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Dawkins said ""it's right"" that Olson served time, but he is glad she is being released. He expects many hugs await her in St. Paul and that she will soon be back to her generous ways. ""I really believe who we knew in St. Paul was the true Sara Olson,"" he said. The Los Angeles Police Protection League disagrees and has loudly opposed her early release. Sgt. Paul Weber, the league's chief, called her a sociopath who ""never said she was sorry."" He also lashed out at those who rush to defend her. ""Enough with the BS that she was unfairly targeted by law enforcement for her youthful indiscretions -- she is a criminal,"" Weber said in a Monday statement. Corrections officials say it's important that she be reunited with her family during her parole -- it helps reduce recidivism -- but Minnesota legislators, the governor and the St. Paul Police Federation have asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep her in California over the next year. ""Letting a domestic terrorist like Kathleen Soliah set the terms of her parole is an insult to the memory of Myrna Opsahl and all the men and women of LAPD past and present,"" the St. Paul union said in a letter last week. Jon Opsahl, however, just wants to put Olson out of his mind. ""Get her out of here,"" he said. ""I don't want to see or think about her again.""","NEW: Governor, police unions oppose Olson serving parole in Minnesota .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sky News, the British-based 24-hour news broadcaster, will not show a controversial appeal for aid for the people of Gaza, it announced Monday. Protesters demonstrate in London Sunday against the BBC's decision not to show Gaza aid appeal. Sky News joins the BBC in refusing to show the appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella group of 13 leading British aid agencies. The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, has been criticized by politicians and religious leaders for refusing to show the appeal, which launches Monday. There have been demonstrations against the decision at BBC buildings in England and Scotland. Sky News said airing the appeal would compromise its reputation for fairness. Do you agree with the decision? Send your comments . ""Broadcasting an appeal for Gaza at this time is incompatible with our role in providing balanced and objective reporting of this continuing situation to our audiences in the UK and around the world,"" John Ryley, the head of Sky News, said Monday in a statement on the company's Web site. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) includes the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children and 10 other charities. British broadcasters, led by the BBC, originally declined to air the Gaza appeal, but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds. CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad, a DEC spokesman said. About 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London on Saturday over the broadcaster's stance. Seven people were arrested. About 50 people protested at its Glasgow headquarters Sunday. The corporation received about 1,000 phone calls and 10,000 e-mails of complaint in the three days after it announced its decision Thursday. But the BBC is sticking with its position, director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation's Web site. ""We concluded that we could not broadcast a free-standing appeal, no matter how carefully constructed, without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story,"" he wrote Saturday. ""Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations. The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story,"" he wrote. ""Gaza remains a major ongoing news story, in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict, the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious,"" he added. The BBC, which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television, is required by its charter to be impartial. The DEC is ""disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal,"" a spokesman told CNN. ""It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public."" The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality. ""That is a decision they must make. We have no view on that subject,"" he said. Many readers of Thompson's blog post did have a view, however. The statement received hundreds of comments, most of them critical of the BBC. A commenter who signed in as bully--baiter said the BBC was taking a side no matter what it did. ""Sorry Mr. Thompson but you cannot have it both ways. If deciding to accede to the DEC request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political. Don't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise,"" the commenter wrote. Other commenters simply rejected Thompson's position out of hand. ""I think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding,"" brit--proud wrote. ""How can simply bringing food, medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality? How stupid do the BBC think the British public are?"" The corporation had its defenders as well. ""The last thing I want to do, is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda,"" SternG wrote: ""There's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC's politically-motivated 'appeal' for Gaza. Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group, including by the EU. There is no doubt that some aid/fund will be 'procured' by Hamas.... Good decision BBC."" British broadcasters have refused to air some previous DEC appeals, the umbrella organization's spokesman said. A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because ""there were genuine concerns, shared by the aid agencies, about the deliverability of aid."" Thompson cited doubts about whether DEC members could get aid to Gaza as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad.","Sky News said airing the appeal would compromise its reputation for fairness .

"GAZA CITY (CNN) -- Israel bombed a Hamas government compound early Tuesday, leveling at least three structures, including the foreign ministry building, eyewitnesses and Hamas security sources told CNN. Relatives mourn three boys from the same family who were killed in an Israeli airstrike Monday in Gaza. A Gaza-based journalist, whose name was withheld for security reasons, told CNN he heard 18 blasts in the area and that two fires were burning at the compound early Tuesday. More bombs continued to drop over Gaza through the morning.  With Tuesday's bombs, Israel appeared to extend its airstrike campaign in Gaza to a fourth day. The strikes -- which Israel says are aimed at stopping the firing of rockets from Gaza into southern Israel -- have killed more than 375 Palestinians, most of them Hamas militants, Palestinian medical sources said Tuesday. At least 60 civilians have been killed in Gaza, U.N. officials said. About 650 people have been wounded there, according to the Palestinian medical sources. Monday, Israel's defense minister said the nation was in an ""all-out war"" with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. ""We have stretched our hand in peace many times to the Palestinian people. We have nothing against the people of Gaza,"" Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israel's parliament. ""But this is an all-out war against Hamas and its branches."" Israel continues to strike Hamas targets in Gaza, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN. Mortar fire along the Gaza border late Monday killed one Israeli soldier and wounded four others, he said. Earlier Monday, columns of smoke rose over Gaza City as warplanes carried out strikes. Though there was no indication of an Israeli military ground operation in Gaza, Israeli tanks cruised along the territory's edges.  Watch rocket fire force a reporter to take cover » . Iyad Nasr, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the streets of Gaza were largely empty during airstrikes Monday morning. Despite the airstrikes, militants fired  more than 40 rockets and mortar shells into Israel on Monday, according to Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld. More than 150 rockets have been launched into Israeli territory since the campaign began, Israel Defense Forces said.  Watch damage in Sderot » . Six Israelis have died over the past three days, five of them civilians.

Rocket strikes killed an Israeli and wounded two others at Kibbutz Nahal Oz, according to Israeli police and hospital spokespersons. Rocket attacks also wounded two people, one seriously, in Ashdod. One woman who was critically injured during the attack died later during an operation, according to Israeli medical sources. The White House on Monday called on Hamas to halt rocket fire against Israel, so calm can be restored in Gaza.  Watch the White House blame Hamas » . Israel has struck more than 300 Hamas targets since Saturday, its military said. The Israeli air force carried out at least 20 airstrikes on Gaza on Monday, Israeli military sources said. Hamas security sources said the targets included the homes of two commanders of Hamas' military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, in the Jabalya refugee camp just north of Gaza City. Neither commander was among the seven people killed in those strikes, the sources said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on a report by Dr. Mu'awiya Hassanein that a strike near a mosque in Jabalya killed five children in a nearby home. The situation triggered protests in Iran, Greece, Britain and Lebanon, and the Iranian government declared a day of mourning for Palestinians in Gaza. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei urged the world's Muslim populations to unite against Israel's attacks on Hamas in Gaza.  Watch a demonstration in London » . ""All true believers in the world of Islam and Palestinian fighters are duty-bound to defend the defenseless women and children in Gaza Strip and those giving their lives in carrying out such a divine duty are 'martyrs,' "" Khamenei said through Iran's official news agency IRNA. U.S. and Israeli officials told CNN that Hamas militants in Gaza have received support from Iran in the past in the form of weapons, training and cash. ""We know of Hamas operatives, commandos and soldiers who were trained in Iran itself. We know that. So there is a close cooperation and exchange of know-how and activities,"" said Isaac Herzog, a member of the Israeli Security Cabinet. Iran denies any involvement with Hamas. But an Iranian official told CNN Iran has ties to Shiite groups such as Hezbollah, a political party in Lebanon with alleged terrorist roots. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned Hamas for the rocket attacks, but also had strong words for Israel. ""While recognizing Israel's right to defend itself, I have also condemned the excessive use of force by Israel in Gaza. The suffering caused to civilian populations as a result of the large-scale violence and destruction that have taken place over the past few days has saddened me profoundly,"" he said in a prepared statement. The U.N. Security Council called for both sides to immediately end the violence, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Sunday that the campaign could last ""for some time,"" and his Cabinet voted to call up 7,000 reservists. So far, about 2,000 reservists have been activated, according to the government. Read analysis of what may happen next . Hamas pledges it will defend its land and people from what it calls continued Israeli aggression. Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire. The truce formally expired December 19, but it had been weakening for months. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian parliament member, flatly blamed the violence on the Israeli ""occupation"" of the Palestinian territories and dismissed Israeli claims that it is targeting only Hamas.  Watch why one Palestinian lawmaker blames Israel » . ""This is not a war on Hamas; it is a war on the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""The Israeli politicians are using this bloodbath, which is the worst since 1967, for their election campaigns. This is insane.""  Watch Barghouti warn ""violence breeds violence"" » . Both  Barak and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will be vying in February for the prime minister's post against Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Both Barak and Netanyahu have previously held the post. The ongoing assault and threat of Israeli military ground incursion caused panic in Gaza City, the territory's densely populated capital, a U.N. humanitarian official told CNN on Monday. ""It's very bad, people are running in all directions because of the bombings that are happening everywhere,"" Karen AbuZayd said from Gaza City. AbuZayd is the commissioner-general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance to about 80 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million residents. Israel allowed more than 50 trucks carrying relief aid into Gaza on Monday -- in addition to 40 on Sunday -- Israeli military sources said. The U.N. is expecting 100 trucks Monday, but a U.N. official said it will not be enough to alleviate the worsening humanitarian situation. In the West Bank, Saeb Erakat, adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, urged Israeli and Hamas leaders to put another cease-fire in place. The power base of Abbas' Fatah party is in the West Bank. The party is locked in a power struggle with Hamas, which won parliamentary elections in January 2006 and wrested Gaza from Fatah in violent clashes last year.

Richardson was taken to a hospital near Station Mont Tremblant before she was transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal following her fall on Monday, according to the statement. However, she was transferred Tuesday to an undisclosed location in the United States, according to Michelle Simard, spokeswoman for Hopital du Sacre-Coeur. Simard said she had no further details. Richardson fell on a beginners' trail Monday during a ski lesson at Station Mont Tremblant, said the statement from the resort, located about 80 miles northwest of Montreal. She was not wearing a helmet, the resort said. At the time, Richardson was accompanied by a veteran female ski instructor, who called the ski patrol, the statement said. The ski patrol members examined her and found no visible sign of injury, according to the statement. ""As standard protocol, the ski patrol insisted that Ms. Richardson be transported to the base of the hill in a rescue toboggan,"" the resort statement said. Once at the base of the hill, staffers advised Richardson to seek additional medical attention, but she declined. Accompanied by the instructor, Richardson went to her hotel, where she was again advised to see a doctor, the resort said.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A heavy snowstorm caused chaos Friday at Madrid's Barajas Airport, where flights were suspended for hours before Europe's fourth-busiest airport reopened in the late afternoon. A woman enjoys the snow in Madrid, where the airport suspended flights because of the weather. Planes were flying again at 4:40 p.m. (10:40 am ET). ""It's a huge snowstorm. You don't see this in Madrid often,"" an airport spokeswoman said. The airport has 1,205 daily inbound and outbound flights. But for the first time, the airport halted operations due to a weather problem, the spokeswoman said. The temporary shutdown began about noon (6 a.m. ET). Visibility was low, and the storm was so intense that the airport's snow clearing and de-icing equipment couldn't keep up, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The first plane to depart when the airport reopened was a Finnair flight bound for Helsinki, a second spokeswoman said. The delays from the storm affected hundreds of travelers at the airport. Many others could not even reach the airport because of poor road conditions.

"(CNN) -- The West African country of Guinea, reeling after the death of President Lansana Conte, is staring at the prospect of widespread political instability amid an apparent coup. Lansana Conte came to power in a military coup in 1984. Journalist Mohammed Kayta in Conakry said the Guinean military seized control of the capital city's streets in an apparent coup. He reported that the military was holding negotiations to determine who will succeed Conte, who ruled the country for nearly 25 years. The action followed an announcement on national radio Tuesday by army Capt. Foamed Dadis Camara that government and national institutions had been dissolved, according to Le Jour, a national newspaper, and the subsequent announcement by Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare that the government continued to function. Soldiers were out in force, including around the offices of the president and prime minister in Conakry, local journalist Barry Minkalou told CNN. The streets were calm, with no reports of injuries or violence, he said. Camara said Tuesday an ""advisory council"" of civilians and soldiers would be set up. The Foreign Office in Great Britain said it was ""concerned by reports of a military coup. ""We condemn any attempt to seize power by force, and call on all parties to ensure respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and to safeguard the well-being of their own citizens and foreign nationals in Guinea,"" the office said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who issued a statement commending Conte and passing along condolences, urged ""a peaceful and democratic transfer of power"" and exhorted ""the armed forces and all stakeholders to respect the democratic process."" The United Nations told its personnel in Guinea to stay off the streets. ""All U.N. staff have been encouraged to stay at home,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' spokesman in Guinea, Faya Foko Millimouno, told CNN. ""Only the military is in the street now.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia judge threw the book at Brian Nichols on Saturday, giving him four consecutive sentences of life without parole for a 2005 shooting rampage that started in an Atlanta courthouse. Brian Nichols tells the court Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia, ""I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life."" ""I'm giving you the maximum -- every day I could give you. If I could give you more, I would,"" Superior Court Judge James Bodiford told Nichols. Nichols, 37, was convicted last month of 54 counts for a deadly shooting rampage that began March 11, 2005, in the same courthouse where he stood trial. Nichols, who was being tried for rape, shot three people to death as he escaped from the downtown courthouse that day and a federal agent the next day in Atlanta's Buckhead district before being captured in neighboring Gwinnett County. ""I know that the things that I've done caused a lot of pain, and I am sorry,"" Nichols, who remained seated, told the court before sentence was pronounced. ""And I just wanted to say that I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life.""  Watch victims' family members react to the sentence » . Nichols was spared a death sentence Friday after the jury deliberating his fate announced that it could not agree on a sentence. Bodiford gave Nichols the maximum sentence on all the non-murder charges, and ordered them to be served consecutively. Those terms ranged from five years for escape to life for armed robbery. Other charges included aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, robbery by force, theft by taking, hijacking a motor vehicle and false imprisonment. ""It's a large number of years. It's many lifetimes,"" Bodiford said. Bodiford ordered that Nichols serve his time in the Georgia state penal system, forgoing the possibility of sending him to the federal maximum-security prison in Colorado. Bodiford implored Nichols' family and attorneys never to trust Nichols again. ""There's ample evidence that trusting him will get you killed,"" he said in concluding the sentencing hearing. Jurors told Bodiford on Friday night that they were deadlocked, with nine in favor of death and three in favor of life without parole. Under Georgia law, the jurors must reach a unanimous decision in order to impose a death sentence. In the absence of a unanimous jury verdict, the decision fell in the hands of Bodiford. Defense lawyers said Nichols, who confessed to the killings, suffers from a mental disorder. The jurors unanimously found the necessary aggravating circumstances in the four murders, but they were split over the death penalty. After nine weeks of testimony, the jury found Nichols guilty of 54 counts, which included the four murders plus numerous aggravated assaults, carjackings and kidnappings. The shootings began in the Fulton County Courthouse, where Nichols was set to stand trial for rape. He overpowered a sheriff's deputy and took her gun before proceeding to the courtroom of Judge Rowland Barnes, killing him and court reporter Julie Ann Brandau. Sgt. Hoyt Teasley chased Nichols to outside the courthouse, where Nichols fatally shot him. Nichols killed off-duty U.S. Customs Agent David Wilhelm as he worked on a house in Buckhead the next day. He was captured later that day after a standoff with police in the apartment of a woman he had taken hostage in Gwinnett County. The case drew nationwide attention, in part because of the cost of Nichols' representation: about $2 million at last accounting. Nichols had attempted to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but the Fulton County District Attorney's Office would not take the death penalty off the table.","Judge: ""I'm giving you the maximum -- every day I could give you""

"(CNN)  -- Brazilian star Kaka has rejected a world record transfer move to Premier League Manchester City and decided to stay with AC Milan. Kaka opted to stay with AC Milan despite the riches on offer. The 2007 world player of the year was set to earn $750,000 per week with City, who were reported to be willing to pay a staggering $147 million to acquire his services. The devoutly religious Kaka explained his reasons on the club's television station. ""I believe I have made the right choice. ""To have gone to Manchester City could have been a great project but in the past few days I have prayed a lot to understand what the right team would be and in the end I have decided to remain here. ""I don't want anything else, I just want to be well and be happy in the place where people love me."" Italian prime minister and Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi originally broke the news that the devoted fans of the Rossoneri wanted to hear. Interviewed on Italian TV's Sky Italia late on Monday night, Berlusconi confirmed that Milan had offered Kaka the chance to ""make himself a fortune, but said he has ""higher values."" Berlusconi continued: ""He is staying with us, there are things which are more important than money: we are happy. ""When I heard he would prefer to stay, that he didn't think he would be missing a great opportunity and he prefers the values of our flag, the values of closeness and friendship, the warmth and the affection that all the fans have shown him in these days, I said 'hooray' and we hugged. Kaka is staying at Milan."" Fans of former European champions Milan had staged a series of protests since City's audacious move for Kaka became public late last week. They intensified after Kaka played in the 1-0 home win over Fiorentina which improved Milan's Serie A title chances as arch-rivals and league leaders Inter Milan slipped up. Have your say: Should Kaka have stayed at AC Milan or taken the money? City, who are being backed by Sheikh Mansour's Abu-Dhabi investment group, finally admitted defeat in a statement on their club Web site www.mfc.co.uk from executive chairman Gary Cook: . ""Whilst Manchester City Football Club has an obvious interest in world-class players of the quality of Kaka, we owe it to our fans that such a transfer must work on every level; commercially, financially, in terms of results on the field and within Manchester City's broader community."" Cook and a City delegation returned to Manchester without ever managing to meet 26-year-old Kaka face to face, dealing instead with Milan officials and his father Bosco Leite. Manager Mark Hughes, who completed the signing of striker Craig Bellamy from West Ham on Monday, will also be hoping to finalize a deal to acquire midfielder Nigel De Jong from Hamburg as he strengthens his squad in the January transfer window. City, who are struggling in 11th in the Premier League and out of the FA Cup, signed Kaka's Brazilian international teammate Robinho from Real Madrid shortly after their new Abu Dhabi owners took over last summer. Robinho has proved an immediate success with 12 goals, but City are aware of the need to attract more world class players to their ranks, hence the ulitmately fruitless attempt to sign Kaka. In a separate development, Robinho moved quickly to deny reports that he had stormed out of City's training camp in Tenerife because they had failed to sign his friend Kaka. ""I had made Manchester City aware that I needed to return to Brazil because of a family matter,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I will return to the club and hope to sort this out as soon as possible."" He added: ""I feel it is important to underline that I did not return to Brazil because of the Kaka deal. ""He is one of my good friends and it would have been great to see him at Manchester City -- but it had nothing to do with his decision to stay in Milan. ""I am committed to helping Manchester City become the force the owners assured me they will become.""","AC Milan's Kaka turns down big-money transfer to Manchester City .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Qatari man held for years in military custody in the United States was charged Friday in federal court with conspiracy ""to provide material support and resources"" to al Qaeda, prosecutors announced. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001. The Supreme Court was to hear arguments in April on a challenge by the suspect, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, to the principle that the president has the authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitely and without charges. The Justice Department on Friday asked the high court to dismiss that pending appeal. ""Because the military detention challenged by the petitioner has ended, no live controversy remains in this case,"" said Obama administration lawyers in their brief. Al-Marri's lawyers oppose such a move, saying the fundamental constitutional question of military detentions needs to be answered. The federal indictment means the case will be transferred to civilian courts for prosecution. Andy Savage, one of al-Marri's lawyers, visited him at the naval brig in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday to show him the indictment charging him with terrorism. ""He denies it,"" Savage said. ""I'm sure he'll enter a not guilty plea."" Savage said he was disappointed in the information contained in what he called a brief indictment. ""We'd like information about what he's supposed to have done,"" he said. ""You'd think after 7½ years they'd have a little more to say. ""The most important thing to him is he now has some definition of his future. Before, he didn't know if he'd be charged, be repatriated or held forever."" The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining ""enemy combatant"" held in the United States. He had been accused of being an al Qaeda sleeper agent, but until this indictment he had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense. He will be transferred at some point to Peoria, Illinois, to face a criminal trial. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled April 27. A Justice Department official said the White House will release an official presidential order to transfer al-Marri into civilian custody. Al-Marri's lawyer applauded the move. ""This indictment is an important step toward restoring the rule of law and is exactly what should happen when the government suspects an individual of terrorist acts. This case is now finally where it belongs: in a legitimate court that can fairly determine whether Mr. al-Marri is guilty of a crime,"" said Jonathan Hafetz, an ACLU attorney who is representing him in the pending high court appeal. President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the ""factual and legal basis"" for the continued detention of al-Marri. Obama late Friday issued a presidential memorandum ordering Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to facilitate al-Marri's transfer, calling it ""in the interest of the United States."" Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001, al-Marri, a 43-year-old legal resident of the United States, has remained in ""virtual isolation in the brig,"" his attorneys said. They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and are challenging the constitutionality of his detention. They said his cell at the brig in South Carolina is only 9 feet by 6 feet and he is allowed little contact with the outside world, including his family. Military officials deny mistreatment. The case posed a sticky legal dilemma for the high court and the current and previous administrations. President George W. Bush ordered al-Marri confined in military custody, and the Bush Justice Department had been filing the appeals opposing al-Marri's legal claims. At issue was whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, attacks, gave the president the power to order the indefinite military detention of an accused terrorist seized on domestic soil. Al-Marri arrived in the United States the day before the 2001 terrorist attacks as a computer science graduate student at Bradley University in Peoria. He had earned an undergraduate degree there a decade earlier. Weeks later, he was arrested after authorities found hundreds of credit card numbers belonging to others in his home. At an early court hearing, a prosecutor said al-Marri was believed to be an associate of al Qaeda, the Islamic terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The case against al-Marri escalated when investigators further examined his computer and interrogated al Qaeda detainees, the government said. Although al-Marri was not charged with terrorism-related offenses, Bush in June 2003 issued a formal declaration naming him an ""enemy combatant"" and transferring him to military custody. That move sent him out of the normal criminal justice system into indefinite military detention. The declaration alleges al-Marri engaged in ""hostile and warlike acts"" working as an ""al Qaeda sleeper agent"" who was planning to ""hack into the computer systems of U.S banks,"" for a possible follow-up to the 9/11 attacks. The Pentagon said he had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan, met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and ""volunteered for a martyr mission,"" according to the government's filing with the high court. A lawyer for Jose Padilla, an American citizen detained as an enemy combatant, said the government's actions in the al-Marri case echo those in Padilla's, in which he says criminal charges were filed shortly before the case was to go to the Supreme Court. ""This is deja vu all over again -- what the Bush administration did with Padilla, the Obama administration is trying to do with al-Marri,"" he said. ""Transferring al-Marri out of the brig is the right thing to do. Moving to dismiss the case is not."" The case is U.S. v. al-Marri (09-CR-10030). CNN's Carol Cratty and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri charged with conspiracy to provide support to al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Author John Updike, regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern American letters, died Tuesday, his publicist said. He was 76. John Updike won many literary awards. His books, such as ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" were also best-sellers. Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer. He lived in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. ""He was one of our greatest writers, and he will be sorely missed,"" said Nicholas Latimer, vice president of publicity at Updike's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Updike was a rarity among American writers: a much-esteemed, prize-winning author whose books -- including ""Rabbit, Run"" (1960), ""Couples"" (1968), ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1984) and ""Terrorist"" (2006) -- were also best-sellers. Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice: for ""Rabbit Is Rich"" (1981) and its successor, ""Rabbit at Rest"" (1991). iReport: Share your tributes to John Updike . The ""Rabbit"" series, about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike's hometown of Shillington, Pennsylvania, spanned four novels, a novella and four decades. In the books -- which also included 1971's ""Rabbit Redux"" and a 2001 novella, ""Rabbit Remembered"" -- onetime basketball star Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom negotiates marriage, divorce, wealth and health problems, never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life. ""Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection, but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood, and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking,"" wrote Time's Lev Grossman in naming ""Rabbit, Run"" to Time's ""All-Time 100 Novels"" list. Updike was incredibly prolific, penning essays, reviews, short stories, poetry and memoirs. His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker, including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams' final game, ""Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu."" ""No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John,"" said David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, in a statement. ""Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine, loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young. ""We adored him,""  Remnick continued. ""He was, for so long, the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him."" The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years, including 327 book reviews, 170 short stories and 154 poems. He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts. ""John Updike's place among America's literary greats is forever secure, as is his special place in every Red Sox fan's heart for his magnificent 'Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,' "" Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement. ""We honor his memory and his contributions, and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own."" Updike never won a Nobel Prize, but one of his characters, Henry Bech, received one in ""Bech at Bay"" (1998). His works, particularly given their sexual content, could be as divisive as they were poetic. Many critics accused him of misogyny, and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream. ""It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book,"" the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001. But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers, the cover of Time magazine (for 1968's ""Couples"") and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain's Literary Review. He was criticized by Norman Mailer, hailed by fellow author (and Updike obsessive) Nicholson Baker in ""U and I"" and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a ""Simpsons"" episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book. ""[I] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield,"" Updike said, noting that the hardest part of his performance was ""producing a chuckle."" John Hoyer Updike was born March 18, 1932, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Shillington. From an early age he took to reading and writing, and earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where he headed the Harvard Lampoon. Upon graduation, he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England. By the time he was 23, he had been offered a position at The New Yorker, which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years. Updike's first novel, ""The Poorhouse Fair,"" came out in 1959. The next year, in ""Rabbit, Run,"" he introduced Angstrom, who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction. When introduced, Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife, the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life. Over the course of the ""Rabbit"" books, the character would routinely infuriate his spouse, mistresses and offspring, try to make things right, and never quite succeed. His attitude didn't help. ""Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who has the brains. God maybe,"" the character said in ""Rabbit, Run."" ""Rabbit, Run"" was successful, as were Updike's other '60s books, including ""The Centaur"" (1963), which featured a teacher much like Updike's father, and the short story collection ""The Music School"" (1966). But it was ""Couples"" that made Updike a household name. The book, about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts, became a No. 1 best-seller. Updike's interests ranged widely. He wrote about an African state in ""The Coup"" (1978). He discussed the relationship between science and religion in ""Roger's Version"" (1986). He revisited ""Hamlet"" in ""Gertrude and Claudius"" (2000). And he created a group of promiscuous witches in ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1984), which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil. Though Updike's work routinely sold well, he was painfully aware of the decline of what's come to be called ""literary fiction."" In a 2000 interview with Salon, he lamented its difficulties. ""When I was a boy, the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher's shelf. I mean, Steinbeck, Hemingway, some Faulkner. Faulkner actually had, considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are, quite a middle-class readership,"" he said. ""But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent. You don't feel that now."" And yet, Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word, and the pleasure brought by jotting, tuning, refining -- creating -- a new story, even as the years drifted by. ""An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while,"" he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year. ""The pleasures, for him, of book-making ... remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best."" Updike's most recent novel, ""The Widows of Eastwick,"" came out in 2008. A collection of stories, ""My Father's Tears and Other Stories,"" is due out later this year.","John Updike, author of ""Rabbit"" books and ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" dies .

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Discovery is on pace for a Sunday launch after NASA engineers repaired a leaky gas venting system, officials said Saturday. Space shuttle Discovery readies for launch, which now appears on pace for Sunday. The leak had canceled a planned launch on Wednesday. NASA hopes the seven-member crew can take off around 7:40 p.m. Sunday on a mission to the international space station, where they will deliver supplies needed to expand the station's crew to six people. ""The vehicle is looking real good ... ,"" lead shuttle flight director Mike Moses said. ""Basically, I think I can sum this up by just saying we're good to go tomorrow and we're looking forward to getting the count going."" A leak in a hydrogen gas vent line forced Wednesday's delay. Repairs went smoothly, Moses said. The line funnels flammable hydrogen away from the launch pad during takeoff. The shuttle crew will be delivering the final parts needed for an expanded solar energy power system that will allow the station to double its crew to six people. The crew also will be dropping off Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, who will replace NASA's Sandy Magnus on the space station. The shuttle also will carry a replacement for a failed unit in a system that converts urine to drinkable water, NASA said.  Watch an explanation of why Wednesday's launch was scrubbed » . Kathy Winters, the mission's chief weather officer, said Sunday appears to offer only a 20 percent chance of weather that would scrub the launch. The crew, led by commander Lee Archambault, is expected to board Discovery at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, at about 4:30 p.m. Sunday. Officials said the crew has been training and resting for the mission since Wednesday. Earlier this week, Magnus, station commander Michael Fincke and Russian engineer Yury Lonchakov had to take shelter in their Soyuz spacecraft -- a lifeboat of sorts -- when a piece of debris from an earlier mission hurtled uncomfortably close to the station. The debris, moving about 20,000 mph, came within three miles of the station but caused no damage. Wednesday's launch postponement was the latest in a series of delays for Discovery as it tries to make the 28th shuttle mission to the space station. The launch had been delayed previously to allow time to check a ""flow-control valve in the shuttle's main engines,"" NASA said last week. That resulted from damage being found in a valve on the shuttle Endeavour during its November 2008 flight. Three valves were cleared and installed on Discovery, it said. CNN's Kim Segal and John Zarella contributed to this report.","NEW: Repairs to leaky hydrogen gas vent line went well, NASA says .

"(RealSimple.com) -- Overwashing, overapplying, and product overkill won't improve your skin. Rein in your regimen to get real results. Want beautiful skin like model Megan Gale? Don't overdo it, experts say. Cleansing and exfoliating . You don't need to wash or scrub as often -- or as vigorously -- as you may think. ""Many women go overboard here, figuring it will make their skin look better if they do both more frequently,"" says dermatologist Leslie Baumann. ""But that only damages the skin's natural barrier and creates dryness and irritation."" Combination skin . How often: Wash your face twice a day, and gently exfoliate once or twice a week; this is enough to keep skin balanced and encourage cell turnover, according to experts. What to look for: A mild cleanser that isn't too rich or too drying, says Mary Lupo, a dermatologist in New Orleans, Louisiana. Use an exfoliant that contains gentle particles or acids to remove dead cells without abrading your skin. Where to find it: Cleanser -- Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, $6 at drugstores. Exfoliant -- St. Ives Elements Microdermabrasion Scrub, $7 at drugstores. Dry skin . How often: Cleanse skin at night, when it's dirtiest. Rinse with cool water in the morning to help maintain natural oils. If skin is flaky, exfoliate once a week, says Lisa Donofrio, a professor of dermatology at Yale University. What to look for: A cleansing oil or creamy wash that has moisturizing ingredients, such as glycerin. If you have sensitive skin to boot, avoid products that contain fragrances or alcohol, which can irritate. Where to find it: Cleanser -- Laura Mercier Purifying Oil, $40, www.sephora.com; or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, $11.50 at drugstores. Exfoliant -- Your safest bet is to use a wet washcloth. Oily/acne-prone skin . How often: Lather up two to three times a day (as needed) but never more; overwashing kicks oil glands into overproduction. Exfoliate once or twice a week, but skip this if you have acne; the friction can make it worse. What to look for: An oil-free, non-comedogenic foaming cleanser that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to prevent breakouts. The scrub should contain mild acids to keep the pores open and clean. Where to find it: Cleanser -- Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, $7 at drugstores. Exfoliant -- Bioré Pore Unclogging Scrub, $6 at drugstores. Sensitive skin . How often: Wash once a day if your skin is irritated by nearly everything or if you have eczema or psoriasis; twice a day if your skin is dirty. Forget about exfoliating, as it's too abrasive for your skin type. What to look for: Hypoallergenic and fragrance- and soap-free cleansers. Calming ingredients, like green tea, chamomile, feverfew, and aloe, are a bonus. As a general rule, the fewer ingredients in a product, the better. Where to find it: Cleanser -- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser ($19.50, www.laroche-posay.com). Apply with your fingers. ""Think of the way you'd touch a newborn,"" says Barbara Reed, a Denver, Colorado, dermatologist. Portion control . • Use a quarter-size amount of cleanser on most skin types. • A dime-size dollop of scrub will do. • A pea-size dab of cleanser is plenty for sensitive skin. Real Simple: Best facial cleansers . Moisturizing and protecting . No matter what your skin type, moisture is important. ""If your skin isn't hydrated, it can't protect itself from the free radicals that cause damage, discoloration, and wrinkles,"" says dermatologist Leslie Baumann. Year-round daily sun protection is also a must. Fortunately there are moisturizers with SPF available for every complexion. Combination skin . How often: Each morning, apply moisturizer with SPF after cleansing your skin. Reapply if you're spending more than 30 minutes outside, as sun-screens break down in sunlight over time. What to look for: A medium-weight lotion with skin-protective antioxidants, such as green tea, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin C, and broad-spectrum sun protection with an SPF of 15 or higher.

Dry skin . How often: To help seal in water, apply moisturizer with SPF once a day, right after cleansing, while your skin is still damp. Reapply at midday if your skin begins to feel tight, and use a cream at night. What to look for: A rich cream that contains antioxidants, plus hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides. ""Hyaluronic acid and glycerin bind in moisture, and ceramides prevent water loss from the skin,"" says Donofrio. Where to find it: Dove Pro Age Day Moisturizer SPF 15, $14 at drugstores; or Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15, $10.50 at drugstores. Oily/acne-prone skin . How often: Moisturize every morning. Oily skin needs the right type of moisture and lightweight, non-comedogenic sun protection. Reapply as needed, since blotting away shine can remove sunscreen. What to look for: An oil-free, featherweight lotion, serum, or gel with antioxidants. If you're acne-prone, avoid products with cocoa butter, cinnamon, or coconut oil, as they can trigger breakouts, says Baumann.

How often: In the morning, apply moisturizer to skin that has been dabbed dry. Ingredients penetrate wet skin more deeply, which is often a good thing, but this can irritate sensitive skin. What to look for: Fragrance-free lotions or creams that contain anti-inflammatories, such as chamomile, green tea, feverfew, and caffeine. Avoid lipoic acid, as it can be irritating.

"(CNN) -- The first person ever convicted in Idaho of knowingly spreading the HIV virus is facing new charges for the same offense, authorities said Thursday. An Ada County, Idaho, grand jury on Tuesday returned an indictment charging Kerry Thomas, 45, with seven counts of knowingly transferring the HIV virus, Jean Fisher, Ada County deputy prosecutor, told CNN. In 1990, Thomas was charged with four counts of HIV transmission and two counts of statutory rape, Fisher said. As part of a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty only to the rape charges. According to Fisher, Thomas received a 12-year sentence and had to serve three years before being eligible for parole. He was later granted early release. In 1996, however, Thomas was again charged with one count of HIV transmission, and a jury convicted him, Fisher said. He received a 15-year sentence with a seven-year minimum. Now out on parole, Thomas faces possible life in prison on the new charges because prosecutors are seeking his designation as a ""persistent violator."" It was not immediately known whether Thomas was in custody Thursday. He was not listed online among the inmates in the Ada County Jail. Asked why Thomas would continue to spread the virus, which causes AIDS, Fisher said, ""That's the $64,000 question, for a person who has been to prison twice.""","Kerry Thomas was indicted for second time for knowingly transferring HIV virus .

"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album. He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star. Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music. His new record is ""Untold Truths."" Only in this case, he was a movie star. Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of ""Untold Truths"" -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Back in the day, they called themselves Roving Boy. Truth be told, the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star's vanity project. It's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop. Costner sings about freight trains, dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that's pleasant, if not terribly distinct. In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater, he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen. At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Field of Dreams"" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. The mission statement from ""Field of Dreams"" seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist: ""If you build it, they will come."" Plenty of fans did come to his show that night, but earlier in the day, we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored ""SoundCheck"" session.  Listen to Costner kick it with his band » . CNN: Even though your album, ""Untold Truths,"" is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. Kevin Costner: Yeah. It's just music. CNN: What made you decide to put out an album? Costner: My wife said, ""Look, you are the happiest by far when you are making music. Why don't you keep on making music?"" CNN: People may not know this, but you've been making music for a long time. Costner: Yeah, for a long time. I have been doing a lot of things for a long time. (chuckles) It's not like we called up and said, ""Hey, we have a garage band. Can we show up?"" We have been working really hard at this for three years. All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it. It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation, people discovering the band. CNN: When you were talking to the students, you spoke a lot about being fearless. Costner: Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues, but by their parents. You only get one shot at this life. They can go to college and learn a lot of things, but they should also be encouraged to try things, even if they don't succeed. I am trying -- even if I don't succeed. You know, failure is completely underrated in America. (smiles) CNN: With this new project, there's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter. Costner: Well, that will happen no matter what I do -- so I'm not worried about that. I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable. CNN: And what is that? Costner: I don't know. It's just a moment when you feel you've given an honest effort. CNN: You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie, let alone condensing things into a three-minute song. How do you -- . Costner: I don't have that hard a time! CNN: Oh, come on! Costner: I make jokes about it a lot. You know, I make one-hour, 59-minute movies! But yeah -- telling the story, I don't believe in some conditional running length. I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically. CNN: You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago. Costner: Yeah, a long time ago. Blair (his bass player), the same. Like anybody with good sense, you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you. CNN: Which is more cutthroat, the movie business or the music business? Costner: There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under, and people ducking for exits, pointing fingers. You know, it is a cycle of life. Then someone else will take that spot, some heavy hitter. Maybe it is good to take a lesson. You have to be a little humble because maybe one day, you are not that big, swinging dog you think you are. CNN: Do you ever feel like that in your own career? Costner: Well, I am aware that a career that takes chances isn't always going to ring a bell. It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person, or the number one person, because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with. CNN: Do you read reviews? Costner: No. Sometimes they are read to me. ""Look what he said!"" I am like, ""Please don't show me."" CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. We'll see where it lands. We made a record. We made it as good as we could make it, and now we let it go. And we go and write a better song. CNN: In the meantime, you have a show to put on. Costner: There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning, and that is a great feeling. Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them. When you perform, for me, it's like filling up the gas tank.","Kevin Costner has band, Modern West; new album just out .

"(CNN) -- South African Giniel De Villiers is the new leader of the Dakar Rally after he won Thursday's 12th special stage and Spaniard Carlos Sainz was forced to pull out following a dramatic crash. The stricken Volkswagen of Carlos Sainz after he careered down a ravine on stage 12 of the Dakar Rally. De Villiers, who was claiming his third stage triumph, brought his Volkswagen across the line in four hours, six minutes and 43 seconds -- over 16 minutes  ahead of team-mate Mark Miller, who lies second overall. American Robert Gordon (Hummer) was third on the stage, the same as his overall position. The route from Fiambala to La Rioja was reduced by 30 kilometers, leaving the special stage at 223km, as organizers accepted the Argentinian authorities' request to shorten it because of the archaeological discoveries made a month ago in the Fiambala region of Catamarca province. Two-time world rally champion Sainz, who was leading after six stage victories, had his dream of winning his first Dakar ended when, 79km into the stage, his Volkswagen crashed into a dry riverbed. His co-driver, Frenchman Michel Perin, suffered a shoulder injury and both had to be evacuated by helicopter for medical attention. Perin told PA Sport: ""We had made a small mistake in the first part. We took the wrong direction at a Y crossing but it was not too bad because we did end up on the right trail. We were tailing Giniel De Villiers, who had started about 10 minutes after us, so it was still sort of okay. There was a hidden way-point indicated as 'danger' -- but it should have been indicated as 'extremely dangerous'. ""The car behind us, Nani Roma's car, would have fallen in the same hole as we did if we had not been there already. I'm okay, I just have something broken in my arm, but I'm all right."" De Villiers said: ""It was really a tough stage. In places we would go around in circles for 15 minutes to find the right trail. It was very dangerous and the sand was really soft. ""We stopped one time to deflate our tyres, then a second time in a huge canyon with tons of boulders. My co-driver Dirk von Zitzewitz had to get out of the car to find a way out. It was really a tough day."" Miller added: ""I can tell you that this was a very demanding stage. I cannot even imagine how the amateurs will make it to the finish today. It was not just difficult, navigation was almost impossible. ""It was a long series of horror situations from start to finish. ""These were the longest 200km in my life. The sun and the sand were so bright that I could not see anything."" He added: ""It's not good news to know that Carlos had to withdraw. He has an important place in the team."" In the motorcycle class, title holder Cyril Despres (KTM) kept his hopes of winning his third crown alive after taking his third stage in a time of 3:57:37 to climb into second spot in the overall standings. However, Despres' Spanish team-mate Marc Coma did not make things easy for the Frenchman as he crossed the line 1:23 behind, to remain out in front with a 1:29:48 advantage. The 12th stage has been the most difficult since the rally began on January 3 in Buenos Aires, with competitiors struggling through sand dunes and rain in western Argentina. Sainz had held a commanding lead in the overall standings at the start of the day, having won six of 10 previous stages.","Dakar leader Carlos Sainz crashes out of rally during Thursday's 12th stage .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Two hundred years after his birth in a log cabin in Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln continues to fascinate. Abraham Lincoln is invoked by politicians of both parties, observes historian Ronald C. White Jr. His moral clarity, his extraordinary gifts with language, his decisive role in preserving the Union and what some consider his ultimate martyrdom combine to make of Lincoln a mythic figure with a firm hold on our collective imagination. In conjunction with the bicentennial of his birth, a slew of new books on the 16th U.S. president have appeared. Among the best-reviewed is the biography ""A. Lincoln"" (Random House) by historian Ronald C. White Jr., who drew on new research for his portrait. CNN talked with White about Lincoln's impact on the country, President Obama's affinity for him and what lessons Lincoln has to offer Americans of today. The following is an edited version of White's comments: . CNN: Thousands of books have been published about Lincoln. Why did you decide to write a new biography? Ronald C. White Jr.: Probably surprising to many is how many new discoveries have been made about Lincoln just in the last 15 to 20 years. For example, about 20 years ago, a professor in Illinois wondered if there were still Lincoln legal papers laying around in the almost 100 courthouses in Illinois. So he got together a group of students, and they began searching those courthouses, and they found [thousands] of Lincoln legal documents. ... I wanted to treat more of that part of Lincoln's life -- he spent nearly 24 years as a lawyer. This is just an example of what we have discovered only in recent years. See iReporters don stovepipe hats like Lincoln . CNN: More than 100 years after his death, why does Lincoln still fascinate us? White: I think for many he embodies the best of America. The fact that a man of such humble origins, with less than one year of formal education, could, in his term, have the ""right to rise."" He felt that America was a land where we should not put any shackles or weights upon people. One reason he hated slavery so much was that it puts weights upon people. ... I'm going to be speaking in Italy and Germany in April, and people there are fascinated with Lincoln for the same reason. Now, to be sure, Obama has shone a large spotlight on Abraham Lincoln. I think this is somewhat responsible for rediscovering this man at the beginning of the Lincoln bicentennial in the year 2009. CNN: Why do you think Barack Obama has made such a point of aligning himself with Lincoln? White: It's become commonplace for politicians of both parties to invoke Lincoln -- literally wrap themselves in the mantle of Lincoln -- especially at political conventions. But when I read ""The Audacity of Hope"" it came through to me that this is something quite genuine. As Obama is seeking to define his own vocation as a politician, he found in Lincoln -- Lincoln's inclusive spirit, Lincoln's humble demeanor, Lincoln's great gift with words -- he found here some of the very values that he wished to inculcate into his own life. ... I think he picked up on the symbolism of Lincoln, using the very same ceremonial Bible [for his swearing-in], picking as his theme a ""new birth of freedom,"" re-enacting the final 137 miles of the train ride [Lincoln took to Washington for his first inaugural]. It's fascinating that here this African-American politician is finding a model and a mentor, and I think it is the values that Lincoln represents that Obama is finding. CNN: Some people have noted temperamental similarities between Lincoln and Obama. Is there any justification for that comparison? White: I think there is. Obama comes across as a person of kind of calm, reassuring demeanor. He is a person who likes to circle around questions and problems. He was as interested, as I've come to understand, when he taught law in Chicago, in asking questions as in coming up with answers. This is exactly the way Lincoln approached reality. They both have a real sense for oratory, how less is more; they have a compelling way of speaking. ... To be sure there are real differences. [Obama] had an education far beyond Lincoln's. It's yet to be determined how Obama will emulate Lincoln. I would argue that Lincoln had to teach himself to be president. He was very aware of his inadequacies, certainly in administration and military policy. And I think with all the fanfare for Obama I think he understands that he has to teach himself how to be president, too. iReport.com: Send your rendition of Lincoln's second inaugural speech . CNN: [Historian] Henry Louis Gates suggests Lincoln's attitudes on race were not as enlightened as some would like to think. In your book, you say it's important to consider the context in which Lincoln articulated his racial views. White: This is the difficulty ... with understanding the context. Lincoln's racial attitudes ... were left of center and moving in that direction, toward the left. ... Lincoln said in one of his debates with Stephen Douglas, ""It's not that I'm about to marry a black woman, it's not that I think blacks should serve on juries."" ... He then comes back and says, ""But this black woman, in terms of her right to eat the bread she earns from her own hands is every bit my equal and the equal of every person here because if you're referring to the Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal."" Even the most radical abolitionist would probably not have granted social equality [between blacks and whites]. CNN: What did you discover about the evolution of Lincoln's religious views? White: His religious odyssey comes to more of a full scope during his presidency. ... We see him re-appropriating elements of the Christian faith -- not his parents' tradition -- but a more rational, logical, thoughtful old-school Presbyterian tradition [after he became president]. This is a story that has not often been told, and I think it's an important part of understanding the moral core of Abraham Lincoln. It wasn't simply that he had an ethic, which he certainly did, but there was a theological kind of undergirding of that ethic that came to the forefront more in his years as president. CNN: Do you feel Lincoln is our greatest president? White: Well, there are a lot of great presidents. ... Certainly the times make the man. Lincoln led us through the greatest crisis of our nation's history -- an internal crisis -- even as Franklin Delano Roosevelt is one of our greatest presidents, who led us through two other great crises -- the Great Depression and World War II. It's hard to compare people of different eras, but I think Lincoln sort of incarnates the best values of the American experience. CNN: What can we all learn from Lincoln? White: If there is an ultimate value in doing a biography of Lincoln, it is that Lincoln offers some wisdom for today. We don't have to be political leaders to catch the values -- his humility, the strength of his character and moral vision, the fact that words fiercely mattered to him and should matter to us. ... He said at the second inaugural, ""With malice toward none, with charity for all."" I was intrigued to find ... that people wore mourning badges right after his death that said, ""With malice toward none, with charity for all."" Lincoln didn't just speak these words, he had come to embody these words for the people who knew him and loved him. And so these values are not simply back there in the 19th century.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Friday said she would do the job again -- but only if she could work for her current boss. Dana Perino said goodbye to the White House press corps at her last briefing as White House spokeswoman Friday. ""I wouldn't do it for anybody but President Bush,"" Perino said as she briefed reporters for the last time Friday. ""If given the chance to do it over again, would I? Yes,"" Perino said. ""But would I ever come back and do this? No. ... I think it's good to get off the stage."" Perino also thanked the White House press corps. ""We all have difficult jobs, we all work long and tough hours, and it's been an exciting challenge,"" said Perino, 36. ""I know I had some big shoes to fill when I got here -- and I still only wear a size six.""  Watch Bush's farewell address » . And she wished President-elect Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, ""all the very best."" ""Please go easy on him -- for a week,"" Perino joked with reporters. In the 80-year history of official White House press secretaries, only two women have been named to the job: Dee Dee Myers, who served former President Bill Clinton, and Perino. It's been 15 months since Bush named Perino to succeed Tony Snow, who later died of colon cancer, as White House press secretary.  View key moments in the Bush presidency » . ""It was about two weeks into the job when I realized that I am never going to be like Tony Snow,"" Perino said. Her first goal was to make briefings less heated. She still pushed back, but chose her confrontations carefully. ""If I was testy all the time as a woman in this position, I can only imagine what people would have said about me, so there is a delicate balance, I think, in this position."" During her time behind the White House podium, Perino sparred almost daily with the media on a number of contentious issues, including the president's decision to ""surge"" troops into Iraq. Perino said there are some things that she would have done differently. ""I'm sure that I'll have lots,"" she said Friday when asked if she had any regrets. ""I'm going to go on a six-week trip with my husband, and I'm sure there will be long-enough flights for me to think about all the things we could have done better.  View iconic images from Bush's time in the White House » . ""Any press secretary always wants to be more proactive, but news happens all over the world,"" Perino said. ""And now with the 24/7 news cycle, in many ways, sometimes, you feel like you're just trying to keep up with that."" ""That's not a regret or a disappointment. It's just a fact of life,"" she added. As she begins to look beyond her years in the West Wing, Perino, a native of Wyoming who was raised in Colorado, says she is looking forward to spending more time in her own neighborhood in Washington with her husband, Peter McMahon, and their dog, a Hungarian Vizsla named Henry.

"(CNN)  -- The often scathing critic Simon Cowell called Susan Boyle -- the breakout singing sensation from ""Britain's Got Talent"" -- a ""little tiger."" Judge Piers Morgan admits that he expected Susan Boyle's audition to be a joke before she began singing. On CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" she showed she's no one-trick pony. During a taping of the show Friday, she nailed a verse of Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" after King asked her to sing. ""Amazing. That was just absolutely stunning,"" said ""Britain's Got Talent"" judge Piers Morgan, who was also a guest. ""To sing that with no musical backing is unbelievable. You have the voice of an angel, Susan."" The 47-year-old Boyle's frumpy attire and awkward mannerisms drew snickers and eye-rolling from her audience before she belted out a pitch-perfect number from ""Les Miserables"" at an audition for the talent contest, making her an overnight sensation.  Watch Boyle sing on Larry King » . An unemployed charity worker who lives alone with her cat in Scotland, Boyle has inspired millions with a performance that flies in the face of pop music's penchant for pre-processed princesses. A clip of her audition had more than 19 million views on YouTube by Friday evening. Boyle, who did a repeat performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" via satellite on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Thursday night, told King she was aware of the snickers her appearance prompted at the audition. ""That doesn't bother me because I knew I had to get on with my act ... ,"" said Boyle, again speaking by satellite. ""I wasn't sure how I would be received, so I just thought I'd give it a whirl.""

""And then you came out and we thought you were going to be a bit of a joke act, to be honest with you,"" he said. ""And then I can remember ... that second when you had begun to sing, and I had never heard a more surprising, extraordinary voice coming out of somebody so unexpected.""

But she said she's staying focused on the competition for now. She said she has no plans to get a makeover or alter her wardrobe -- ""Why should I?

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago, America discovered ""one of England's loudest bands,"" courtesy of documentarian Marty DiBergi and his film, ""This Is Spinal Tap."" Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will perform Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs on tour. It was all parody -- DiBergi was director Rob Reiner, and cohorts Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer played the heavy-metal musicians in Spinal Tap -- but for a fictional band, Spinal Tap has had a long afterlife. The film gave birth to several catchphrases, including one -- ""up to 11"" -- that's made it into the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. There are Web sites devoted to the Tap, including at least one, http://tap-albums.s5.com/, that offers a complete discography of the fictional band's nonexistent albums. And Guest, McKean and Shearer have never left their spandexed alter egos behind. The band reunited for a 1992 album, ""Break Like the Wind,"" and again for a 2001 tour. For the latter, the opening act was another Guest-McKean-Shearer collaboration, the Folksmen from Guest's film ""A Mighty Wind."" Now Shearer, McKean and Guest are hitting the road again, but not as Spinal Tap or the Folksmen. They're playing ... themselves. ""We're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us, and only us,"" says Shearer in a phone interview discussing the trio's ""Unwigged & Unplugged"" 30-date acoustic tour, which kicks off Friday in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""And because we don't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we're trying to dress it up as a treat, a rare treat, to see us as ourselves."" The group will be performing both Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs, though, Shearer adds, ""[we'll be] doing these songs kind of in a different way because we're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters."" Have no fear, however, Tap fans: A new album, ""Back from the Dead,"" is due out in June. Shearer took some time out from tour preparations to talk about Spinal Tap's origins, the similarities between Tap and Metallica, and how ""Start Me Up"" became more closely identified with the Folksmen than the Rolling Stones. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: It's been 25 years since ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" but it's been much longer since Spinal Tap came together. Do you remember what brought it about -- and who it's based on? Shearer: You know, I would like to make a little book composed of all the bands that people have guessed Spinal Tap actually is -- there would be a lot of bands in there. And in fact it is about a lot of bands -- it's never been about one band. When we did this, the Pythons had already done [the Beatles parody] the Rutles, so there had been a piece that ... was a really specific spoof of a really specific band. That was something we didn't want to do -- that had been done. Our notion was to ... sort of encapsulate everything we know about rock 'n' roll -- and everything we found funny or amusing about bands -- into one band. So it was a process of smooshing all that stuff into this fictional band. CNN: Are you familiar about this new movie called ""Anvil""? [The documentary, about a real heavy-metal band, has been compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap.""] . Shearer: I've been reading about it and hearing about it a lot, but I haven't seen it. ... It sounds interesting. The last thing I've seen along that line was ""Some Kind of Monster."" ... Was that amazing. That was stupefying. ... I heard they had a therapist. But it wasn't really a therapist -- it was a life coach. Which is different -- and worse (laughs). Even more humiliating. It's one thing to have somebody who's a therapist, but ... did you ever see ""Starting Over""? The daytime series on NBC? CNN: No. Shearer: Oh, four or five women in a house with two life coaches. Oh my God, it was just shocking. Well, ""Some Kind of Monster"" is in that vein. CNN: How do you guys go about writing songs? The songs on the first album were wonderful pastiches of various heavy metal-type things. On the second album you had more styles and brought in guest musicians, including [renowned session pianist] Nicky Hopkins for ""Rainy Day Sun."" Shearer: My God, yeah. Nicky had actually come in, I think, to audition for the movie but couldn't do the movie or something, but we'd always dreamed to work with Nicky. How we write the songs -- ... every one is a different experience. In the case of Tap, it's what seems like a funny idea sort of leads to a riff or some lyrics. In the case of the Folksmen, I think there was more -- at least the stuff Michael and I wrote together -- a sense these certain kinds of songs that became clichés in that era of folk music, and we sort of have to touch each of these bases. CNN: Like ""Blood on the Coal,"" a combination of coal mining and train song. Shearer: Yeah! We saved you the time. It was a twofer. ... There were a lot of songs in that era that were kind of based loosely or less loosely on the Bible, so we wrote ""The Good Book Song,"" and then of course the great cliché of folk music is the rambler or wandering song, so we wrote ""Never Did No Wanderin',"" about a guy who just stayed home. CNN: Since you're going to be performing as you, are you worried that people will show up wondering where the costumes are, or perhaps yell out, ""Hey Harry, I want to hear Smithers,"" or ""Hey Chris, do Harlan Pepper""? Shearer: Each seat will be [affixed] with Taser equipment to discourage that. ... Hopefully, we'll be so entrancing that they won't be even thinking of talking to us, except if we ask for questions. But as to what people are expecting, we're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us, and only us, and because we don't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we're trying to dress it up as a treat, a rare treat, to see us as ourselves and doing these songs kind of in a different way, because we're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters. CNN: Are you planning to do covers on the order of ""Start Me Up""? [The Folksmen covered the Rolling Stones song on the ""Mighty Wind"" soundtrack.] . Shearer: ""Start Me Up"" is actually the only song that we didn't write that's in the show. I can't resist [it] -- none of us can -- but I have a personal affection for it. After the Super Bowl a few years ago in Detroit, where the Stones played halftime, a few weeks later I met somebody who said that ""the soundtrack record of 'A Mighty Wind' is my 6-year-old son's favorite CD, and at the Super Bowl that day during halftime, I was in the kitchen making lunch for him and his sister, and the 6-year-old ran into the kitchen as excited as I'd ever seen him in his life and said, 'Daddy daddy daddy, they're doing a Folksmen song on the Super Bowl!'

"(CNN) -- Don Henley, a founding member of ""The Eagles,"" is suing a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, claiming the candidate is misusing two of his popular songs. Don Henley performs at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival on May 2, 2008. The suit filed Friday in federal court in California claims Charles DeVore is using Henley's hit songs ""The Boys of Summer"" and ""All She Wants to Do Is Dance"" without authorization. The suit comes from two campaign videos that DeVore posted on YouTube that used Henley's music, according to the lawsuit. In one of the videos, DeVore's campaign changed the words of ""All She Wants to Do Is Dance"" to lyrics that attacked Sen. Barbara Boxer, the lawsuit alleges. Mike Campbell, who co-wrote ""Boys of Summer,"" is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. ""Don Henley and Mike Campbell brought this action to protect their song, 'The Boys of Summer,' which was taken and used without their permission,"" Henley's spokesman said. ""The infringers have vowed to continue exploiting this and other copyrighted works, as it suits them, to further their own ambitions and agenda. It was necessary to file a lawsuit to stop them."" DeVore, a member of the California State Assembly, is running against Boxer, a Democrat, in the 2010 election, according to his Web site. DeVore mentions Henley's legal actions on the Web site. ""We're responding with a counter-claim, asserting our First Amendment right to political free speech,"" the site said. ""While the legal issues play out, it's time to up the ante on Mr. Henley's liberal goon tactics. By popular request, I have penned the words to our new parody song.""

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. After a one-on-one interview with President Obama on Wednesday, CNN en Español's Juan Carlos López is traveling with Obama to Mexico City and to the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderón in Mexico City on Thursday. MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- It's the return of an American president to Mexico City. Although George W. Bush visited the country several times, he never made it to this city of more than 20 million people, and it is President Obama's first visit to Latin America. Obama's relationship with Mexico started on shaky ground, although the first foreign leader he met with as president-elect was Mexican President Felipe Calderón. Reports from the Pentagon and the CIA considered that Mexico was at risk of becoming a failed state, something that didn't sit well with the Calderón government. Washington corrected course and even admitted its own responsibility in Mexico's growing drug war, which killed 6,000 last year alone. Statements by Cabinet members and Obama himself calmed things down, but tensions arose again. Congress ended a pilot program that allowed Mexican trucks into U.S. territory, as contemplated in the North America Free Trade Agreement; Mexico, in line with the treaty, retaliated by imposing fees on 90 U.S. products. Even so, the bilateral relationship is at a high point and large-scale protests aren't expected when Obama visits the Mexican capital. But there are pending issues, such as immigration reform, trade and a pressing question in this capital: Who will the next U.S. ambassador be? Local media have been reporting that Carlos Pascual, a Cuban-American expert on Europe and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, is Obama's choice, but the fact that he wrote a report for the Brookings Institute on Iraq and the importance of reconstructing a failed state wasn't well received in political and government circles. Obama and Calderón have a lot to sort out in this one-day visit. Then comes the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, where Obama will face 33 heads of state, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who called Obama ignorant on Latin-American issues, and other leaders who want Cuba, a member of the Organization of American States suspended since 1962, to be reinstated. Although Obama lifted some restrictions on travel and remittances to the island by Cuban-Americans, many in the region want more, including the lifting of the decades-old embargo, something Obama says he is not considering. It is not clear if Obama will be welcomed in the same way he was by Europe two weeks ago, but so far the signs are positive -- to have a U.S. president saying he is willing to listen to and treat Latin American neighbors as equals is something the region isn't used to.","Lopez: Obama's relationship with Mexico started on shaky ground .

"(CNN) --     More than 5,000 patients of a South Dakota urology clinic may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV when the facility reused single-use medical products, state health officials said Friday. Clinic workers told inspectors they've been reusing products since the clinic opened its doors in 2002. The Siouxland Urology Center in Dakota Dunes has been ordered to contact nearly 5,700 former patients treated there since 2002. A routine inspection found the facility was reusing sterile saline bags, tubing and other medical supplies from cystoscopies -- a diagnostic procedure that looks at the lower urinary tract. ""We witnessed the practice while we were in the facility,"" during a January inspection, said Barb Buhler of the South Dakota Health Department. Siouxland Urology has since been put under a provisional license and has been very cooperative, according to state officials. ""Siouxland Urology Center informed certain of its patients by U.S. mail that a prior cystoscopy procedure could have potentially exposed them to an infectious disease,"" the facility's Web site said. It added that ""the risk of infection from our past procedure is very minimal and we are unaware of any blood infections in our patients caused by the cystoscopy practice."" The clinic, which primarily serves clients from South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska, is offering free blood tests to those possibly affected to rule out the presence of viruses .Watch more on the possible exposure of urology patients » . On January 21, South Dakota Department of Health inspectors entered an examining room where a cystoscopy was about to take place, and noticed that a saline bag, which was hanging on a pole, was dated January 19, said Bob Stahl, of the South Dakota Department of Health. The inspectors, who are registered nurses, questioned the clinic staff. The clinic staff said they routinely reused saline bags and tubing, although both are clearly marked ""for single use only,"" Stahl said. ""They used the bags and tubing on multiple patients,"" Stahl said. He said the workers at the clinic told the inspectors they'd been reusing bags and tubing since the clinic opened in 2002. They said they didn't see anything wrong with the practice, Stahl said. ""It was their standard operating procedure,"" Stahl said. ""They told the inspectors that this was a common practice all over the country. We disagreed and told them this was not a common practice."" He said that the clinic had been inspected seven times since it opened, and no one had noticed that the clinic was reusing equipment. ""It was just by chance that this saline bag was hanging there. We run across these things by luck at times,"" Stahl said. ""We're fortunate that the team was able to identify this."" Fluids from patients can retreat into saline bags and tubing while the equipment is used, and reusing the tubing or saline bags could put patients at risk for contacting diseases from previous patients. A 1-liter bag of saline and tubing costs about $4, according to Mary Jo Lallis, account manager for PSS World Medical, Inc., a medical supply company. CNN's Greg Morrison and Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.","Thousands of patients of a urology clinic possibly exposed to hepatitis and HIV .

"(CNN) -- Pirates captured a Belgian ship and said they were taking it to the coast of Somalia after the vessel was reported missing early Saturday, NATO and pirate sources told CNN. The Dutch frigate De Zeven Provincien tracked seven pirates Saturday back to their mother ship. The Pompei, a Belgian-registered ship believed to have a mostly Belgian and Croatian crew, was one of two vessels that came under attack near the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles on Saturday, the sources said. The second ship escaped the attack after a brief exchange of gunfire with pirate vessels, the pirate source added. Meanwhile, Dutch naval forces captured seven pirates and freed 20 captive fishermen after tracking the pirates to their ""mother ship"" in the western Gulf of Aden on Saturday, a NATO maritime spokesman said. The Belgian government tried to communicate with the Pompei ""without success"" before the ship was confirmed to have been hijacked, according to an official.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . ""This morning we received two different channels, a silent alert, that there was a problem on the boat, which is a Belgian boat on its way to Seychelles,"" Belgium Government Crisis Center spokesman Peter Martens told reporters. ""We tried to have a contact with the ship but without success until now."" The archipelago where the attack occurred is roughly 800 miles off the Somali coastline. ""Somali pirates are getting wilder and out of control,"" pirate spokesman Ali Sugulle said on April 11. ""They go too far away from the Somali [coast] and go to the Kenyan coast even."" The European Union, NATO and the United States have been patrolling the waters off Somalia since an upsurge in piracy in the region last year. No NATO vessels were in the region at the time of the attack, said Cmdr. Chris Davies from NATO's Maritime Component Command Headquarters in Northwood, England. Meanwhile, the Dutch rescue operation happened after pirates launched an unsuccessful attack on petroleum tanker MT Handytankers Magic, NATO Cmdr. Chris Davies told CNN. The Dutch frigate De Zeven Provincien was with the NATO fleet patrolling the region. After the Dutch disarmed the pirates, they released them, Shona Lowe, a spokeswoman from the maritime headquarters, told CNN. Because the crew was on a NATO mission, they lacked the jurisdiction to hold them, according to reports. The MT Handytankers Magic is part of a fleet belonging to Handytankers, a company that distributes petroleum products in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the United States, according to the company's Web site. Last week pirates attacked a U.S.-flagged ship, the Maersk Alabama, off the Somali coast.  The crew regained control of the ship but the captain was taken hostage and held for five days on a lifeboat.  The crisis ended when U.S. Navy sharpshooters shot and killed three of the pirates who were holding the captain.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama on Tuesday left open the possibility of criminal prosecution for Bush administration officials who drew up the legal basis for interrogation techniques that many view as torture. President Obama says any congressional investigation should be conducted in a bipartisan fashion. Obama said it will be up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether or not to prosecute the former officials. ""With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions, I would say that is going to be more a decision for the attorney general within the parameter of various laws, and I don't want to prejudge that,"" Obama said during a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House. ""There's a host of very complicated issues involved there. As a general deal, I think we should be looking forward and not backward. ""I do worry about this getting so politicized that we cannot function effectively, and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations.""  Watch as Obama says U.S. can be protected and live up to its ideals » . The president added that any congressional ""accounting of what took place"" should be done ""in a bipartisan fashion outside of the typical hearing process that can sometimes break down ... entirely along party lines."" It is important, he said, for the ""American people to feel as if this is not being dealt with to provide one side or another political advantage."" Obama's remarks came five days after the administration released four Bush-era memos detailing the use of terror interrogations such as waterboarding, a technique used to simulate drowning. One memo showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding -- which Obama has called torture -- at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects. Obama reiterated his belief that he did not think it is appropriate to prosecute those CIA officials and others who carried out the interrogations in question. ""This has been a difficult chapter in our history and one of [my] tougher decisions,"" he added. The techniques listed in memos ""reflected ... us losing our moral bearings."" The president's apparent willingness to leave the door open to a prosecution of Bush officials seemed to contradict White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who indicated Sunday that the administration was opposed to such an action. Obama believes ""that's not the place that we [should] go,"" Emanuel said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""It's not a time to use our energy ... looking back [with] any sense of anger and retribution."" On Monday, Obama asserted during a visit to CIA headquarters that he had released the documents primarily because of the ""exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos, particularly the fact that so much of the information was [already] public. ...

"BELLINGHAM, Washington (CNN) -- After 11 years of living illegally in the United States, it was not until Gerardo Arreola Gonzalez was nearly deported that he finally received permission to work here. No longer illegal: Gerardo Arreola Gonzalez holds up the card authorizing his employment in the United States. Arreola was one of 28 illegal immigrant workers arrested in February after agents from U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement raided a car engine repair business. According to the immigrants, a small army of federal agents surrounded Yamato Engine Specialists in Bellingham Washington, and began searching for workers who could not show they had authorization to work in the United States. ""My blood ran cold,"" Arreola said in Spanish. ""We went to the back door, but they were waiting for us. There was a bus already there, and they put us on it."" As he was being taken to an immigration detention center, Arreola said he thought of his wife and the five children they have had while living here and who are U.S. citizens by birth. He expected to be deported back to Mexico, Arreola said, and he was doubtful about when he would see his family again. ""I would have been there and they would have been here,"" he said. ""I would have had to come back. I couldn't take them there. My children don't know anything about Mexico. They go to school here.""  Watch Arreola and others discuss the raid » . Typically, cases like Arreola's end in deportation. According to ICE, some 5,173 people were arrested last year in similar worksite raids. However, the Bellingham raid was the first of its kind to take place during the Obama administration. During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Obama's criticism of government immigration policies that split up families had given some people in immigrant communities hope that the raids would end if he were elected. ""Under the Obama administration, we didn't expect it to happen that people would be dragged out in handcuffs,"" said Rosalinda Guillen, a Bellingham immigrant rights advocate. Many in the area strongly opposed the raid, Guillen said. ""This is a really heavy Obama-supporting county,"" she said. ""So a lot of folks here had been in involved in the election."" Immediately after the raid, she said, ""the calls, the e-mails started and networks were activated."" Guillen said the controversy over the raid was featured heavily on Hispanic radio stations and that a charity called Los Niños Fund was created to help the children of the jailed immigrants. During a hearing before the House Committee on Homeland Security the day after the Bellingham raid, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano distanced herself from the action. Worksite enforcements, she said, should focus ""on employers who intentionally and knowingly exploit the illegal labor market."" Napolitano promised lawmakers that she would ""get to the bottom"" of what happened in Bellingham. Napolitano's comments turned the heat up on the already boiling debate over how immigration policies should be reformed. ""Get to the bottom of what? Law enforcement officers enforcing the law?"" asked Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit group that advocates more border security and decreasing the number of illegal immigrants entering the country. ""The message is if you are hiring illegal aliens, 'no problem.' If you are in the country illegally, unless you commit a serious felony we are not going to bother you, so it's a de facto amnesty,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if the administration cannot get an amnesty through Congress this year, what they are going to do is through administrative decisions allow everybody to remain here and send the signal that more people are welcome."" Amy Kudwa, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said there was no policy shift and that other worksite immigration inspections had taken place since the Bellingham raid. But Rosalinda Guillen said people in the pro-immigrant rights community were heartened by the fact that shortly after Napolitano ordered a review of the Bellingham case the immigrant workers who were still in immigration detention were released. ""I was just flabbergasted,"" Guillen said. And the same immigration agents who had arrested the workers, she said, now promised them visas that would allow them to work temporarily in the U.S. ""Homeland Security drove them to the place where they had to go to fill out the paperwork for the work permits,"" she said ""That is totally unheard of."" A spokeswoman for the ICE Seattle office declined to comment on the case because the raid is under review and the investigation into the company where the immigrants worked is still ongoing. Several days after the workers' release, ICE agents again searched Yamato Engine Specialists. The company did not respond to repeated CNN requests for comment, but a statement posted on its Web site reads: ""It has been and continues to be Yamato's policy to hire people only if they meet the legal requirements for employment."" Several of the workers who were arrested said immigration agents have asked if they suffered any abuse while working for Yamato. Gerardo Arreola Gonzalez said the company did not mistreat him during the months he worked there soldering car engines. But Yamato did not verify his immigration status when he first arrived at the company, Arreola said. ""I filled out my application and did the interview. They asked if my papers were good,"" Arreola said. ""You say 'yes,' otherwise you don't get the job.""","Immigration raid led to detention of 28 people in Washington state .

"(CNN) -- President Obama, visiting CIA headquarters Monday, defended his decision to release Bush-era memos on interrogation tactics, saying the country will ultimately be stronger as a result. President Obama met with CIA workers and Director Leon Panetta, left, in Virginia on Monday. The president's remarks came in the wake of criticism from a former CIA chief and others that his decision compromised national security and encouraged terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. Obama also met with CIA Director Leon Panetta, Deputy Director Stephen Kappes and other officials, and talked to employees about the importance of the agency's mission to national security. The president asserted that he had released the documents primarily because of the ""exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos, particularly the fact that so much of the information was [already] public. ... The covert nature of the information had been compromised.""  Watch Obama talk about ""exceptional circumstances"" » . Obama added that he ended the controversial interrogation techniques mentioned in the memos because the United States ""is stronger and more secure"" when it can deploy both power and the ""power of our values, including the rule of law."" ""What makes the United States special ... is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy, even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so,"" he said.  Watch Obama talk about the importance of values » . Although abiding by the rule of law can make battling groups such as al Qaeda more difficult, he added, it is ultimately why ""we'll defeat our enemies. We're on the better side of history."" Panetta, while introducing the president, promised that the CIA would abide by the president's order barring controversial enhanced interrogation techniques. He also agreed that it was possible to protect the country and its values at the same time. Obama's visit to the CIA's Langley, Virginia, headquarters came a day after former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the decision to release the four memos undermined the work the agency is doing. Hayden, President George W. Bush's CIA director from 2006 to 2009, said the release of the memos emboldens terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. ""What we have described for our enemies in the midst of a war are the outer limits that any American would ever go to in terms of interrogating an al Qaeda terrorist. That's very valuable information,"" Hayden said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""By taking techniques off the table, we have made it more difficult in a whole host of circumstances I can imagine, more difficult for CIA officers to defend the nation."" He added, ""if you look at what this really comprises, if you look at the documents that have been made public, it says 'top secret' at the top. The definition of top secret is information which, if revealed, would cause grave harm to U.S. security."" Obama said last week that withholding the memos ""would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time."" ""This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States,"" he said in a statement. The memos include details on terrorist suspect interrogations such as waterboarding, a technique used to simulate drowning. Obama has called the method torture. One memo showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects. The administration also has come under criticism from human rights organizations after announcing that CIA officials would not be prosecuted for past waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics.  Watch for details on the interrogation techniques » . Obama believes ""that's not the place that we go,"" White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""It's not a time to use our energy ... looking back [with] any sense of anger and retribution."" Attorney General Eric Holder has promised that officials who used such interrogation tactics would be in the clear if their actions were consistent with Justice Department legal advice under which they were operating at the time. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Sunday that the release of the memos is consistent with how Obama conducts government. ""It's about transparency. It's about accountability. And he released them. And on the other hand, he said to those CIA employees who were following what the Department of Justice told them they could do, they would not be subject to further prosecution, because it's also about closing this chapter so we can move on to the future,"" Napolitano said.","Release has been criticized as damaging to national security .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Muzquiz was ""goth"" in high school. She had, and still has, multicolored hair, a ""face full of piercings,"" and an all-black wardrobe, even though she no longer identifies with the goth subculture. And while her style had always earned her her fair share of strange glances, she says everything changed for the worse after the Columbine school shootings on April 20, 1999. Jennifer Muzquiz, in all black, decided to study at home after feeling shunned as a goth after Columbine. It was on that day that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and teachers in a shooting spree at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The massacre was one of the deadliest school shootings in history, and it had a profound effect on students and teachers across the country. As the media and the public groped for meaning behind the incident, there were plenty of theories about the motive behind the massacre. One of these was that Harris and Klebold were members of the goth subculture, or ""trench-coat mafia"" as they were known at Columbine, and thus had been outcasts. This theory has been widely refuted, but for goth students around the country, the damage was done. ""As a result [of Columbine], the public were afraid of the 'goths' and 'punks' and 'metalheads' at school,"" says Muzquiz, who was a high school senior at the time. ""Parents, often successfully, lobbied to get trench coats and all-black attire banned in their local schools. School administrators started considering these groups to be gangs and harassment of students was rampant, with unwarranted backpack searches, detainment in the hallways by security guards, and being called into the administrative offices for questioning."" Rumors ran rampant about kids who ""looked like they were going to bring a gun to school,"" and Muzquiz says her classmates quickly learned if they wanted to cause trouble for a student, all they had to do was report that student had a list of enemies. ""They could simply report to administrators that the person had an 'enemies list' and the school would quickly swoop in to rectify the situation, even when it wasn't the truth. ... The accused would forever be known as 'the kid with the list' and ostracized,"" she says. Because of this and the new dress code restrictions, her goth friends ""were afraid to go to school."" Muzquiz herself caught so much flak for her appearance that she went into home studies. And though she was no longer in school, discrimination couldn't be avoided. People in town would cross to the other side of the street to avoid her and her friends, she says. iReport.com: 'Sadly, teens still tend to shun those who are different than they are' Muzquiz was even interviewed by the national media about her experiences after Columbine. At first she regretted it and feared backlash. ""I had already gotten enough crap since Columbine about wearing all black,"" she says. But she was glad she did it after receiving e-mails from other students who identified with her and thanked her for the interviews, including one girl who was suicidal until reading an article about her. ""One girl even had e-mailed me and said [she] was coming home to write a suicide note ... and kill herself after school. She read the article about me and it made her think twice,"" says Muzquiz. ""In the article, I said it's not worth letting these people get to you. It's not up to them to tell you that you're wrong. She thanked me."" ""[To have] a 14-year-old e-mail me ... it was just, like, whoa, I don't care who says anything bad ... I helped someone,"" says Muzquiz. ""To this day that just sticks with me. Anything I do in my life -- nothing's going to measure to that, the fact that I helped someone realize that there's more to life."" Things changed for teachers after Columbine, too. Many say they realized they weren't just responsible for their students' knowledge, but for their overall well-being. ""Life was never the same after that day,"" says Barbara Rademacher, a veteran teacher from Rogers, Arkansas. Schools across the country instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks and metal detectors, and teachers were trained to deal with violent behavior. But more than that, says Rademacher, ""teachers and students are always just a little afraid."" ""What Columbine said to me as an educator was that we in the education community hold people's lives in our hands. ... We as educators have a much higher duty, a much higher call, than just to teach our subject areas. ... Columbine was to education what 9/11 was to the United States: a shattering wake-up call, a disaster so profound, it permanently changed our world view.""  iReport.com: 'Education is literally a matter of life and death' Kym Godwin remembers a similar wake-up call after the shooting. She was a first-year teacher in Ilwaco, Washington, at the time. ""I think most people who go into teaching have the desire to go out there and change the world and enlighten kids and bring them to this great level of knowledge,"" she says. ""I remember when it happened, all of a sudden, it was like: 'How can I give them all of this knowledge if I can't keep them safe?' I realized at that moment that my job wasn't just giving them academic learning, it was also about protecting them and making them feel like they're in a safe place."" This realization hit home for her when her school had a lockdown. Teenagers from another part of town had entered the school, allegedly looking for a student there. A school security guard apprehended them right outside the door to Godwin's classroom. ""I remember thinking, what would happen if somebody actually walked in the door? ... And that's when it hit me, that the kids have to be able to trust me as their teacher to protect them regardless of who walks through that door. I told the kids, this is real, and I am the one in control and I will protect you. ... And I found out afterward that virtually every teacher in the building did the exact same thing. The kids looked to us and knew we were there to keep them safe."" Godwin also means ""safe"" in a different way. It includes protecting her students from physical harm, yes, but also protecting them from bullying or social stigmas that could potentially lead to violent behavior. Some investigators have said there is evidence to suggest the Columbine shooters were victims of bullying or ostracism, and Godwin says this is a nationwide problem. ""What happened at Columbine could happen virtually anywhere. Kids get picked on, and it could get to a point where they snap. They're human beings,"" she says.  iReport.com: 'My students are my kids'","Columbine shootings forever changed atmosphere in schools nationwide .

"(CNN) -- The Sri Lankan army launched an operation against Tamil rebels in the country's north early Monday, the military said, claiming to have rescued thousands of civilians trapped in a government safe zone. The Sri Lankan army has relaunched its attacks on Tamil rebels in the country's north. A rebel Web site, TamilNet, said government forces were engaged in a fresh ground offensive. A TamilNet correspondent in Vanni reported heavy shelling, rocket fire and gunfire. Thirty civilians died in shelling Sunday, rebels said. The government of Sri Lanka has been battling the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) rebels in a civil conflict that has lasted nearly 25 years. ""Thousands of civilians who had been forcibly held by the LTTE terrorists in the government declared No Fire Zone (NFZ) were rescued early hours this morning, 20 April, as the troops engaged in a massive scale rescue mission, were able to open a safe passage for the civilians,"" the Ministry of Defense Web site said. More than 10,000 civilians are trying to seek refuge with soldiers, the military said. The upsurge in hostilities follows a two-day cessation last week for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. The U.S. State Department on Thursday called for a cease-fire between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tigers to allow civilians to escape the fighting. ""We call upon the government and military of Sri Lanka, and the Tamil Tigers, to immediately stop hostilities until the more than 140,000 civilians in the conflict area are safely out,"" acting spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement. ""Both sides must immediately return to a humanitarian pause and both must respect the right of free movement of those civilian men, women and children trapped by the fighting.""  Watch the heavy toll of fighting on civilians » . A brief cessation of hostilities  announced by the Sri Lankan government on April 12 allowed the United Nations and its partners to bring in aid, but a renewed government offensive has left civilians trapped in a war zone. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his humanitarian chief John Holmes called the brief halt in fighting inadequate and have pushed for a longer humanitarian pause in fighting. The most pressing concern now, according to Holmes, is the fact that more than 100,000 people are crowded in a ""very small pocket of land"" that is about five square miles, or about twice the size of New York's Central Park. ""It is a very small area indeed for what we believe is a very large number of people,"" Holmes told reporters Wednesday. Overcrowding is also a problem in camps housing displaced people, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). As of Monday, some 65,000 displaced people were crammed into camps in Vavuniya, Jaffna and Mannar, with 35,000 more expected to arrive within 48 hours, the organization said in a statement. ' UNICEF said it feared for children trapped in the escalating fighting and is worried that the worst is yet to come. The group appealed for donations to help cover ""the most immediate needs of the affected population in health and nutrition, water and sanitation, protection and education."" The crowded population, primarily comprised of Tamil civilians, is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults. The British and French foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on Wednesday, saying that the Tamil Tigers are using Tamil civilians as human shields. The Tigers have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict officially began in 1983. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Monday that it has helped evacuate more than 10,000 sick and injured patients, and their caregivers, from Putumattalan in rebel-held territory since February. ""These evacuations have saved many lives,"" said Morven Murchinson, the Red Cross medical coordinator in Sri Lanka. ""It is vital that they continue, because more sick and wounded people are arriving every day at the makeshift medical facilities in Putumattalan."" The Red Cross says there's an acute shortage of medical supplies in the region, which it is trying to rectify.","NEW: Fears voiced by UNICEF for children trapped in the escalating fighting .

"ABUSIR, Egypt (CNN) -- Today, I met Cleopatra's lawyer. Well, not her lawyer but someone who is determined to defend the legendary queen against centuries of bad publicity. Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist from the Dominican Republic, wants to mend Cleopatra's tattered reputation. Kathleen Martinez is a young archaeologist from the Dominican Republic who has toiled for three years on a barren hillside overlooking the coastal highway linking Alexandria with the Libyan border. According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located. I met Martinez in a dusty tomb full of bones at the excavation site. She recounted to me that, as a young girl, she listened in on a scholarly discussion in her father's library about Cleopatra. ""They were speaking very badly about her and about her image,"" she recalled. ""I got very upset. I said I didn't believe what they are saying, that I needed to study more about her."" Martinez went on to earn a law degree but continued to be fascinated by the saga of Cleopatra. Four years ago, she managed to convince Zahi Hawass, the untiring director of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, to allow her to start excavating at Abusir. Her fascination with -- and admiration for -- Cleopatra is intense. The last queen of Ancient Egypt, she told me, ""spoke nine languages, she was a philosopher, she was a poet, she was a politician, she was a goddess, and she was a warrior."" In short, Martinez believes, Cleopatra was a woman way ahead of her times. And given that history is written by the victors -- in Cleopatra's case, the Romans -- her press was somewhat less than complimentary. It was ""bad propaganda,"" in Martinez's words. For that reason, she told me, ""I want to be Cleopatra's lawyer."" With Hawass, Martinez is now working on a book about Cleopatra to repair all that damage. The tale of Antony and Cleopatra has fueled the popular imagination for centuries. Ill-fated lovers were a favorite theme for William Shakespeare, and the Roman noble and the Egyptian queen certainly fit the bill. Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra. In his youth, he led a life of heavy drinking and womanizing. According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Antony accumulated debts of 250 talents, the equivalent of $5 million, before reaching 20. To escape his creditors in Rome, he fled to Greece, where he studied with the philosophers of Athens, before being called to join the Roman legions in the east, then serving under Julius Caesar. After Caesar's assassination, Marc Antony became embroiled in a series of power struggles and eventually ended up in Egypt. Egypt was the enemy of his former ally, Octavian, who would go on to become the Emperor Augustus, the first emperor of Rome. Octavian defeated Antony's forces at the battle of Actium in 30 B.C. Shortly afterward, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, he by his own sword, she by a poisonous asp. Octavian, according to Plutarch, allowed them to be buried together ""in splendid and regal fashion."" But no one knows where. The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks. Was Cleopatra a stunning beauty a la Elizabeth Taylor, or somewhat less spectacular? Researchers from Newcastle University in England claimed in 2007 that, based upon coins found from the period, she was quite homely, with ""a shallow forehead, long, pointed nose, narrow lips and a sharply pointed chin.""  See gallery of tomb that might be Cleopatra's » . The same researchers didn't have a very flattering assessment of Marc Antony either, saying he had ""bulging eyes, a large hooked nose and a thick neck."" No Richard Burton. This does contradict Plutarch's description of Marc Antony as having ""a noble dignity of form; and a shapely beard, a broad forehead, and an aquiline nose [that] were thought to show the virile qualities peculiar to the portraits and statues of Hercules""? Hawass hasn't had much to say in defense of Marc Antony, but he claims the coins found in Abusir show Cleopatra was ""beautiful."" At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness. ""The only thing you can see here is her nose is a bit big."" That's because, Hawass insisted, ""when you draw a face on a coin you cannot draw the beauty of a queen, and therefore I think that the lady who captured the hearts of Julius Caesar and Marc Antony cannot have been ugly."" Egyptians, who are intensely proud of their country and its ancient heritage, may be forgiven for their insistence on this point. I tend to take the middle ground on this one. Beauty is more than skin deep, and what seems to have captivated Julius Caesar and Marc Antony was not physical but rather inner beauty.  Watch report from CNN's Ben Wedeman on Cleopatra » . Plutarch wrote in his ""Life of Antony"" that ""for her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her."" In other words, she was plain. Plutarch goes on to write, however, that she was intelligent, charming and has ""sweetness in the tones of her voice."" The mystery of what Cleopatra really looked like may never be solved. In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt. Others include the obvious ones: How were the pyramids built? Who built them? Why were they built? How old is the Sphinx? Hawass dismisses with lusty contempt the people who espouse the more fantastic theories (that aliens built the pyramids, that the Sphinx is more than 10,000 years old), labeling them ""pyramidiots."" But there are other historical mysteries out there that have yet to be answered. Some archaeologists are trying to find the tomb of Alexander the Great (who died in Babylon but, according to some ancient historians, was buried in Egypt). Others are searching for the remains of the lost army of Cambyses -- 50,000 soldiers dispatched on a mission by the Persian Emperor to attack the Oracle of Amon (today's Siwa Oasis in western Egypt) only to disappear during a sandstorm in the Sahara Desert. There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra. Alas, the enthusiasts are going to have to be patient. The summer residence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is just down the road from the site. For security reasons, no one is allowed on the hillside where the excavations are taking place from May through November. So unless Mubarak decides to overrule his security detail, the solving of this mystery will have to be put on hold for at least another five months. We've waited 2,000 years. I guess we can wait a few more months.","Kathleen Martinez has toiled for three years in Egypt looking for Cleopatra's tomb .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- For 65 years, Elisabeth Mann has carried with her the pain only a Holocaust survivor can know. Elisabeth Mann, the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust, sits with her children, Nancy and Thomas. The only one in her Hungarian Jewish family to make it out of the Nazi death camps, life for a long time felt like punishment. Branded in her mind are the images of, for example, a pile of babies set ablaze, snarling dogs and the laughter of an SS officer pointing to the black smoke of incinerated bodies that filled the sky. And on her heavy heart is the anguish, including the blame she feels for her brother Laci's death. He was 13 and not feeling well when the family arrived by cattle car at Auschwitz-Birkenau.  Watch Mann describe the brutal trip to the camp » . ""I told him to go with my mother because mothers are the people who take care of sick children,"" she cried, while sitting in her Los Angeles, California, home. ""I didn't know that with my advice I killed my brother because all the mothers and all the children were taken to the gas chamber right away."" Given the horrors she's lived and witnessed, one might think Mann, now in her 80s, would be among those demanding that Nazi war criminals be brought to justice. And yet she's uncomfortable with the ongoing attempts to deport to Germany for trial John Demjanjuk, an 89-year-old Cleveland, Ohio, man allegedly linked to mass killings at Sobibor, a death camp in Poland. Demjanjuk insists it wasn't him. The pursuit of him -- and of suspects like him -- isn't one Mann supports. She said she never wanted revenge, because ""I did not want to be like them."" Mann doesn't think going after war criminals now is worth the cost and energy, nor does she think the legal process will make a difference to such men who've already lived a full life.  Watch Mann explain why money is wasted in the hunt » . ""What is punishment for a person who is capable to do such horror, such horrible things to living people?"" Mann, an artist, wondered aloud. ""I cannot imagine that that person has a soul or conscience or heart. ... He simply wouldn't feel it. ... What kind of punishment could you give to a person like that?"" Her argument doesn't work for Efraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, a systematic effort that wiped out 6 million Jews, or two-thirds of European Jewry. ""It has to be clear to everybody that the Holocaust was not a natural disaster. ... It was created by man, against man,"" he said from Jerusalem, Israel, where he coordinates Nazi war crimes research for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. ""When responsibility can be determined, people have to be held accountable."" On Monday, the day before Holocaust Remembrance Day, the center released its latest status report on Nazi war criminal investigations and prosecutions. Demjanjuk tops the list of the 10 most wanted. Others on the list include Sandor Kepiro, a former Hungarian officer who allegedly helped kill 1,200 people in Novi Sad, Serbia, as well as Milivoj Asner, a onetime Croatian police chief, now believed to be living in Austria, who allegedly persecuted and deported to the Nazi camps hundreds of Jews, Serbs and Gypsies. In a written statement about the report, Zuroff said that since the start of 2001, there have been 76 convictions, at least 48 indictments, and hundreds of investigations have been launched. Central to these actions has been a project Zuroff has helped oversee called Operation: Last Chance, a push -- started in 2002 -- to support worldwide government efforts to pursue aging Nazi war crime suspects. While some countries have stepped up, including the U.S., Germany, Serbia and Spain, others, such as Australia, Austria and Ukraine, have shown a ""lack of political will"" and have failed to act, the statement says. ""The easiest thing in the world is to just forget,"" Zuroff, 60, said by phone. ""The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the murderers. ... We don't think people deserve a prize for reaching an old age."" Mann's own children couldn't agree more. Like Zuroff, they think pursuing Nazi war criminals is the least that can be done to honor victims. ""I'm definitely in favor of going after these folks, regardless of their age,"" said Mann's daughter, Nancy. ""A lot of people suffered, and are still suffering, because of the crimes that were done in the past.""  Watch daughter explain that 'murder is murder' » . Thomas, Mann's son, said that going after Nazi war criminals ""sends a message to our society and the world that it's not OK to do these things,"" and that it helps bring awareness ""to people who don't know about the Holocaust, and there are lots of them.""  Watch son on why punishment falls short » . He told the story of a college freshman in Southern California who stood up during a presentation his mother was giving and said she'd never heard of the Holocaust.

"(CNN) -- Walking into the Khatmul Nabeen Masjid (mosque), you can for a moment forget that you're in Afghanistan. Beautiful buildings, walkways, flowerbeds and even a grass soccer pitch. Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be behind the law. Young men and women, dressed in Muslim attire, walk around freely and with smiles. Smiles are a bit of a rarity in today's Kabul, a polluted city of survival and despair, so this was both shocking and refreshing to me. We didn't have an appointment but we were hoping to interview Mohammed Asif Mohseni, a conservative Shia cleric. He is said to be the man behind the controversial Shia state law, a law critics say strips Afghan Shia women of many rights. While security was checking our bags, one guard said that Mohseni had been waiting for us. I tried explaining that we did not have an appointment. Nonetheless, we were sent back to where Mohseni was waiting. Before entering the room I was cautioned by a guard to make sure none of my hair was showing below my headscarf. They were apologetic; one even asked me to zip up my sweater higher because too much of my neck was exposed. I complied, tucking in my hair and zipping my sweater as high as it could go. Now paranoid about the design holes in my scarf that exposed parts of my hair, I took off my shoes to enter. As we walked in, Mohseni, an older man with a white beard wearing a Shia-style turban called a ""dulband"" was sitting on a brown couch. He looked at the two men who brought us in and said, ""These aren't the two I was waiting for."" I explained that we just showed up for an interview because we did not have a number to reach him. He smiled and said, ""I guess you are in luck."" Mohseni welcomed us and asked me to translate his warm welcome to our Scottish cameraman. As the interview started, I noticed that Mohseni avoided my eyes. I wondered if it was because I was female. I was also prepared for verbal attacks; a journalist friend told me that when he brought a western journalist to interview Mohseni a few days ago, the journalist ended up having more questions thrown at him than he was able to ask. But it didn't take long for Mohseni to warm up and explain why Shia state law is just and a part of Islam. Those who don't agree don't understand it, he said. ""The law ... which I created I see as correct for both men and women,"" he said. ""We have given rights to both men and women, even better than rights given to women in the West. We give women more in this law."" I asked him about reports that if a woman does not comply in having sexual relations with her husband, then the husband can refuse to feed her. ""Yes, I said that,"" Mohseni said looking me in the eye. ""When a couple marries, sex is a part of marriage, and they agree to that."" He went on to explain that a woman isn't obliged to have sexual relations every single night or if she is told by her doctor to refrain. But otherwise it is her obligation and something she signed up for when she got married. He calls it the wife's duty. Mohseni added that a wife wearing makeup ""prevents a man from thinking about other women on the streets and he can just think of his wife."" He continued: ""It is natural that women (wear makeup). Don't they in the West? Their women wear it on the streets and in shops. Women should put make-up on for their husbands as it will increase the love and attraction between the two."" The cleric also explained that a woman is not required to ask the permission of a man to leave the house if she has a job and needs to go to work. But they do need to get permission if they are leaving for other reasons. More importantly, he said, a couple needs to make clear the day they marry whether or not she will need permission to leave the home. If they disagree then they should not get married. ""Like, you are working for CNN,"" he said. ""If your boss tells you, you'll be working for 8 hours a day, then you're responsible for that. It's the same here. They both have to agree on it."" According to Mohseni, the West is imposing its beliefs on the Muslim world because they don't understand. However, it's not just people in the West who are opposed to this law. Many Afghans, men and women, have vehemently resisted it. They fear it will set women back after the progress that has been made in the last seven years. Sima Samar, head of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, has been working for a year now, trying to amend certain articles within the law. ""I feel discriminated. Clear-cut. I don't feel equal in this country,"" she told us. Samar said the law does not represent Islam. It blatantly contradicts the constitution of Afghanistan, which states that men and women are equal. Critics have labeled the law as ""Talibanistic,"" but Samar says even many of the Taliban's actions were not enshrined in law. She admitted that a law for Shias is necessary but that it should be what is stated in Sharia or Islamic Law. ""One of the very important pillars in Islam is justice, there is no justice in this law,"" she said. Samar also pointed out the absurdities in the law, such as the edict on makeup. ""If she doesn't (put on make-up), will the husband go complain to the police that she didn't put (on) the lipstick? Or, 'I like red but she put on pink.'"" However, Samar didn't blame the clerics alone for creating the new law; she blamed various parts of the government for allowing it to pass. ""I think they -- all of them -- took the whole issue very superficially. And none of the state institutions, ministry of justice, parliament, senate and the office of the president, really didn't look at the law as serious as they should,"" she said.","Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be man behind Shia State Law .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Police think it started with a dispute over an ex-girlfriend. Threats were made on social networking sites and via text messages. The suspects, clockwise from top left are: Lernio Colin, Angel Cruz, Peter MacDonald and Christopher Harter. A murder plot was hatched and, police say, in the early hours of last Saturday morning, a Florida man was gunned down in his car. But the suspects apparently killed  the wrong man. Now four men are in custody, and will face charges of first degree premeditated murder and two counts of attempted murder. The four are Angel Cruz, 23; his brother from Oregon, Christopher Harter, 29; Peter MacDonald, 18; and Lernio Colin, 20. They have all appeared before a judge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They have not entered pleas and are being held without bond, according to state prosecutors. Detectives are executing search warrants today, and much about the case is still not known. ""The victim was with two other males, in the vehicle,"" said Mike Jachles of the Broward Sheriff's Office. ""One of those men was the intended target,"" Jachles told CNN. Witnesses said multiple shots were fired, according to police. Henry Mancilla, 24 was sitting in the driver's seat of a gold Mitsubishi Galant at an intersection in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. ""They were exiting the vehicle when shots were fired, striking Mancilla,"" said Jachles. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Mancilla was with two other men in their early 20s, Tony Santana and Nick Pappas. One of them was the intended victim, but police are not saying who. ""The four men acted in unison in planning and executing this murder. Mancilla was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he ended up the victim,"" said Mike Jachles. The three victims said they had been ""jumped"" earlier in the evening by the same four men and fled the scene in a red Chevy Impala, according to a sheriff's detective affidavit released Monday afternoon. Later, a blue Chevy Silverado pickup truck belonging to the defendant Cruz drove up to the three men, according to the affidavit. The victims say they armed themselves with a baseball bat and a walking cane, when the truck turned around and drove towards them. That's when the shots were fired. Christopher Harter told police he was in the vehicle at the scene, but said he left the vehicle and then heard four or five gunshots, according to the affidavit. Harter also told police he saw his brother, Angel Cruz, in possession of a semi-automatic pistol three weeks prior to the incident. ""It could have been a case of mistaken identity, but our investigation will determine that,"" Jachles told CNN. Threats were posted on social networking sites and sent via cellular text messages by the suspects to the intended victim, said police. Police said they have not subpoenaed those records and are not releasing the names of those Internet sites. The Broward County State Attorney's office could seek the death penalty.","Henry Mancilla, 24, shot to death as he sat in his car with two others .

"(CNN) --   Much has been made of the electric car driving to the rescue of ailing automobile manufacturers and saving the planet at the same time. But what if that eco-savior came on two wheels instead of four? Lean, green electric machine: KLD is hoping to kickstart the electric scooter industry with its new engine. A high price tag, a limited range, sluggish performance and the tendency not to work when they get wet, have meant that electric scooters are a rare sight on the roads. However, KLD Energy Technologies, an electric engine company based in Texas, believes that its new electric motor can overcome all these problems and kick-start the sector. It's teaming up with Vietnamese motorbike manufacturer Sufat to produce an affordable electric-powered scooter that has a performance just as good as a normal petrol-powered bike. ""We chose Vietnam [to launch the bike] because there are 22 million scooters in a country of 85 million people. That's a lot of people riding scooters in a contained area and the pollution is a concern. All governments in southeast Asia are looking for solutions [to pollution problems], but so far there hasn't been one. We believe that we've found that solution,"" Christian Okonsky, founder of KLD Energy Technologies told CNN. Rather than looking at making batteries more efficient, KLD has improved the performance of the engine itself. The company has built an engine using nano-crystalline composite materials, which it believes is 10 times more efficient than traditional iron core motors, giving an output of 2500 hertz. Together with a computerized motor control, the KLD engine is compatible with any type of battery. Top speed of the KLD scooter is about 55 mph, which is almost double that of many electric scooters and delivers twice as much torque, accelerating from 0 to 50 mph in ten seconds. The engine also doesn't require a transmission. The range on a full charge depends on the type of battery used, although in tests KLD says that its motor system extends the distance a battery can go before a charge is required by 40 percent. Cost-efficiency of components and years of technological development have created the engine KLD has the sole license to produce. ""The nano-crystalline material was developed 20 years ago, but it was incredibly expensive and people couldn't figure out how to use it in a motor. Even 10 years ago a computer, to run this kind of high frequency engine, would have been more like the size of a desk top computer. The magnets we use today that cost 20 cents 10 years ago would have cost $4 to $5,"" said Okonsky. Vectrix Electrics is another company that has been developing electric scooters, so far selling only in North America and Europe. While the performance of its scooters is comparable to KLD's, their models sell at a much higher price tag around $11,000. Earlier this month Vectrix reported financial difficulties and has been forced to make staff cuts. Okonsky, however, remains positive that the KLD scooter engine will be successful and that there is a market for electric-powered scooters. By the end of the year KLD is aiming for 2,000 scooters a month to be produced by Sufat with its electric engine. The projected retail price is around $1500, only slightly more than Sufat's existing bikes that sell in Vietnam for between $800 and $1250. ""Among two-wheelers a scooter is the best for electric drive,"" auto industry analyst John Wormald of Autopolis told CNN. ""A motorcycle is too performance-driven, so it's not really suitable, but a scooter would be. For many electric bikes with very limited battery capacity, the power is just an assist and the battery can be heavy which isn't great, if you're cycling."" Yet the market for electric bikes -- the pedal variety with a battery pack -- has been booming, particularly in China. According to the China Bicycle Association, sales of electric bikes in China stood at 58,000 in 1998, compared with the 20 million recorded just a decade later in 2008.  Watch the report on electric bikes ». However, rather than replacing cars, the majority of electric bikes are affordable substitutions for bicycles, as Chinese cities continue to grow and daily commutes get longer. Their impact in reducing pollution then is open to question, as car sales in the country continue to rise. Ultimately the real eco-credentials of electric vehicles depends on how the electricity is generated, but for helping to relieve vehicle exhaust-filled streets, especially in Asia's two-wheel dominated city centers, electric mopeds could go a long way. As the idea of electric vehicles as viable substitutions for petrol-powered ones becomes more widely accepted, Okonsky's bigger challenge will be convincing skeptics that the old problems of electric scooters have been overcome. ""I'm always asked, 'What happens if I go through a puddle, will it still work?' The answer is yes,"" Okonsky said. In fact, Okonsky says that they've tested their engine underwater and it still works. Expect a video of the trial on KLD's Web site soon.","Electric scooter developed with same price and performance as petrol models .
Engine's developers say it is much more effectual than other electric motors .
Huge scope for electric scooters, primarily in Asian cities, if made affordable ."
"(CNN) -- From the world's biggest manufacturer of mobile phone batteries to a car company with global pretensions, BYD is a Chinese company that has roared onto the international stage energized by its workaholic founder Wang Chuanfu. Building his own dreams: Wang Chuanfu has turned BYD into an international company in less than 15 years. Wang's hands-on approach to running a business with 130,000 employees  -- he still eats in the company canteen and lives in a BYD-owned housing complex -- isn't too far removed from how he built the company from scratch in 1995 when he was 29 years old. Wang trained as an engineer and studied the patents of other companies' mobile phone batteries, even taking them apart to see how they were made. He raised some start-up capital from a relative to create his own mobile phone battery-making business in Shenzhen, the special economic zone just north of Hong Kong. BYD's business approach differed from the likes of Sony and Sanyo by substituting an automated system for one of China's biggest resources, physical labor. Employing thousands of people was cheaper than installing expensive robotic assembly lines, and by 2000 BYD had become the biggest mobile phone battery maker in the world. Wang bought a failing Chinese car company in 2003 to enter the automobile market, and BYD now has a number of models available in China, including a plug-hybrid car cheaper than the market-leading Toyota Prius. The success of BYD has attracted plenty of attention from industry analysts and investors from the West, including Warren Buffet. The billionaire American has invested $250 million in BYD, making even more people in the West sit up and take note of the company. Wang isn't content to just compete in the hybrid and electric car market in China; he aims to keep BYD's meteoric rise going and make it the world's biggest car maker by 2025. ""It is a big ambition. In January and February 2009 China was the world's biggest automobile consuming market for those months. So based on this, China can sell more than 10 million automobiles this year. So maybe China can exceed the USA and become the biggest market in the world,"" Wang told CNN. BYD stands for ""Build Your Dreams"" and Wang is trying to fulfill the aspiration among many in China of creating a national champion; a brand with international respect and reputation of quality. Wang believes the electric car can be that product, and BYD the company to do it. ""For new energy vehicles...China is on the same level or even leading other countries. In the field of new energy cars, China hopes that Chinese companies can catch up with the rest of the world and catch up with the pace,"" said Wang. But the term ""Made in China"" still has a stigma attached to it. The scandals of tainted milk and toys that had to be recalled rocked China in 2008 and diminished the reputation of Chinese products abroad. ""This kind of 'Made in China' is different from other types of 'Made in China.' Our products have never been recalled, unlike many of our competitors. Judging from that, products made in China are sometimes better that those made elsewhere. As long as there are high-standards, Chinese manufacturing companies can definitely meet those standards,"" said Wang. China also has acute environmental problems. It is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and Wang is aware that being an entrepreneur also means having an eye on the environmental impact of his business. ""As an entrepreneur, I think I have to consider both aspects. One part is the creation of a new business mode, or the revelation of new business competition. The other is that it's for social responsibility, making our Earth bluer. ""Urban pollution, reliance on petroleum and emission of carbon dioxide are three problems that entrepreneurs have to consider for basic social responsibility,"" said Wang.","Founder of car and battery company BYD that aims to be world leader .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A former police officer tearfully apologized Monday for his role in an elderly Atlanta woman's shooting death during a botched drug raid, and another told a judge he prays daily for the victim.   ""I used to think I was a good person,"" ex-cop Gregg Junnier said before breaking down on the witness stand during a sentencing hearing in a federal courtroom in Atlanta, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. Junnier and two other ex-officers, Arthur Tesler and Jason Smith, face prison in connection with the November 2006 drug raid that left 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston dead in a hail of gunfire. Investigators later determined the raid was based on falsified paperwork stating that illegal drugs were present in the home. The killing prompted a major overhaul of the Atlanta police drug unit. Smith, like Junnier, apologized during Monday's sentencing hearing. The proceedings were expected to resume Tuesday. ""I pray daily for Ms. Johnston. I also pray other officers in Atlanta will have the moral fortitude I didn't have,"" Smith testified Monday, according to WXIA. Smith, Junnier and Tesler pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. Smith and Junnier also pleaded guilty to state charges of voluntary manslaughter and making false statements, and Smith admitted to planting bags of marijuana in Johnston's house after her death. Tesler was convicted on one state count of making false statements for filling out an affidavit stating that an informant had purchased crack cocaine at Johnston's home in a crime-plagued neighborhood near downtown Atlanta. The informant denied having been to Johnston's home, leading to investigations by local authorities and the FBI, and the breakup and reorganization of the Atlanta police narcotics unit. Police said Johnston fired at them with an old pistol during the raid, and they shot back in self-defense. Johnston's one shot went through her front door and over the officers' heads; they responded with 39 shots, hitting Johnston five times. ""Her death was the foreseeable culmination of a long-standing conspiracy in which the officers violated their oaths of office,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon-Peter Kelly said, according to CNN affiliate WSB. The officers ""regularly swore falsely"" to get warrants and make cases, he said. Federal prosecutors said officers cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses, often while on duty and for cash payments. Johnston's family was not in court Monday. But U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes heard a letter from Johnston's niece during the hearing, and family spokesman Markel Hutchins told WXIA he hopes an FBI report of the case can be used to prompt additional charges at the local level. ""The real culprit in this is the culture within the Atlanta Police Department and the higher-ups that laid the foundation. Why aren't they being held accountable?"" Hutchins asked. The probe also led to guilty pleas by the police sergeant in charge of the narcotics unit and another officer who admitted to extortion, federal prosecutors said.","Sentencing hearing begins for three former Atlanta police officers .

"OSWIECIM, Poland (CNN) -- Israel's vice prime minister compared Iran to Nazi Germany on Tuesday at the site of one of World War II's most notorious death camps. Israel's vice prime minister Silvan Shalom said Tuesday ""Israel can never live with"" a nuclear Iran. The Islamic republic's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons are ""not far away, not at all, to what Hitler did to the Jewish people just 65 years ago,"" Silvan Shalom said at the former Auschwitz camp. ""Israel can never live with the idea that Iran will hold a nuclear bomb,"" Shalom added, reiterating long-standing Israeli policy. He was speaking as Israel observes its Holocaust memorial day, remembering the roughly 6 million Jews who were killed by the Nazi regime during World War II simply for being Jewish. A day earlier, Iran's president caused an uproar at a United Nations anti-racism conference by accusing Israel of having a racist government and committing genocide. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the West made ""an entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering ... in order to establish a totally racist government in occupied Palestine."" Dozens of European diplomats walked out of the speech, but a majority of the conference delegates stayed, and there was some cheering. Iran denies its nuclear program is aimed at building bombs, but Israel and the United States do not believe it.

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old college student in Boston, Massachusetts, has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a woman who may have been contacted through a Craigslist ad, police said. Police found Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds on April 14. She later died. Philip Markoff, a pre-med student at Boston University with no criminal record, also was charged with the armed robbery and kidnapping of another victim, Police Commissioner Ed Davis announced Monday evening. Markoff, who was under police surveillance, was arrested earlier in the afternoon after a traffic stop south of the city, police said. Markoff is suspected in the death of New York City resident Julissa Brisman, 26, who was found unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on April 14. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward. Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service. The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. ""It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,"" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on  its Web site. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man. Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday. Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said. A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were ""involved in similar professions."" ""This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,"" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week. Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court. It was not immediately clear if he had retained defense counsel. Davis and Conley warned there may be other victims that come forward in the case. ""We would like to make one final pitch to those out there who may have been a victim of robbery at the hands of Philip Markoff, especially those who may have used Craigslist in the manner in which the victim used Craigslist,"" he said. Authorities received more than 150 leads in the case, which Davis credited to the popularity of the Web site. ""The public came forth, they were fascinated by this crime,"" he said, adding, ""I wish we had this level of cooperation in every homicide that occurred."" Davis said Boston investigators were working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, in what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney. He said no conclusions could be made, but allowed that the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area.""  Watch police say assailant is perusing Craigslist ads » . Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said the company was ""horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have arrested a man whom they accused of having terrorized students, their parents and the administration of a grade school for three months. Alberto Enrique Hernandez Magallanes, 62, is accused of making phone and written threats asking for money. ""There have been threats against several schools, but this is the first time we have been able to make an arrest,"" said Arturo Sandoval, Chihuahua State Ministerial Police spokesman, after police acted Tuesday. Alberto Enrique Hernandez Magallanes, 62, is accused of making phone and written threats asking for money in exchange for not hurting the children. Police said he sent school administrators notes in packages that included bullets. Citing security concerns, police asked that the name of the school not be divulged. The spokeswoman for Chihuahua's state prosecutor, Daniela Gonzalez, described it as a private school with a student body drawn primarily from middle- to upper-class families. ""School administrators were anxious and afraid,"" Gonzalez said. ""The letters were escalating in demands until they reached the $50,000 figure. They feared for their safety and the safety of the children."" Gonzalez said police helped her negotiate with Hernandez, who agreed to accept $10,000 and a sport utility vehicle. After he collected the money, Hernandez ran to his home, half a block from the school, where he was arrested, Gonzalez said. Police said they confiscated rifles, guns and ammunition. Sandoval said investigators don't think Hernandez is linked to Mexico's drug cartels that have laid siege to Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas. ""He is a person that, because of the current insecurity climate in the city, has taken advantage of the situation,"" the police spokesman said.","Police say suspect sent school administrators notes in packages with bullets .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- In a time of economic turmoil, most Americans are being frugal with their money, but one freshman congressman is taking cost-cutting to a new level. Rep. Jason Chaffetz unfolds the cot that fits into a closet in his office. Newly elected Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, opted out of renting an apartment in Washington, instead deciding on a cot in his office every night. ""I will save $1,500 a month doing this,"" Chaffetz said. ""I get paid a very handsome salary, no doubt about it, but you know, I've got expenses and a future for my kids and my family, too. "" In a stroke of luck, Chaffetz was one of the few freshmen members of Congress to have the chance at an office with a window when he drew number six out of 55 in the office lottery. His office in the Longworth House Building comes with a half-bathroom, a closet that fits a cot, and what he calls his ""breakfast nook"" where he stores Fig Newtons, granola bars and mixed nuts.  Watch more on the thrifty congressman » . The building also has a gym with a shower room, where Chaffetz starts his day about 5:45 each morning. ""My home is in Utah. My wife and kids are there,"" he said. ""I'm here to work."" Cutting out travel to and from the office allows Chaffetz more time to serve his constituents and return more of their e-mail and phone calls, he said. The savings are certainly a plus for the congressman, who has three children to provide for, car payments and a mortgage to pay. But Chaffetz said his decision had a larger meaning. ""We are now $10 trillion in debt. $10 trillion. Those are expenses that have to be paid at some point,"" he said. If he can tighten his belt in these tough economic times, Chaffetz said, Congress should be able to as well. ""Our country has to learn to do more with less,"" he added. Although he is a relatively unknown freshman in the House, word of Chaffetz's sleeping arrangement is spreading. Republican Rep. Judy Biggert of Illinois, whose office is adjacent to Chaffetz's, said he isn't the first to sleep in his office, and he won't be the last. ""This is a job that you have to have, really, two homes. One in your district where you're there on the weekends and then one here during the week, and it's expensive,"" Rep. Biggert said. ""I'm really glad we have a neighbor here to make sure that the neighborhood is safe at night when we're not here,"" she joked, adding that Chaffetz is actually projecting the right image of the Republican Party by being a ""fiscal conservative."" Chaffetz said he is finally getting used to sleeping on his not-so-comfortable cot, but that doesn't mean he rests easy at night. ""My biggest challenge is what goes on in the hallway at night,"" Chaffetz said. ""There's this cleaning machine that comes down the hall at night. And it's got that obnoxious beep, beep, beep."" Despite the din, Chaffetz has no plans to search for another form of housing -- unless his back gives out. ""I've got to keep my back in check, but so far, so good,"" Chaffetz joked. ""But look, our troops are sleeping on a lot worse than this.""","Jason Chaffetz says he'll save $1,500 a month by choosing cot over apartment .

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese plane that was hijacked shortly after taking off from Nyala in the country's Darfur region, presumably by rebels, has landed in Kufra, Libya, said Sudan's ambassador to the United States. ""I believe since it started in the sovereign state of Darfur. ... It is more likely something to do with the rebels in that area,"" John Ukec said. About 87 passengers and 10 crew members are thought to be on board, Ukec said. It was unclear how many hijackers were on board. The hijacker or hijackers wanted to land the plane in Egypt, but the Egyptian government refused them permission, Ukec said. However, an Egyptian civil aviation official disputed that. ""The hijacked plane never entered Egyptian airspace,"" said Capt. Shirbeeni, the head of Egypt's civil aviation control. ""It never requested to land on Egyptian soil. ... We understand that it had a tank that would allow it to fly for four hours. It flew directly toward Kufra."" A reporter from Al-Shuruq, a Dubai-based Sudanese network funded by Sudan's government, said passengers on the plane include some officials from the interim government of Darfur, Sudan's war-torn region. Libya's state-run Jamahirya television, citing civil aviation sources, reported that the hijacked plane landed in Kufra, in eastern Libya. ""We are in contact with Libyan officials because of this dangerous event,"" Murtada Hassam Jumaa, an official with Sun Air airlines, told Al-Shuruq. ""We want to resolve this situation as soon as we can in a way where we can guarantee the safety of all our passengers."" Asked whether the airline received any threat before the flight took off, he said, ""There were no signs of any terrorist or criminal activity on the plane. We checked the plane like we do with all other planes. We followed the regular security checkup. We still don't have any information on what type of weapons were used."" Jumaa also said 87 passengers were on board the plane. The hijacking follows a Monday attack involving Sudanese government troops at the Kalma refugee camp, 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from Nyala. It was unclear whether the incidents are related. The United Nations African Mission in Darfur said the government of Sudan reported that its military and police forces were granted a search warrant for drugs and weapons and raided the camp in executing the warrants. UNAMID said 60 government vehicles surrounded the camp. The refugees resisted the government's attempts to enter the camp, however, and ""the situation escalated into confrontation and exchange of gunfire, with no indication as to who started it."" The gunfire lasted about two hours, UNAMID said. ""On the basis of information provided to the UNAMID team while on site, the casualty toll amounted to 64 killed and 117 wounded, of which 49 were evacuated by UNAMID to the Nyala hospital,"" the organization said in a written statement. Sudanese military and police were heavily armed, the organization said, but the refugees had only sticks, knives and spears. Sudanese security forces reported that they were met by a human shield of women and children, with gunfire coming from behind them, prompting them to return fire. ""UNAMID strongly condemns the excessive, disproportionate use of lethal force by the [government] security forces against civilians, which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties,"" the UNAMID statement said. CNN's Hosam Ahmed in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this report.","Passengers include officials from Darfur's interim government, reporter says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jon Hamm has a confession to make: He hates his hair. Jon Hamm poses with his partner, Jennifer Westfeldt, at the premiere of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" That may come as a surprise to fans of the actor, whose slick-backed hair is part of his signature look on ""Mad Men"" -- the show that just earned him another Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a TV drama. In the new movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" Hamm sports a slightly different 'do, with his bangs combed rakishly over one eye. It was in the context of promoting the sci-fi remake that Hamm revealed his tonsorial frustration. ""It's the bane of my existence. Goofy hair,"" he said in a self-deprecating interview with CNN. ""It never looks good ... It's a pain."" Hamm says he's always worn his hair long, but had to cut it for AMC's TV series, in which he plays a 1960s Madison Avenue ad executive. He says stylists on the show, armed with hair spray and blow dryers, mold his coiffure into a hard shell. Helmet hair has come in handy at work. ""I've had a piece of the set fall on my head and my hair didn't move,"" he said. ""I had seven stitches in my head and my hair didn't move. That's impressive."" Whether it's his hair, good looks, acting chops or a combination thereof, Hamm's star is on the rise in Hollywood. Apart from his co-starring role in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" Hamm recently completed work on the murder mystery ""The Boy in the Box."" He hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" this fall, he's due to play Tina Fey's love interest on ""30 Rock"" and he continues to receive accolades for his work on ""Mad Men"" (nominations for an Emmy and a Golden Globe so far). How does that make Hamm feel? ""Exciting is the right way to say it. It's been a good year. It's very exciting,"" he said. ""I get to read a lot more scripts. I get to meet interesting people. I get to work with interesting people ... It's fun to be sort of invited to the party.""","""Mad Men"" star Jon Hamm earned another Golden Globe nomination .

"(CNN) -- Canadian ski resort gondola cars that were left dangling and swaying with terrified skiers inside failed because ice buildup snapped a supporting tower, the resort said Thursday. One gondola car is suspended above an icy creek at a ski resort near Whistler, British Columbia. In a rare occurrence called ice-jacking, water seeped into the lower section of the lift tower and turned to ice Tuesday at Whistler Blackcomb resort, 177 kilometers (110 miles) north of Vancouver, a resort official said in a press release Thursday. The lift hangs from a tower that is spliced into two parts. Extremely cold temperatures caused the ice buildup that exerted 800 tons of pressure between the two parts that hold the tower together, causing them to rupture, according to Whistler Blackcomb. The section of the lift affected by the accident had 15 cars going up the mountain and 15 coming down at the time, but they weren't carrying a lot of passengers, according to Doug Forseth, senior vice president of the resort. He said 53 passengers had been rescued from the stranded cars. No skiers at the Whistler, British Columbia, resort were seriously injured. ""The towers are not normally designed to allow for any water penetration and so this failure is a very unusual situation,"" said Warren Sparks, senior vice president of Doppelmayr Canada, the engineering firm that investigated the accident. They are trying to figure out what caused the water to pool. He said independent structural engineers are examining the tower from Vancouver-based CVMM Consulting Engineers. ""The evidence so far indicates a sudden rupture rather than a fatigue failure over an extended period,"" Sparks said. At least two gondola cars broke away and hit the ground, both from relatively low heights near the tower that split, and caused the system's heavy cable line to slacken, according to Tyler Noble, a reporter for CNNRadio affiliate CKNW in Vancouver. ""One hit a bus stop and the other hit a house,"" Noble said Wednesday. ""Another one was suspended over a creek, but everyone is out of that car."" The broken Excaliber Gondola was not operating Thursday. Whistler engineers checked eight similar towers across the two mountains of the resort. All passed those inspections, and are open Thursday, the release said. The British Columbia Authority says it does not expect to rescind operating permits on any lifts at the resort, other than the Excaliber Gondola. Jeff Colburn, general manager of Silver Mountain Resort in Kellogg, Idaho, said a lift tower at his resort was similarly damaged by ice in December 2006. The damage was discovered in the morning before the slopes opened, so no one was endangered, he said. The damaged tower was replaced in about three weeks, Colburn said, and the resort's business was not significantly disrupted. ""We check our towers in the summer now, and we also check before we open up for ski season as well just to make sure they don't have any water in them, and we've worked with the manufacturers,"" he said. Holes have been drilled in the bases of towers so that water can drain out, Colburn said.

"(CNN) -- When travel author Beth Whitman was in Vietnam, she witnessed a group of young American male travelers rough-housing in the streets outside of the Rex Hotel. Americans traveling to sites around the world like the Blue Mosque in Istanbul should be respectful. In their youthful, loud exuberance, they ended up ripping each other's shirts as they horsed around. ""I thought to myself that those shirts probably cost maybe 20, 30, 40 dollars apiece, and here you are in a culture where the people may not be even making that much on a monthly basis. ""It's that sort of thing, just not being aware how off-putting that can be to the local culture."" Such behavior, while seemingly harmless, can help to cement the moniker of ""the ugly American,"" which came to refer to loud, rude and thoughtless behavior of U.S. citizens abroad. The term came about as a result of the book ""The Ugly American,"" and more than 50 years after its publication, those from the United States continue to battle an image of arrogance and nationalism. Written by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick, the novel chronicled American foreign policy and diplomacy failures in a fictitious developing nation. In the book, the American ambassador to the country is portrayed as crude and inept. That enduring legacy has not been easy to shake, and even the U.S. president knows the score. During a recent trek to Turkey, President Obama said in his remarks at the Tophane Cultural Center in Istanbul that he knows the ""stereotypes of the United States are out there."" ""Sometimes it suggests that America has become selfish and crass, or that we don't care about the world beyond us,"" he said. ""And I'm here to tell you that that's not the country that I know and it's not the country that I love."" Whitman, the author of the ""Wanderlust and Lipstick"" guides and publisher of ""Traveling with Kids,"" often gives lectures and workshops -- many geared toward female travelers -- and speaks on the importance of Americans being stellar representatives of their homeland while abroad. ""It's about being respectful of the country and the culture, treating the people respectfully and not flashing around your money and your material possessions,"" Whitman said. ""It's up to every individual to be that ambassador and portray their country well."" Author Ann Hulbert wrote a piece for The New York Times Magazine a few years ago about her desire not to be mistaken for an ugly American when her family traveled to Istanbul and the Turkish coast. Hulbert took the step of vetoing one of her teenage son's T-shirts, worried that the message on it, ""The Fighting Quakers. Beat them 'til they reach consensus,"" might be misunderstood in the Muslim country. ""I think that when you are a big and powerful country, it's easy for the rest of the world to feel that you don't deal with the kind of consideration and humility that other people do,"" said Hulbert, who researches the areas she visits prior to her trips. iReport.com: Ever been to the Netherlands? Share your travel pics . Christopher P. Baker, who is a Cuba travel expert and award-winning author of the best-selling guidebook ""Moon Cuba,"" said he has concerns about what will happen if and when travel restrictions are completely lifted from that country. He recalled two years ago when he was reviewing one of Havana's first five-star hotels that had just opened. Standing in the lobby with one of the hotel's executives, he witnessed a man, dripping wet from the pool and wrapped in a towel, emerge from the elevator. The man walked through the bar, down the stairs and into the marble lobby just as the staff tried to intercept him, Baker said. ""I heard them say, 'We don't allow guests in the lobby dressed this way,' and the man said, 'Yeah, I know' in this deep American brogue,"" Baker said. ""Behavior like that is not necessarily common to Americans, but it's the type of thing that can give Americans a bad name."" Manners and lifestyle expert Thomas P. Farley runs the site What Manners Most and said Americans tend to be seen as free-spirited and not nearly as guarded as natives of some of the other countries -- as evidenced most recently by first lady Michelle Obama putting her arm around Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. ""That's something that maybe sent shivers up the spine of a lot Britons, but in the final analysis, people really looked at that as a nice gesture and something very American to do,"" said Farley, who added that travelers should be as respectful in other countries as they would be if they were in someone else's home. The Obamas may actually be aiding in changing the perception themselves. Travel writer Beth Whitman said the mere election of President Obama has helped to improve America's reputation worldwide. ""It helped to change how we are viewed, but the real key is the behavior once a person arrives in a country,"" Whitman said. ""Some of [the ugly American perception] will exist no matter who is in office, and that's why everyone has to take responsibility for being the very best representative of their country that they can.""","Decades after the publication of ""The Ugly American,"" the perception persists .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The day I interviewed Neil Diamond, he was sitting in a little room to the side of a studio, and a makeup artist was smacking him in the face with a powder puff. He was wearing a white wife-beater T-shirt and looked like he wanted to flee. Neil Diamond is riding high with a huge world tour, a successful album and a humanitarian award. It was November, and Diamond had just come off the first two legs of his biggest world tour yet -- with 64 shows in 50 cities and nine countries already under his belt. In a moment, he would step in front of a camera to begin a round of 70 or so interviews -- beamed via satellite to local television stations -- to talk up the remaining 20 dates, where he'd thrill diehard fans with such nuggets as ""Cherry Cherry,"" ""Song Sung Blue"" and ""Sweet Caroline."" Ours was the only in-person interview he -- or someone in his camp -- had agreed to do. The singer-songwriter (who turned 68 on January 24) stepped into the studio, a man ready for his close-up. He had slipped a black button-down shirt over his T-shirt, and suddenly he looked like Neil Diamond -- the same Neil Diamond who next week will be feted by The Recording Academy as its ""2009 MusiCares Person of the Year,"" joining an elite club that includes Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Sting, Bono and Quincy Jones. He's working on a follow-up to last year's CD, the Rick Rubin-produced ""Home Before Dark"" -- which earned Diamond his first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. That album came after 2005's ""12 Songs,"" also produced by Rubin, which re-invigorated his recording career. As for live performance, he's rarely had problems filling arenas -- but he remembers when he did.  Watch Diamond talk about giving back » . CNN: The man in black. This has become quite the trademark. Neil Diamond: Yeah. I still wear black, but I got sparkly somewhere along the way -- especially if you are playing in an 18,000-seat arena, you like to be seen by somebody in the back. CNN: I've been to a Neil Diamond concert, and everybody stands up, and they sing every word to every song. Don't you ever want to tell them, ""I'm singing -- listen!"" Diamond: No, I don't -- but I did in the very beginning when I first realized on my first few records that people were singing along. I thought, ""You shouldn't be singing. That's my job. Let me sing and you listen."" But then I realized that it's a compliment. They knew the music, they loved it and they wanted to sing. So I said, ""All right, let's sing together."" [chuckles] . CNN: Whenever you hit the road, you're one of the year's top ticket draws and play to more than a million fans per tour. [Diamond had the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2008, taking in $60 million in ticket sales.] . Diamond: It's truly not until the last leg that you finally get the show down. You are relaxed with it, you are not worried about the intricacies of the show, and the last shows are always the best and the most fun. CNN: After 40 years in the business, do you still get nervous? Diamond: I don't know if it's nerves. I get excited. I want things to go right. I want the audience to love the show. CNN: For this tour, you've donated all the proceeds from merchandise sales [T-shirts, programs and other souvenir items] to the victims of Hurricane Ike in Texas. We're talking about a figure that's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars. Diamond: Hurricane Ike hit southern Texas so fiercely [in September 2008, while Diamond was on tour], and has been forgotten about by the rest of the country -- but these people are still in desperate straits, and are in dire need of our help. And I saw what was going on. The mayor of Houston took me around, and he told me about it and introduced me to some people. The next day, I drove down to some of the hardest-hit areas, and I just felt that I had to do something, and I felt that maybe my audience would help me out with it. So we just say the merchandise and whatever you buy goes down to those people to rebuild their homes. They are still living in tents and cars down there. So to all the people down in Oak Island, Galveston, Galveston Bay and Houston, help is on the way -- and that's the message that I want to bring and spread around. The Eagles just made a substantial donation to this fund. CNN: Has that inspired new songwriting for you? Diamond: I don't know if it has inspired new songwriting -- I don't do a lot of writing when I am out touring -- but it has inspired a reality in me of what's going on. You tend to live in a bubble when you are traveling and touring. I missed the election completely. I actually worked and performed election night. The wonderful people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, came and filled the place, and I said to them, ""I appreciate you coming down, because there is something really good on television."" I missed the election completely. I got off the stage and tuned into the concession speech. But I heard it was very dramatic, and I'm happy with the outcome. You tend to miss things when you're on the road. CNN: Right before the Grammys, you're being honored by The Recording Academy as its ""2009 MusiCares Person of the Year."" Diamond: Well, it's a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you. [Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career, but has only won one award.] But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit -- that big dinner -- is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times. It's not the most secure job in the world, and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated. It's a cause that's very close to my heart. I have been very fortunate, and I have been successful. CNN: When you tour, you sell out 20,000-seat arenas -- but do you ever worry about a day when you might walk out on stage and there are only two or three people in the audience? Diamond: Well, that did happen to me very early in my career. So yeah, that has occurred to me. I'm always a little amazed that people show up, and I don't know where they came from -- but I'm thrilled that they are there. CNN: Do you ever wonder what you would have done had this all not worked out? Diamond: I do, and I don't like any of the choices that I would have made, or any of the places that I would have been. CNN: I hear you earned a fencing scholarship to NYU. Diamond: Yeah, I did. But you can't make a living as a fencer these days. CNN: So this is definitely much better. Diamond: Yes, this is a lot better. I love singing. I have been singing since I was a little boy, so to make a life in music as a writer and as a singer -- I think I have the best job in the world. CNN: At the end of the tour, you're only taking two days off, and then you begin working on your next album. Don't you believe in vacations? Diamond: I'm not the kind of guy that's good at laying on the beach for too long. If I'm laying on the beach, it's with a guitar and a legal pad, and I'm thinking about music.","Neil Diamond to receive Recording Academy's Person of the Year honor .

"KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police in Pakistan arrested lawyers holding a public protest to demand that the government immediately restore judges the previous president had ousted, Karachi's police chief told CNN Thursday. Lawyers shout slogans Thursday in Karachi on the eve of a march to Islamabad. Among those detained were Muira Malik, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and leader of the Karachi lawyers movement, and retired high court justice Rasheed Razvi, police Chief Wasim Ahmed said. The lawyers were arrested under an order that outlaws public gatherings. The police chief also said authorities had credible information that there was a terror threat against the march and he had warned the lawyers before they started that it would be a public danger. Up to 500 lawyers in the Karachi group planned to join thousands of other demonstrators heading to the capital, Islamabad, as part of a four-day ""Long March."" The demonstrators plan a massive sit-in at the parliament building Monday. ""Our movement is a peaceful movement,"" organizer Razvi, president of the Sindh High Court Bar Association, said before his arrest. ""When we protested the last time, there were hundreds of thousands of people and not one grass was broken, not one leaf was broken."" The demonstrators began walking from the gates of the Sindh High Court, heading to a dozen buses that waited to ferry them to their next stop: the city of Hyderabad. ""The rule of baton and bullets cannot last,"" the protesters chanted. They want President Asif Ali Zardari to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by then-President Pervez Musharraf. Among the dismissed judges was the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. After sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year, Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office. The deadline came and went. The government responded to the recent intensification of protests by banning political demonstrations in two of the country's biggest provinces -- Punjab and Sindh. It also detained several hundred activists Wednesday. But the protesters said they will not be deterred. Their movement now, they said, isn't so much about reinstating Chaudhry as it is about restoring the office of the chief justice. ""We will start the long march from the province as we have promised the nation,"" Razvi said. The country's largest opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), is backing the lawyers -- but for reasons of its own. Party head Nawaz Sharif accuses Zardari of being behind a February Supreme Court decision that bars Sharif from holding public office. The court also stripped Sharif's brother, Shahbaz, of his post as chief minister of Punjab -- the Sharif party's power center. Supporters of PML-N have responded by holding massive rallies, some of which have turned violent in recent days.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Pfizer is near a deal to buy rival drugmaker Wyeth for $68 billion, according to news reports late Sunday citing people familiar with the deal. Pfizer's world headquarters is in New York. A deal was imminent and likely to be announced Monday, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported. ""It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,"" said Michael Lampe, a Wyeth representative. Pfizer was not immediately available for comment. Pfizer, the world's leading drugmaker in terms of sales, has been in talks to buy Wyeth. Pfizer's stock slipped 1 percent on the news Friday, while Wyeth gained about 8 percent. On January 13 Pfizer said it was cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D staff, about 800 jobs. Spokesman Raymond Kerins said that was to ""raise productivity."" But analysts say Pfizer is clearly trying to beef up its drug pipeline through an acquisition, adding that the company seems to have given up on its own R&D staff coming up with a blockbuster to replace Lipitor. This cholesterol-cutting drug peaked in 2006 with nearly $13 billion in annual sales but will lose its patent protection in 2011, when generic versions will become available. Les Funtleyder, pharma analyst for Miller Tabak, said Pfizer is ""not feeling that they're getting the efficiency out of their R&D unit."" He said Pfizer would probably rather do a deal with Wyeth over other competitors, because there is less overlap in the companies' pipelines. Funtleyder said Pfizer already has a diabetes franchise, which would overlap with Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both of which also focus on diabetes treatments. Pfizer probably has its eyes on Wyeth's Alzheimer's drug pipeline, he said. But he cautions that a merger won't be a success unless Wyeth's pipeline is successful, which remains to be seen, he said. ""If Wyeth comes out with an Alzheimer's drug that works, then the deal works,"" he said. Pfizer is probably also focused on Wyeth's blockbuster children's vaccine Prevnar, as well as its experimental biotech drugs, said Michael Krensavage of Krensavage Asset Management. Sales of Prevnar, which combats meningitis and blood infections, jumped 12 percent in the first nine months of 2008 compared with the same period the prior year, to $2.1 billion. If a deal does go through, Funtleyder warns, Wyeth staffers should brace for layoffs. ""I can say with pretty good confidence that this is going to lead to some head count reduction,"" he said.","""It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,"" Wyeth rep says .

"(CNN) -- Singer and actress Eartha Kitt has died, her publicist, Patty Freedman, told CNN on Thursday. Actress Eartha Kitt, shown at a benefit for the Actors Fund in 2003, performed almost until the end of her life. Kitt, 81, died in New York, where she was being treated for colon cancer, Freedman said. Her daughter, Kitt Shapiro, was by her side. She was performing almost until the end, taping a PBS special six weeks ago in Chicago, Illinois. The show is set to air in February. The ringtone version of her recording of the saucy Christmas song ""Santa Baby"" was certified gold earlier this month. Kitt was well known for her distinctive voice and made a name for herself in her portrayal of Catwoman in the television series ""Batman."" That role produced Kitt's recognizable sultry cat growl. She worked in film, theater, cabaret, music and on television during her lengthy career. According to Kitt's official Web site, she was nominated for a Tony three times, a Grammy and Emmy twice. According to the biography on that site, Kitt lived in Connecticut near her daughter and four grandchildren. Kitt was ostracized at an early age because of her mixed-race heritage, the biography says. At age 8, she was sent from the cotton fields of South Carolina by her mother to live with her aunt in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, the site said. As a teen, she auditioned for the famed Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe, was hired as a featured dancer and vocalist, and toured worldwide with the company. This launched Kitt into a life of roles in the entertainment field. According to the book ""Contemporary Black Biography,"" she was adored in Europe in the 1950s as a cabaret singer. In the United States, her dance career led to a critically acclaimed stint on Broadway, including the play ""New Faces of 1952,"" which was later made into a movie. Broadway stardom landed Kitt a recording deal that led to a string of best-selling records, including ""Love for Sale,"" ""I Want to Be Evil,"" ""Santa Baby"" and ""Folk Tales of the Tribes of Africa."" She recorded more than 20 albums, worked in hundreds of television and movie roles, and was invited as a guest to the White House several times.

"(CNN) -- A convicted sex offender who was sentenced to death for killing a 9-year-old Idaho boy is scheduled to be arraigned Monday on charges related to the killing of a 10-year-old California boy. Joseph Edward Duncan III will answer charges in the 1997 abduction and murder of Anthony Martinez. Joseph Edward Duncan III is expected to appear in court in Riverside County, California, to answer to charges in the 1997 abduction and murder of Anthony Martinez, said a spokesman for the Riverside County District Attorney's office. Investigators have charged Duncan with murder in Anthony's death. Law-enforcement officials also are investigating whether Duncan, who committed his first sexual offense at the age of 12, can be tied to other crimes, according to CNN affiliate KTLA in Los Angeles, California. Martinez was kidnapped on April 4, 1997 from an alley near his home in the city of Beaumont, the station reported; the boy's naked body was discovered a little over two weeks later. Duncan has confessed to killing Martinez and crushing the boy's head with a rock, KTLA reported, citing court documents. Authorities reportedly discovered the boy's body by following vultures to a remote section of a nearby canyon. The body was partially buried under a pile of rocks and bound with duct tape, according to KTLA. Duncan, a high school dropout and drifter, was sentenced to death last August for the torture and murder of Dylan Groene, a 9-year-old Idaho boy. He was convicted of kidnapping Dylan and his then 8-year-old sister before torturing them at a remote campsite and fatally bludgeoning members of their family. In 2007, Duncan pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping counts in state court for the hammer-attack murders of three other Groene family members. If convicted of murdering Martinez, Duncan can be sentenced to death again.","Joseph Duncan committed his first sexual offense at the age of 12 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Stop brooding over the financial crisis, and start packing. Some tour operators are offering packages to Hawaii at prices lower than a year ago. The economic downturn has dealt a heavy blow to the global travel industry as travelers have tightened their grasp on their wallets. But there is a silver lining to the meltdown. The turmoil has roiled currency markets, making some once-pricey trips more affordable. Other popular spots are rolling out deals and special packages in a bid to lure travelers. Whether you're paying in dollars, pounds or euros, there's a travel deal out there for you. Here's a look at four of them. Cool as ice . Iceland was once prohibitively expensive for many people, but now the tiny island nation is rebranding itself as a budget destination. Iceland's economy was booming a few years ago, fueled by the availability of cheap credit. But the collapse of the country's financial system has reversed its fortunes. The government has nationalized the banking system and the Icelandic currency -- the krona -- went into freefall. Now the Icelandic Tourist Board is wooing travelers by highlighting the favorable exchange rate. Icelandair is offering a Christmas special for travelers from the U.S. The package - which includes airfare, a three-night hotel stay, a visit to the Blue Lagoon and airport transfers - starts at $699 a person for a double room. For European visitors, it's promoting a number of three-night city breaks (flights and hotel included). Packages from London start at £249.  See photos of Iceland and other places you can catch a bargain » . Surf's up . The downturn in the U.S. has hit Hawaii tourism hard. Visitor arrivals are expected to tumble nine percent this year, making it the biggest annual drop since 2001, according to the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization. Hawaii has suffered from a sharp decline in flights from the mainland. Aloha Airlines and ATA accounted for roughly 20 percent of flights to the Big Island from North America before going out of business earlier this year. In response to slumping visitor arrivals, Hawaii's Visitors and Convention Bureau has teamed up with a variety of travel wholesalers to offer air-hotel packages. ""The savings being offered mean the cost of a Hawaii vacation can now be less than a year ago,"" John Monahan, the bureau's chief, said in a statement. Liberty Travel is offering free nights at several hotels. Classic Vacations is offering an air credit of up to $500 for stays of five nights or longer booked through the end of the year. London calling . While a trip to London still can't be called cheap, the British pound's recent decline means costs are falling dramatically for foreign visitors, particularly Americans. Concerns of a deep recession in the UK have sparked the pound's decline. In the last three months, the pound -- which traded near $2 in August -- has lost roughly 20 percent of its value against the dollar. Aside from the falling pound, some hotels are offering special promotions. The Hoxton Urban Lounge, a stylish boutique hotel located near London's financial district, routinely sells rooms for £1 a night. But travelers should be warned: Snagging one of the rooms can be tough. The last time the hotel offered the promotion, the rooms -- which normally cost from £59 to £199 -- sold out in 26 minutes. The next sale is scheduled for January. Into the wild . If you fancy a walk on the wild side, now's the time to net yourself a bargain. Amid the financial market meltdown, investors have been flocking to safe-haven investments. The aversion to risk has hit the currencies of several emerging market economies, including the South African rand. The rand touched a record low against the euro and a six-year low against the dollar last month. The drop in the rand means adventure trips like safaris are becoming more affordable for foreign tourists. Several luxury safari lodges have recently cropped in and around South Africa's Kruger National Park -- an ideal perch for viewing the wildlife that roams the unspoiled landscape. A luxury tent at Tanda Tula Safari Camp currently runs around 4,250 rand per person per night. At the current exchange rate, that comes to about $430 -- or roughly $160 less than you would have paid in early August. Have some useful travel tips?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British singer Amy Winehouse has been charged with ""common assault"" in connection with an incident last September, and will appear in court later this month, Scotland Yard said Friday. Amy Winehouse performs at last year's V Festival in Chelmsford, England. In the incident, on September 26, the singer allegedly hit a fan at a charity ball, British media reported. A spokesman for the 25-year-old Winehouse said in a statement that she ""voluntarily attended a police station in London yesterday morning. ""She was questioned by appointment in relation to an accusation made after the Berkeley Ball last year. ""She was charged with common assault and will attend a court hearing in the coming weeks."" Winehouse is facing the possibility of another potentially damaging court case after husband Blake Fielder-Civil last month asked his lawyer ""to commence divorce proceedings on the grounds of Amy's adultery,"" his lawyer, Henri Brandman, said. That came after Fielder-Civil saw photos of her cavorting with another man during her recent holiday in the Caribbean, while he sat in a British jail.","Winehouse allegedly hit a fan at a charity ball in September .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The numbers were good for ""Knowing."" In ""Knowing,"" a physics professor (Nicolas Cage) ponders patterns in a list of numbers. The film, about a physics professor who sees clues for disastrous events in a time capsule's list of digits, overcame some pretty long odds at the box office -- going against the Paul Rudd-Jason Segel comedy ""I Love You, Man,"" the Julia Roberts-Clive Owen romantic thriller ""Duplicity"" and some fairly scathing reviews -- to emerge as the weekend's No. 1 film. Though star Nicolas Cage wouldn't have predicted the outcome, in an interview before the film's release, he did talk about the power of positive thinking. ""I'm a huge believer of the human spirit,"" he told CNN. ""I think people are amazing. I think what we have accomplished is incredible. ... If you think positive and you apply the guts and ingenuity that mankind has been doing forever, at least in our existence, I believe we get through anything."" Cage's character, John Koestler, is a science professor whom Cage describes as ""someone who is reawakening to his faith."" He begins the film believing that everything is random, but as the film continues -- and he seeks to alert the world of a coming catastrophe -- ""he believes there is cause and effect and perhaps even a divine mind,"" Cage said. The film begins in 1959, with students burying items in a time capsule at an elementary school. One of the children, however, creates an image of seemingly random numbers. Fifty years later, when the capsule is opened, Koestler's son receives the page of numbers, and his father realizes that they correspond to major disasters of the past half-century. Koestler determines that three events have yet to occur and sets out to meet the clairvoyant child's now grown daughter. The final event threatens life on Earth itself, and the group begins a race against time, with unusual consequences. Critics were not impressed. The film earned a 25 percent rating on the review aggregator RottenTomatoes.com, with some reviewers in full-on mockery mode.  Watch Mr. Moviefone review ""Knowing"" and other films » . ""It's increasingly hard to believe that Cage won an Oscar in 1996 (for 'Leaving Las Vegas'),"" wrote USA Today's Claudia Puig in a 1½-star review. ""In the past decade, he has made some awful choices, and his range has seemed to grow more limited."" ""It's so inept that you may wish you were watching an M. Night Shyamalan version of the very same premise,"" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman, referring to the director whose last two films, ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening,"" were two of the most detested films of recent years. But the film's apocalyptic theme obviously strikes a chord, something director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"") saw early on. Proyas told CNN in a pre-release interview that ""you can read [the film] as biblical if you choose to,"" but he prefers to see it as ""spiritual."" ""I try to leave it very open-ended,"" he said. ""I try to think of it as more a spiritual place than a biblical one."" Cage's character, he said, is on a spiritual quest in the midst of what could be global destruction. Rose Byrne, who plays the clairvoyant child's daughter, Diana, called the film ""kind of a theological discussion."" ""That's always an exciting topic,"" she said. ""It's bridging the gap between science and spirituality. That always makes things thought-provoking, and I like that with any piece of art."" Byrne said that ""Knowing"" taps into some of the end-times anxiety that's been in the air in recent years, which perhaps could help find an audience. (As she was talking before the film's release, she didn't realize how much of an audience.) ""I think it's a common thing in life,"" she said of end-of-the-world fears, referencing one of the latest making the rounds -- the Mayan calendar's Long Count end in 2012 -- in making her point. Proyas observes that given such worries, the film can be a wake-up call for such concerns as global climate change. ""There is a symbolic aspect to what is happening and what the story is about, and to get people to pay attention to what could happen,"" he said. But, he adds, it's also just a movie. ""I believe in the entertainment value of movies -- very much so,"" he said. ""I ... want to make it good for the audience. I really want people to be there and experience something powerful and resident, both in terms of ideas and emotions ... and also with this film trying to do something different. It's a challenging film, and it takes some unexpected turns.""","""Knowing"" was weekend's No. 1 film .

"(CNN) -- Legendary singer/songwriter Aretha Franklin sang ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" at the inauguration Tuesday. Aretha Franklin says cold weather affected her voice during her performance at the inauguration on Tuesday. CNN's Larry King talks with ""The Queen of Soul"" about the reality of the nation's first black president, singing at the inauguration and the much-talked-about hat she wore. Larry King: Where'd you get that hat? Aretha Franklin: Well, I bought it at a little millinery that I frequent out in Detroit. King: What was that like for you (Tuesday)? Franklin: Oh. What a tremendous, mammoth morning, evening, the ball, everything, from one event to the other, was just too much. King: How did you find out you were singing? Franklin: My agent called me and he told me that he had received an invitation and a telephone call, asking for my presence and performance at the swearing-in and the inauguration. King: Did you choose the song? Franklin: Yes, I did. King: Is that a tough song to sing? Franklin: No, not at all, but (Tuesday) it was. Mainly because of the temperature outside. I don't have to tell you, it was freezing, if you were there. Some singers it doesn't bother, and others it does. I don't care for it. It affected my voice.  Watch Franklin sing at inauguration » . King: You sang at Martin Luther King's funeral. What do you remember about that? Franklin: There were very, very long lines, of course.

They shuttled us from one point to the other. The passing of a great man was at hand. King: How did you feel yesterday about seeing a young black man elected president? Franklin: Oh boy, how do you put it into words? There's a love affair going on with the country and Barack. I think it's the age of Barack. People have just fallen head over heels in love with him. His ascent to the presidency was miraculous. But we have to remember that he's not going to work miracles right off the top. It's going to take time.

I'm going to deal with her when I get home. It, by no means, was my standard. I was not happy with it, but I just feel blessed because it could have been five above zero or five below zero like it is in Detroit. I was still blessed to be able to pretty much just sing the melody, but I wasn't happy with it, of course. King: It was great to listen to. Franklin: I was delighted and thrilled to be there. That was the most important thing, not so much the performance, but just to be there and to see this great man go into office -- the promise of tomorrow coming to pass.","Aretha Franklin: Cold weather affected rendition of ""My Country 'Tis of Thee""

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN)  -- Gunmen attacked a convoy Sunday in Somalia and took several hostages, including two foreign aid workers from the group Doctors Without Borders. Medecins San Frontieres workers, shown here, were abducted and released in March in Sudan. Local staff said a three-car convoy was traveling from Rabbure to Hudur in southwestern Somalia, escorted by local bodyguards, when gunmen seized the group. The district commissioner of Rabbure said the only people released were elders accompanying the staff, with the local and international staff kept as hostages. Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres, did not immediately release the identities or nationalities of the hostages. MSF is an international medical group that works in more than 60 countries. It says it helps people ""threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe."" Michel Peremans, international coordinator for operational communications for MSF Belgium, which operates in the region, confirmed that the organization had lost contact with two of its staff in Somalia. Rabbure is in the Bakole region, which is under the control of the group al-Shabaab, considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Al-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006. The ICU's former leader, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, became president after Ethiopian troops withdrew in January. Al-Shabaab rejected the peace agreement that led to the Ethiopian withdrawal and is now fighting Sheikh Ahmed's government. Attacks on aid workers in the region are common, and U.N. staff came under attack this year. In Sudan, on the other side of Ethiopia, four workers from Medecins Sans Frontieres were abducted in March and released a few days later. All four -- an Italian doctor, a Canadian nurse, a French coordinator and a Sudanese guard -- worked for the Belgian section of the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres. Sudan last month ordered 13 major aid groups to leave the country after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

"(CNN) -- She's being hailed as the ""face of the economic crisis,"" and now Henrietta Hughes has become something of a media star after reaching out to President Obama in an emotional plea for help. President Obama talks to Henrietta Hughes at a town hall rally in Fort Myers, Florida, on Tuesday. Her message: My son and I are homeless, and we need immediate help. ""I have an urgent need, unemployment and homelessness, a very small vehicle for my family and I to live in,"" Hughes told Obama Tuesday at a town hall rally in Fort Myers, Florida, as he pushed for passage of his stimulus plan in the Senate. ""The housing authority has two years waiting lists, and we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to. We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help."" Hughes said she had been homeless after her son lost his job and, subsequently, their home. Although her son has been looking for work, Hughes says, so far, no luck. The Fort Myers-Cape Coral area -- in heavily Republican Lee County, which went for GOP presidential nominee John McCain in the 2008 election -- has seen record housing foreclosure rates.  Watch CNN's Ed Hornick discuss the story » . According to the White House, the area had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation last year, with 12 percent of housing units receiving a foreclosure-related notice. Median housing prices in the Fort Myers metropolitan area have plummeted from $322,000 in December 2005 to less than $107,000 in December 2008, the Obama administration notes. And nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost in Fort Myers in the past year. The president offered Hughes a kiss on the cheek and a promise: ""We're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you.""  Watch more of Hughes' emotional plea to Obama » . Some questioned the circumstances of Hughes' appearance at the event. Blogger Michelle Malkin, in a story on the conservative Web site TownHall.com on Wednesday, said that if Hughes ""had more time, she probably would have remembered to ask Obama to fill up her gas tank, too."" ""The soul-fixer dutifully asked her name, gave her a hug and ordered his staff to meet with her. Supporters cried, 'Amen!' and 'Yes!' "" she added. One reader questioned Hughes' motives and asked how the homeless woman got to the rally at all. ""How does a 61-year-old homeless woman who's living in a pickup truck with her son JUST HAPPEN to get a ticket so she can VERY PUBLICALLY ask Prez. Obama for a HOUSE? Anyone? Who pushes her up on stage? She's right at the front of the crowd. Did she just happen to get a seat there?"" asked reader Erik E. In Fort Myers, a city of about 60,000, people began lining up for tickets to the Obama event over the weekend. Many camped out overnight, with tents and sleeping bags springing up near the front door, and all tickets were given away in less than an hour. White House spokesman Joshua Earnest said Wednesday that after she spoke, the administration connected Hughes -- who did not vote in the 2008 election because she didn't have a home -- with local housing officials, who happened to be in the crowd. On Wednesday, the head of the local housing authority, Marcus Goodson, said he met with Hughes. He said he's working on finding her a housing unit with a shorter waiting time and that he's emailed a White House staff member with the update. But it wasn't just officials reaching out. Chene Thompson -- the wife of state Rep. Nicholas Thompson, R-Fort Myers -- offered Hughes and her son a house in nearby La Belle rent-free, according to a spokeswoman, and she is interested in taking it. ""Basically, I offered Ms. Hughes and her son the opportunity to stay in my home rent-free for as long as they need to,"" Thompson told WBBH-TV in Fort Myers. ""I'm not a millionaire, I'm not rich, but this is what I can do for someone if they need it."" Hughes will check out the house in the coming days, according to Thompson's office. In the meantime, she has set up shop in the district office where she gave media interviews. And help for the woman whose story touched the president keeps pouring in. A Web site, HenriettaHughes.com, was set up featuring video clips of the homeless woman at the rally and information about her plight. The site hails her as ""the face of the economic crisis."" The owner of the site said Hughes has ""brought to [light] the homeless [an] unemployment problem we have in the United States."" ""As a local southwest Florida resident, I have seen countless stories like Henrietta's. I wanted to take this opportunity to promote awareness of our plight on a national level. If you as equally concerned as I am, please bookmark this site and sign up for updates,"" the owner wrote on the site. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the stimulus package . And Fort Myers Mayor Jim Humphrey, a Republican, said Wednesday that his ""community has responded"" to Hughes' story. ""I even received a phone call from a lady in Ocala wanting to offer her $50 a month, so what we're seeing is, this should be a nonpartisan issue,"" he said.  Watch Humphrey discuss Hughes' story » . Linda Bergthold, a health policy expert, wrote on the liberal blog HuffingtonPost.com that it was a touching moment that highlighted a community coming together. ""It would have been interesting had Obama turned to the crowd and asked anyone who had a solution for Henrietta to step forward afterwards. But he didn't have to. People came forward anyway,"" she wrote Wednesday. ""The dilemma Ms. Hughes described is not limited to her. ... Her request was a compelling one and it only highlights issues of homelessness that will surely get worse as the economic downturn deepens.""

"Editor's note: Frances Fragos Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, formerly served as President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Townsend has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations. Townsend is currently a consultant to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member of President Bush's Intelligence Advisory Board, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Program. Frances Townsend says the director of the CIA is not a post for on-the-job training. (CNN) -- Leon Panetta is an impressive man with many laudable achievements to his credit. Mr. Panetta served eight terms in Congress and worked in the Clinton White House as chief of staff to the president and director of the Office of Management and Budget. But his impressive credentials are insufficient to allay the well-founded concerns of senior Democrats and Republicans that he is the wrong man to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Panetta is a seasoned political operative and a proven manager -- both of which would be useful to him as CIA director -- but more is required. Accurate and actionable intelligence is among our most effective tools in fighting against terror threats. The nation has gone more than seven years without a terrorist attack and much of the credit for that lies with the men and women of the intelligence community: in the CIA, FBI, and Defense and Homeland Security departments, among others. Career intelligence officials need a leader they can count on to protect their mission from inappropriate political interference and who would be willing to defend their efforts when, as is often the case, they are attacked based on less than accurate or complete facts. Because of the critical role the intelligence community plays in protecting our nation, the director of the CIA is not a position for on-the-job training. President-elect Barack Obama had a competent, qualified career intelligence official to nominate. John Brennan served for decades at the CIA under numerous directors and in both Democratic and Republican administrations. Just prior to his retirement, Mr. Brennan served as the director of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, the predecessor to the current National Counterterrorism Center. John Brennan had no loyalty to the policies of the Bush administration and in fact at times voiced his disagreement. Mr. Brennan's loyalty was to the mission and role of the intelligence community in protecting our nation. Unfortunately, the incoming administration permitted the vicissitudes of party politics and special interests to derail this nomination. [In a letter to Obama obtained by CNN in early December, Brennan said he was dropping out of consideration for the job because of strong criticism by people who associated his work at the CIA with controversial Bush administration policies on interrogation techniques and the pre-emptive war in Iraq.] . The next CIA director has many important issues to confront. He or she must continue to ensure adequate resources for the intelligence community and continue to build our human and technical intelligence capabilities. The new director will necessarily review detention, interrogation and rendition policies. And at the same time, the CIA director must seek new ways to gain the intelligence advantage on crucial priorities such as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and a host of regional issues in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Regardless of who becomes the next CIA director, the nation is fortunate that from the deputy director on down, the CIA is run by career officials who will continue to do the nation's business. But they will continue to require the tools necessary to do the job. Before abrogating Bush Administration policies on interrogation and detention, the new CIA director must learn: what is legal; what is effective; and how have these policies been implemented. A new administration may choose to make more limited use of these tools or add additional procedural safeguards. But any decision must be made with caution. Tools that the Justice Department deem legal and the intelligence community determines are effective must not be taken away because they are politically unpopular. The nation and the intelligence community deserve better and must be led with the same courage that they have displayed. President-elect Obama is off to a strong start, taking daily intelligence briefings and asking probing questions. If Mr. Panetta is to be the next CIA director, he will need to earn the trust, confidence and respect of career intelligence officials. Mr. Panetta will need these career intelligence officers to best advise the new president on the CIA capabilities at his disposal to support critical foreign policy and national security objectives. The most important objective will remain protecting American lives. Mr. Panetta is smart and no doubt a quick study. Let's pray if he is confirmed that he is up to the difficult job ahead of him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frances Townsend.","Frances Townsend: Leon Panetta has had a fine career in government .

"(CNN) -- Jenny's phone number is for sale, but not for a song. ""867-5309/Jenny"" originally appeared on Tommy Tutone's ""Tommy Tutone 2"" album. Bids for a New Jersey version of the number, stuck in the minds of millions since Tommy Tutone's ""867-5309/Jenny"" hit the Top 10 in 1982, had reached $5,100 on eBay as of Monday morning. The song is about a guy who finds Jenny's name and number scribbled on a bathroom wall. ""This is really, in my opinion, one of the last cultural remnants of the '80s pop culture era ... other than the mullet,"" said Spencer Potter, a 28-year-old DJ who is selling the number he got for free five years ago. While Potter is overlooking the fact that ""867-5309"" is an active phone number in dozens of other area codes, it does get called a lot by curious people. Potter said he has gotten about 40 calls a day since he got the area code 201 version for his Weehawken, New Jersey, DJ business. ""The minute we plugged the phone jack into the wall, it began ringing,"" Potter said. Mostly, Potter said, the callers are ""a lot of '80s fanatics"" and he lets the calls ring through to his voice mail. When he did answer a call three years ago, Potter found his own Jenny on the line. ""She had been using my number to give out to guys that she didn't like at bars,"" he said. ""It was a bum phone number."" The young lady from Hoboken, New Jersey, told Potter she was just curious about who might be getting the calls. Potter ended up asking her out. ""I figured if she was having to give out a bum number that often then she was probably pretty cute,"" he said. ""We ended up meeting for drinks. We dated for awhile and it was actually a great friendship."" Potter recently moved from Weehawken and decided to try to make money off the infamous digits with an eBay auction. Potter's DJ business goes with the number, a necessary provision to get around phone company rules against selling telephone numbers, he said. Phone companies technically own the numbers, not the customers. Potter said Vonage, the company that assigned the number, gave him permission to transfer it as part of the sale of his business. EBay halted a 2004 auction by the purported holder of the 212 area code version of the number, The New York Times reported. A Philadelphia-area resident who holds the toll-free versions -- both 800 and 888 -- said he values his numbers in the millions. Jeffrey Steinberg said his best offer so far, rejected several years ago, was for $1 million from a national weight-loss company. He acquired the numbers in the early 1990s for a pizza delivery campaign and has licensed them for other advertisers in the years since. Potter said when his auction ends next Monday, February 9, he hopes to make at least $40,000. He said he would use the money to take a Caribbean vacation -- away from his ringing phone. .

"(CNN)  -- North Korea said Saturday any sanctions or pressure applied against it following its rocket launch earlier this month will be considered a ""declaration of war."" A North Korean soldier looks into South Korea from the demilitarized zone on April 9. In an announcement on state-run television, the country said it was ready to step up efforts to develop nuclear weapons and poised for a military response to any moves against it. ""The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are always keeping themselves fully ready to go into action any moment to mercilessly punish anyone who encroaches upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit,"" it said. On Monday the United Nations condemned North Korea -- which refers to itself as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK -- for launching a rocket. The United States called the launch a ""provocative act"" that violated a 2006 Security Council resolution prohibiting Pyongyang from conducting ballistic missile launches. Pyongyang insists the April 5 launch was a successful mission to place a communications satellite into orbit. The United States says the rocket's payload did not reach orbit. The U.N. statement says the rocket launch was ""in contravention"" to a 2006 Security Council resolution that demanded that North Korea not launch any ballistic missiles. The 15-member council also voted unanimously for a statement by the council's president demanding the country make no more launches. ""The Korean People's Army will consider sanctions to be applied against the DPRK under various names over its satellite launch or any pressure to be put upon it through 'total participation' in the PSI (Proliferation Security Initiative) as a declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war against the DPRK,"" the announcement on state TV said. ""Now that the group officially declared confrontation and war against the DPRK, its revolutionary armed forces will opt for increasing the nation's defense capability including nuclear deterrent in every way, without being bound to the agreement adopted at the six-party talks,"" it continued, apparently referring to the Security Council. Referring to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, the statement added, ""The Lee group of traitors should never forget that Seoul is just 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from the Military Demarcation Line."" That line was established by the 1953 Armistice Agreement between the two Koreas -- which are still technically at war. A Friday report North Korea's official KCNA news agency, seemed to blame the ""war hysteria"" on the United States and South Korea after the two countries carried out a combined air force operation in South Korea. The ""'South Korea-U.S. military alliance' oft-repeated by them is, in essence, nothing but a 'war alliance' and 'alliance for aggression' aimed at invading the DPRK,"" the report said. ""When a nuclear war will break out due to the war chariot of the 'South Korea-U.S. military alliance' is a matter of time,"" it said. ""The U.S. and South Korean warmongers would be well advised to stop acting rashly, properly understanding who their rival is.""","North Korea says sanctions applied against it will be ""declaration of war""

"(CNN) -- Three people were killed and 10 wounded when a hospital treating victims of Sri Lanka's civil war was shelled for a fourth time in two days, the International Committee of the Red Cross told CNN Tuesday. A civilian, injured during fighting in rebel territory, lies on a bed at a hospital in Vavuniya on January 16, 2009. Artillery shells slammed into the hospital in the northern district of Mullaittivu on Monday evening. Strikes on the hospital on Sunday -- including one that hit the pediatric ward -- left 11 people dead, including some children, according to an aid worker who spoke to witnesses. Government forces and Tamil rebels are locked in a battle for the remaining rebel strongholds in northern Sri Lanka, where the the country's ethnic Tamil minority has been fighting for an independent homeland since 1983. Humanitarian groups say as many as 250,000 unprotected civilians are trapped in the area. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. International humanitarian aid agencies have asked for increased access to the region, calling conditions in northern Sri Lanka a ""nightmarish situation."" Sarah Crowe of UNICEF told CNN Monday that aid from the United Nations was getting into the war zone only every few days.  Watch video an aid  group says shows civilians suffering » . ""We need open access,"" she said. ""These children and families need to be protected and they need to get out fast."" Hundreds of civilians, including children, have been wounding in fighting since the end of last week. Government officials have accused aid organizations and foreign media of sensationalizing civilian casualties. ""It looks as if it's convenient for certain agencies to exaggerate the numbers so that this can be converted to a humanitarian crisis in the public eye, "" Secretary of Foreign Affairs Dr. Palitha Kohona told CNN. Over the weekend, Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised to ""continue with the military offensive until we liberate the remaining area under LTTE (the rebel group's) control,"" according to Sri Lanka's state-run news agency. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has promised to allow safe passage to trapped civilians and urged the Tamil Tigers, as the rebels are commonly known, to promise the same. A handful of U.N. staff are working round the clock to save a growing number of children caught in the crossfire, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday. Children as young as 4 months old were being treated in area hospitals for shrapnel injuries and other wounds of war, spokesman James Elder told CNN. ""There is just intense fighting in a small area where children and other civilians are,"" Elder said. ""The space [where conflict is taking place] is shrinking and the fighting is augmenting."" Last Thursday, U.N. aid workers rescued 50 critically injured children and 105 adults, he said. ""We are trying to get as many people out of there as we can,"" Elder said.

"(CNN)  -- After nearly 150 years in business, the Rocky Mountain News published its final edition Friday, the victim of a bad economy and the Internet generation. The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado, published its last edition Friday after 150 years. The final front-page headline simply says: ""Goodbye, Colorado."" ""It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to you today. Our time chronicling the life of Denver and Colorado, the nation and the world, is over."" The Rocky Mountain News' owner, E.W. Scripps Co., made the announcement to the newsroom at noon Thursday, ending three months of speculation and drama over its fate. The News had been put up for sale in December. The Rocky Mountain News was the latest victim in an era of shutdowns, layoffs and cutbacks plaguing the newspaper industry. ""It's in a free fall and nobody knows where the bottom is. It's kind of like water in the toilet swirling around and nobody knows what's left when you're done flushing,"" media critic Eric Alterman said.  Watch how the economy and Internet are taking a toll on the industry » . Newspapers across the country are under pressure as readership declines, along with advertising revenue, while more and more Americans get their information online. ""All newspapers are under great pressure. They'll survive, but they'll survive in different forms, their costs base will have to be dramatically lowered,"" said Mort Zuckerman, publisher of the New York Daily News, which has the seventh highest circulation in the country. The dramatic decline in advertising dollars in a brutal economy has forced newspapers to cut costs by firing cartoonists, columnists and others, leaving them searching for jobs in a struggling industry. Pia Catton lost her job as arts editor of the New York Sun five months ago, when the newspaper closed. She has taken a short-term job editing a book, but she thinks she may need to look at different careers soon. ""There will always be a market for news, you will always need to know immediately what's happening. Will there be a market for newspapers? That's another question,"" she said. The Rocky Mountain News had more than 200 editorial employees, according to the Columbia Journalism Review's Web site. Rich Boehne, chief executive officer of Scripps, told employees the newspaper was the victim of a terrible economy, an upheaval in the newspaper industry and multimillion-dollar annual losses. ""Denver can't support two newspapers any longer,"" Boehne said. ""It's certainly not good news for you, and it's certainly not good news for Denver."" The News has been in a joint operating agreement with The Denver Post since 2001, which combined the papers' business operations in an effort to save money, but left the editorial departments separate. The News' closure leaves Denver with one major newspaper, like most American cities. ""We've been, sort of, hanging on the edge for so long,"" said Mel Pompanio, a presentation editor for the paper. ""What a huge loss for Colorado today."" This week, the San Francisco Chronicle announced it was in danger of being sold or closed if it doesn't stop losing millions. Officials from the Hearst Corp., owners of the Chronicle, said the paper lost $50 million in 2008 and is on pace to lose more this year. ""It's difficult. It's hard,"" Lynn Bartels, a political reporter and 26-year employee for Scripps, said of the News' closing. ""I haven't returned any phone calls yet, because I don't need to be reporting and crying at the same time. I've done that enough."" Long faces dominated the newsroom in video posted on the paper's Web site. A few sobs could be heard, too, as the announcement of the closing began to sink in among employees. ""I could say stupid things like 'I know how you feel.' I don't,"" Boehne said. ""We are just deeply sorry. I hope you will accept that.""

"(CNN) -- Online and on the air, talking about sports has almost always been a guy thing. Former athletes and coaches banter on a more-or-less equal footing with other guys who've never played a down or never hiked a ball but have a head full of stats and an encyclopedic knowledge of the manly arts. Meshall Shuman zooms in on Hattie Lemon at a recent taping of ""Ladies in the Locker Room"" It's almost insulting to say the obvious, but there are plenty of women who know their sports, too. And they have their own sports show, one that offers an alternative to the ""testosterone ceiling"" of the guys' club. It's called ""Ladies in the Locker Room,"" and TV subscribers in the Atlanta, Georgia, area have been tuning in to its unique brand of sports commentary, analysis and trivia since 2004.  Watch the 'Ladies in the Locker Room' » . The show is the brainchild of Hattie Lemon, a prolific writer, director, producer and actor whose independent crime series ""Atlanta Homicide"" is featured on the CoLours TV network. ""Ladies in the locker room are not women who think they know everything about sports; they just know the men who do,"" Lemon said. It's one of the catchphrases she uses to describe the show that immediately disarms most critics who otherwise wouldn't respect an all-female sports show. ""It's all women, all sports, all sexy,"" Lemon said. ""It's a combination of my love of sports and my love of media."" Each year for the past five years, Lemon has recruited a new group of personalities and production crew members to punch out about a half-dozen shows. The show is captured live at sports clubs and restaurants across the Atlanta metro area, with additional time in the studio to create produced segments to add to the mix.  Photo gallery: Making 'Ladies in the Locker Room' » . And for the second time in the show's history, Lemon is traveling to the Super Bowl with a handful of her ladies and a production crew to create a version of the show featuring interviews with the celebrities and stars flocking to football's big game. Soma Balber, a self-professed superfan of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team and one of the show's commentators for the 2008-09 season, first got to know Lemon when she began playing a recurring role in ""Atlanta Homicide."" They got to talking about sports, and Balber was asked to be a part of the show. ""It's kind of nice to show the audience that women can have fun watching sports,"" Balber said. ""And we want to educate women about sports as well."" Lemon, who describes herself as a huge fan of professional football, says she hopes her show will lead more men to understand that women love sports, too. ""When women talk about sports, sometimes men look at us as groupies,"" Lemon said. ""Men don't think women understand sports."" As for men who have never played sports but still know all the stats? They get the ""man pass."" It's not fair, she says, but ""it is what it is. I just hope we get more women talking about sports.""","Hattie Lemon created show to merge loves of sports and media .

"(CNN) -- Three crew members died in a fiery Navy helicopter crash near Corpus Christi, Texas, a military spokesman said, and a fourth is hospitalized in critical condition. The Navy MH-53 Sea Dragon helicopter crashed in a field about four miles south of Corpus Christi on Wednesday just after 8 p.m. It caught fire after impact, said Ed Mackley with the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command. Copter wreckage came to rest near guide wires of a 1,000-foot TV tower for Public Broadcasting System affiliate KEDT, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Authorities refused to tell The Associate Press whether the Sea Dragon collided with the tower. A witness reported a huge fireball and booming noise shortly after the crash. Rescuers found bodies of three crew members about 2:30 a.m. on Thursday, Mackley said.  Watch smoke and flames after the crash » . Witness J.D. Batten told the Caller-Times he was walking on his property about two miles from the crash site when he heard a helicopter overhead. ""I saw a red-glowing fireball shoot hundreds of feet up into the air,"" he told the paper. ""I heard a giant boom a second later. It was then dead silent, and I couldn't hear the helicopter anymore."" A fourth crew member was in critical condition at Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, Mackley said. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the families,"" Mackley said. Authorities did not immediately identify the victims. The aircraft was part of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 out of Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, a military spokesman told the Caller-Times. The Caller-Times quoted a Navy spokesman who said the aircraft was on a training mission and the crash occurred during heavy fog. A military investigation will try to determine what caused the crash, Mackley said. First responders to the crash site were hindered by downed power lines, according to the Caller-Times report.

"DOHA, Qatar (CNN) -- If there's anything in which Qatar takes pride -- aside from a massive construction boom -- it is providing its Qatari minority and the hundreds of thousands of expatriates working and living here with plenty of shopping opportunities. City Center Mall booked ""Freestyle Football"" artist Iya Traore, from Guinea, to help draw more crowds in Doha . You can nary drive a kilometer in Doha -- few Qataris actually walk the streets -- without passing a shopping mall. And few of those malls are lacking hordes of people strolling from store to store. From the pricey jewel-adorned head scarf fashions to budget-conscious it-could-be-rat-leather shoes, food courts to suit Eastern and Western tastes, to perfume shops selling essences for more per ounce than many people earn in a month -- shoppers in Doha are spoiled for choice. I'm lucky to have a few Qatari national friends in Doha. Each time I visit, I'm treated to a familiar, and always entertaining, routine ... passing time at a succession of shopping centers. Yes, many of you may think this pastime -- especially in America -- is for the kiddies. You are right. And yes, my friends and I are in our 30s. But there's a more sophisticated, Arab cultural aspect to ""hanging out"" at a Starbucks at Landmark Shopping Center or drinking mint tea at one of the restaurants in the renovated Souq Waqif. For many ""shoppers"" -- male and female -- these centers are an opportunity catch up with friends, and discretely flirt and mingle ... even if only by exchanging messages via Bluetooth on the cellphone. And unlike many teenyboppers cruising the malls of America, most of the adults here are a shop owner's dream: high-end, impulse purchasing consumers with a lot of money to spend -- and a lot of time to kill. Little surprise then, that shopping mall developers and management have taken to providing more entertainment options to pull in the crowds: The obligatory movie theater, for example. One mall's basement is host to a skating rink. At a recent stop at City Center-Doha Mall, thumping hip-hop beats had kids dropping their McDonald's ice cream cones and running to the center atrium to see what all the fuss was about. Turns out there's this athlete literally center stage of the mall, kicking and balancing a soccer ball -- OK, football -- about his head, shoulders, legs and back with such skill he might put Ronaldo to shame -- and doing this to the beat of hip-hop African tunes for what seemed more than just a few minutes. Guinean native Iya Traore's ""freestyle soccer"" routine mesmerized the crowd. Ironically, it distracted them from shopping -- but kept shoppers in the Mall longer and gave people something new to talk about. Apparently his athletic tricks have landed him television and live performances in Japan, Turkey, Mali, Germany, France and, increasingly, in the Arab world. Africa would seem a long way to book an act to attract more shoppers. But then again, the stakes are high in an increasingly competitive shopping mall-packed Qatar. As long as the mall remains an outlet to spend petro-dollars -- and Doha's main, all-access social networking scene -- mall developers will have to step up their game to keep consumers happy.

"(CNN) -- State officials said Monday that they suspect a drug reaction or toxins killed 21 horses as they were prepared to compete in a Sunday polo match in Wellington, Florida. Blue tarps obstruct the view of horses that died at the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida. State officials and local law enforcement also announced Monday that they are launching investigations into the deaths as scientists work to pinpoint what exactly killed the horses. Officials believe that the ""very rapid onset of sickness and death"" points to toxins or a drug reaction and also allows them to rule out other possibilities. ""At this time, there is no evidence that these horses were affected with an infectious or contagious disease, as there are no other horses affected at this time,"" according to Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesman Terence McElroy. Officials are continuing to conduct tests, and Florida agriculture scientists are performing necropsies on the animals. ""We'll be testing blood and tissue to see what the common denominator was here: Was it something injected? Was it bad water? And so forth,"" McElroy said. John Walsh, the Lechuza Caracas polo club president, said he was told that there was no contagious virus airborne or disease and that the incident was an ""isolated"" one.   Watch Walsh talk about the devastating deaths » . ""This was a mistake of a combination of something, and whether the mistake was at the barn, whether the mistake was at the feed company, whether the mistake was at the vitamin company,"" Scott Swerdlin of the Palm Beach Equine Clinic, who treated some of the horses, told CNN affiliate WPTV. ""We don't know, but we're going to find out."" James Belden, a veterinarian at the Left Bank Equine Clinic who also treated some of the horses, told WPTV that he and others don't suspect foul play. ""I think this is an accident,"" he told WPTV. ""A terrible accident."" McElroy said that despite the early indications, he does not want to jump to conclusions about what happened. ""Obviously, this is a tragic situation, and we are working hard to determine what happened,"" he said. ""But it would be irresponsible to speculate on what may have killed the horses. We will wait until the facts are in before making any specific comments on the case."" Officials in the state Agriculture and Consumer Services Department will investigate the case with the help of the department's Division of Animal Industry, the department's Office of Agricultural Law Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies. The horses were part of the Venezuela-based Lechuza Caracas team and were being kept at the team's trailers on the grounds of the International Polo Club Palm Beach. Fifteen horses that seemed disoriented died before Sunday's match, said McElroy, and their bodies were sent to the state-run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando, Florida. Luis Escobar, a player on the opposing Team Blackwatch, was on the grounds when the horses began to fall ill. ""I thought it was something temporary, and I saw a veterinarian and thought maybe it was one or two horses, and the vet was going to give something to help them out, and it was going to be done,"" he said. ""But it wasn't."" Two horses initially collapsed, and as veterinarians and team officials scrambled to revive them, five others became dizzy, Tim O'Connor, spokesman for the polo club, said Sunday.  Watch as vets search for clues » . Escobar said soon things got worse, and other horses started to get sick. Peter Rizzo, executive director of the United States Polo Association, was at the match and saw the horses drop. ""It was surreal,"" he said, calling the deaths ""unprecedented."" ""It is a horrible tragedy,"" he said. Some of the 15 horses died immediately, but some lingered for about 45 minutes, Swerdlin said Sunday, according to a report in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. The clinic is the International Polo Club's consulting veterinarian group, the newspaper said. Six of the 21 horses were kept overnight in the same trailer in Wellington, said McElroy, and died sometime between Sunday and Monday. Their bodies have not been taken to the Kissimmee lab. Escobar said he's never seen anything like the scenario that unfolded Sunday night. He says the players and trainers do ""everything possible"" to keep the horses in optimum condition, saying ""they are babied every single day, all day long."" The U.S. Polo Association, the sport's governing body, is opening their own investigation. Celeste Kunz, chief examining veterinarian at the New York Racing Association and a 19-year veterinarian, said Monday that she suspected a tainted substance was injected into the horses. ""[It was] something that was administered for it to work in a short amount of time and have an animal succumb that quickly,"" Kunz said. ""My thought is that something was injected, because it would have to affect the central nervous system."" Escobar, from his experience with the animals, agreed. ""When something like this happens, if there was disease or illness or virus, other horses would already be coming out,"" he said. ""Anything that would come whether it's something like this or a small stomachache, we see it, because we are there with them all the time."" Anabolic steroids are not likely to have caused the deaths, either, Kunz said. ""It takes at least five days for [anabolic steroids] to really work, and the effects aren't real obvious at first,"" she said. ""Most of the time, [anabolic steroids] are used to build up their muscularity."" Each team brings between 40 to 60 horses for matches. The ponies are continuously switched out throughout a match to keep them from overexerting themselves, O'Connor said. The horses were between 10 and 11 years old and were valued at about $100,000 each, club spokesman O'Connor said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. CNN's Kimberly Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report.","21 thoroughbred horses died at International Polo Club Palm Beach .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The plastic surgeon who operated on hip-hop star Kanye West's mother the day before she died abruptly walked off the set of CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Tuesday, saying he was honoring a request from her family. ""I think I'm taking up your air time,"" Dr. Jan Adams tells CNN's Larry King before walking off. ""I want to thank you for this opportunity,"" Dr. Jan Adams told King. ""Basically, I had come here to talk about things in the press that aren't accurate about me. ""But I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for the West family. They asked me not to go on. And I've said from the very beginning, I don't have a side in this,"" Adams said. ""They are my side, and I'm going to respect their wishes. I'm going to apologize to you because I think I'm taking up your air time, but I will not be on the show and I'm not going to discuss any of that. I'm going to honor their wishes."" When King asked Adams if he would ever answer questions regarding the West case, he said, ""I will talk with them,"" meaning her family. ""When they are comfortable, then I will be comfortable. If they are never comfortable, then I will never be comfortable. They are what's important to me,"" Adams said. Asked whether he wanted to speak out, Adams said he did not, removed his earpiece and left the set.  Watch Adams walk off » . Earlier, as the show began, King said Adams had received a letter from West's family, saying that if Adams discussed West's case on the show, the family would ask the Medical Board of California to decertify him. Adams' brief appearance and walkout followed discussions with his attorney and ""Larry King Live"" producers. ""To the extent there are issues about even why he's here, why this is in the media, it relates to the relationship he had with his patient,"" Alan Tenenbaum, one of West's attorneys, told King.  Watch CNN's Lola Ogunnaike describe the backstage drama » . ""So until he gets clearance from the family, I don't think it would be fair or right for him to talk about these things."" The letter from West family attorneys asking Adams not to go on the show was faxed to one of Adams' attorneys in California, Tenenbaum said.  Watch Larry King discuss the strange scene » . West, 58, died November 10 after she was found unresponsive and in respiratory distress at her home, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said. Her funeral was held Tuesday in Spencer, Oklahoma. An autopsy was inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests, coroner's spokesman Ed Winter said last week. But preliminary reports indicate West may have died from complications of cosmetic surgery, which was performed by Adams the day before, he said. Adams told TMZ.com that he performed a tummy tuck and breast reduction on West and that her death was unforeseen. But another Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon said he had recently refused to perform a procedure on West until she had medical clearance for a condition he feared could lead to a heart attack. ""The preliminary information we had indicated that she had several minor medical issues, but I can't comment on those,"" Winter said. West was taking some medications, Winter added, but could not say which ones and in what dosages pending the toxicology reports. West was in good condition before the surgery, Winter said. Investigators are talking with Adams about the surgery. Adams told TMZ.com that West's death could have been caused by a heart attack, pulmonary embolism or massive vomiting. He said he consulted with her for months and she changed her mind several times about going forward with the surgery, TMZ.com said. TMZ.com, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. Legal documents filed in California show that Adams faces disciplinary action from the state Medical Board for multiple DUI convictions and that he has paid nearly $500,000 in at least two malpractice lawsuits. Last week, Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon Andre Aboolian said through his publicist that Donda West consulted him in June about a procedure. Publicist Jo-Ann Geffen said West contacted Aboolian again two weeks ago to say she was ready to go forward, but Aboolian said he needed a medical clearance before he would perform the surgery. ""I always insist on a medical clearance for women over 40, and in this instance it was particularly important because of a condition she had that I felt could have led to a heart attack,"" Aboolian said, according to Geffen's statement. West was scheduled to see an internist for the appropriate tests, but did not keep the appointment, Geffen said. Donda West was a major influence on her son's life, as the music producer-singer-songwriter has often said -- including in lyrics to some of his songs. She regularly attended her son's concerts and was at his performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September.

Billy Powell, center, poses with other members of Lynyrd Skynyrd at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2006. Powell, who died early Wednesday, had survived the band's October 1977 plane crash in Mississippi that killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; Gaines's sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines; an assistant road manager; and the pilot and copilot. Powell was seriously injured in the crash. More than 40 fans left messages on a fan Web site. ""Billy, you are truely free now. Rock on with Ronnie and the gang.

""I cannot believe the hurt that I have felt from being a Skynyrd fan, but I realize that it only hurts so much because I love the members of this band like my own family. We will always miss you, Billy. I can hear your fingertips rolling off those ivory keys right now. Thanks for being you. Rest in peace and may God bless you,"" another fan wrote. According to Orange Park Police Lt. Mark Cornett, Powell called 911 around midnight Tuesday from his condo at the Club Continental, complaining about chest pains. ""When paramedics and police arrived, they found him unresponsive on the bed,"" Cornett said. Powell was pronounced dead at the scene, and his cardiologist signed the death certificate at 1:52 a.m. ET Wednesday. According to the officer, Powell missed an appointment with the same doctor on Tuesday. Powell joined the original Skynyrd band in 1972, but he worked for the Jacksonville, Florida-based band for several years before that as a crew member. Among the Southern rock band's acclaimed songs are ""What's Your Name,"" ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" all released in the 1970s. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" reached the top 10 in 1974. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Two years after the plane crash, Powell, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington and Leon Wilkeson formed the Rossington-Collins Band. It broke up in 1982. A new Lynyrd Skynyrd band formed in 1987 and included Johnny Van Zant, Ronnie's brother. It began a tour in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the plane was headed when it crashed.

"HONOLULU, Hawaii (CNN) -- Battered by the current economic recession, Hawaii's economy could get a strong boost from two key sporting events. The Pro Bowl this year was played at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. It will return there in 2011. The National Football League's Pro Bowl Game will return to Honolulu in 2011 -- an event that is expected to bring millions of dollars in revenue. Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann is also hoping to lure the 31st Summer Olympic Games -- but not to his city. He's actively supporting Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Games. ""How does that play out for Hawaii? Well, obviously if we get the Olympics -- that is (the) USA -- we benefit from a Discover America campaign that we'd like to see with visitors coming prior to Chicago to Hawaii or after, and visiting other parts of our country,"" the mayor said. ""What I really want to do is promote Hawaii as a great place for some of these teams to come and do a little R&R (rest and relaxation) or training before they go on to the Olympics in Chicago."" Hannemann will head to Chicago, Illinois, this weekend to court International Olympics Committee members, who are in the Windy City to evaluate its plan to host the Games. On October 2, the IOC will choose among Chicago; Madrid, Spain; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; or Tokyo, Japan, as the 2016 host city. Hannemann co-chairs the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Olympic Task Force, along with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, which he said aims ""to bring the Olympics to America in 2016."" Hawaii's economy is heavily dependent on tourism, and the economic recession means fewer people are visiting the island state. With three-quarters of the state's population living in Honolulu, Hannemann said, workers are especially hit hard in the capital city. ""The slowdown in tourism has resulted in shorter hours, in some cases even a decrease in their wages, and hopefully a last resort is some of them are being laid off as a result of some of these businesses going out of business,"" he said. ""So our job is just to continue to do what we can to work with private industry to shore up the tourism industry. It is our No. 1 industry, nothing comes close."" Tourism accounts for between $10 billion and $12 billion each year compared to Hawaii's second-largest industry, which is military spending, according to Hannemann. That accounts for between $3 billion and $4 billion annually, the mayor said. Last month, the Hawaii Tourism Authority voted to allow the NFL's Pro Bowl game to return to Hawaii in 2011 and 2012. The game has been held the week after the Super Bowl at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu since 1980, and has sold out every time. Next year, it will take place in Miami, Florida, before the Super Bowl -- raising concerns that it will not be as much of a draw because no Super Bowl players will participate in the game. Hawaii authorities agreed to allow the game to return to the state under the condition that the NFL would consider returning the Pro Bowl to the Sunday after the Super Bowl ""depending on the success, or failure, of the 2010 game in Miami,"" according to the NFL. Hannemann said the tens of thousands of people who attend the game annually have then spent ""at least $30 million"" across the state of Hawaii. Losing the game would not only be an economic loss for the state, but a ""major downer"" for residents, he said. ""People (have) said, 'Oh, my goodness, now we lost the Pro Bowl. We've had it here for over 20 years, it's been a sell-out. What's going on here? ... Everything's going to go out of Hawaii,' "" Hannemann said. ""So I got involved, I went and talked to some of the commissioners there, I changed their votes, and we're able to keep the Pro Bowl here."" But hosting the Pro Bowl will come at a cost. Hawaii will have to pay $4 million each year it hosts the game. In a recent commentary in the East Oahu Sun newspaper, writer Joe Edwards questioned whether the cost of hosting the game would come at the expense of projects more vital to residents -- such as a long-awaited rail transit project. ""Don't get me wrong: I like the Pro Bowl. I've been to several. It's a great show. But our own citizens, and our own football team, should come well before the NFL,"" Edwards wrote. Hannemann insists that despite the recession, he will be able to deliver on his campaign promise of a public rail system in Honolulu, which is scheduled to break ground this year. ""Even under the rubric of a stimulus package, we're going to get some monies there to push this out,"" Hannemann said, noting that Hawaii's senior U.S. senator, Daniel Inouye, is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He also said the measure is supported by President Barack Obama, who was born and grew up in Hawaii. ""These are tough times, but if there's a necessary project -- what I call a need-to-have versus a nice-to-have -- I'm going to make all the justification in the world and then we're going to do it,"" he said.","NFL's Pro Bowl will return to Hawaii in 2011 .

"BUFFALO, New York (CNN) -- One person credits bad weather and the other a long line. An investigator works the scene of the plane crash Friday outside Buffalo, New York. Those are the reasons two would-be passengers did not fly on Continental Connection Flight 3407, which crashed Thursday outside Buffalo, killing all 49 people aboard and one on the ground. ""It could have been me,"" David Becony said from his home in Springville, New York, as he watched television reports on the crash and its fiery aftermath. ""My wife would have been with all those families"" who had loved ones on the plane. Becony missed the flight from Newark-Liberty International Airport to Buffalo Niagara International Airport because bad weather had delayed his earlier flight from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Newark. Unable to get another flight and unable to find a hotel room near the airport, the supervisor for a demolition company decided to camp out on a seat in the terminal.  Watch how airlines have reacted to crash » . When he found out the plane he was to have taken had crashed, he called his wife, Marti, at their home outside Buffalo. ""He broke down, and I broke down,"" she said. ""We just couldn't believe it."" Becony spent a sleepless night in Newark and then returned Friday morning to Buffalo -- on another Continental Connection flight. It wasn't a smooth ride, Becony said of his Friday flight. ""It was weird, shaky, knowing it was the same type of aircraft."" That type of aircraft was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft, operated by Colgan Air for Continental Connection's regional service. ""I'm still in shock, really,"" said 49-year-old Becony, a Catholic. ""God was looking over me."" Becony is keeping his unused ticket for Flight 3407 as a reminder of how close he came. His wife said friends and family called all morning to check on his safety. ""It is wow,"" she said. ""It's been unbelievable. We're happy. We're sad for everybody else."" Asked how her husband's close call would affect the family, which includes two children and two grandchildren, she said, ""I think we'll probably appreciate each other a lot more."" Susan Reinhardt, 49, a marketer for Verizon, had a confirmed seat on a 4:30 p.m. flight from Newark to Buffalo, but it was delayed for four hours because of bad weather, and she was looking for alternatives. Using her Blackberry to search Continental's Web site, she noted that the 7 p.m. flight was delayed by only about 20 minutes, so she asked the gate agent whether she could get on the standby list for that flight. ""He said, 'It's pretty open ... easy eight standby seats. You won't have a problem getting on it,' she said . ""I said, 'Can you put me on standby?' He said, 'No, you've got to go on the customer service line.' "" But that line ""was a gazillion deep because of all the delays,"" enough to dissuade her from making the switch. ""I said, ehhh."" When she heard about the crash, Reinhardt was happy for her good fortune but shaken nevertheless. ""The heart-wrenching piece for me was, I was at the gate talking to this gate agent, and a young woman came up and she wanted to know: Should she stay on the 7 o'clock flight because of all the delays? Did the gate agent think the 4:30 was going to get out before the 7? ""He said, 'No, you will still get in before the 4:30,' and she said, 'OK, I'm going to stay on the 7 o'clock; I'm calling my boyfriend.' And she did."" For a while, the two women stood together at the gate, both of them using their Blackberries to study the flight information. Then, they went their separate ways. ""I said, 'Good for you. Have a nice trip.' That's the killer for me."" Reinhardt said her flight was uneventful. She and the other passengers landed at the airport in Buffalo shortly before 11 p.m., oblivious to what had happened just minutes before and a few miles away. ""I walked out, and I saw all these people standing there, and I'm thinking, 'It's Thursday at 11 at night. Why are all these people in Buffalo? Who are they waiting for?'  Watch witnesses describe fiery crash » . ""They were waiting for that plane that didn't come in. Of course, I didn't know that until I got to my car, and then my phone starts ringing."" Reinhardt said the close call has made her ""a little more philosophical where, if it wasn't my time, OK, it wasn't my time. What is the meaning of my life now? What am I supposed to do because it wasn't my time? I've had several people say, you know, sometimes you can't ask why. It just is the way it is."" Reinhardt said she plans to go to one of the memorial services. ""I think I need to do that for some kind of closure."" CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","David Becony misses flight due to bad weather that delayed previous flight .

"(CNN)  -- Buy a $175,000 package to attend the Oscars and you might buy yourself trouble, lawyers for the Academy Awards warn. The 81st annual Academy Awards will be held on February 22 from Hollywood's Kodak Theatre. The advertising of such packages -- including four tickets to the upcoming 81st annual Academy Awards and a hotel stay in Los Angeles, California -- has prompted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to sue an Arizona-based company. The Academy accused the company Experience 6 of selling ""black-market"" tickets, because tickets to the lavish movie awards show cannot be transferred or sold. Selling tickets could become a security issue that could bring celebrity stalkers or terrorists to the star-studded event, says the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in the Central District of California. ""Security experts have advised the Academy that it must not offer tickets to members of the public and must know identities of the event attendees,"" the lawsuit says. ""In offering such black-market tickets, defendants are misleading the public and the ticket buyers into thinking that purchasers will be welcomed guests, rather than as trespassers, when they arrive for the ceremony."" Experience 6 did not return calls from CNN for comment. On Tuesday morning, tickets to the event were still being advertised on the company's Web site.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Letters containing white powder were mailed to 16 U.S. embassies across Europe, according to the State Department on Wednesday. Emergency services surround U.S. Embassy in Madrid, Spain. The substance has proved to be harmless in 15 locations with results still pending for the final embassy in The Hague, Netherlands, Deputy Spokesman Robert Wood said. He said the list of U.S. embassies where the powder was received includes Berlin, Germany; Bern, Switzerland; Brussels, Belgium; Bucharest, Romania; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Oslo, Norway; Paris, France; Reykjavik, Iceland; Riga, Latvia; Rome, Italy; Stockholm, Sweden; Tallinn, Estonia; and The Hague.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) --  -- Federal officials have fined Exxon Mobil more than $6 million after it violated a three-year-old agreement to decrease air pollution at four of its refineries. Exxon Mobil's refinery in Baytown, Texas, is one of four that the EPA said had high sulfur emissions. The Justice Department announced Wednesday that the oil giant agreed to pay $6.1 million after Environmental Protection Agency officials determined the company had not sufficiently reduced sulfur emissions in its refineries in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Torrance, California. Exxon Mobil had paid a $7.7 million fine in its original 2005 agreement with the government and promised to install new emissions controls at the refineries. The petroleum company said after the latest settlement its refineries now meet the required EPA standards on sulfur emissions. The company's role in environmental pollution has been in the spotlight ever since the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska, the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This past summer, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the company to pay $507 million in punitive damages from the incident, down from an original $2.5 billion judgment.","EPA says company had not sufficiently reduced sulfur emissions at four refineries .

"Editor's note: Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University . Economist Jeffrey Miron says the stimulus guideline should be -- first, do no harm. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When libertarians question the merit of President Obama's stimulus package, a frequent rejoinder is, ""Well, we have to do something."" This is hardly a persuasive response. If the cure is worse than the disease, it is better to live with the disease. In any case, libertarians do not argue for doing nothing; rather, they advocate eliminating or adjusting policies that are bad for the economy independent of the recession. Here is a stimulus package that libertarians can endorse: . Repeal the Corporate Income Tax: Repeal would spur investment, improve the transparency of corporate accounting, slash compliance costs, and avoid the distortions caused by the special-interest provisions in the tax code. Repeal can work fast, by raising companies' share prices, increasing cash flow, and allowing corporations to lessen their need for bank lending. Thus repeal provides short-run stimulus and enhances long-run efficiency. Recent estimates suggest that tax cuts are at least as effective as spending increases in raising GDP. The adverse impact on the deficit is likely to be less than the $300-$350 billion in revenue the corporate tax takes in per year, since repeal spurs growth and therefore the revenue from other taxes. Increase Carbon Taxes While Lowering Marginal Tax Rates: Reasonable people disagree about how much the U.S. should reduce its use of fossil fuels, but crowded highways, air pollution, and global warming all suggest that some reduction is desirable. The effective way to accomplish this is higher gasoline or other carbon taxes, not the messy, complicated green spending in the Obama plan that will morph into pork in many cases. If higher carbon taxes are combined with lower marginal tax rates, the private sector faces better incentives on both counts. This approach avoids the higher deficits implied by Obama's green initiatives. Moderate the Growth of Entitlements: The elephant in the room amidst the stimulus debate is the impending imbalance in Social Security and Medicare as the baby boom generation moves into retirement. Without reductions in benefits, taxes will have to increase substantially, generating a major drag on the U.S. economy. A reasonable response is to raise the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare, consistent with the increases in life expectancy and health that have occurred in past decades. This restructuring would reassure markets about the U.S.'s long-run fiscal balance. This means foreigners will continue to be willing to hold U.S. debt, so U.S. borrowing costs will remain moderate. Eliminate Wasteful Spending: Most discussion of the stimulus focuses on areas where, according to proponents, government spending should be higher. Much current expenditure, however, is wasteful. Examples include agricultural subsidies, bloated transportation projects like the Big Dig in Boston, misguided infrastructure projects like the New Orleans levees (why encourage people to live below sea level?), ineffective weapons systems, pork barrel spending, and subsidies for Amtrak and the Post Office (buses are more efficient than railways, and Fedex is more efficient than the Post Office). Everyone knows the U.S.'s long-run deficit picture is dismal. We should address this by cutting inefficient spending now. Withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan: President Obama plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq over the next eighteen months, while expanding U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. It is hard to see, however, that any good arises from dragging out our Iraq exit or from staying in Afghanistan. The government should move toward faster withdrawal, and from both countries. The U.S. can redeploy these troops where useful, or release the resources to civilian uses. Limit Union Power: Later this year, Congress is likely to vote on the card check bill, a new law that facilitates unionization. The law eliminates the presumption of a secret ballot, which means union organizers can pressure employees into accepting representation. Laws that protect unions are problematic. Unions raise wages above market levels, increasing unemployment. Thus the Obama administration can signal American business that it cares about efficiency, not just redistribution of wealth, by opposing the card check bill. Better yet, it can repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, which inflates labor costs in federal contracts. Renew the U.S. Commitment to Free Trade: One crucial danger in the current environment is that the U.S. and other countries will embrace protectionist policies. The U.S. enacted prohibitive tariffs during the Great Depression, and many trading partners retaliated. World trade plummeted, contributing to the economic misery. The Obama fiscal stimulus risks reviving this insanity, since both the House and Senate bills require that certain stimulus-funded projects use U.S. equipment and goods. The administration should oppose these provisions. More generally, President Obama and his economic advisors should state -- no, scream -- that America is unambiguously committed to free trade. Expand Legal Immigration: Radical changes in immigration policy seem unlikely in the near future, but one specific change is compelling: an increased quota for H-1B visas, which go to workers with technical skills seeking employment in U.S. industry. The annual quota for such visas was 195,000 as recently as 2000, but it now stands at only 65,000. A major increase in this quota would be a boon to American scientific and engineering productivity. More broadly, expanding immigration is the most effective method the U.S. has for aiding poor citizens of foreign countries and for influencing repressive governments. Stop Bailing out Businesses that Took on Too Much Risk: Popular opinion blames deregulation and private sector greed for the financial meltdown, but the reality is more subtle. Existing regulation was ineffective at preventing excessive risk-taking, and the private sector did its best to profit from the incentives that were in place. The extreme increase in risk-taking, however, would not have occurred absent policies that encouraged such risk (e.g., Fannie Mae or the Fed's reassurances about housing bubbles) or past bailouts that cushioned the losses from private risk-taking. One crucial response to any crisis is learning to avoid the next one. The lesson this time is that rewarding risk generates more risk. The U.S. should therefore stop bailing out banks, automakers, homeowners, or anyone else. The libertarian view, then, is that many desirable policy changes involve less government, not more. Even changes that are inconsistent with the Keynesian stimulus framework, such as reductions in military spending, make sense when the spending is wasteful. It is tempting to believe that every problem has a solution, but the reality is not so nice. It is possible, even likely, that the best we can do is fix things we know how to fix, and then get out of the way. This may not ameliorate the current situation, but it avoids making things worse. In economics as in medicine -- first, do no harm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron.","Jeffrey Miron: Key rule of stimulus plan should be: first, do no harm .
He says plan should repeal the corporate income tax, raise retirement age .
Miron says ""buy American"" rules should be avoided and free trade backed .
Miron: Government shouldn't make it easier for unions to organize ."
"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Natasha Richardson, a film star, Tony-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting family, died Wednesday after suffering injuries in a ski accident, according to a family statement. She was 45. Natasha Richardson fell on a beginners' slope in Canada. Richardson, wife of actor Liam Neeson, was injured Monday in a fall on a ski slope at a Quebec resort about 80 miles northwest of Montreal. Richardson's family released a statement saying, ""Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time."" According to a statement from Mont Tremblant Ski Resort, Richardson fell during a lesson on a beginners' trail.  Watch a report on Richardson's life » . ""She did not show any visible sign of injury, but the ski patrol followed strict procedures and brought her back to the bottom of the slope and insisted she should see a doctor,"" the statement said. Richardson, accompanied by her instructor, returned to her hotel, but about an hour after the fall was ""not feeling good,"" the statement said. An ambulance was called, and Richardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal. From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Friends and colleagues were saddened by her death. ""Natasha was brilliant, beautiful, funny, talented beyond measure, as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp,"" said Jodie Foster, who worked with Richardson in ""Nell,"" in a statement. ""Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her. May Liam, her beautiful boys and her loving family hold her close as they move through this tragic moment."" ""Natasha combined the best of [her parents, Vanessa] Redgrave and [Tony] Richardson: the enormous depth and emotional force of a great actor on the one hand, and the intelligence and objectivity of a great director on the other. She was a one-of-a-kind, a magnificent actress,"" said director Sam Mendes in a statement. Mendes directed Richardson in her Tony-winning ""Cabaret"" performance. Richardson was practically born to perform. Her grandfather, Sir Michael Redgrave, was a famed British actor.

Natasha Richardson's uncle Corin Redgrave, aunt Lynn Redgrave, and sister Joely Richardson are also noted performers. But being part of a family of actors wasn't always easy for Richardson. Her parents divorced when she was 4 and her mother, involved in controversial political causes, gave away a lot of money, putting the family in financial straits, according to the BBC. Then there was the family heritage, of which Richardson once said, ""Though my name opened doors it didn't get me work, and a lot of pressure comes from having a mother who is considered one of the greatest actresses of her generation,"" the BBC reported. In 2007, Richardson worked with her mother in the film ""Evening."" Richardson said she made one point to director Lajos Koltai about the relatives working together. ""This is a unique opportunity,"" she said she told him. ""This is the one time my mother and I are going to play mother and daughter on screen, so you've got to take advantage of it.""  Watch Richardson talk about working with her mom » . Richardson's first film role was a bit part in her father's ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1968), made when she was 4.

"(CNN)  -- Rescuers have found the body of a man who was one of six people aboard a small airplane that crashed Sunday evening near the northern shore of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Cessna 206 single-engine aircraft went down about a half mile off the coast of Quebradillas. The man's body was found Monday less than 150 feet from shore, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. The Coast Guard launched two more search missions Tuesday morning for four men and one woman still missing. Authorities have not released their identities, nor the name of the man found Monday. ""The Coast Guard will continue to search as long as there is the possibility of finding any survivors,"" Castrodad said. Eighteen divers will conduct searches Tuesday in the area where the body was found, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Volunteer divers from Arecibo found the body Monday, said Jose Daniel Echeverria, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, which also is involved in the search. As of Tuesday, the Coast Guard will have conducted 12 search operations, eight done by four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Air Station Borinquen and four by the Cutter Matinicus, Castrodad said. The search is complicated, he said, by the roughness of the area. ""It's like a cliff,"" he said. ""The surf is very rough. It's hard to get in that area."" Smaller boats from the emergency management agency and the Puerto Rico Police Joint Forces for Rapid Action are being used because they can reach areas that the Coast Guard cutter cannot, Castrodad said. The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said. The four males and one female onboard were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said. The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said. A 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas. Searchers found a debris field in the area late Sunday. In the Dominican Republic, meanwhile, a man who said he spent the weekend with the missing passengers said he urged them not to leave Sunday night because of severe weather. Retired businessman Manuel ""Manolin"" Lecaroz, 64, told El Nuevo Dia newspaper that the group left because one of them had business to conduct Monday morning. He did not have a premonition, Lecaroz said. ""It's just that you can't fly when the weather is bad."" The winds and heavy rains that were still being felt in Puerto Rico on Monday had ruined the group's chances to spend the weekend fishing and playing golf in the Dominican Republic, which is 79 miles (127 kilometers) away. ""It rained every day,"" Lecaroz told the Puerto Rican newspaper. ""The wind was blowing very hard, so much that we couldn't go out in the boat any day."" As they left Sunday night, group members hugged Lecaroz and talked about returning later this month to fish and golf, he said.","Coast Guard launches search missions for five still missing after plane went down .

"HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Reality television featuring law enforcement officers on the beat is nothing new. A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects, however, is a new twist. Maricopa Co. Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show, ""Smile: You're Under Arrest."" Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose showy brand of justice has raised charges of discrimination and civil-rights abuses while making him a hero among fans of his tough-on-crime attitudes -- will star in ""Smile: You're Under Arrest."" The show, which premiers this weekend on Fox Reality Channel, features Arpaio and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants. In one, a suspect is invited to a fake fashion shoot and told he's going to become a supermodel, according to Fox Reality's Web site. In another, a suspect is tricked into what he thinks is a job as a movie extra and, after a staged argument between the film's ""director"" and another actor, gets promoted to the starring role. ""It's kind of fun to show how stupid they are and, as I say, the looks on their face,"" Arpaio, 76, said of the suspects wanted for DUIs, drug charges, missed court dates and other offenses.  Watch Arpaio explain his methods » . But Arpaio's critics aren't amused. They say they fear the show will give the controversial sheriff positive publicity, ignoring what they call a darker side to his 16-year tenure as top lawman in the county that includes Phoenix. ""It's going to celebrate a sheriff that's frankly scaring this community, a sheriff that has seen violent crime increase significantly in his county, a sheriff that is racially profiling the Latino community, and I doubt that the show is going to reflect that,"" said Paco Fabian, spokesman for the immigrant-rights group America's Voice. In a statement on the group's Web site, Fabian calls Arpaio a ""modern day Bull Connor,"" comparing him to the public safety commissioner in 1960s Birmingham, Alabama, whose use of attack dogs and firehoses on civil rights demonstrators made him a symbol of racial intolerance. Dubbed ""America's Toughest Sheriff,"" Arpaio makes many of his county's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents. He reinstituted chain gangs -- including crews for women and juveniles -- banned smoking, coffee and movies in his jails and, most recently, moved to require all inmates with money in their jail accounts to pay for their own meals. And then, of course, there's the pink underwear. ""They were stealing the white underwear, smuggling the underwear out of the jail,"" Arpaio told CNN. ""So you know what? Give them pink. The other reason is they hate pink. Why would you give the 10,000 inmates the color they like?"" Earlier this year, the mayor of Phoenix wrote a letter to the U.S. attorney general's office, asking the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division to investigate Arpaio's aggressive illegal immigration crackdowns. Mayor Phil Brown wrote that Arpaio's sweeps show ""a pattern and practice of conduct that includes discriminatory harassment, improper stops, searches and arrests."" The letter came after Arpaio, who had already been the target of hundreds of lawsuits, launched a series of what he calls crime-suppression patrols in largely Latino neighborhoods. Critics say the patrols use racial profiling to unfairly target Hispanic drivers and pedestrians, while Arpaio says they have resulted in the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants, including some with criminal records. ""We are the only ones cracking down on the state's human smuggling law,"" Arpaio said. Fabian said America's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio's show. Either way, the series offers another moment in the spotlight for a lawman who has never shied away from it. ""I'm not going to brag,"" Arpaio said, ""but there isn't anybody in the world who doesn't know who this sheriff is.""

This form of Islamic law is already in effect in parts of North West Frontier Province where the Taliban have control -- including Swat, which is located about 100 miles northwest of Islamabad. Provincial minister Amir Haider Hoti said the people of the region want sharia which fills the ""vacuum"" left by a lack of access to Pakistan's judicial system. He said he hoped it would bring peace to the region, where Pakistani forces have battled militants aligned with the Taliban. It is difficult to gauge the concerns of residents in Swat, because the government does not allow journalists into the area due to the ongoing military operation. Also, residents risk their lives if they openly criticize Taliban rule. Bibi -- who used a false name to protect her identity -- told CNN that people in Swat do not support the Taliban's version of Islamic law. A strict Muslim herself, Bibi said she observes the teachings of the Quran, and the Taliban's interpretation of sharia has nothing to do with the Muslim religion. ""They are killing people, they are beheading people, there is no accounting for what they are doing,"" Bibi said. Their oppression is also focused on women. The Taliban have destroyed dozens of girls' schools in the region. Bibi is living in a house in Islamabad with other women who have fled Taliban rule in Swat. ""For God's sake, in the West you must realize this: no education for women,"" she said. ""You are going to destroy an entire generation."" She dismissed the government's peace deal as a concession to the Taliban. But she remains hopeful that she can return to the picturesque Swat Valley with her three children. ""I want peace more than anyone else,"" Bibi said. ""It's my home, it's where I want my children to go back to, it's where I want to live. ""I love Swat. It's because of my love and my passion for Swat that I am speaking.""","""Probably your next 9/11 is going to be from Swat,"" says woman who fled the town .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged the leaders of Madagascar to resolve their differences after an anti-government rally a day earlier turned violent and left more than two dozen people dead. Protesters rally Saturday before violence broke out near the Presidential Palace. In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Ban deplored the violence and called Sunday on authorities ""to urgently initiate a fair process by which those responsible will be brought to justice."" Ban also blamed the ""tragedy"" on a ""lack of restraint on all sides."" ""The Secretary-General calls upon all concerned parties to resolve their differences through peaceful and democratic means and through the exercise of responsible leadership,"" according to the statement. A police official said the death toll from Saturday's violence outside the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Antananarivo had risen to 26. More than 80 were injured during the demonstration, officials said. The capital city was quiet as mourners attended a public ceremony for the dead. The violence stemmed from an ongoing dispute over who is in charge of the government. Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of Antananarivo, took to the streets one week ago, declaring himself the Indian Ocean island nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300.  Watch an iReport on the Madagascar violence » . But President Marc Ravalomanana has fired him and put someone else in the mayoral job. Rajoelina had called the rally to unveil his new government at the May 13th Plaza, according to Brittany Martin, an American citizen who is a Harvard Fellow and lives in Antananarivo. Martin said the rally was peaceful in the morning hours of Saturday, until gunshots rang out in the afternoon after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from. Some media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd. Violence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo. Hours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks ago, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.

Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble. Anger has risen in Madagascar, where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year, over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane. Rajoelina has urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government could be established in the nation off Africa's southeastern coast.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq will not grant an operating license to security firm Blackwater Worldwide, an Interior Ministry official said Thursday. Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad, Iraq, from a helicopter in 2003. Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf said the ministry denied the request mainly because of a September 2007 shooting incident in which security guards employed by Blackwater fired on a crowd and killed 17 Iraqis, according to the government. A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, who asked not to be named, confirmed the report. ""We have been informed that Blackwater's ... operating license will not be granted,"" the official said. ""We don't have specifics about dates. We are working with the government of Iraq and our contractors to address the implications of this decision."" Blackwater has one of the biggest security contracts in Iraq. The U.S. State Department, which contracted the company to protect American diplomats and other employees, is also ""looking at the implications"" of the decision, said Robert Wood, the department's acting spokesman. Wood didn't say what specific plans the State Department has to protect its employees, but he told reporters that State will encourage contractors to abide by Iraqi law, as required under the recently approved U.S.-Iraqi security agreement, and will make sure its personnel are protected. ""We're formulating how to go forward,"" he said.  Watch report on Iraq's refusal to grant license to Blackwater » . Wood refused to say whether two other security companies working in Iraq, Triple Canopy and Dyncorp, would take over security operations, but did say those options were being considered. Earlier this month, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16, 2007, shootings in a Baghdad square. A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The company does not face any charges. But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA). The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" A security agreement approved in December 2008 specifies U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in Iraq. Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004, but the provision was not strictly enforced. Last year, the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government. Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate.

"(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba muscled his way through for a late winner to put Chelsea into the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. A bare-chested Drogba is congratulated by Salomon Kalou after scoring the winner at Wembley. The all-London clash rarely hit the heights on a difficult pitch, but Drogba's 84th minute strike gave Guus Hiddink's men a deserved victory and leaves them in contention for three trophies. Dutchman Hiddink, who took temporary charge of the Blues in February and has lost only one match, said Drogba had proved his worth again. ""He is proving already he is so dangerous, very strong and physically fit,"" he told Press Association. ""We respect each other very much but also challenge each other without thinking this is a big name."" Arsenal went ahead in the 18th minute as Theo Walcott's volley deflected past Petr Cech, but Florent Malouda equalized for Chelsea just after the half hour mark. Chelsea looked the stronger against an Arsenal team missing key defenders and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and it came as no surprise when Ivory Coast star Drogba scored a typical winner. He latched on to Frank Lampard's hopeful volleyed through ball, shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net. Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick. Quintuple chasing United play Everton in the second semifinal, also at Wembley, on Sunday. Chelsea, who are a still challenging third in the Premier League and semifinals of the Champions League, showed their character after falling behind to Walcott's strike. The England international winger connected with a chipped cross from Kieran Gibbs and his effort took a cruel deflection off Ashley Cole's arm to beat Cech. Arsenal had made a fine start, but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal, Chelsea came back strongly into the game. Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski, but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post. More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten. Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted, but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left to rue their defensive errors and the performance of his 20-year-old Polish goalkeeper. ""He's a great goalkeeper but it was not his greatest day,"" Wenger said. ""Inexperience, yes. It was a game when any mistake could be costly.""","Didier Droba winner ends Arsenal's long unbeaten run and puts Chelsea in final .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- After a long apprenticeship, it's been an astonishingly fast rise for R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan. Jazmine Sullivan is up for five Grammys next month, including best new artist. Before she was in her teens, Sullivan sang on ""It's Showtime at the Apollo."" At 13, she met Stevie Wonder. Soon she was performing regularly at the jam sessions called Black Lily in her hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She went to that city's performing arts high school and was signed to a contract by Jive Records, where she was paired with producers such as Timbaland and Cool & Dre. It didn't work out -- then. But soon, Sullivan signed with Clive Davis' J Records, and suddenly she was everywhere. Her debut single, ""Need U Bad,"" hit No. 1 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and her album ""Fearless"" hit the Top 10 on Billboard's album chart. Now she's up for five Grammys on February 8, including best R&B performance (for ""Bust Your Windows"") and best new artist. CNN's KJ Matthews talked with Sullivan about her inspirations, who she's bringing to the Grammys and the mysterious person behind ""Bust Your Windows."" The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: How would you describe your sound? Jazmine Sullivan: I can't really describe it; that's the whole thing. Once you hear the CD, you'll hear that one sound doesn't sound like the next. You know, I've been influenced by so many different styles and different genres of music that I felt like that should be represented on my first album, so when you get it, you get a taste of gospel, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, reggae, pop ... everything is on there, there's something for everybody to enjoy. I didn't want to exclude anybody from the album. CNN: Let me ask you this: When you saw or heard the other nominees in the best new artist category who happen to be a little bit more well-known, was it intimidating? I mean, you got the Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Adele ... Sullivan: Yeah, the Jonas Brothers, specifically. I didn't even know they were new artists because they are so huge, so, you know, so after, when my name was called after theirs, I thought, ""Wow, they're new artists, too?"" I got a little scared, I tell you that. But I'm just so honored to be mentioned to be in the same categories with such wonderful artists, so I'm looking forward to February and the Grammys and just being in that atmosphere. CNN: I was looking at your background, and I didn't know that you're a protegee of Missy Elliott. I was thinking to myself, you would think that you would do rap, but you're this big voice, this soulful voice. You might not equate that with Missy. Sullivan: Yeah, and a lot of people don't know that Missy Elliott ... grew up in the church, and she's really into vocalists. When I met her, was I was about 13 or 14, [and] she was ecstatic about me. When nobody else was there to support me, Missy was there, so she's a good friend of mine, and I'm happy to have her by my side. She's definitely taught me a lot of things. CNN: So everybody wants to know, the guy behind ""Bust Your Windows"" -- is there one? Sullivan: We won't talk about that on camera -- that's an off-camera conversation -- but it's definitely a song that relates to a lot of women especially. You know, even if they really haven't busted windows out of anybody's car, they have wanted to. A lot of women have been through that, so I'm glad that my music is touching those people . CNN: ""Need U Bad"" is rising as well. What's the thought process behind that one? Sullivan: ""Need U Bad"" ... a lot of men actually pointed out to me that women don't come out and admit that they made mistakes and say that they actually need the male, so I think that was kind of cool. I haven't thought of it like that when I was writing it. So, you know, it's a song for the fellas, saying that we appreciate them and we need you as much as you need us. But on the flip side, I do a song like ""Bust Your Windows,"" so on the album you have a lot of different perceptions and everything. CNN: How old are you? You look like you're 10. Sullivan: I'm 21 years old. CNN: Success that early, that's sometimes tough for people. Sullivan: Well, I've been in this industry for a very long time. I started out when I was 12; I got signed when I was 16, so it wasn't an overnight success story at all. I put a lot of hard work into it, and this is just a byproduct of all of that. CNN: It's great that you write your own music too, because a lot of people don't do that. You have a lot more creative control. Sullivan: Most definitely, and I've dealt with not having that control when I was younger and I was signed. I wasn't writing at all, and so I've been through all of that. So now to be in a position where I write my music, and I have that control -- it feels so much better. CNN: All right, the big question: Grammy night. What are you wearing? Who are you bringing? What are you going to be doing? Sullivan: I'm bringing my mother. She's been my rock and my support ever since I was a baby. She was my first huge fan, that what she is. I don't know what I'm wearing. I'm trying not to think about that. I want to perform. Hopefully I can get on stage and I can show everybody who I am and what I'm about. But I haven't thought about the dress or the shoes or the hair or anything about that. CNN: You're just trying to enjoy the moment. Sullivan: Enjoy, yes.","R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan is up for five awards next month .

The British Press Association cited an unnamed source saying Osbourne, 24, is being treated at the Hazelden retreat in Oregon. ""Kelly Osbourne has voluntarily entered a medical facility to address some personal issues,"" spokeswoman Caroline Barrett said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. ""Her family stands by and supports her."" Osbourne was jailed in London in January on a charge of assaulting a British newspaper gossip columnist at a London nightclub last summer.

"(CNN) -- Don't believe the hype. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan in ""Watchmen,"" the film version of the popular graphic novel. ""Visionary"" director Zack Snyder, as the marketing would have it, has filmed Alan Moore's ""unfilmable"" graphic novel by treating the comic book panels as his storyboard and his Bible. Doesn't it bother anyone that this is about as far from the definition of ""visionary"" as it's possible to get? The visionary sees what others do not see. Snyder -- whose previous films were a remake (""Dawn of the Dead"") and another scrupulously faithful comic book adaptation (""300"") -- is more in the line of a fancy photocopier, duplicating other artists' imagery with a forger's intensity. A visionary transforms the world. Snyder slavishly transcribes what's set down 5 inches in front of his face. Alan Moore, who has refused to have his name on the movie (ditto its Moore-based predecessors, ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") and who has declined all reimbursement to protest the entertainment industry's fundamental lack of respect for intellectual property, counts as a bona fide visionary. His 1986 comic book is a landmark in the history of the form, a masterpiece of pop cultural angst, filtering Cold War nihilism and disillusionment through the inspired pulp idiom of mundane masked crimefighters and one genuine, possibly radioactive, superhero. In Moore's alternative 1985, Nixon is still president, the U.S. having won in Vietnam. The Soviets are effectively neutered by America's not-so-secret weapon, Dr. Manhattan, a kind of quantum ghost in the machine capable of reconstituting matter (and nuclear warheads) at will.  Watch the stars at the premiere » . Moore's meta-comic switched back and forth in time with the same facility as Dr. Manhattan morphed between New Jersey and Mars, cutting between a doomsday conspiracy threatening to engulf the Earth and flashbacks relating the biographies of half-a-dozen ""watchmen,"" a generation of intrepid masked avengers forced to hang up their capes and Spandex when public opinion turned on them in the late 1970s. (It's easy to discern the book's influence on subsequent films ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mystery Men."") With its parallel stories and virtuoso zooming and panning visual tropes, Moore and illustrator Dave Gibbons' ""Watchmen"" always felt cinematic. You could sense Martin Scorsese and ""Taxi Driver's"" Travis Bickle in Moore's squalid New York and vigilante anti-hero Rorschach, but proposed movies by Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass failed to materialize, foundering on the comic book's sophisticated narrative chicanery. The solution proposed by Snyder and screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse is simply to ignore the problem and stick to the text. In fairness, this strategy has proved wildly popular in adaptations of the ""Harry Potter"" books, for instance, ""Twilight"" and ""300."" The fans seem to demand it -- just as there is now a common assumption that a longer, unexpurgated DVD edition is inherently superior to the shorter, tighter theatrical version. ""Watchmen"" the movie provides ample evidence that more is more, but less might have been closer to Moore in spirit (that is, anarchic, witty and compelling). Clocking in at an exhausting 163 minutes even without some of the book's various subplots, the film forfeits momentum and suspense for a jerky succession of expository dialogue scenes, interspersed with occasional flashes of grotesque ultra-violence. It's all invariably filmed in Snyder's spasmodic, stop-go trademark style and accompanied by a jukebox score that ranges from Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen to Nena's ""99 Luftballoons."" On the few occasions where the filmmakers do exercise their imaginations -- in a credit montage relating the glory days of the crimefighters Weegee-style, and in a neat improvement on Moore's climax -- the results are actually ingenious and sharp. iReport.com: Fan underwhelmed by ""Watchmen"" But too many key scenes ring hollow, undermined by flat staging and tone-deaf treatment. One of them is the ridiculous moment when Dr. Manhattan's faith in humanity is restored by the revelation of ... Well, see it for yourself, and then compare with the infinitely more nuanced passage in the graphic novel. The considerable limitations of Swedish-Canadian actress Malin Akerman are cruelly exposed as Laurie, aka Silk Spectre II, and if Matthew Goode (playing Adrian Veidt) is the smartest man in the world, then we're really in trouble. Jackie Earle Haley and his ""Little Children"" co-star Patrick Wilson fare better as, respectively, the angry reactionary Rorschach and mildly conflicted Dan Dreiberg, while it's hard to take your eyes off Billy Crudup's naked blue avatar, Dr. Manhattan -- for various reasons. I guess an honest reproduction of a great comic book is better than the trivialization that often passes for adaptation, and in this case the material is so ingrained with audacious ideas the movie can't be counted a complete cop-out. But if it was really going to honor the original, ""Watchmen"" had to put the fear of God in us, to rekindle that prospect of imminent nuclear annihilation that haunted the Cold War world. And it had to remind us these rather sorry comic book characters were, as Moore insisted, more human than super. iReport.com: ""Watchmen"" very good, but not for kids . Snyder flunks that test. Yes it will hit the box office like a tidal wave, but ultimately the numb, enervating ""Watchmen"" is living on borrowed time. No smiley face here. ""Watchmen"" runs 162 minutes and is rated R. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.","""Watchmen"" is so devoted to the comic book it misses vision, says Tom Charity .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan cricketers have been told they will not be allowed to appear in the highly-lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) this coming season because of fears over security. Danish Kaneria, in action against India last December, was hoping to play in the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies and, for the first time, England will be competing in the action that starts on April 10. Several Pakistan stars had also signed for IPL franchises while another five, including leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, were scheduled to appear at a players' auction to be held in Goa, India, on Thursday. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said players would not be allowed to play in the IPL this coming season on government advice. ""We have informed the IPL and Indian board that our players can't take part in the IPL this year,"" PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters.com. The decision follows concerns for players' safety because of the tense relations between Pakistan and India after the Mumbai militant attacks in November. Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, who plays for Delhi, said the players would abide by the directives of the government and PCB. Meanwhile, another former captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq is among several top Pakistan players who have successfully challenged a domestic ban imposed following appearances in the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). Provincial Sindh High Court on Monday suspended the 2007 action taken by the PCB which must appear in court later this month to explain their action. Players affected by the 2007 ruling also include Mohammad Yousuf, Imran Nazir, Mohammad Sami and Azhar Mahmood who along with Inzamam, played for Lahore Badshahs. Last year, the Badshahs named after a Pakistani city and with a number of Pakistani players won the ICL 20s Indian championship. ""The honorable court has suspended this relevant clause of the PCB rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect,"" Zahid Fakhruddin Ibrahim, the legal counsel for the players, told Reuters.com. Lahore coach Moin Khan, a former Pakistan captain, said the suspension of the ban was good for Pakistani cricket. ""Some of the ICL players can still play for Pakistan and when they play in domestic cricket, youngsters will learn from them,"" Khan commented. ""The ban had hurt the players financially as well as cricket-wise, so it's a great decision.""","Pakistan cricketers miss IPL season over security fears .

"(CNN) -- A seventh minute goal from Brazilian teenager Alexander Pato proved enough to give AC Milan a 1-0 home victory over Fiorentina in a match totally dominated by Manchester City's $150 million bid for playmaker Kaka this week. Pato (right) and David Beckham celebrate Milan's only goal at the San Siro on Saturday evening. The goal was created by David Beckham who beat two defenders to a loose ball. He poked it back to Marek Jankulovski who played in Pato inside the penalty area. There still appeared no danger to the Fiorentina goal, but Pato hit a stunning strike from the left that went in off the far post. Fiorentina should have equalized on 66 minutes when Juan Vargas got to the byline and crossed to Mario Santana but the Argentine put his shot too close to goalkeeper Christian Abbiati who managed to save. The result leaves Milan in third place on 37 points, six points behind leaders and city rivals Inter, who have a game in hand. Jose Mourinho's side travel to Atalanta on Sunday. Jankulovski collected a late red card for timewasting, but Milan held on to secure the three points. Meanwhile, Milan supporters made their opposition to the Kaka bid, and his possible departure, perfectly clear throughout the match -- unveiling a host of banners and singing songs pleading with the Brazilian to stay at the San Siro. Reggina remain deep in relegation trouble after suffering a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Siena. Mario Frick's goal 15 minutes from time was enough to give the Bianconeri three points which sees them leapfrog Sampdoria and move up to the relative comfort of 14th spot. Siena in contrast, stay second from bottom and could slip to the foot of the Serie A standings if Chievo beat Napoli on Sunday.","Alexander Pato scores seventh minute goal as AC Milan defeat Fiorentina 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- A military junta that toppled Guinea's government announced its new leader Wednesday in a nationwide radio address. Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara wrapped in the Guinean flag Wednesday. Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara declared himself president of the National Council for Democracy, which he called a transitional body that will oversee the country's return to democracy. In effect, that would make Camara president of Guinea, which was thrown into turmoil Monday after the death of President Lansana Conte. Camara also declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time. Guinea's parliament is holding negotiations with the military, Africa News reporter Mamdou Dian Donghol Diallo told CNN. ""For the time being the situation is calm and negotiations are under way,"" Diallo said. ""There is no traffic. Everyone is staying inside their homes."" Camara, previously the spokesman for the National Council for Democracy, suspended the government, constitution, political parties and trade unions, Diallo said from Conakry. The newly formed government, made up of 26 military personnel and six civilians, is negotiating a power-sharing deal that would reflect its ethnic make-up, Diallo said. But some in the military may not support the new leadership, he said. International institutions, including the African Union, have condemned the coup. Guinea, in western Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean, has had two presidents since gaining independence from France in 1958. Conte came to power in 1984, when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president, Sekou Toure. The country did not hold democratic elections until 1993, when Conte was elected president. He was re-elected in 1998 and 2003 amid allegations of electoral irregularities. Worsening economic conditions and dissatisfaction with corruption and bad governance prompted two massive strikes in 2006, the CIA World Factbook says. A third nationwide strike in early 2007 sparked violent protests that resulted in two weeks of martial law. To appease the unions and end the unrest, the Factbook says, Conte named a new prime minister in March 2007. Guinea is one of the poorest countries in the world, despite its mineral wealth, according to the British charity Plan UK. The country hosts large refugee populations from neighboring Liberia and Ivory Coast.","NEW: Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara named de facto president of Guinea .

"AMSTETTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- The Austrian who reportedly admitted holding his daughter captive for 24 years and fathering seven children with her will plead insanity, his lawyer said. Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children. Attorney Rudolf Mayer said he believed 73-year-old Josef Fritzl had a mental disorder, The Associated Press reported. Mayer said someone who was mentally ill ""didn't choose"" to do what police allege he did. Mayer said Fritzl would be confined to a psychiatric institution rather than a prison if he was certified as insane and convicted, AP reported. Police said last week that Fritzl had confessed to imprisoning his daughter in a secret cellar dungeon in his home, fathering seven children with her and burning the body of one who died in infancy in a furnace.

Christine R. also said Fritzl committed an unrelated rape in 1967, served 18 months in prison for that crime and that her sister continued to stay married to him in a desperate attempt to keep their family together. Recent media reports also claimed Fritzl had been convicted of rape. Austrian police have said they are looking into the claims. The horrifying story has shocked many locally and across the world. On Sunday, members of the Amstetten religious community held a Mass to remember Fritzl's family. After the Mass, members of the church signed a banner outside a church in support of the victims.  Watch church members sign the banner » . The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel two weeks ago, when Fritzl's daughter, Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions and was hospitalized. The 19-year-old girl, who had been locked in the basement her entire life along with her mother and two brothers, was in an artificially induced coma in an Amstetten clinic. She was suffering from a kidney ailment that worsened because she did not receive medial treatment sooner, authorities said.  Watch how Fritzl led double life » . Fritzl told his wife that their daughter Elisabeth, who is now 42, ran away from home at age 18. The couple adopted three of the children who Josef said were left on their doorstep as infants by his runaway daughter. In the interview Christine R. said her sister, Rosemarie, truly thought that her daughter had ran away to join a cult. ""She never believed him being capable of it,"" said Christine R. ""We were all taken in by him and believed that she (referring to Elizabeth), was in a cult and that she wouldn't come out."" It may have been Fritzl's strict rule over the household that made it possible for him to keep his gruesome secret hidden for so long, Christine R. said. The unspeakable ordeal has taken a toll on the whole family, Christine R. said, stating that she spoke to her sister on the phone recently. ""Five or six days after Kerstin went to the hospital I called my sister and asked her how the girl was doing,"" Christine R. said. ""She said that she herself was doing badly, and the girl herself was doing badly and she wished with all of her heart that the girl would pull through."" Fritzl is being held in police custody. He has yet to be charged, but he can be held by police for 14 days without formal charges while the investigation is under way. That amount of time can be extended by a judge. E-mail to a friend .

"(OPRAH.COM) -- As a fiction writer, I struggle to tell useful truths by telling the lie that I am someone other than myself. I'm a fat girl trying to survive rape in my first novel, the resentful brother of a mentally ill twin in my second. In my third novel, which I'm close to finishing, I'm the husband of a drug-addicted nurse lost in a maze of her failures and fear. Author Wally Lamb says writing personal stories can free you  from painful memories and imprisoning secrets. Writing fiction invites me to move beyond the limitations of my own experience and better understand the un-me, the other. I am similarly invited to do so each time I go to jail. For the past eight years, I have run a writing workshop for inmates at the Janet S. York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's high-security prison for women. Someone asked me recently if I ever felt afraid of my students. Our class, after all, includes individuals who have committed armed robbery, gang-related assault, and homicide. But no, I don't fear these women, because through their autobiographical writing, I come to know them not merely as their convictions but as complex human equations that go far beyond ""good versus bad"" or ""us versus them."" Listen to the voice of one of my students. ""I am Barbara Parsons, who has been a healthcare worker, a business manager, a homemaker, a gardener, and a killer -- and who is consequently a state prison inmate."" Molested by her grandfather when she was 4, Parsons shot and killed her abusive husband when he revealed that he had molested her granddaughter. Convicted of ""manslaughter due to emotional duress,"" she challenges readers to think beyond stereotype. ""I am sure you have a dark side, too,"" she writes. ""Look at me. Who would ever have thought that I, an average neighbor from rural Connecticut, could be capable of murder?"" Oprah.com: How to make peace with your past . Most of my students begin as you might begin: by writing safe pieces -- narratives about fun family vacations, loving tributes to favorite relatives. But sooner or later their painful memories call to them and demand to be examined. With pen in hand, an inmate may, for example, begin to explore the connection between the incest she endured as a young girl and her subsequent drug addiction. She may discover a link between her embezzlement conviction and her lifelong inability to please an emotionally distant mother. Along with that growing clarity, she will confront anger, shame, grief, and the need to stop making excuses and take responsibility. Doing so will lessen her heartache and promote her recovery if she stays with it, but she may surrender to the pain before she gets to experience the gain. She may become too busy, too tired, too headachy, too blue to come to class. Before long, her seat will go to the next woman on the waiting list. Addicts are particularly vulnerable to cold feet when truth telling begins to overpower manipulation and self-deception. Yet if the writer reflects honestly and un-self-pityingly on the damage she has both endured and caused -- and if she takes the critical next step of sharing her words with the group and receiving feedback -- she will begin to defy the gravity of her painful past. But a person need not go to prison to access the therapeutic value of autobiographical writing. Which of us has not put walls and razor wire around our concealed sadnesses and past regrets? Who among us was raised by a perfect family? Who does not have hilarious, life-affirming stories to share and debilitating secrets to dispel? Which of us is so self-aware that we could not reveal ourselves more deeply by reflecting on our lives with fingertips on the keyboard -- and then sharing our discoveries with other writers and bearing witness to theirs? In doing so, we discover that ""the other"" and we are more alike than different, variations on a theme of humanity and circumstance. Michelangelo, the 16th-century artistic genius, once said this about his work: ""I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."" My inmate students, you, and I are damaged angels-in-waiting who have the potential to sculpt our best selves with the aid of paper and pen. Oprah.com: 6 ways to get your creativity flowing . The rehabilitative power of our words invites us to test our still-wet wings, tentatively at first and then with greater and greater assurance.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Juliana Redding was 21, an aspiring actress and model who, like so many others before her, had moved from Arizona to southern California in pursuit of the Hollywood dream. She wound up the victim in a real life murder mystery -- one few people are willing to talk about in any detail. Juliana Redding, an aspiring model and actress, was found murdered in her Santa Monica apartment. By the age of 18, Redding had earned her first film credit, appearing in a 2005 independent film called ""Kathy T Gives Good Hoover,"" about college students and the graffiti culture. In 2006, she moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California, with her pet Yorkshire terrier. She was also taking college courses while working part-time in a trendy Venice Beach bar. Friends grew worried in March when they couldn't reach Redding for a few days. They called her mother in Redding's hometown of Tucson, Arizona. Her mother called the Santa Monica police.  Watch why this case is so baffling » . Police found Redding dead inside her apartment. ""The manner of death is homicide,"" said Sgt. Rinaldi Thruston of the Santa Monica Police Department. Although there are unconfirmed reports that the cause of death was blunt force trauma, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office denies that. ""Those media reports are not accurate. The cause of death was not blunt force trauma. The file has been sealed by police, so we cannot disclose the actual cause of death."" Police also would not disclose whether a weapon was used or whether Redding's apartment had been broken into, which would give clues as to whether she knew her assailant and opened the door for him or her. Thruston also refused to say whether Redding had been sexually assaulted. ""We have made no arrests in this case nor do we have any suspects or persons of interest at this time,"" Thruston said. He said police have collected evidence from the crime scene that could link a potential suspect to the crime. Police are hoping they will continue to get tips and leads from the public. According to friends, Redding had been dating another actor for two years and they had broken up about six months before her slaying, but remained friends. It is unclear whether she had a new boyfriend, but police have been interviewing all of Redding's known friends and neighbors. ""We believe the police are doing what they can to solve this case, but we really prefer no media attention,"" her mother said. Early in the investigation, there were reports of blood found on the sidewalk or wall outside Redding's apartment. Police will not comment on the forensic results of that blood or any specific evidence at the crime scene. They also will not reveal whether any of Redding's neighbors heard screams or other sounds of a struggle. At this point, there are more questions than answers. If anyone has any information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for Juliana Redding's death, please call the Santa Monica Police Department tip line at (310) 458-8449.","Aspiring actress found dead in Santa Monica apartment in March .

"(CNN) -- Bruce Windsor is known as many things: church deacon, soccer coach, father of four. But facing potential financial problems, he's now known as something else: suspected bank robber. Bruce Windsor listens Friday as a judge tells him he faces kidnapping and robbery charges. Police say the 43-year-old owner of a real estate company walked into the Carolina First Bank in Greenville, South Carolina, late Thursday with a mask and a handgun. In court documents filed Friday, police said he forced two bank employees into an office at gunpoint and demanded money. Police arrived minutes later with the suspect still inside, touching off a tense 90-minute standoff before he released the hostages and surrendered. His actions were ""out of character"" for a man who has never been in trouble with the law before, friends and relatives said. His tearful sister, defending him as he stood before a judge, said, ""He must have just snapped under the pressure."" In his initial appearance for a bond hearing, Windsor was in an orange jail jumpsuit, shackled and with his hands cuffed. In a quiet voice, he answered ""yes, sir"" as the judge explained the charges to him: two counts of kidnapping, one count of robbery and two counts of pointing firearms at a person, charges that could carry more than 30 years in prison if convicted. A police detective told the judge Windsor said he had been experiencing financial problems. But police spokesman Cpl. Jason Rampey told CNN they could not yet say for certain whether money problems were the motive for the alleged robbery. His attorney said in court Windsor had been married for 16 years and was the father of four children. Reports say the oldest is 11. Attorney Sidney Mitchell told the judge he was ""a model citizen up until yesterday,' and we've obviously got a lot of talking to do with him,"" Rampey said. The judge allowed his family to stand with him during the court appearance. His sister clutched his arm, crying through most of the brief hearing. His wife stood behind him, appearing to rub his back. His pastor at Brushy Creek Baptist Church, where Windsor is a deacon, stood at his side. His sister told the judge Windsor coaches one of his children's soccer teams and picks them up every day from school. ""He would never, ever hurt his family,"" she said in a halting voice. Sobbing, she said, ""I can't imagine the desperation that must have caused this."" The incident, she said, ""doesn't even register."" Windsor then spoke up, saying, ""I've never stolen anything in my life."" But the judge reminded the court ""this is a very serious incident,"" setting the bail at just over $1.5 million. On Thursday, SWAT officers surrounded the Carolina First bank as the suspect allegedly made the hostages move with him at gunpoint inside until he surrendered. Bank owner Art Seaver, who nervously watched the standoff unfold at the scene, met with his employees before they reopened Friday morning for a ""time of reflection and a time of healing."" Asked if everything was back to normal, he told CNN affiliate WSPA, ""No. What is normal?"" Two different images of Windsor unfolded the day after the incident. The man his pastor called ""one of the best fathers I know, anywhere"" and the man court documents said ""forced the victims to move with him at gunpoint during the attempted robbery. The victims were held by the accuser against their will for over an hour."" Rampey said Greenville's crisis negotiating team just happened to be training on Thursday for hostage scenario when the call came in for the real thing. As SWAT officers took up positions outside, negotiators talked to the suspect, who then allowed the hostages to go. SWAT officers said in court documents they ""challenged the subject at gunpoint"" before he lay down on the ground and surrendered. No shots were fired and no one was injured.","Police say man robbed a Carolina First Bank in Greenville, South Carolina, Thursday .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- An oil painting was returned Tuesday to the estate of a Jewish art dealer who was forced to consign the painting and other artwork under Nazi Germany before fleeing the country. ""Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe"" was done in 1632 by an unknown artist. The painting, ""Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe,"" was done in 1632 by an unknown painter from the Northern Netherlandish school, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in southern New York. It was owned by Max Stern, an art dealer who had a gallery in Dusseldorf, Germany, until 1937, when the Nazis' Reich Chamber for Fine Arts ordered him to liquidate the gallery and its inventory, the statement said. Stern, who died in 1987, left no heirs. He and his wife had founded the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, which directly benefits Concordia University and McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, according to a statement from U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The painting was returned Tuesday -- Holocaust Remembrance Day -- to Clarence Epstein of Concordia University on behalf of the executors of the estate, said Lou Martinez of the immigration agency. It was returned in a ceremony at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York, he said. The painting had been owned by Philip Mould Ltd., a London, England, gallery, when Lawrence Steigrad, a New York art dealer, bought it in 2008, the New York attorney's office said. Neither had any idea of the painting's past. Philip Mould Ltd. had purchased the painting the year before from Lempertz Auction House. The same auction house sold the painting in 1937 after Stern was forced to liquidate, without receiving any proceeds from the sale, the New York attorney's office said. Immigration agents used information from a Holocaust claims office in the New York state Banking Department to look into Steigrad's gallery. The art dealer ""confirmed the painting was in his possession."" and he eventually allowed agents to seize the painting, the attorney's office said.","Art dealer Max Stern was forced to liquidate his gallery in 1937 .

"(CNN) -- A controversial comment by the top U.N. envoy to Somalia ""motivates"" those who have carried out recent fatal attacks against journalists in the war-torn country, the head of the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) said Wednesday. Friends and relatives prepare to bury Said Tahlil, a journalist killed on February 4. Earlier this month, the U.N. special representative for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, compared the role of Somalia's media with the infamous Rwandan radio station that was used to incite participation in the 1994 genocide in that country. A day after his remarks, suspected Islamist gunmen shot and killed Said Tahlil Ahmed, the director of independent HornAfrik Radio in Mogadishu, in broad daylight in the Somali capital. Ould-Abdallah's statement ""motivates the criminals and warlords who have been committing unpunished crimes against journalists to keep on their merciless war against media,"" according to Omar Faruk Osman, head of the NUSOJ. It also ""raises serious questions regarding the willingness of (Ould-Abdallah) to help protect Somalia's endangered media professionals,"" Faruk Osman said. He called on the U.N. official to ""immediately withdraw allegations against Somali media and make (a) public apology."" ""If the U.N. ambassador does not meet our demand, it only confirms a hidden and dangerous agenda by the U.N. official,"" he said. Last week, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on Ould-Abdallah to ""immediately retract"" his statement. In a February 3 Voice of America interview, Ould-Abdallah reacted angrily to allegations that African Union troops the day before had indiscriminately fired on Somali civilians after their convoy was struck by a roadside bomb. HRW has also called for an independent investigation into that incident, which killed at least 13 -- most of them civilians. ""What happened is to divert attention from what is going on here and, as usual, to use the media to repeat Radio Mille Collines, to repeat the genocide in Rwanda,"" Ould-Abdallah said in the VOA broadcast. Faruk Osman said that while not all Somali journalists are perfect, ""they are working in an extraordinarily difficult environment by the fault of politicians, and toothless diplomats."" ""The comparison with Radio Mille Collines is insulting, ignorant and dangerous, as that radio had become a legitimate military target in Rwanda,"" the NUSOJ secretary-general added. On Saturday, another Somali journalist, Hassan Bulhan Ali, was stabbed five times in the stomach and heart during a tribal reconciliation meeting in the central town of Abudwaq, according to NUSOJ. Bulhan, 38 and director of Radio Abudwaq -- was critically wounded. ""Somali journalists have paid an enormous price to continue reporting on the crisis in Somalia,"" said Georgette Gagnon, HRW's Africa director. ""The U.N. should be making every effort to support independent Somali media and civil society at this critical time, not comparing journalists to war criminals."" Somali radio stations in Mogadishu recently agreed to take steps to avoid broadcasting any messages of incitement, according to Shabelle Media. The stations agreed not to air live sermons by Muslim clerics or live news conferences or interviews by insurgent groups in an effort to avoid promoting their political agendas, according to the Shabelle report. The statements will instead be recorded and ""checked and edited,"" before they are broadcast, it said. CNN regularly works with Somali journalists who are employed by Shabelle Media. The Committee to Protect Journalists lists Somalia as the seventh most deadly nation in the world for journalists, with 11 Somali journalists killed since 2007, including Said Tahlil Ahmed and another this year. Members of the news media work under duress there amid a war between a weak transitional government and insurgents, the committee said.","Somali journalists say U.N. envoy's quote motivates attacks on them .

"(CNN) -- Surviving economically in downtrodden Elkhart, Indiana, may require doing some things you don't want to do. Elkhart, Indiana, has become the poster child for the nation's economic downturn. ""Here in Elkhart, I've never seen things as bad as they are,"" lifelong resident Yvonne Sell said Tuesday. ""When you open the newspaper, unless you want to be a topless dancer, there's nothing."" Elkhart became the poster child for the nation's economic downturn when President Obama visited there Monday and then mentioned it several times during his first White House press conference. Unemployment in the Elkhart-Goshen, Indiana, area was 15.3 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, the fourth highest of any U.S. metropolitan area. Elkhart's unemployment rate has spiked more than 10 percentage points in the past 13 months. But is it really that bad in Elkhart? According to Sell and several other business owners and workers, it is. Sell and her four co-owners are in the process of selling Blessing Music Co., which has sold, rented and repaired musical instruments for school bands since 1916. ""We're not making money. It's just too tight,"" Sell said. The company has high overhead and a ""considerable"" high-interest loan, and credit continues to be a problem, she said. Sell said she isn't hopeful that any government plan will kick-start commerce in Elkhart or elsewhere. The banks, which started the mess, have already been bailed out, she said, but ""I'm not seeing them loosening their purse strings."" Small businesses as well as individuals need credit -- not government spending -- to keep the economy churning, she said. Take, for example, recreational vehicles, one of the town's knotted lifelines: Sell said she knows plenty of people willing to purchase RVs, but they can't without a bank loan. ""People won't buy them because they're too scared,"" she said. ""I don't personally see how spending the amount of money [Congress is] talking about spending is going to stimulate the economy."" Robert Dunlop runs a different kind of business, but he agrees with Sell. ""Unfortunately, when you drop a ton of money to pay billion-dollar bonuses on the East Coast, it kind of sucks on the Midwest,"" said Dunlop, president of J.A. Wagner Construction Co. in Elkhart. ""If banks can free up a little bit of credit so that people can buy products and get people back to work, that would be good for this area."" People in Elkhart who were interviewed said they don't have much confidence in the government's ability to resolve the crisis, though Dunlop said he thinks tax relief would help some. ""Unfortunately, you still have to have a job to have relief from the tax burden, and a lot of these people are behind in house payments and, quite frankly, it's a vicious cycle: You don't have a job, you can't make your house payment, you're not out buying anything. Even if you reduce the tax burden to those people, they still need to have some sort of income. When that occurs, they start buying things, which creates more jobs, which then starts the cycle back up again."" Elkhart Mayor Dick Moore echoes that view. He said people need jobs so they have money to spend and support industries such as RVs. The Democrat supports the stimulus plan Obama was touting in his town Monday because it will get residents to work quickly. ""It's jobs, jobs, jobs,"" Moore told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday.  Watch what Elkhart's mayor says about the president's visit » . ""We have 16 shovel-ready projects ready to go ... These are not pie-in-the-sky items; they're not pork. ... These are projects we will have to do,"" Moore said. But gift shop owner Joanie Smith said she thinks government programs are no solution. ""I think that the government and the banks are the biggest problem, because we have checks and balances to make sure what happened didn't happen, and obviously it didn't work,"" she said. ""They've already bailed out the banks; I don't know why the banks aren't lending money or offering the assistance that most businesses run with."" Smith saw traffic at her gift shop start dropping off at the end of 2007. ""I have a store that is full of wonderful things, but nothing anybody needs,"" Smith, owner of The Picture Show for 27 years, said with a tense laugh. ""We're just in a real reality-check area right now. It's hard not being negative."" Smith has survived in retail by being financially conservative -- she doesn't have any loans to repay and has cut hours for her two employees, she said. Several years ago she downsized her shop from more than 4,000 square feet to a cozy 1,200. Smith said she feels protective of Elkhart and its image. ""It's a real entrepreneurial city,"" she said. ""We still manufacture here. We still create here. And unfortunately we've lost so much of our diversity of businesses here to China."" Despite these lean times, Smith said she is determined to stay in business. ""Women love to come in here and shop, and we want to be there for them.""","Elkhart, Indiana, entrepreneurs sweating out tough economic times .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One can only imagine the sights this hat has seen. Perched atop a man who towered over his peers at 6 foot 4 inches, this hat must have had quite a view. ""Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life"" will be on display through January 2011. It may have been there when a divided nation -- a devastating Civil War on the horizon -- elected a politician from Illinois as president. It could have watched as this president, so desperate to preserve the Union, carefully drafted the Emancipation Proclamation, thus changing the course of American history. And we know for sure that this hat was witness to a tragic April night when the same president was fatally shot while enjoying a play. The iconic top hat, part of a collection of items associated with Abraham Lincoln, is now on display at the National Museum of American History. Nearly three years in the making, ""Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life"" is part of the Smithsonian Institution's bicentennial celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth and a rare glimpse into the life of one of our nation's greatest presidents. Nearly two centuries later, still adorned with a black band of mourning for a son who died too early, Lincoln's hat is worn-down, yet strangely magnificent. Maybe it is the hat's history that gives it such a majestic quality. Or perhaps it is simply that a top hat always commands a certain reverence -- an attribute that may reveal a great deal about the vanity of its owner. ""Why would somebody who is 6 foot 4 inches decide to wear a tall hat?"" asks Harry Rubenstein, curator of the exhibit. ""He clearly has this desire to stand out in the crowd, to make his place in it."" Rubenstein hopes this is the type of intimate detail about our 16th president's life that people will take away from the ongoing Lincoln exhibit. ""This is the first time we've brought together all of the museum's best Lincoln objects to tell the story of Lincoln's life,"" Rubenstein says. ""And I think it's a different kind of story that emerges -- one that's more intimate and more personal and one that brings this story to life in very tangible ways.""  Watch descriptions of items in the Lincoln exhibit » . The Smithsonian Institution started its Lincoln collection more than 140 years ago, Rubenstein says. The exhibit, which opened in January, houses more than 60 items from Abraham Lincoln's life, spanning his humble beginnings, his political career, his life in the White House, and even relics recovered in the wake of his assassination. Rubenstein says the collection includes ""little personal objects of things he touched and used at pivotal moments in his life,"" like his office suit, his gold pocket watch -- and a coffee cup he left on a windowsill the night of his assassination. The exhibit is also home to more significant objects, such as the inkstand Lincoln used to draft the Emancipation Proclamation, and a patent model of a device he invented for lifting boats over sand bars.  See photos from the exhibit » . Also on display is memorabilia from the 1860 presidential election campaign -- such as a replica poster portraying a young and masculine Lincoln splitting rail -- that reveal a candidate not impervious to the somewhat superficial aspects of the American political system. Rubenstein says that although Lincoln scoffed at his party's attempts to brand him as ""Old Abe the Rail Splitter,"" he understood the importance of appealing to the masses and creating an image to ""link him and his ideals in an iconic kind of way."" Perhaps no one is more aware of the power of Lincoln's iconic image than President Barack Obama, who frequently cited his Illinois predecessor as a source of inspiration for his own presidency. While Rubenstein warns against drawing too much of a comparison between presidents -- the two Illinoisans have been linked by their reformist platforms, their penchant for eloquent speeches, and even for their physical likenesses -- he acknowledges the significance of the symbolic timing: As the first African-American becomes president, the nation celebrates the 200th birthday of the man who ended slavery. ""We have a president from Illinois -- the land of Lincoln -- who has found inspiration in the Lincoln story. ... It's clearly an historic moment,"" Rubenstein says. Nonetheless, as the nation celebrates Obama's momentous election, ""An Extraordinary Life"" is a reminder of the relevance of Lincoln's legacy today and commemorates the incredible life that he led. ""It is amazing ...here is this individual from a family in the middle of the woods in Kentucky ... [struggling] to educate himself,"" Rubenstein says. ""To then take on this incredible responsibility, [and] beyond that, his ability to articulate those ideas to inspire not only his generation, but for us today ... it's an extraordinary odyssey that he took."" Visit ""Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life"" at the National Museum of American History on the National Mall, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C.

"(CNN) -- The future of Iceland's elected government was in question Sunday after another weekend of street protests and the resignation of the government's commerce minister -- both responses to the country's financial mess. Iceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde, left, talks with business minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson in October. The minister, Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, resigned Sunday, saying the government had failed to restore confidence in the three months after the collapse of several of the country's leading banks, currency and stock market. Senior government officials from the two parties that make up Iceland's coalition government -- the prime minister's Independence Party and the Social Democrats party -- met Sunday to discuss the government's future but nothing was resolved, a spokesman for the prime minister said. Another meeting was scheduled for Sunday night and it was ""highly likely"" that the parties would decide whether the current government would remain, the spokesman, Kristjan Kristjansson, said. Sigurdsson's resignation followed Saturday's demonstration in which about 6,000 to 7,000 people in front of the parliament building called for the government of Prime Minister Geir Haarde to step down. Protests have been staged regularly since the collapse, but Saturday's was one of the biggest to date, a spokesman for the prime minister said. Saturday's demonstration was peaceful, the spokesman, Kristjansson, said. Watch iReport of Saturday demonstration . Riot police intervened during protests earlier in the week, using pepper spray and arresting some demonstrators. In his resignation letter to the prime minister, Sigurdsson said he was taking his part of the responsibility for the economic situation in the country. But he also said that there were many more who shared responsibility, Urdur Gunnarsdottir, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN. No other officials were named. The night before he resigned, Sigurdsson dismissed the head of the country's financial supervisory authority and requested the authority's board resign. Haarde announced Friday he has a malignant tumor on his esophagus and would not run for re-election as chair of the Independence Party. He also proposed that early elections be held on May 9, two years ahead of schedule. The country's five-party parliament has not yet taken up the proposal, Kristjansson told CNN. Iceland's financial system and currency collapsed in October following a series of bank failures, forcing the International Monetary Fund to intervene. Iceland sought IMF help after its government was forced to nationalize three banks to head off a complete collapse of its financial system. Trading on the country's stock market was suspended for nearly a week, and inflation jumped to more than 12 percent. The IMF announced in November it would pump about $827 million into the Icelandic economy immediately, with another $1.3 billion coming in eight installments. Iceland's Nordic neighbors -- the governments of Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden -- announced they would lend Iceland another $2.5 billion. In his resignation letter, Sigurdsson said after the country's financial crash, he hoped the government would re-create trust and restore the country's finances. But he said the effort failed, and he was resigning to help facilitate a restoration of public trust. Sigurdsson is legally entitled to keep receiving his salary for several months after his resignation, but said in his letter he would not accept it.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Boston-based wedding planner Bernadette Smith has helped arrange the same-sex nuptials of nearly 75 Massachusetts couples during her five-year career. But she's never seen quite the surge in business as she has during the past few months. Wedding planners have seen a surge in same-sex couples traveling to New England to tie the knot. Smith's calendar first started filling up when the 1913 law that banned gay marriage for out-of-state couples was lifted in July 2008. But, she says, things became even more hectic when Proposition 8, the California ballot proposal restricting marriage to heterosexual couples, passed in the November elections. Now Smith and other wedding planners have seen a surge in gays and lesbians traveling to New England to tie the knot. And the trend is growing quickly: On April 3, Iowa's Supreme Court found its gay-marriage ban unconstitutional; four days later, the Vermont legislature gave same-sex couples the right to marry; and on April 16, New York Governor David Paterson announced he would introduce a bill to legalize gay marriage. Not surprisingly, hotels and resorts that cater to same-sex weddings are cashing in. One is the Hob Knob in Martha's Vineyard; its Escape & Elope package includes an intimate ceremony, along with Champagne and massages. And all their wedding packages come with access to Tulle, a destination wedding-and-gown specialist that can accommodate not just one picky bride, but two. Another property capitalizing on the ruling is the Mayflower Inn & Spa in Washington, Connecticut. The inn's ""At Last"" package includes all the traditional trimmings of a wedding: rehearsal dinner, couples' massage, garden ceremony, and officiant, along with either ""his and his"" or ""hers and hers"" stylists. The hotel also offers 25 percent off room rates on the couples' wedding anniversary for life -- much better than a Tupperware set. Travel + Leisure: 50 best romantic getaways . For those who want to plan their own ceremony, Bernadette Smith suggests the Exchange Conference Center overlooking Boston Harbor -- it's where she'll be saying ""I do"" this summer. Anne P. Worcester, chief marketing officer of Market New Haven, a tourism and commerce organization for the New Haven area, suggests a few other same-sex-friendly Connecticut venues. There's the New Haven Lawn Club, known for its large ballroom and experience in gay weddings; the Union League Café (""arguably the best restaurant in all of New Haven,"" she says); and the quintessentially romantic carousel at Lighthouse Point. For those traveling long distances, the Omni New Haven Hotel can accommodate out-of-town couples and their guests with in-house ballrooms, restaurants and a spa. Travel + Leisure: Great romantic weekend getaways . Anne Stanback, executive director of Love Makes a Family (a pro-gay marriage organization in New Haven, Connecticut) has become an expert on same-sex wedding planning since she arranged her own nuptials without the help of bridal magazines. ""We may not see the lesbian version of Modern Bride until a few more states legalize marriage for same-sex couples, but I have no doubt we eventually will,"" she says. Now gay advocates in Iowa would like to create the same kind of wedding infrastructure available in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. Greg Nooney, who started one of the state's few gay-wedding Web sites, began receiving inquiries just days after the decision was finalized on April 3. Nooney admits that building a roster of gay-friendly vendors won't happen overnight. ""It is taking some people a little time to get their bearings,"" he says. One place that wasted no time in promoting itself as gay-friendly is the Sioux City Holiday Inn. Manager Larry Jenson says the property has held commitment ceremonies in the past and looks forward to hosting same-sex couples in the future. Despite the fast pace of change across America, however, wedding experts say all the feedback has been positive. ""People may be surprised at just how few ripples the change in the marriage law has caused here,"" says Anne Stanback, of Connecticut. ""There has been no backlash, there have been no protests. Just lots and lots of people who are pleased."" Planning a beach getaway? Don't miss Travel + Leisure's guide to Affordable Beach Resorts. Copyright 2009 American Express Publishing Corporation.

"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Monday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says nonemergency legislation needs time to be read by the public and Congress. (CNN) -- Whether by omission or commission, both the White House and Congress get a dose of blame for not living up to the new era of transparency promised by President Obama. The president's old campaign Web site still has this commitment there for all to see: . ""As president, Obama will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days."" Well, the president broke that promise barely a week after taking office when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Bill dealing with equal pay for men and women. A good bill, and certainly one that could have survived a five-day comment period. So, maybe the White House folks just forgot? But then there is Congress and the Stimulus Bill. How fast could you get through it? According to the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, lawmakers had just 13 hours to read 1,100 pages of material that would cost the American taxpayer $787 billion. That's less than a minute and a half per page, with no time for bathroom breaks. No wonder so many of our lawmakers didn't seem to notice that last-minute exemption clearing the way for bailed-out companies like AIG to pay out big bonuses. So, the House tried to clean up the mess last week by rushing through another bill -- a tax on AIG bonuses. That bill was just 11 hours old before it went on the floor to be argued and then quickly approved. And the list goes on well before the president took office. The bank bailout got all of 29 hours, the rescue of Fannie and Freddie was only available for 19 hours. This is how bills could literally become, to borrow a phrase, too big to fail -- and too fast to stop. The Sunlight Foundation is calling on Congress to allow the American people three days, 72 hours, to read a nonemergency bill online before debate begins. We strongly agree. And yes lawmakers, you can have three days to read it over, too, before taking a stand. As for President Obama's promise of a five-day public review once a bill leaves Capitol Hill headed for his desk, it would be nice if he kept his word on this going forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.","Brown: Obama said he'd post legislation on Web for 5 days before signing it .

"LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Toiling in what is the opium capital of the world, farmers in southern Afghanistan are swapping out their poppy plants for wheat crops. A farmer harvests wheat in a field on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan, last summer. The farmers are participating in programs sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is offering seeds, fertilizers and improved irrigation to the region in an effort to stop poppy crops and, ultimately, the production of opium and heroin. Observers have noticed a significant decline in the opium trade in Afghanistan, with the number of poppy-free provinces increasing from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008, according to a U.N. report released last year. Opium cultivation in the country, which has 34 provinces, dropped by about 20 percent in a year, the U.N. reported in August. ""It's a challenge to deliver assistance in a war zone -- you can hear fighter jets flying above us right now,"" said Rory Donohoe, a USAID development officer. ""At the end of the day, what we found is successful is that we work in areas that we can work,"" he told CNN in a recent interview in Helmand province. ""We come to places like this demonstration farm where Afghans can come here to a safe environment, get training, pick up seeds and fertilizer, then go back to districts of their own.""  Watch Afghans speak about the change in their farming practices » . Many of Afghanistan's northern and eastern provinces have already benefited from USAID alternative farming programs, which have doled out more than $22 million to nearly 210,000 Afghans to build or repair 435 miles (700 kilometers) of roads and some 2,050 miles (3,300 kilometers) of irrigation and drainage canals. Giving Afghan farmers improved access to markets and improved irrigation is successfully weaning them away from poppy production, according to officials at USAID. Over the years, opium and heroin -- both derivatives of the poppy -- have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, most notably the Taliban movement that once ruled Afghanistan. ""If you can just help the people of Afghanistan in this way, the fighting will go away,"" said Abdul Qadir, a farmer in Lashkar Gah. ""The Taliban and other enemies of the country will also disappear.""","USAID offering seeds, other help to encourage Afghan farmers to grow wheat .

"(CNN) -- A motel owner in New Zealand -- fed up with one too many incidents of rowdy behavior -- has banned an entire town from checking in as guests. Steve Donnelly, an Australian, has been accused of racism following his decision. Steve Donnelly, the owner of the Supreme Motor Lodge in the town of Palmerston North, said he decided to yank the welcome mat for the 16,000 residents of Wainuiomata because ""each time they visited, our life became less exciting."" ""I'm not Santa Claus. I can't figure out who's naughty and who's nice,"" he said. ""So we went ahead and banned all of them."" Wainuiomata, near the capital, Wellington, is about two hours' drive from Palmerston North. Donnelly said he banned the town after three groups of people from Wainuiomata checked in on separate occasions over a six-month period, riling other guests at the 51-room hotel. ""We have moms and dads who come here with two or three kids to relax,"" he said. ""They don't want some loudmouth spitting on the pavement, flirting with girls and swearing."" The ""no vacancy"" extends to the members of parliament, as Wainuiomata lawmaker Trevor Mallard found out when he came to test the ban. ""He's barging in here with a TV camera, trying to book a room to prove a point,"" Donnelly said. ""We just stood at the front door and said, 'You're not welcome here. Go away.'"" By ""we,"" Donnelly is referring to himself and his general manager, Malcolm Glen -- a Scotsman known in the community as ""Basil Fawlty"" after the iconic and paranoid John Cleese character in the British sitcom ""Fawlty Towers."" News of the ban sent some former guests complaining, and others accusing Donnelly, an Australian, of racism. Many wanted to know whether he was violating the Human Rights Act, which prohibits hotel owners from discriminating based on race. ""Some people are making it out to be about the big Aussie brother giving his poor little Kiwi cousin a hard time,"" Donnelly said. ""They were flabbergasted that there wasn't a law that stopped me. But it's like having a pub. You don't have to have a reason why you won't serve alcohol to any group of people."" Donnelly, who's owned the 25-year-old motel for the past two and a half years, said he might annul the ban in the future -- if Wainuiomata adjusts its behavior.","Steve Donnelly owns Supreme Motor Lodge in town of Palmerston North .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban in Pakistan have issued a direct challenge to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government, by declaring the country's entire legal system ""un-Islamic."" Taliban representatives leave talks in Peshawar in February after reaching a deal on Sharia law in Swat. ""Let the judges and the lawyers go to Islamic university,"" said Muslim Khan, a Taliban spokesman in Pakistan's Swat Valley. ""(After) they learn Islamic rules, Islamic regulation, they can continue to work."" In a telephone interview Tuesday with CNN, Khan demanded the imposition of Islamic sharia law all across the country. He also called for the creation of jaziya, an Islamic tax, to be levied on all non-Muslims in Pakistan. And Khan denounced any Pakistanis who disagreed with his interpretation of Islam, calling them ""non-Muslims."" The Taliban militant echoed statements made by Sufi Muhammed, an Islamist fundamentalist leader who helped broker a peace deal between the Pakistani government and the Taliban in Swat Valley. Last week, the deal led to the implementation of sharia law in Swat, an alpine region that was once one of Pakistan's most popular destinations for foreign tourists. Speaking before an audience of tens of thousands on Sunday, Sufi Muhammed declared democracy and Pakistan's judicial system ""un-Islamic."" Since reaching his peace deal with the government in Islamabad, Muhammed has been appointing qazis, or clerics, to serve as judges in Islamic courts in Swat. The rise of the Taliban in Swat has alarmed and frightened some members of local civil society there. ""This is a time bomb for the country,"" said Aftab Alam, the head of the lawyers' association in Swat district. Speaking by telephone from the town of Mingora, Alam claimed Taliban militants have kidnapped, ransomed and even killed lawyers in recent months. ""The only sane voice against the militants, the only sane voice against the criminals, is the lawyer community,"" he said. ""And this is why we have been declared by them, I mean the militants, liable to death."" This week, some secular Pakistani political parties publicly condemned the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islam. But many other prominent officials appear unwilling or unable to challenge the creeping Taliban conversion of Pakistani society. For example, Ali Ahmed Kurd, one of the leaders of the lawyers protest movement which helped bring down the government of military ruler Pervez Musharraf, declined to comment on Tuesday when asked by CNN about Sufi Mohammed's comments. In recent months, videos have emerged showing what appear to be Taliban militants in Swat meting out vigilante justice. One video shows men beating a woman accused of adultery with a cane. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan initially claimed responsibility for the public caning in interviews with Pakistani TV stations. But in his interview with CNN on Tuesday he reversed his position, accusing ""opponents of Islam"" of making fake videos to hurt his movement's image. Meanwhile, in another Taliban-run region called Orakzai, details emerged of militants forcing a small community of Sikhs to pay a jaziya or ""minority tax"" of 10.5 million rupees, roughly 18,000 dollars earlier this month. During his interview, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan said that if his vision of an Islamic society is fulfilled in Pakistan, terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden will be welcome to travel and live openly here. ""Sure, he's a Muslim, he can go anywhere,"" Khan said. Khan added that he would like to see sharia law implemented beyond Pakistan, even in America, a country he knows intimately. For four years, the Taliban spokesman lived in the United States, working as a painter near Boston.","Taliban in Pakistan demand imposition of Islamic sharia law across country .

"(CNN) -- A conference of Islamic prosecutors in Iran worked Wednesday to draft an indictment against Israeli leaders, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Palestinian women walk past a building destroyed during Israel's campaign in Gaza. The charges stem from Israel's late-December offensive into Gaza against Hamas militants. The Israeli military has been accused of using excessive and indiscriminate force in civilian areas. Israel is ""a regime that only understands the language of violence and force,"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said at the gathering, in calling for the prosecution of Israeli ""criminals."" ""I am confident that there will come a day when all Zionist criminals will be brought to justice,"" he said on the second day of the conference in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The Iranian president regularly rails against Israel and has called for the Jewish state's elimination. Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said: ""The day when this conference will start dealing with human rights in the countries that are members of this organization will be the day that their claims concerning Israel will be deserved to be heard, not before. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, let alone commit suicide bombings."" ""The accusations themselves are nothing more than the hysterical, hostile coverage of the media in these countries and not based on solid facts,"" he continued. Human Rights Watch, in a report released last month, said there was evidence that Israel committed war crimes in Gaza by firing white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas. Israel has rejected that claim. Israel also has said that the offensive was to defend against repeated rocket attacks by Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday its forces ""operated in accordance with international law"" during recent fighting in Gaza, but said there were a few incidents in which ""intelligence or operational errors"" occurred. This is the conclusion of probes that emerged from Operation Cast Lead, in which Israel was broadly criticized for its actions in Gaza. Phosphorus shells can be used to create a smokescreen for troops. In creating the diversion, the element ignites when exposed to oxygen and can cause severe burns. The Israeli offensive was launched December 27 and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children, a U.N. report recently said. Thirteen Israelis died -- three civilians and six soldiers were killed by Hamas, and four soldiers were killed by friendly fire -- the report said. A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the U.N. report an example of the ""one-sided and unfair"" attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which had requested it. The two days of meetings in the Iranian capital have included more than 200 senior judicial officials from the Organization of the Islamic Conference -- an association of 56 states. The organization might ask the U.N. International Court of Justice to charge Israeli leaders with crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. The court would not be obligated to act.","Islamic prosecutors draft indictment against Israeli leaders over Gaza offensive .

"EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting in high school, math and history lessons never captured Danny Santos' imagination. The drug-fueled streets of the Texas-Mexico border provided his education, and he was an excellent student. Danny Santos, 21, works two part-time jobs and still doesn't make as much as he did as a drug mule. Santos says he became one of the thousands of American and Mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling. ""I didn't care. I had no conscience,"" Santos said at a boxing gym in El Paso, Texas. ""You're young, and you're naïve, and you think it's easy."" Santos' journey into the underworld of teenage drug smuggling offers a glimpse into how drug cartels lure teenagers into doing their dirty work. US. Customs and Border Protection officials in El Paso and San Diego report that in recent months, they've seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints. They're often called mules. These teenagers are usually hired only to smuggle drug loads across the border. It's a short drive or walk that offers quick cash but can carry serious consequences.  Watch how teens get drugs across the border » . Drug cartels ""just need someone who can legitimately cross the border,"" said Bill Molaski, the El Paso Port Director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As an American, Santos could freely cross the El Paso-Juarez border and not raise suspicion. At age 15, Santos says, he met ""a guy"" at a party who introduced him to drug kingpins in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. ""You start off as a driver,"" Santos said. ""People feel like they can trust you, then you move up to something bigger."" Two weeks later, he got a $4,000 job offer to drive his first load of marijuana across a bridge into El Paso. It was the beginning of a four-year smuggling career. ""I can't say I wasn't nervous,"" Santos said. ""You kind of project yourself into another time of happiness or joy. ... You just have to forget you have something illegal in the car."" In all, Santos says, he earned $50,000 making about 20 mule runs, driving right through heavily guarded border checkpoints. Santos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail. He said charges were dropped. Because he was younger than 18 when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, CNN could not confirm his story through court records. Young smugglers don't fit a stereotype. Several sources said that both American and Mexican teens are lured into the work. Teenage boys and girls alike are involved. Many smugglers come from middle-class families. ""There's a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved,"" El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez said. His office is responsible for prosecuting juvenile smugglers. Federal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools. Depending on the size of the drug load that's being smuggled, a kid can be paid a couple hundred dollars up to $5,000. Mexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in Mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits. A phone number is included in the ad. The officials say a cartel member sets up a meeting to determine whether the kid is up to the job. But Rodriguez offers a chilling reason why teenagers should avoid the lure of easy money. ""We had a kid here who lost a load and had some of his toes chopped off,"" Rodriguez said. Santos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago. Now he spends every day training at a boxing gym in El Paso. Boxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal. However, it's a slow climb to the top of the boxing world. He's chasing the golden dreams of boxing championships and hoping to make more money boxing than he did smuggling. Santos is working two part-time jobs, and he says it takes him two months to earn the money that he used to make in one day of drug smuggling. He spent almost all the money he made smuggling. But he has no regrets. ""The peace of mind is good,"" Santos said after a bruising workout. ""I sleep good, eat good. I feel better now.""","Danny Santos, 21, says he made $50,000 in four years as a drug mule .

""And the baristas from coffee-producing countries seem to have an easy access to this."" Davies said he owes his success to his willingness to improvise. ""There were 256 different drinks that we could have made,"" he said. ""We tried a few and added the ingredients. But it was still a bit risky ... and we got away with it!""

Not to suggest he's using the popular social networking service to cause trouble. Hardly. The 44-year-old rock musician said he enjoys the open stream of chit-chat with his fans. ""It's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone's probably had forever,"" said Cornell. ""And I don't mind answering them. And I can actually have conversations with fans that are quick, but still more meaningful than the typical situations you're put into. I've really liked it."" His more than 200,000 followers can revel in bite-size musings about life on the road (""crowd was amazing last night"") or sweet tweets to his wife, Vicky (""hi baby! i miss you!"").  Watch Cornell talk about his Twitter fascination » . The former front man of Soundgarden and Audioslave -- who is also known for singing the James Bond theme ""Casino Royale"" -- is the first to admit he's a fan of experimenting. His new solo album, ""Scream,"" has him meshing his rock vibe with dance-floor beats by the much sought-after producer Timbaland. The collaboration has left some people scratching their heads. Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor took a swipe by twittering: ""You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable? Heard Chris Cornell's record?"" Ouch. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart, but it took a substantial tumble the second week. But Cornell -- who said he's never met Reznor nor read or responded to his tweet -- was more than ready for criticism. ""You could kind of see it coming,"" he said. ""Some of it is a script that was written just by putting [me and Timbaland] together. And most of the negative responses fit that script perfectly: 'You can't put these two things together. We don't like it! We're not going to let you! So we're gonna say bad stuff.' "" For Cornell, working with Timbaland required him to ""rinse away everything that I knew about songwriting and recording."" He said the biggest challenge was in having to relearn how to sing to a different rhythm, his raspy voice needing to match up with slick studio beats rather than sliding loosely around the live, loud accompaniment he's so used to. ""To me it seemed like an exciting thing to just go and do,"" he said. ""I think this is as good as any album I've ever made, and I listen to it probably more than any other record I've ever made."" Cornell spoke to CNN about Timbaland, Twitter and throwing stuff out windows. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Some people have said that you've lost your musical identity in this album. Chris Cornell: I don't have one, really. I don't want to have one. If I had a musical identity that was definable then it would be time to get into painting or something else. Race car driving. CNN: So you would be happy to be experimental on your next album? Cornell: Absolutely. CNN: So what was it like working with Timbaland? Cornell: He didn't really have a particular direction in mind in terms of what he wanted me to do. He did what Timbaland does, and I did what I do. We just wrote songs, which is really the best thing that came out of it. ... It doesn't sound like anybody else's record. It doesn't sound like music I've ever heard. It defies genre, and yet it's very much a song-oriented album as well as an album-oriented album. ... The music never stops. I've performed it that way. It's almost like a movie soundtrack. CNN: How often do you Twitter? Cornell: It depends. When I'm out on the road, depending on the day, a couple times a day I'll spend a half-hour or an hour or so. I've found that doing vocal warm-ups and Twitter at the same time, cause I'm a multitasker. I can watch CNN -- because I do -- and then I can be online and do vocal warm-ups all at the same time. And only one of those things is way too boring. CNN: I read a couple of your tweets, and you said that you were having trouble sleeping. Is that an occupational hazard? Cornell: Probably, yeah. I think everybody has a hard time when you play ... [a] show and then you're finished at 1:30 in the morning. It takes me an hour and a half to be able to eat after that and then to be able to sleep after that. It's hard. CNN: What is the biggest misconception about being a rock musician? Cornell: My first answer would be that it's just all a big party. But then I've been in that situation or seen bands like that where it is all a big party. I think overall there's this idea that it isn't work, that it isn't something that you have to put pretty much 100 percent of your focus and your being into, that it's like winning the lottery in a sense. And I think if you're a musician that's had any kind of success there is a component to that. There's some aspect to timing and luck, there's talent obviously as well. But it's a lot of traveling. It's a lot of waiting, it's a lot of leaving one city going into another city only to see the venue you're going to play in when you arrive, playing for the audience and then leaving and going to the next city. CNN: Have you ever thrown a really big object through a window? Cornell: Yeah. I threw an amplifier, a small one, through a window only because me and a few friends of mine that were out on tour together just made the observation [that] our generation just doesn't do stuff like that. So we sort of did it as kind of a ritualistic, ""OK, let's participate in the real thing."" There was a piece of duct tape on the amplifier that had my name on it. So I had to run down to the alley and take that tape off so that they wouldn't know who threw it off to the street.","Chris Cornell's new album is ""Scream""

"(CNN) -- Neenah Pickett is on a mission to find love, and it's the kind that has a countdown and can be monitored by any curious voyeur. No, she's not the newest bachelorette to feed America's reality TV addiction. The New Jersey media consultant is the brains and heart behind ""52 weeks 2 find him!"" a Web site dedicated to the search for her husband. ""This whole process has been me really realizing I need to find new ways to be proactive,"" said Pickett, 43, who might typically get roped into long hours at work or the embrace of a comfortable couch. ""I'm past the stage of believing it'll just happen."" So she's putting it all out there on her site. She's blogging. She's asking friends and strangers to weigh in with advice. She's pushing herself to do things and act in ways she never has before. And a little more than 14 weeks into the self-imposed challenge, she's pretty exhausted. ""I can't believe how hard it is,"" she said of the journey so far, which has brought her more dates in two months than she'd had in two years. ""But that's why the deadline is so important."" Setting goals and working hard -- no doubt, it's the American way. Singles scramble to avoid renewing online dating subscriptions. They sign up for ""speed dating"" events to feast on a smorgasbord of quick-and-easy first impressions. TV viewers beat up ""The Bachelor"" when he regrets selecting the mate he's chosen after a limited number of episodes. And how-to books that promise, within a set timeframe, discovery of the One, fly off bookshelves. When it comes to matters of the heart, though, does finding love on a deadline make sense? ""It sounds good from a marketing standpoint, but life doesn't work like that,"" said Blaire Allison, ""The Love Guru,"" who coaches people when it comes to matters of the heart. She should know. About five years ago, when she was 27, Allison posted a site called ""Marry Blaire,"" with the hope -- albeit somewhat in jest -- that she'd be engaged within six months. Like Pickett, she felt that setting aside time to focus on her personal life was necessary. ""It's OK to say, 'I want to be a partner in a law firm in three years' ... but we're taught to not be open about our desires about marriage, because we don't want to scare off the guy,"" she said. By being honest, ""you end up attracting men who want the same thing as you."" A funny thing happened along the way, though. Allison found ""my One,"" as she calls him, ended up living with the guy and felt essentially married. But she walked away when she realized that she hadn't taken time to know herself. She was young, caught up in the societal pressures and so worried about finding him that she'd never bothered to look within. Through self-discovery, she fell ""totally in love with myself,"" she said. ""Now, I'm ready for a partner in my life again, but there's no rush; there's no urgency; there's no fear."" And nothing is more attractive than a woman who is happy with herself, said Sam van Rood, a ""Love Doctor"" based in London, England. He said that putting a deadline on the search for love sounds like ""a risky approach"" and that allowing time for self-evaluation is most important, no matter the gender. To get where he is, personally and professionally, he had to examine and fix his own mindset when it came to love and romance. ""I used to see an ice queen, and I'd run and impale myself on her cold, bitter heart,"" said van Rood, 35, who's engaged to be married next year. ""Now I have the loveliest, warmest woman I've ever met. In helping myself, I've ended up helping other people."" For 23 years, Janet Page has been offering her own brand of assistance by way of an evening course offered at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. It was traditionally called ""I Will Be Married in One Year,"" but the psychotherapist has changed the course name in recent years to better represent her curriculum and those she wants to reach, including gays and lesbians who can't marry: ""Find Your Dream Mate While Finding Yourself: The Twelve-Month Plan."" Too many people are caught up in the fantasy of how love works and happens, she said. They are prepared to work hard on the job or in school, but they haven't done their homework to achieve true and lasting love. Women, for example, think that outward appearances will reel men in, but men don't give enough attention to how they look, she said. And simple things, like making a conscious effort to smile more often, can make a difference. Get advice from matchmakers on what to wear, where to go . ""Women who don't smile are perceived as hostile. Women perceive men who don't smile as being unsafe,"" Page said. ""But of course, your best smilers in the world are sociopaths,"" she added. Though ""love doesn't have a time limit on it,"" Page said giving people time constraints can be important, especially if what they need to do is some of the hard, looking-within kind of work. If people were told to spend five years on this process, they'd wait until year four to focus, she said. ""You have to give people deadlines."" And it's the deadline of 52 weeks that works for Pickett, who had never allowed herself this time to focus on her heart and the search for love. This ""grand effort,"" as she calls it, is simply her attempt to see whether she can add to what is already ""a full life"" and one that she loves. If she doesn't find him by the end of the year, she's prepared to take a year off to re-evaluate where she is. ""At that point, I'll probably need a year off from dating,"" she said with a laugh.","A woman sets up a Web site for help in her 52-week search to find The One .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nine of the 11 Pakistani nationals being held in an alleged terror plot in northern England were released Tuesday, according to police. Police officers guard a house in Manchester, England, following raids and arrests of terror suspects. The arrests were made the week before Easter and came quickly after Britain's chief terrorism officer, who has since resigned, exposed a list of people who were suspected of planning an al Qaeda-linked attack. Britain's Greater Manchester Police said the men were released into the custody of the U.K.'s border agency, which will determine whether they can legally remain in England. Police and the border agency said they want the men deported, even though investigators apparently were unable to find enough evidence to charge them with crimes. ""We are seeking to remove these individuals on grounds of national security. The government's highest priority is to protect public safety,"" said a statement from the agency. ""Where a foreign national poses a threat to this country, we will seek to exclude or to deport, where this is appropriate."" Twelve people originally were arrested April 8, and one had been released before Tuesday. Two people remained in custody, authorities said. Police said that at the time of the arrests, their investigation compelled them to take action, even without the blunder made by Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick. The document he was carrying when photographed outside 10 Downing Street contained the names of those to be arrested, and a source said photographers were able to easily read the names when they enlarged the photographs. Once the word was out, police rushed to make the arrests. Authorities said those actions would have been taken in the following 24 hours anyway. The men -- ranging in age from 18 to 22 -- were arrested in Manchester, about 200 miles northwest of London. They had been held for 13 days without being charged. Police will need to seek an extension by Wednesday to be able to continue holding the two remaining suspects without charges. Police say they are continuing to review evidence collected in the case and are searching at least one more house . CNN's Paula Newton in London contributed to this report.","Border officials want men deported despite lack of evidence to charge them .

"(CNN) -- Besides charting the nature of space and time and penning the bestseller ""A Brief History of Time,"" Stephen Hawking has another distinction: He beat the life-expectancy odds for people with ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stephen Hawking, shown in Pasadena, California, in March, is hospitalized but said to be ""comfortable."" Most people with ALS survive only two to five years after diagnosis. Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom. Hawking, 67, was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, England, on Monday in a ""very ill"" condition, and spent the night in the hospital. He was said to be  ""comfortable""  Tuesday. Bob Hawkins, 75, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year, said Hawking, with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer, gives him hope. The physicist should be a role model for people with the disease as well as those without it, Hawkins said. ""The man is brilliant, and he has striven through a lot of adversity to accomplish all of the things he has accomplished,"" Hawkins said. ""He should be an inspiration for anyone."" The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest, said Dr. Lucie Bruijn, scientific director for the ALS Association, in an e-mail. This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said. ""To have achieved so much in his lifetime while battling Lou Gehrig's Disease is quite remarkable,"" she said. ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, which results in muscle weakness and atrophy. The disease causes the death of motor neurons, meaning the brain loses its ability to control muscle movement. Hawking has had direct involvement in promoting awareness and research into his disease. He recently agreed to be a patron of the MND Association in Northampton, England, meaning he will lend his name to the charity and support it by attending events, fundraising, or other activities. He has participated in some of the organization's high-profile events, said Mel Barry, communications manager at the MND Association. ""He's a very busy man, so it's wonderful that he's publicly supporting us with his very heavy workload,"" she said. Hawking's case is also unusual because his condition was diagnosed at a young age, said Sharon Matland, vice president of patient services at the ALS Association. People typically are between 40 and 70 when they learn they have ALS; Hawking found out at age 21. Some very rare cases manifest in the late teens, Bruijn said. There have been other rare cases of people living long lives with ALS, although none as famous as Hawking. Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years. ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States, the ALS Association estimates. ""It totally upsets your entire way of living,"" Hawkins of North Carolina said. ""It slowly takes over your entire muscle structure and eventually your limbs are affected, your speech may or may not be affected. The only part of your body that isn't affected is your mind."" Still, patients experience different symptoms, and some do have cognitive impairment, Matland said. They may have trouble making day-to-day decisions, such as choosing which bills to pay first. Hawkins said he first experienced weakness in his legs and arms, typical symptoms of the disease. People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said. ""You drop things or you can't grasp things as you might have been able to do in the past,"" she said. Loss of voice is another potential symptom, but some people are able to speak until they die, Barry said. The nature of the disease is that it's very different in each person, she said. Most people with ALS become dependent on a wheelchair -- sometimes within six to eight months, but the time frame varies, Matland said. Typically, the ultimate cause of death is respiratory failure, because ALS affects the muscles used for breathing, she said. David Niven, the English actor known for his roles in ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""The Pink Panther,"" died of ALS at age 73. He suffered from the disease for more than a year. A variety of ongoing clinical trials seek to find an effective treatment for ALS in the U.S. Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association. A recent study showed there may be a genetic component to the disease. In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said. Psychiatrists currently prescribe lithium, a mood-stabilizing drug, for bipolar disorder and other conditions. An FDA-approved drug called riluzole has been shown to prolong survival for some ALS patients, but extends the life span by only three to six months, Barry said. Typically, palliative care is the main treatment -- managing symptoms rather than stopping or curing them. Stem cell therapy may hold promise for the disease, but the general perception is that research into it is not sufficiently advanced, according to the MND Association. To raise money for research in the U.S., the ALS Association hosts walks across the country. Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville, North Carolina, Walk to Defeat ALS in May. ""I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects,"" he said. CNN's Jennifer Pifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Stephen Hawking is a rare case of someone who has survived decades with ALS .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Move over Susan Boyle. A week after the Scottish woman became a global sensation following a barnstorming audition on ""Britain's Got Talent,"" a 12-year-old Welsh boy with a Motown voice has been hailed for his ""life-changing"" performance on the TV show after earning a standing ovation from Simon Cowell. Jafargholi impressed the ""Britain's Got Talent"" judges with a rendition of ""Who's Loving You."" Shaheen Jafargholi's prospects looked bleak when the infamously hard to impress Cowell brought the audition to an abrupt halt just one verse into his rendition of ""Valerie,"" the Zutons' song covered by Amy Winehouse. ""You've got this really wrong,"" Cowell told him. ""What do you sing apart from that?"" Jafargholi instead offered to perform ""Who's Loving You,"" written by Smokey Robinson and performed by a young Michael Jackson with the Jackson Five, bringing screams of delight from the audience as he launched into a note-perfect rendition that brought a beaming Cowell and fellow judges Piers Morgan and Amanda Holden to their feet. ""This is how one song can change your life,"" Cowell told him. ""This may be the start of something special for you young man.""  Watch Shaheen Jafargholi perform on ""Britain's Got Talent"" » . Writing in his blog for the show, Morgan said Jafargholi had been the stand-out act of the show and tipped him as a possible challenger to Boyle for the TV talent show's £100,000 ($146,000) prize. ""Once Simon got him to sing the right kind of song for his voice, he was sensational. Like a young Stevie Wonder,"" Morgan said. In an interview for the show, Jafargholi said he had been singing since he was two years old. ""When I was a bit older my mum got me some singing lessons and my voice just got bigger and bigger,"" he said. ""Hopefully this is going to be my big break."" Last week's performance by Boyle, the 47-year-old with a Broadway voice who claimed to have never been kissed, brought the show global attention, with her version of the Les Miserables' tune ""I Dreamed a Dream"" gaining more than 32 million hits on YouTube as well as earning her a string of U.S. media appearances, including on CNN's Larry King Live. Jafargholi has some way to go to match Boyle's success. By Monday morning a YouTube link to his performance had been watched just 330,000 times. Who do you prefer? Susan Boyle or Shaheen Jafargholi?

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Four people in two states have been arrested as part of an investigation into the Final Exit Network, an organization that police believe helped a Georgia man end his life in June, authorities said Thursday. Claire Blehr, 76, of Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of Florida and Georgia, were two of the four arrested. John Celmer, 58, lived in Cumming, north of Atlanta. Cumming police, the Forsyth County coroner and the man's relatives all had suspicions that his death was an assisted suicide, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation  launched an investigation, the agency said in a news release. The GBI on Wednesday set up a sting operation at a residence in adjoining Dawson County, using an undercover agent who had posed as a terminally ill man seeking assistance with his suicide, the statement said. Claire Blehr, 76, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of both Punta Gorda, Florida, and Kennesaw, Georgia, were arrested, the GBI said. Meanwhile, authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, arrested Dr. Lawrence D. Egbert, 81, of Baltimore in connection with the investigation. A second person, Nicholas Alec Sheridan, 60, also of Baltimore, was arrested Wednesday night, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said Thursday. All four face charges of assisted suicide, tampering with evidence and violation of the Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the GBI said. The Final Exit Network, based in the north Atlanta suburb of Marietta, identifies itself on its Web site as ""an all-volunteer organization dedicated to serving people who are suffering from an intolerable condition. Network volunteers offer you counseling, support and even guidance to self-deliverance at a time and place of your choosing, but you always do the choosing. We will never encourage you to hasten your death."" Celmer suffered from ""very, very severe mouth and throat cancer,"" his 85-year-old mother, Betty Celmer, said from her home in the Buffalo, New York, suburb of East Amherst. ""They were rebuilding the whole mouth,"" she said. ""He was suffering terribly, that I know."" She said her son had undergone numerous surgeries and ""sounded depressed."" When he died, she said she had no idea his death might have been a suicide. In a statement released by the GBI, Celmer's widow, Susan, said that she and her family ""are gratified that the GBI and other law enforcement agencies have pursued this matter vigorously and that their investigation has led to the arrests reported today."" She said she will not comment further and requested privacy, referring future questions to her attorneys. An e-mail to Jerry Dincin, a man listed as Final Exit Network's vice president and treasurer on its Web site, was not answered Thursday. A call to Final Exit was answered by a recording. The method used in the suicide was helium inhalation, according to the GBI statement. People pay $50 to join the Final Exit Network, according to the GBI, and complete an application process. They are then visited by an ""exit guide"" assigned to the case. ""During the visitations, the member is instructed to purchase two helium tanks of a specific size and brand and a specific type of hood known as an 'exit bag,' "" according to the GBI statement. ""On the day of the event, the member is visited by the 'exit guide' and a 'senior exit guide.' The senior exit guide instructs the member through the process."" Goodwin and Blehr were told the GBI agent suffered from pancreatic cancer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. At the Dawson County residence on Wednesday, Goodwin allegedly walked the undercover agent through the steps and demonstrated how he would hold the agent's hands to stop him from removing the exit bag, Bankhead said. The GBI said that after the death occurs, ""all evidence is removed from the scene by the 'guides' and discarded, as evidence indicated happened in the Cumming case."" Goodwin's former neighbors in Kennesaw told CNN he moved to Florida a few years ago but still owns his large home there and returns to check on it occasionally. Kay Makarenko, 69, who lives behind Goodwin's home, said she was shocked to hear of his arrest. ""I said, 'It can't be the same Ted Goodwin.' "" After the arrests Wednesday, authorities in Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Colorado and Montana began executing search warrants and conducting interviews as part of the probe into the Final Exit Network, the GBI said, adding that GBI agents were in each state except Colorado to assist. In Phoenix, Arizona, police have linked the 2007 death of a 58-year-old woman to the Final Exit Network, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO-TV in Phoenix. Thomas said the woman, Jana Van Voorhis, was not terminally ill but suffered from mental illness and depression. He said a police investigation turned up records of visits from Final Exit guides to Voorhis, according to KPHO. No arrests have been made, but Thomas said he expects his office to wrap up its investigation and decide if charges are warranted within 60 days. CNN affiliate WDIV-TV in Detroit, Michigan, reported that search warrants were executed regarding two Michigan residents who sit on Final Exit's board of directors. The Final Exit Network Web site features a ""Wall of Fame"" with photos of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, among others. Kevorkian was released on parole in June 2007 after serving more than eight years of a 10- to 25-year sentence in the 1998 death of a man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ""We believe the needs of those who are suffering are paramount,"" the organization says. ""We applaud the work of organizations that seek legislative action to strengthen our right to die a peaceful and painless death at the time and place of our choosing. However, we feel that legislative change will not come soon enough for the many people who need help now and in the interim."" Betty Celmer, meanwhile, declined to share her thoughts on assisted suicide or the Final Exit Network's alleged involvement in her son's death, saying she lacks specifics. ""He's in a far better place,"" she said. ""That's the only comment I'm going to make.""

"Smokers with high levels of a carcinogen byproduct (NNAL) are at higher risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking is a lot like Russian roulette: You never know who will end up developing lung cancer and who won't. But Dr. Jian-Min Yuan, as well as other researchers from the University of Minnesota, say they are one step closer to determining a smoker's risk for developing the disease. In a study, they tracked the carcinogen and nicotine levels in nearly 500 smokers through a simple urine test and discovered a link between the level of a specific carcinogen and lung cancer. Their findings were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference. Why did researchers track only  the levels of one carcinogen? We all know that tobacco smoke is bad: It's loaded with 60 different carcinogens, which cause all sorts of health risks. There is one carcinogen in particular that researchers suspected for years contributed to human lung cancer. But there were never any scientific human studies showing this relationship. This carcinogen is known as NNK. It releases into your body when you inhale smoke, quickly passes through the liver, gets metabolized and releases NNAL, a byproduct of NNK, into the bloodstream. University of Minnesota researchers were tracking the NNAL levels via urine samples.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings » . How much did a person have to smoke to develop high levels of NNAL? The exact amount is a little tricky to determine because a lot depends on how honest a person is about how many cigarettes he or she smoked per day. Additionally, the type of cigarette and how deeply a person inhales could affect the amount of carcinogens in the body. Researchers say a person with high levels of NNAL and high levels of nicotine (equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day) is 8.5 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with a smoker with lower levels. While the researchers point out that not everyone who has a high level of NNAL is going to develop lung cancer, it does help assign a number to a risk that was hard to quantify before. Isn't smoking bad for you regardless? What is the benefit of having this type of information? There is nothing healthy about smoking. Even if this test pegs you at low risk of developing lung cancer, it doesn't mean you won't develop a dozen other cancers commonly cause by smoking. If you smoke, the No. 1 thing you should do is quit. But that is easier said than done. If it were easy, 23 percent of adults in the United States would not smoke regularly. One benefit of knowing whether a smoker is at increased risk for lung cancer is for his or her doctor to screen the person regularly for abnormalities, in the hopes of catching the cancer early. Lung cancer is but one consequence of smoking, so this type of testing is not going to fix everything. But as far as lung cancer goes, it may give people a better idea of when and how often to get screened. Reported by CNN's Danielle Dellorto .","First study to quantify link between carcinogen byproduct and lung cancer rates .
Researchers tracked levels of byproduct (NNAL) using urine samples .
Smokers with high levels of NNAL doubled their risk of developing lung cancer .
Test could identify high-risk people, aid in early detection and treatment .
Bottom Line: This test may one day be used to identify smokers at high risk for lung cancer, but won't help against smoking's other health hazards."
"(CNN) -- Jon Opsahl said he doesn't think domestic terrorist-turned-housewife Sara Jane Olson served nearly enough time for his mother's murder, but he's relieved the saga ended with Olson's Tuesday release from prison. Sara Jane Olson was released from a California prison Tuesday after serving seven years. Olson, a member of the self-styled revolutionary Symbionese Liberation Army -- perhaps best known for kidnapping Patricia Hearst -- was released from a California prison after serving seven years, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. She was released to her husband just after midnight and is expected to serve her yearlong parole term in Minnesota -- over the the objections of police unions and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Her sentence stems from her involvement in the 1975 attempted bombings of two police cars and the slaying of Myrna Opsahl during a bank robbery that same year. Back then, Olson went by her birth name, Kathleen Anne Soliah. After her 1976 indictment in the attempted bombings, she changed her name and started a new life in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was not apprehended until 1999. ""I've really got nothing to say. She did her time, as minimal as that may have been,"" said Jon Opsahl, who was 15 when his mother was killed. ""One of those years -- just one -- was for the murder of my mom and the bank robbery up in Carmichael."" Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four, was depositing money at the Crocker National Bank for her church when she was shot by Olson's co-defendant Emily Montague Harris, according to court documents. Harris was sentenced to eight years; she served four and was released on parole in February 2007. Jon Opsahl, now 49, said he never understood why it took so long to bring his mother's killers to justice. While charges were filed in the bombings within months, no charges were brought in his mother's murder until 2002. ""You expect thugs to do what thugs do, but you don't expect the district attorney to turn a blind eye to the murder of an upstanding citizen,"" Jon Opsahl said Monday. Olson's release Tuesday will cap an oft-strange storyline that spans more than three decades and which saw Olson wear the hats of college student, 1970s radical, housewife and philanthropist. Attorney Andy Dawkins met Olson, now 62, shortly after she moved to St. Paul through friends in the reggae band, Pressure Drop. Fred Peterson, Olson's husband, played trumpet in the band, Dawkins said. ""She did good deeds everywhere. She raised three wonderful daughters. It was always a shock to all of us that the Sara we know had that past,"" Dawkins said. After attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, Olson moved to Berkeley in the early 1970s. There, she met Angela Atwood in 1972, and the two became best friends and roommates, Olson told L.A. Weekly in a 2002 interview shortly before she was imprisoned. After Atwood and five other SLA members were killed in a 1974 gunfight with the Los Angeles Police Department, Olson appeared at a memorial in Berkeley's Ho Chi Minh Park to eulogize her friend. ""SLA soldiers, although I know it's not necessary to say, keep fighting. I'm with you, and we are with you,"" Olson told the crowd. Almost a year later, Olson took part in two bank robberies to help fund the SLA, according to court documents. During the Carmichael robbery, Olson ""entered the bank with a firearm and kicked a nonresisting pregnant teller in the stomach. The teller miscarried after the robbery,"" the documents said. In August 1975, Los Angeles police found homemade bombs under two squad cars. They were designed to explode when the car moved, but neither device detonated. Authorities cast the attempted bombings as payback for the bloody shootout that left Atwood and other SLA members dead. A probe into the gunbattle helped police arrest Hearst, the granddaughter of publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst, who claimed she had been kidnapped, raped and brainwashed by the SLA. In her book ""Every Secret Thing,"" Hearst put Olson at the center of the Carmichael robbery. Olson soon left California. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ""she evaded capture for 23 years, and in the meantime, became a doctor's wife, mother of three, community volunteer, veteran of charity work in Africa and practicing Methodist living in an upscale neighborhood in St. Paul."" Though authorities said a 1999 ""America's Most Wanted"" episode marking the 25th anniversary of the L.A. shootout led to Olson's arrest, the show's Web site mentions neither Olson nor Soliah among its almost 1,100 ""captures."" Her Minnesota friends and neighbors were shocked, even incredulous, when she was arrested. They pleaded with a judge to grant her bail. The Sara Olson Defense Fund began selling cookbooks, titled, ""Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes."" It would help that Olson was generous with her time. She was active in the church. She volunteered for political campaigns. Dawkins said he had a blind client to whom she used to read The New York Times. Olson's philanthropy, coupled with the connections of her husband, a respected emergency room doctor, made raising the $1 million bail relatively easy, said Dawkins, who remembers that some members of the community had so much faith in Olson they put up their children's college funds. On October 31, 2001, Olson pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to ignite a destructive device or explosive. She later tried to rescind the plea, saying ""cowardice"" prevented her from telling the truth. A superior court judge, however, denied her request and in January 2002 sentenced her to 20 years to life in prison, a sentence the parole board later reduced. Olson was charged with Opsahl's slaying that same week and pleaded guilty in 2003 to second-degree murder. Olson received a sentence of five years to life. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement that Olson's sentence was reduced for good behavior and for her work on a maintenance crew that cleaned the main yard of the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Dawkins said ""it's right"" that Olson served time, but he is glad she is being released. He expects many hugs await her in St. Paul and that she will soon be back to her generous ways. ""I really believe who we knew in St. Paul was the true Sara Olson,"" he said. The Los Angeles Police Protection League disagrees and has loudly opposed her early release. Sgt. Paul Weber, the league's chief, called her a sociopath who ""never said she was sorry."" He also lashed out at those who rush to defend her. ""Enough with the BS that she was unfairly targeted by law enforcement for her youthful indiscretions -- she is a criminal,"" Weber said in a Monday statement. Corrections officials say it's important that she be reunited with her family during her parole -- it helps reduce recidivism -- but Minnesota legislators, the governor and the St. Paul Police Federation have asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep her in California over the next year. ""Letting a domestic terrorist like Kathleen Soliah set the terms of her parole is an insult to the memory of Myrna Opsahl and all the men and women of LAPD past and present,"" the St. Paul union said in a letter last week. Jon Opsahl, however, just wants to put Olson out of his mind. ""Get her out of here,"" he said. ""I don't want to see or think about her again.""","NEW: Governor, police unions oppose Olson serving parole in Minnesota .

"(CNN) -- ""Sesame Street"" may not be a real place, but tell that to some of the people Michael Davis met when researching and talking about his new book, ""Street Gang."" Bert, left, and Ernie have been mainstays of ""Sesame Street"" since the beginning. ""I met a lot of people who I worked with in New York or got to know in New York -- transplants -- who said to me, 'When I first arrived here in New York, I had this strange desire to find Sesame Street,' "" he said. Well, to paraphrase the famous theme song, who wouldn't want to get to ""Sesame Street""? For two generations, the fictional block of brownstones inhabited by curious children, friendly adults and some odd-looking Muppets has helped shape childhood education by offering exercises, games and life lessons all wrapped up in a television-friendly format. It's a model that's proved durable and influential, says Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson. ""If I were to make a list of the top 10 most significant American TV shows ... I'd put 'Sesame Street' on the list. The fact that it's still on the air attests to its [significance],"" he said.  See ""Sesame Street"" in pictures » . ""The idea they came up with was kind of radical: If you can sell kids sugared cereal and toys using Madison Avenue techniques, why couldn't you use the same techniques for teaching counting, the alphabet and basic social skills? And it works."" Indeed, as Davis notes in ""Street Gang"" (Viking), the genesis of ""Sesame Street"" was when the 3-year-old daughter of a Carnegie foundation executive was fascinated by television, waking up to watch the broadcast day begin and memorizing commercial jingles. He talked about his daughter with a friend, producer Joan Ganz Cooney. In the liberal ferment of the mid-'60s, both wondered whether educational TV could go beyond the staid classroom shows of the era. Cooney became the driving force of ""Sesame Street."" She put together the plan, helped recruit talent, located financing and oversaw production. ""Sesame Street"" became the foundation for the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop), which created other educational shows such as ""The Electric Company"" and ""3-2-1 Contact."" ""She is just such an impressive woman,"" said Davis, adding that Cooney gave her blessing to his book project without any requirements but one: that he ""get it right."" ""She's just one of those extraordinary public figures."" Cooney didn't hold much back in telling her story to Davis, and neither did others. From its debut on November 10, 1969, the show was a hit -- within a year, it was on the cover of Time magazine -- but it was not without its personality clashes. The original Gordon, Matt Robinson, was a producer uncomfortable in the spotlight. Northern Calloway, who played David, struggled with mental illness. The show's primary songwriters, Joe Raposo and Jeff Moss, were constantly in competition; Raposo ""fairly seethed with envy"" when Moss' ""Rubber Duckie"" hit the Top 20, Davis writes. The book provides balanced biographies of a number of principals, including producer Jon Stone, whom Davis calls ""the heart of the book."" ""I wanted people to say, 'Wow, this guy Jon Stone, he really was the Orson Welles of ""Sesame Street."" ' Without him, the show wouldn't have been what it became,"" Davis said. But for all the backstage machinations that affect any creative enterprise, ""Sesame Street"" stayed true to education, in all its forms. One show matter-of-factly included a breast-feeding Buffy Sainte-Marie; others featured a boy with Down syndrome, Jason Kingsley. EW: Stars who dropped by ""Sesame Street"" Jim Henson, who was famous as creator of the Muppets when ""Sesame Street"" began, invented a world of (literally) colorful characters -- Oscar, Big Bird, the Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie -- and, with his puppeteering crew, gave them soul. And when Mr. Hooper (Will Lee) died, the show dealt with his passing honestly. Over the years, the show has taken its knocks. Critics from the left have complained about its merchandising; critics from the right disliked its avowed commitment to diversity. In the '90s, ""Barney"" stole its thunder, and cable drained its audience. As ""Sesame Street"" comes up on its 40th birthday, some critics wonder whether it's still necessary. But for all that, says Thompson, the show remains important, both in its pioneering educational style and in its clever business model. And it takes its charges seriously, he points out. ""One thing I still like about 'Sesame Street' is that it's not artsy,"" he said. For Davis' part, doing the book -- which succeeded a TV Guide article he did on the show's 35th anniversary -- gave him renewed respect for its creators' achievements. And he's found out through his Web site, http://www.streetgangbook.com/, that ""Sesame Street"" still has the magic to move children -- mothers of autistic children credit the show with helping the kids' development -- and adults. ""Somebody said, 'I was OK when my mom explained to me there was no Santa Claus,' "" he recounts. "" 'But I cried my eyes out the day I realized Kermit was a puppet.' Isn't that great?""","""Street Gang"" is a new book that chronicles the history of ""Sesame Street""

"(CNN) -- Singer Rihanna, through her lawyer, asked a judge Thursday not to prohibit her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, from having contact with her while he faces felony charges of assaulting her. Chris Brown attends his arraignment in Los Angeles on Thursday. Attorney Mark Geragos is at right. The judge granted Rihanna's request. Brown, 19, allegedly attacked Rihanna, 21, during an argument in February that began when she found a text message from another woman on his cell phone, according to a sworn police statement. Brown appeared before a judge Thursday on the two felony counts, but his arraignment was delayed until next month at the request of his lawyer. Authorities charged Brown on Thursday with felony counts of assault and making criminal threats, the Los Angeles County, California, District Attorney's Office said. If he is convicted, the sentence could range from probation to four years and eight months in prison, the office said. While Los Angeles County Judge Kristi Lousteau warned Brown ""not to annoy, harass, molest, threaten or use force or violence against anyone,"" Lousteau did not issue a ""no contact"" order that would have kept Brown away from the woman he is accused of beating.  Watch a discussion of the charges -- and Brown's future » . Rihanna's lawyer, Donald Etra, stood near Brown and his lawyer, Mark Geragos, during the brief hearing. Rihanna was not in the courtroom. Referring to the ""no contact"" order that could have been imposed, Etra told reporters after the hearing, ""Rihanna requested that no such order be issued."" Etra said the less stringent protective order against harassment and threats signed by Lousteau was ""more than sufficient in this case."" Etra did not respond when reporters asked if the singer was cooperating with prosecutors in the case against Brown. Brown, dressed in a suit and tie, said little during the hearing, except to answer ""yes"" when the judge asked him if he wished to waive his right to a speedy trial in exchange for a delay in arraignment. He then signed a waiver, which also allows Geragos to appear without him in court for hearings on routine issues. Lousteau ordered Brown to return to court on April 6 for formal arraignment. Court documents released Thursday revealed details about the case against Brown, including a police statement that the incident began when Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, found a text message on Brown's cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- What recession? Christie's, the famed auction house, this week sold a nearly 36-carat diamond for $24.3 million, which it said was the highest price for a diamond sold at auction. The 35.56-carat diamond dates back to the 17th century. The previous record was a mere $16.5 million for a 100-carat diamond in 1995, Christie's said. ""In the midst of these challenging times, we were thrilled to achieve an historic price for an historic diamond,"" said Francois Curiel, chairman of Christie's Europe and auctioneer for Wednesday's sale. The 35.56-carat Wittelsbach blue diamond, dating to the 17th century, was purchased by international jeweler Laurence Graff, the auction house said in a release. Graff was bidding against Aleks Paul of Essex Global Trading, a professional of Russian origin based in New York, Christie's said. ""Known as 'Der Blaue Wittelsbacher' since 1722, it is one of very few diamonds which can claim 17th century heritage, incredible rarity and exceptional beauty."" The diamond, mined in India nearly 400 years ago, has been privately owned since 1964. Until 1723, Christie's said, all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India. The diamond has a royal lineage. Christie's traces it thus: King Philip IV of Spain (1605-1665) selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter, the Infanta Margarita Teresa (1651-1673). She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria (1640-1705), who later became Holy Roman Emperor. When she died in 1673, her husband retained the diamond, which was passed on to his heirs. In 1722, the diamond entered the Wittelsbach family when the Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria (1701-1756) married the Bavarian Crown Prince, Charles Albert (1697-1745). It was worn by successive rulers until the abdication of King Ludwig III (1845-1921) in 1918. The world's largest deep blue diamond is the ""Hope Diamond,"" a 45.52-carat stone housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Diamonds apparently are recession-proof. Christie's reported jewelry sales of $226 million for the first half of 2008, calling it ""the best jewelry season ever seen at auction."" Sales for the first six months of this year marked a 32 percent increase over the same period in 2007, Christie's said. According to Christie's, key diamonds the company sold in the first half of 2008 included a 13.39-carat fancy intense blue diamond that fetched $8.9 million in Geneva on May 14 and the pear-shaped potentially flawless 38-carat Onassis diamond, which sold for $7.1 million on June 11 in London.","Christie's sells nearly 36-carat diamond for $24.3 million .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates has asked Pentagon staff to draw up plans for shutting the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a Pentagon spokesman said. A detainee is seen through a fence in July at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The camp holds about 250 suspected terrorists, down from a peak of roughly 750 men from 40 countries. It houses several top al Qaeda figures, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- the confessed architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Gates ""has asked his team for a proposal on how to shut it down, what would be required specifically to close it and move the detainees from that facility, while at the same time, of course, ensuring that we protect the American people [from] some very dangerous characters,"" Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said Thursday. Morrell described it as a contingency plan in case the new administration wants to take it up early in the new year. President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to close the camp at Guantanamo but hasn't set a specific timetable. Gates will continue as defense secretary when Obama takes office. ""I would like to see it closed,"" Gates told Charlie Rose in a PBS interview. ""And I think it will be a high priority for the new administration."" Officials close to the Obama team said in November that the incoming administration is pondering options, including trying some of the Guantanamo Bay inmates in federal courts, setting up a special national security court to deal with cases involving the most sensitive intelligence information, and releasing some inmates. In an October 31 interview with CNN, Obama said only that he would close the facility ""as quickly as we can do prudently."" ""I am not going to give a time certain because I think what we have to do is evaluate all those who are still being held in Gitmo,"" he said. ""We have to put in place appropriate plans to make sure they are tried, convicted and punished to the full extent of the law, and that's going to require, I think, a review of the existing cases, which I have not had the opportunity to do."" In May, Gates told a Senate committee that efforts to shut down the facility were ""stuck"" over what to do with the inmates.","Camp holds about 250 inmates, down from peak of about 750 .

"(CNN) -- The brutal winter storm that caused havoc from Texas to Maine has paralyzed swaths of Kentucky, where officials are working to cope with what they say is the worst power outage in the state's history. ""We are kind of in a state of emergency. It's pretty bad,"" said iReporter Dwight Stanley of Louisville, Kentucky. Andrew Melnykovych, spokesman for Kentucky's Public Service Commission, said it is ""an indescribable mess everywhere."" Ice storms covered parts of the state Friday, with moderate snowstorms expected to continue into Saturday morning, the National Weather Service said. Temperatures that dipped into the teens on Friday are expected to rise to the upper 30s to lower 40s on Saturday, the weather service said. Larry Holeman, deputy emergency management director of rural Grayson County, called his hard-hit community ""a war zone."" The emergency reflects the challenges faced in states such as Kentucky, where many rural and remote regions struggle to keep warm and dry under dire weather conditions. Nine weather-related deaths have been reported, with two confirmed, said the office of Gov. Steve Beshear. A previously confirmed death has since been found to be unrelated to the weather. In western Louisville, three adults were found dead Friday morning of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator the family brought indoors, Mayor Jerry Abramson said. The deaths prompted authorities to issue a stern warning about the dangers of carbon monoxide. ""We've lost three citizens because people weren't listening to the fire department when they look into the cameras and talk on the radios and say, 'listen up, carbon monoxide kills,' "" Abramson said in a press conference Friday afternoon. ""We can't talk enough about it."" The storm caused the largest power outage in Kentucky's history, with more than 607,000 customers out of power.  Watch residents of Grayson County, Kentucky, try to cope with outage » . But Melnykovych said that while the state is saying 607,000 customers have lost power, he thinks the number is closer to 650,000 because the state figure comes only from utilities it regulates. When Hurricane Ike hit in September, 600,000 customers lost power. Melnykovych said the temperature was around 75 degrees and power outages were more of an ""inconvenience than a life-threatening situation."" iReport.com: Send your wintry weather photos, videos . ""Hurricane Ike didn't have this kind of impact,"" he said. Of the state's 120 counties, 78 have declared emergencies. So have 47 cities, the governor's office said. At least 113 emergency shelters have been opened. Jewel Tomes, who lives in Leitchfield, took shelter at a high school after a complex for the elderly lost power and was ""thrilled to have a place to come to."" ""The high school here was generous, and more than 500 people have been sheltered here, and we have had cots and blankets and three meals a day. And we had medication,"" she said. Around 93,000 customers on 55 water systems remain without access to water because of outages and storm damage.  Photos of storm's impact » . Crews across the state were working to clear roads of snow, ice and trees. A key concern is getting generators to water treatment facilities because of the large number of people without water. The Kentucky National Guard, which has had 620 soldiers on duty, is bolstering to 1,000 the number of soldiers aiding recovery efforts. Three of the battalions are headed to Paducah, Owensboro and Benton in the west and others are headed to other hard-hit spots.

"(CNN) -- Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to redeploy some troops away from the site of a border temple at the center of a tense military standoff in its second week. Thai soldiers take a rest near the Preah Vihear temple in Preah Vihear province. The decision came after the two sides met to resolve the impasse. Government officials from both nations plan to meet again to decide how many troops will remain at the site of the Preah Vihear temple, the Thai News Agency reported Monday. At a later meeting, the two sides plan to discuss how to tackle the thorny issue at the center of the ongoing dispute -- the question of whether land around the temple belongs to Thailand or Cambodia. The 11th century temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia. The decision to redeploy troops took place after a Monday meeting in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Last week, an eight-hour meeting between Thai and Cambodian officials ended with both sides agreeing on only one point: that troops each country has amassed at the site of the temple will not fire on each other. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. This month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the U.N. says has outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985, portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph in the run-up to the general elections. Analysts believe that the nationalist sentiments stirred up by the military standoff helped Hun Sen's ruling party win enough seats in Sunday's parliamentary elections so that it can form a government without the need for a coalition. The current flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claims Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies that, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory.","Cambodia, Thailand to redeploy some troops away from the site of a border temple .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Predatory mice are threatening the albatross population on a remote south Atlantic island and have caused the birds' worst nesting season on record, a British bird charity says. Baby albatross on a remote Atlantic island are threatened by killer house mice. The research from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicates bad news for the Tristan albatross, whose only home is Gough Island in the middle of the south Atlantic. House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said. The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting, one of the world's largest finches, the RSPB said. ""Without removal of the mice, both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction,"" Grahame Madge, a conservation spokesman for the RSPB, told CNN. The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said. This makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds, Madge said. ""What [the mice] are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population,"" he said. Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea, a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish. The albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully, many more get snagged and drown, Madge said. Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction. Gough Island, a British territory almost midway between Argentina and South Africa, is a place of stunning natural beauty. The island is not inhabited by humans. Gough Island and nearby Inaccessible Island are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said. A later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling. ""We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers,"" said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem. ""However, we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record."" The bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks, and may also compete with them for food in the winter, Cuthbert said. ""The decline in bunting numbers is alarming,"" said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s. ""Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time."" The RSPB has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice. It said trials so far look promising, but it urged the British government to step up funding for the project. It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species. The RSPB said it had been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters. Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world. Albatrosses principally live in the southern Atlantic but some also live in the Pacific, the RSPB says. Albatrosses are among the largest flying birds, weighing up to 25 pounds (22.5 kilograms). One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says. The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.","Predatory mice are threatening the albatross population on a south Atlantic island .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Ricardo Montalban, star of the hit TV series ""Fantasy Island,"" died Wednesday in Los Angeles, a family spokesman said. Ricardo Montalban attends the opening of a theater named for him in 2004 in Hollywood, California. Montalban, 88, was in deteriorating health over the past several days but ""died peacefully"" at 6:30 a.m. at his home, son-in-law Gilbert Smith said. He understood ""it was his time,"" Smith said. The cause of death was not given. Montalban rose to prominence as one of the most visible Hispanic actors in post-war Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. But his star grew as he took on television roles as the mysterious host Mr. Roarke on the hit drama ""Fantasy Island"" and as Captain Kirk's archnemesis Khan Noonien Singh in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" Born in Mexico City, Mexico, on November 25, 1920, Montalban knew at an early age that he wanted to be an actor. He moved to Hollywood as a teenager, and his first big break came when he was cast in a small part in a 1941 play, Tallulah Bankhead's ""Her Cardboard Lover."" After starring in 13 Spanish-language films in Mexico, Montalban made his American feature film debut in 1947 in ""Fiesta."" Montalban became a member of the MGM stable and was often cast in the role of the steamy Latin lover opposite such female stars as Lana Turner and Esther Williams. While working on ""Across the Wide Missouri"" with MGM's biggest star, Clark Gable, Montalban suffered an injury to his spinal cord that, despite surgery, would plague him for decades to come, according to Turner Classic Movies. It was during this early stage in his career that Montalban dedicated himself to changing Hollywood's stereotypes of Latinos. ""When I first came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer under contract in 1945, that's when the image was at its worst,"" Montalban said. ""They didn't realize that by trying to be colorful, they were very insulting."" Montalban played a wide range of film roles over the years, often relishing the chance to play in comedies. As he approached midlife in the 1960s, Montalban made numerous guest appearances on television shows including ""The Untouchables"" and ""The Lieutenant,"" eventually landing a recurring role as Damon West on the popular medical drama ""Dr. Kildare."" During this period, Montalban secured his place in science-fiction history playing the evil but charismatic Khan in the first season of ""Star Trek."" Montalban's dignified demeanor and rich accent added flair to the small screen on a number of television shows. It also established him as a popular pitchman for Maxwell House Coffee and Chrysler. It was the role of the wise and benevolent Mr. Roarke on the 1970's hit TV series ""Fantasy Island"" that perhaps earned Montalban his greatest number of fans, something he called ""very rewarding."" iReport.com: Share your memories of Montalban . But he said he tired of hearing fans shouting ""Zee plane, zee plane"" when they saw him. The line was featured in the show's opening credits by another character, Tattoo. ""They think they are the only ones that thought of saying that,"" he told CNN during the 1990s. ""People mean well, but the joke gets a little tired at times."" Montalban never tired of fighting for the rights of Latinos in Hollywood. For almost 20 years, he served as president of Nosotros, an organization he founded for the advancement of Hispanics in the entertainment industry. ""The ideals of Nosotros continue. As our community of Latinos in show business increases, so will our participation in all of the many aspects of our industry,"" he said in 1987.","Montalban's health was deteriorating, but he ""died peacefully"" in his home .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was an understated gesture, but one that reverberated around the footballing world. Seville forward Frederic Kanoute reveals a pro-Gaza T-shirt after scoring against Deportivio La Coruna. When Frederic Kanoute scored for Seville against Deportivo La Coruna last week in the Copa del Rey he slowly lifted his jersey and revealed a black shirt embossed with the word 'Palestine' in various languages. Within a few seconds it was gone but by then Kanoute, a French-born Muslim who plays for Mali, had made his political point. It earned him a booking for lifting his shirt and, later, a €3,000 ($4,000) fine for breaking article 120 of the Spanish FA's rule book which states that ""revealing messages of a religious or political nature on the pitch is strictly prohibited during the time of play.""  See images of footballer's political protests » . Yet for many in the Arab world, Kanoute's gesture made him something of a hero. Bloggers buzzed with praise for the striker, whilst the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Spain was quick to thank Kanoute for his support. ""[Kanoute] has shown himself to be very brave by supporting our region in a public act like he did,"" Mahmud Aluanen, a spokesman for the mission, told Radio Marca. Should football and politics mix? Tell us what you think. ""Sportsmen are human beings, and they cannot hide their feelings. They have all the right in the world to express their opinions in areas that question human rights. I am sure that all Palestinian children, who love Spanish football, will be moved by this gesture."" High profile players like Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto'o also lined up to praise Kanoute's actions, according to Spanish newspaper Marca. Footballers have always made political gestures. During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Yugoslav players plying their trade in Europe's top leagues organized a series of symbolic protests, the most famous being Lazio's Sinisa Mihajlovic who wore a T-shirt saying 'Peace, not war.' However, it's not just international politics that gets footballers going, as Liverpool FC player Robbie Fowler proved when he revealed a T-shirt that supported striking dock workers during a game in 1997. FIFA has campaigned long and hard to try and remove overt political gestures from football, suspending national football associations when their internal politics impinge on the game whilst strongly disapproving of actions on the field of play that may harm football's impartiality. There are plenty of other forums, they argue, for players to air their political views rather than on the pitch. What do you think? Should footballers be free to make political statements on the pitch? Should politics and sport be kept separate? Or is the commonly used maxim that 'football and politics don't mix' a fallacy?","Seville striker Kanoute launches pro-Gaza T-shirt protest after scoring a goal.

"(CNN) -- Sonic booms and at least one fireball in the sky were reported in Texas on Sunday, less than a week after two satellites collided in space and a day after the Federal Aviation Administration asked U.S. pilots to watch for ""falling space debris,"" authorities said. Video captured in Austin, Texas, shows a meteor-like object in the sky Sunday morning. There were no reports of ground strikes or interference with aircraft in flight, FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said. Herwig told CNN the FAA received no reports from pilots in the air of any sightings but the agency recieved ""numerous"" calls from people on the ground from Dallas, Texas, south to Austin, Texas. Video shot by a photographer from News 8 TV in Austin showed what appeared to be a meteor-like white fireball blazing across a clear blue sky Sunday morning. The photographer caught the incident while covering a marathon in Austin. On Saturday, the FAA told pilots through its routine notification system that ""a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the earth's atmosphere."" The notice did not specify a time or location.  Watch video of meteor-like fireball » . Herwig said most of the reports the FAA received came in about midday Sunday in an area of Texas from Dallas south to Austin. iReport.com: Did you see the fireball? Send photos, video . He said he was not certain where the information that sparked the FAA notification came from, but it was ""probably from NORAD,"" or the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which tracks man-made objects in space. Calls to NORAD headquarters in Colorado were not immediately returned. Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said her agency had received calls from residents surprised by sonic booms about 11 a.m. She said calls came from an area from Dallas to Houston. Last week, the Russian and U.S. space agencies said two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided about 496 miles (800 kilometers) above Siberia, Russia. The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds, NASA said. The satellites collided at 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) per second, producing 500 to 600 pieces of space debris, the U.S. Strategic Command said.

"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has added his brother-in-law to a military board in a move analysts say paves the way for an heir, according to South Korea's state-sponsored Yonhap news agency. Kim Jong-il has named his brother-in-law Jang Song Thaek to a top military board. The addition of his kin to the powerful National Defense Commission also solidifies his standing, Yonhap said. Kim was reappointed Thursday as chairman of the military board in his first major public appearance since a reported stroke in August. His brother-in-law, Jang Song Thaek, is considered his right-hand man, according to Yonhap. Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, currently serves as a director of the Workers' Party, Yonhap said. ""Kim wants to keep the military in check and secure loyalty to both the military and the party,"" Cha Doo-hyeogn, a North Korea expert, told Yonhap. Kim also increased the number of members in the military agency to 13, from eight, Yonhap said. ""Overall, the power of the National Defense Commission was strengthened,"" Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Ho-nyoun, told Yonhap in a briefing. There were no other major changes in the new parliament, which signifies that Kim, 67, is prepared to maintain the status quo as he readies someone to take over from him, analysts told Yonhap. Kim's recent health problems and long absence from public functions have prompted speculation on whether he is ready to groom an heir to the world's only communist dynasty. But the secretive nation shields its internal affairs from international scrutiny. Analysts told Yonhap that Jang may serve as caretaker for Kim's successor, who will possibly be one of his three sons.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-il added his brother-in-law to a military board .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Russia were absent Wednesday as representatives from countries from around the world gathered to sign a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs. French troops examine cluster bombs collected after the Lebanon conflict of 2006. Some 111 countries were due to adopt the Convention on Cluster Munitions at an all-day signing ceremony in Oslo, Norway. But four of the biggest cluster bomb makers -- Russia, China, Israel and the United States, which claims the devices are a vital part of its defense strategy, stayed away. Cluster Munition Coalition activists behind the agreement expressed disappointment at the absence of the big four, but insisted it wouldn't undermine the treaty as it passes into international law. ""Obviously it's very disappointing that those countries aren't here, but at the same time, the strong message that this treaty sends will make it very clear to those countries that these are unacceptable weapons and inappropriate in future conflicts,"" CMC Co-Chair Richard Moyes told CNN from Oslo. ""The treaty and the stigma that it builds will make it practically and politically much more difficult for them to use these weapons again in the future,"" Moyes added about the absent countries. ""Many of their partners will no longer be allowed to use these weapons, and clearly recognize these weapons as far too costly in humanitarian terms."" Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are described by the International Committee of the Red Cross as a ""persistent humanitarian problem."" Most of a device's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Credible estimates show the weapons fail between 10 and 40 percent of the time, leaving civilians at risk of harm from unexploded ordnance, the ICRC says. In addition to calling for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, the Oslo accord calls for strong standards to protect those injured. It urges that contaminated areas be cleaned up quickly and weapons immediately destroyed, the CMC said. The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, said Thomas Nash, coordinator of the Cluster Munition Coalition. Earlier this year, a U.S. State Department representative called it ""an absolute moral obligation"" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after battle, but the insists cluster munitions are an important part of its defense strategy that can be regulated post-conflict. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the ICRC. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting ""no-go"" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later.","United States, Russia absent from signing of cluster bomb ban treaty signing .

"(CNN) -- French fishermen suspended their blockade at three English Channel ports Thursday, allowing ferry traffic and freight to move through after two days of disruption, union leaders said. French fishing boats blockade the port of Boulogne. The French ports of Calais, Dunkirk and Boulogne were open again after French unions met Thursday and agreed to stop the blockade. Union leaders have yet to agree on how the rest of their protest will develop, and whether the suspension will become permanent. The fishermen began their blockade of the three ports Tuesday to protest European Union fishing quotas, which they say threaten their livelihoods. The flotillas forced a halt to all cross-Channel traffic, including passenger ferries and freighters, stranding tourists on both sides of the waterway and causing a backlog of freight trucks. P&O, the largest ferry operator on the Channel, said it had resumed running normal services to Calais. ""It is our hope that we'll be able to continue doing that throughout the day,"" spokeswoman Michelle Ulyatt said. LD Ferries, which operates services to Boulogne, said it had canceled four sailings Thursday as a result of the dispute. ""We do not yet have any information on whether any of our services will be affected beyond 16th April,"" the company said in a statement. French fishermen held four hours of talks with Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Michel Barnier in Paris on Wednesday, the French news agency Agence France-Press reported. Barnier offered the local industry €4 million ($5.3 million) in aid, but refused to budge on the fishermen's key demand that the European Union increase fishing quotas, AFP reported. Both France and the European Union have ruled out any renegotiation, pointing out that French cod quotas have already been raised 30 percent since 2008, AFP said.","French fishermen lift port blockades at Calais, Dunkirk and Boulogne .

"(CNN) -- I wanted to believe the man in front of me wasn't a rapist. I knew he was a former Sudanese soldier, I knew he wanted to talk about rape in Darfur. A humanitarian group working on Darfur issues had introduced him to us. They told us his testimony was important to hear. A woman left homeless by conflict in Darfur walks along railway tracks. Last year in Darfur aid workers told me children as young as five were being raped in the huge displacement camps that are home to several million Darfuris. In some camps, they told me, rape had become so common that as many as 20 babies a month born from rape were being abandoned. As I sat inches from Adam --not his real name -- I feared the revulsion I knew I would feel at my own questions as I asked about rape and his involvement. I have interviewed rape survivors in Darfur. I have two daughters. I am a human being with a conscience. It would be hard to listen to his replies. He told me he was conscripted by force in to the Sudanese army in the summer of 2002. He thought he was being taken for six months' national service and then would be released. The conversation was slow going at first. We were both holding off from delving into the sordid details he'd come to discuss. His answers were short, he told me he got no pay from the army, only food and drink. He said he was rounded up in an army truck from a market in Darfur and trained to kill. He said he was armed with Kalashnikovs and told to ""shoot targets.""  Watch ex-soldier describe brutal attacks on children to Nic Robertson » . Then, he says, his officers told him ""we will be taken to a patrol and then soon after that we were asked to join other people to go and burn and kill people"". That's when he says he realized he wasn't getting national service training, that in fact, he was being forced into war against his will, with his own people. ""They are black,"" he told me, noting the difference between the lighter skinned rulers of Sudan and the darker farmers of Darfur. ""I am black,"" he said, ""this shouldn't be happening."" But, he said, worse than being told to kill his own people, was that if he tried to resist, he himself would be killed. ""The order is that the soldiers at the front, and there are some people who are watching you from behind, if you try to escape or do anything you will get shot. The order is that we go to the village, burn it and kill the people."" It felt as Adam was beginning to open up a little -- not easy, given the topic, and the lights and cameras all around us. He was beginning to talk a bit more, answer questions with more than one or two words. But it was following a pattern: I'd have to lead the way. We were both waiting for the inevitable. How he came to know of rape in Darfur. And that's when he said it.  Watch warrant being issued for president » . He brought up the rape by himself. He was talking through a translator but his voice was quiet. I thought I heard anger, heard him slow and his voice drop: ""I had no choice,"" he said ""but I will say that I didn't kill anybody but the raping of the small children, it was bad"" I knew this was going to be difficult and now it had begun. What happens with the children, I asked. ""They cry out,"" he answered. ""And what happens when they cry out?"" ""Two persons will capture her while she is crying and another raping her, then they leave her there,"" came his reply. Silence. ""What do I ask now?"" I thought. Be forensic. Get the story. This is important testimony, I reminded myself. And so we continued, Adam describing in detail how soldiers raped girls as young as 12. How officers ordered them to do this to make people flee their villages, run away and never come back. Through all of this, Adam didn't once mention whether he actually had been directly involved in the raping. He said he tried to desert the army as soon as he could, but was caught and tortured. He showed me the scars where he said he was tied down beneath a tree and officers set fire to tires above him, dripping burning rubber on his body. Eventually, he said, he did get away, went to his sisters, tried joining the rebels to fight the army. But even there, his troubles were far from over. Incredibly, he said, the rebels didn't trust him; he was kept at their camp and only escaped when it was bombed by the army. The end of his story, but we weren't really done. One more question. Had he been forced to rape children? ""Yes I did, they were government orders,"" came his reply. How many? ""Well it didn't feel like raping, I was feeling very bad but as I was ordered, I had to do something. What I did was take off my trousers and lay myself on top of the girl but I didn't feel like raping, so I lay there for about 15 minutes."" I want to be sure I understand him. ""So you didn't actually penetrate the girls?"" I ask. No, he says, ""because I had no feeling for it, my penis didn't actually wake up, so there was no actual penetration,"" he replied. There were other people in the room, the translator, a cameraman, our producer Jonathan Wald, but I had forgotten they were there. My thoughts were entirely locked on Adam. What more could I ask? I was emotionally drained. There was no way of knowing whether he was telling me the truth. Only in the measure of his voice was there a clue. Here, sitting on an office chair, thousands of miles away from Darfur, the memories come flooding back. The many, traumatized women and children we've interviewed, distraught families, unable to protect themselves. The pain we put them through, to recount, to relive, their nightmares. Each time, I've asked myself can I justify the suffering these questions cause? Each time, I tell myself it is only their own accounts that can cast light on the darkened corner of humanity they inhabit. Only their own accounts that can help break their cycle of suffering. Time and again, though, it seems telling the world their stories has little tangible impact on their reality of their lives. And now I'm face-to-face with a man who says he was part of the suffering, albeit by his own account not complicit and not guilty. I am left with the thought perhaps Adam's words carry even greater power. If his story is true -- and it mirrors other accounts emerging from Darfur -- then it implicates the government in these terrible crimes. He says he has trouble sleeping at nights. I can understand why. He is not alone. Aid workers say millions of women in Darfur not only have trouble sleeping at nights, but live in fear of rape 24 hours a day.","Former soldier says he was armed with a Kalashnikov and told to kill .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- From a distance, it looks like an apparition: a huge multi-colored hot-air balloon floating in the Baghdad sky, bearing a large poster of Jesus Christ. Below it, an Iraqi flag. Santa and his helpers stand under palm trees at Baghdad's first public Christmas festival. Welcome to the first-ever public Christmas celebration in Baghdad, held Saturday and sponsored by the Iraqi Interior Ministry. Once thought to be infiltrated by death squads, the Ministry now is trying to root out sectarian violence -- as well as improve its P.R. image. The event takes place in a public park in eastern Baghdad, ringed with security checkpoints. Interior Ministry forces deployed on surrounding rooftops peer down at the scene: a Christmas tree decorated with ornaments and tinsel; a red-costumed Santa Claus waving to the crowd, an Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders; a red-and-black-uniformed military band playing stirring martial music, not Christmas carols. On a large stage, children dressed in costumes representing Iraq's many ethnic and religious groups -- Kurds, Turkmen, Yazidis, Christians, Arab Muslims not defined as Sunni or Shiite -- hold their hands aloft and sing ""We are building Iraq!"" Two young boys, a mini-policeman and a mini-soldier sporting painted-on mustaches, march stiffly and salute.  Watch the celebration in Baghdad » . Even before I can ask Interior Ministry spokesman Major-General Abdul Karim Khalaf a question, he greets me with a big smile. ""All Iraqis are Christian today!"" he says. Khalaf says sectarian and ethnic violence killed thousands of Iraqis. ""Now that we have crossed that hurdle and destroyed the incubators of terrorism,"" he says, ""and the security situation is good, we have to go back and strengthen community ties."" In spite of his claim, the spokesman is surrounded by heavy security. Yet this celebration shows that the security situation in Baghdad is improving. Many of the people attending the Christmas celebration appear to be Muslims, with women wearing head scarves. Suad Mahmoud, holding her 16-month-old daughter, Sara, tells me she is indeed Muslim, but she's very happy to be here. ""My mother's birthday also is this month, so we celebrate all occasions,"" she says, ""especially in this lovely month of Christmas and New Year."" Father Saad Sirop Hanna, a Chaldean Christian priest, is here too. He was kidnapped by militants in 2006 and held for 28 days. He knows firsthand how difficult the lot of Christians in Iraq is but, he tells me, ""We are just attesting that things are changing in Baghdad, slowly, but we hope that this change actually is real. We will wait for the future to tell us the truth about this."" He just returned from Rome. ""I came back to Iraq because I believe that we can live here,"" he says. ""I have so many [Muslim] friends and we are so happy they started to think about things from another point of view and we want to help them."" The Christmas celebration has tables loaded with cookies and cakes. Families fill plates and chat in the warm winter sun. Santa balloons hang from trees. An artist uses oil paint to create a portrait of Jesus. In the middle of the park there's an art exhibit, the creation of 11- and 12-year-olds: six displays, each about three feet wide, constructed of cardboard and Styrofoam, filled with tiny dolls dressed like ordinary people, along with model soldiers and police. They look like model movie sets depicting everyday life in Baghdad. Afnan, 12 years old, shows me her model called ""Arresting the Terrorists."" ""These are the terrorists,"" she tells me. ""They were trying to blow up the school."" In the middle of the street a dead ""terrorist"" sprawls on the asphalt, his bloody arm torn from his body by an explosion. Afnan tells me she used red nail polish to paint the blood. A little plastic dog stands nearby. ""What is he doing?"" I ask. ""He looks for terrorists and searches for weapons and explosives,"" Afnan says. Her mother, the children's art teacher, Raja, shows me another child's display called ""Baghdad Today."" ""This is a wedding,"" Raja explains. ""Despite the terrorism, our celebrations still go ahead. This is a park, families enjoying time. And this is a market where people go shopping without fear of bombings. This is a mosque where people can pray with no fear."" In the middle is a black mound that looks like a body bag. Policemen and Interior Ministry forces surround it. ""This is terrorism,"" she tells me. ""We killed it and destroyed it, and our lives went back to normal."" A Christmas tale perhaps, I think, but one that many Iraqis hope will come true.","Iraq's first public Christmas party decorated with Jesus, Santa, Christmas tree .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- After heated arguments, the Iraqi parliament turned down the first draft of a bill Saturday that would have allowed foreign troops, including British forces, to remain in Iraq after the U.N. mandate expires on December 31. A British soldier attends an Iraqi army training session Thursday in Iraq's Basra province. Kurdish legislator Mahmoud Othman said the measure was sent back to Iraqi Cabinet members for reworking before resubmitting it to lawmakers. There is no parliamentary deadline for the measure to pass. The bill does not apply to U.S. troops because the United States last month reached a Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government that calls for American troops to leave Iraqi cities by June 2009, and to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. But after December 31 other foreign troops would not be authorized to remain in Iraq. This could cause a problem for Britain, which has the second-largest number of troops in Iraq after the United States. Britain was the leading U.S. ally during the invasion of Iraq and still has about 4,000 troops based outside the southern city of Basra. Five other nations -- Albania, Australia, El Salvador, Estonia and Romania -- have a total of fewer than 2,000 troops Iraq, according to the Multi-National Force-Iraq Web site. British troops will begin leaving Iraq in May 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a joint statement with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki during a visit to Iraq on Wednesday.

"KINGLAKE, Australia (CNN) -- Two men, who were arrested Thursday in connection with the deadly wildfires that have swept through southeastern Australia, were released without being charged, police said. Bushfires have destroyed huge tracts of the Australian countryside. Victoria state police had told CNN that the two -- who had been taken into custody and were ""assisting"" police earlier -- had been behaving suspiciously in or near Marysville, a town where roughly 100 people have died in the fires. It was not immediately clear what the behavior was or why the men were released. Meanwhile, authorities said they fear the death toll from the fires, which sat at 181 on Wednesday, could reach as high as 300. Authorities are basing that figure on the number of people who remain missing and the number of homes that have been destroyed. Rescue workers have not been able to thoroughly investigate many of those homes because of the intense heat. Firefighters have battled blazes since Saturday -- including several new fires that broke out Tuesday night and which officials say almost certainly were the result of arson. About 35 separate fires continued burning Thursday morning, authorities said. But none of those blazes posed an immediate threat to villages and their intensity had lessened, according to police. Authorities were saying Wednesday that more than 500 people have been injured, nearly 1,000 homes destroyed, thousands left homeless and at least 365,000 hectares (901,935 acres) of the Australian countryside burned black.  See a map of the area » . Those numbers were expected to continue to rise Thursday. Arson is thought responsible for all the destruction in the towns of Marysville and Kinglake.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If your organization has the right stuff, it could display one of the U.S. shuttles that NASA plans to retire from service in 2010. Space Shuttle Endeavour comes in for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California last month. The space agency sent a notice this week to museums, schools and similar institutions to gauge their interest and qualifications for properly housing Discovery, Atlantis or Endeavour. The shuttles are to be retired by September 30, 2010, but they won't be available until about a year later, NASA spokesman Michael Curie said Thursday. ""These are national assets, national treasures and something that NASA feels the public would want to see displayed publicly for years to come,"" Curie said. Space shuttle Discovery already has been offered to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. ""We have the information, and of course, we're thrilled to be considered for this artifact,"" said Claire Brown, director of communications for the museum. But no action has been taken at this point, and the institution doesn't have a plan for incurring the cost, she added. The privilege of showing off a shuttle won't be cheap -- about $42 million. This figure will include $28.2 million for the removal of hazardous chemicals -- such as ammonia, used as a coolant, and nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine, used as fuel; $5.8 million for moving the shuttle via a carrier aircraft to its new location; and $8 million for preparing the shuttle for display, Curie said. A carrier aircraft will be the only way to deliver a shuttle to a landlocked location, and such aircraft will no longer be in NASA's budget once the shuttle program ends. After chemicals are drained from the shuttle, its estimated weight will be about 170,000 pounds, Curie said. Whatever facility receives a shuttle must have experience in displaying space hardware and major historical artifacts, NASA said. The shuttles will be released without their engines, which, along with other components, will be offered separately. The deadline for responding to NASA is March 17. NASA emphasizes that it will pay special attention to ensuring that the shuttles will retire to ""appropriate places."" The agency wants them to remain in the United States, and private collectors likely would not meet NASA's goal to have the orbiters and engines displayed publicly, Curie said. ""We really feel that these are artifacts that are important to the history of the country and that as many people as possible should have the opportunity to see them if they can,"" Curie said. Asked whether NASA had considered trying to sell the shuttles on eBay, he laughed: ""No, that probably wouldn't be the prudent thing to do with something paid for by taxpayers' money."" In January 2004, President Bush called for an eventual shift in focus from the space shuttle program to the new Vision for Space Exploration program, which NASA describes as ""a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system."" Bush has said he wants astronauts to return to the moon by 2020. However, President-elect Barack Obama has a team reviewing options for the direction of space exploration. CNN's A. Pawlowski contributed to this report.","NASA gauges interest of museums and schools for properly housing shuttles .

What's unusual is Ahmad's matchmaker wears a turban, a robe and could be the first-ever Iranian cleric who plays cupid. ""First they say 'wow',"" Jafar Ardabili said, ""then they take a closer look and say 'since he's a cleric we have faith in him.'"" Ardabili made his first love match 10 years ago while he taught at a Tehran university. One of his students had a crush on a person, so Ardabili arranged for the two to meet.

The set-up worked so well that Ardabili and his wife opened the Amin International Family and Cultural Institute, a service that matched Iranian singles in a supervised setting. In Iran, Islamic law restricts social interaction. ""You can't just go after someone in public and say would you like to live with me?"" Ardabili said.

Ahmad would love nothing more than one of those women to choose him. On a Thursday morning he anxiously sat in the institute's waiting room. Ardabili had arranged for Ahmad to meet a young lady. Could she be the one? Ahmad had paid a $100 fee, submitted a picture and his information. In return he has access to thousands of other applicants. Once applicants approve of one another's pictures and profiles Ardabili arranges up to two meetings inside his office. After each meeting, the applicants report back to Ardabili.

The area was also a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. In recent months, however, militants have unleashed a wave of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives across the North West Frontier Province. The militants want to require veils for women, beards for men and ban music and television. The fighting has displaced nearly half of Swat's population, officials said. The central government has long exerted little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out militants. As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly bombings, beheadings and kidnappings -- and said the attacks will continue until the troops pull out. On Saturday, the government of the province said it had reached a deal with the Taliban for a permanent cease-fire. It marked a major concession by the Pakistani government in its attempt to hold off Taliban militants.

"(CNN)  -- A 23-year-old Mexican beauty queen and seven men were taken into custody late Monday after being found in vehicles containing weapons and cash in central Mexico, police said Tuesday. Laura Zuniga and seven men were found in vehicles with guns and $50,000, Mexican police say. Laura Zuniga and the men were traveling in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles, handguns, cartridges and $50,000 in cash, said Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco, secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco. The eight were stopped in Zapopan, outside Guadalajara, and will face arms charges and an investigation by a federal organized crime team, Najera said. Police, who had received a tip that a group of armed men were in a home, ""detected"" the vehicles as they were traveling to investigate the call, Najera said. One of the men in the vehicles was 29-year-old Angel Orlando Garcia Urquiza, who is Zuniga's boyfriend and the brother of ""one of the greatest capos of narcotraffic,"" Najera said.

"(CNN) -- Critics took to the social networking site Facebook to voice their fury over Pope Benedict's remark that condoms do not prevent HIV. Pope Benedict XVI's anti-condom comments have raised the ire of some Facebook users. Thousands have pledged to send the pontiff millions of condoms to protest the controversial comment he made to journalists as he flew to Cameroon last week. ""You can't resolve it with the distribution of condoms,"" the pope told reporters. ""On the contrary, it increases the problem."" Pope Benedict XVI has made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception. The Vatican has long opposed the use of condoms and other forms of birth control and encourages sexual abstinence to fight the spread of the disease. About a dozen Facebook groups have sprung up, mostly from European countries, criticizing the pontiff. ""The clergy aren't supposed to have sex at all, but they are free to tell people how to conduct themselves? That's like a girl who wears no make-up as the CEO of CoverGirl,"" one member posted on the page, ""Condoms for Pope Benedict XVI."" ""It frightens me that a man who has devoted his life to moral guidance ... and is undeniably a learned, intelligent man can be at the same time so narrow-minded, bigoted and irresponsible,"" posted another person on a different page. The online campaign added another voice to a deluge of criticism, which includes the governments of France, Germany and Belgium. Aid agencies and other health organizations have also chimed in. The Lancet, a British medical journal, urged the pope Saturday to issue a retraction for the ""outrageous and wildly inaccurate"" statement to journalists aboard his plane. ""When any influential person, be it a religious or political leader, makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people, they should retract or correct the public record,"" The Lancet said in an editorial. ""Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates, including many thousands of Catholics, who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS worldwide."" Some in the Catholic Church have rallied to the pontiff's support. Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, head of the Italian Bishops Conference, told Times Online in Britain that Benedict was simply pointing out that condoms ""had not solved and could not solve the AIDS problem."" Despite the controversy, the pope's pilgrimage spurred excitement in Africa. An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear him preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his trip. He spoke of the need for reconciliation in the country, which has endured a brutal civil war. ""Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure,"" he said.","Facebook users plan to send condoms to Pope Benedict XVI .

Watch footage of the eight arrested and weapons seized » . They were transported in a heavily armed 30-vehicle convoy late Tuesday to Guadalajara International Airport and flown to Mexico City, the official Notimex news agency reported. The federal organized crime team in Mexico City will investigate, and the suspects will face arms charges, Najera said. Zuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity. In July, she won the title Our Sinaloa Beauty. That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Our Mexico Beauty in Monterrey, where she won ""The Election of the Queens,"" one of five special recognitions, and came in third overall. In October, she won the title ""Hispanoamerican Queen 2008"" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Mexican newscasts referred to her Wednesday as ""Miss Pistols"" and likened her situation to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" According to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site, she is to represent Mexico in next year's Miss International contest. A statement issued Wednesday by Lupita Jones, director of Our Mexico Beauty, said the organization will wait to see what happens in the legal system.

"(CNN)  -- Congolese rebels seized a major military camp and a spacious gorilla park in a renewed bout of heavy fighting that sent thousands fleeing, according to the United Nations and park officials. Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga Park, which was taken over Sunday by rebels fighting army forces. The fighting comes after a tenuous week-old U.N. brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces fell apart Sunday. Fighting between the rebels under renegade Gen. Laurent Nkunda and Congolese army regulars in the eastern province of North Kivu of the Democratic Republic of the Congo displaced thousands of civilians, according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux. The rebels also seized the headquarters of Virunga National Park in eastern Congo after intense fighting with the Congolese army, according to a statement by park officials. The rebels have used Virunga Park as a base but have never seized its headquarters before. The 3,000 square mile (7,800 square kilometer) park has a gorilla facility and is home to 200 of the 700 endangered mountain gorillas in existence. ""Over 50 rangers were forced to flee into the forests and abandon the park station, in fear of their lives,"" the park statement said. ""They have seized the entire gigantic infrastructure [of the park headquarters] which is stategically very close to the main road heading north into Goma,"" said park spokeswoman Samantha Newport by phone from Goma, about 40 kilometers from the fighting. ""The situation is eastern Congo is very dangerous,"" she said. ""It's the first time they've [rebels] ever had the audacity"" to take over the park.   Watch as park ranger describes the violence as it explodes behind him » . Newport said the rebels have set up roadblocks so the rangers are making their way through woods south to safety. She said the gorillas and other wildlife in the park are in danger of getting caught in the crossfire. A park ranger described the takeover. ""When the rebels started approaching the park station we thought we were all going to be killed,"" said Park Ranger Bareke Sekibibi, 29, who spoke by cell phone from the forest earlier as he fled, according to the park statement. "" We are not military combatants, we are park rangers protecting Virunga's wildlife."" Although the civil war in the Congo officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and rebels has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes . The conflict and humanitarian crisis in Congo have taken the lives of some 5.4 million people since 1998, and that 45,000 people continue to die there every month, according to an International Rescue Committee report in January.","Congolese rebels seize military camp and Virunga Park's gorilla sanctuary .

"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (CNN) -- Hundreds of Christians packed the Church of the Nativity on Thursday for a midnight Mass in what is thought to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ. A worshipper touches a star at the point where tradition says Jesus Christ was born in the Church of Nativity. The standing-room-only service included singing and organ music. There were also large crowds outside the church, one of the most sacred places in Christianity. So many people had flocked to the area this Christmas season that there were no rooms left at the inns and hotels in Bethlehem. Some took this as a sign that tourism in Bethlehem was on the upswing. Christmas is the one time of year when the West Bank's small, shrinking Christian communities show everyone else that they are still there. Before the midnight Mass, Palestinian scout groups representing Christians throughout the West Bank did as they always do on this day -- they marched, banging their drums loudly and, in a way, trying to make a point.  Watch Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations » . The drumbeat has been heard by more and more people, locals say, as tourism has skyrocketed this year. ""This year, tourism is much better than last year -- we reached 1,250,000,"" said Victor Batarseh, the mayor of Bethlehem. ""All our hotels are full around Christmastime. We have 30,000 tourists coming in."" Tourists in record numbers were on hand this year, braving an unusually cold, gray and windy day to watch the parade of drums and holiday songs. ""It's kind of neat to see it in the Middle East, and they're playing Christmas carols and the songs we know,"" said one American tourist. ""I'm loving it, it's just been an incredible atmosphere and just a wonderful learning experience,"" said another. The Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem also came to the birthplace of Jesus, as he does every Christmas Eve, allowed through normally tightly shut gates by Israeli troops. The heavy security is a testament to ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. ""My Christmas wish is that we will have real peace, based on justice and freedom,"" said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian parliament member. ""My Christmas wish is that the justice that Jesus Christ gave his life for will happen sometime in his birthplace in Palestine.""

"(CNN)  -- The long-running Carlos Tevez affair was finally brought to a close on Monday as West Ham and Sheffield United reached an out-of-court settlement. Tevez scored a crucial winning goal at Manchester United on last day of the 2006-07 season. West Ham will be paying  United an undisclosed compensation fee to settle the dispute, meaning an independent tribunal chaired Lord Griffiths will not reconvene to rule on the controversy. A statement from Blades chairman Kevin McCabe and West Ham chief executive Scott Duxbury released to the Press Association said: ""Both clubs are pleased to announce that a satisfactory settlement for compensation has been reached which brings the dispute between Sheffield United and West Ham to an end. ""The tribunal will not be resuming."" The Tevez controversy began in 2006 when the Argentina international and his fellow-countryman Javier Mascherano were signed by West Ham under third party ownership deals which contravened Premier League rules. Mascherano was later loaned to Liverpool, but Tevez stayed at Upton Park and played a crucial role as West Ham narrowly avoided relegation. He scored the winning goal as the Hammers beat Manchester United on the last day of the season to send Sheffield United down. Tevez later joined Premier League champions Manchester United, but the row lingered on with Sheffield United continuing to insist that West Ham had gained an unfair advantage. The affair has sparked three separate inquiries, the first of which led to a $8 million fine for West Ham, but crucially no points deduction. But United refused to give up and in September 2008 an independent arbitration ruled in their favor in a claim for compensation from West Ham. The Premier League and the Football Association promptly announced another fresh inquiry, but the out-of court settlement looks set to bring the affair to an amicable conclusion. West Ham, whose Icelandic owner Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson has been hard hit by the global economic downturn, were reported by Sky Sports News to be paying the compensation fee, which could rise to $35 million, in installments. The money will certainly be welcomed by Sheffield United, who are pressing for promotion from the Championship to the Premier League. ""We are two clubs with a fantastic footballing history who now want to move on and focus on the business of playing football -- hopefully for us against the Hammers in the Premier League next season,"" said McCabe.","Carlos Tevez now starring for Premier League champions Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen thoroughbred horses dropped dead in a mysterious scene Sunday before a polo match near West Palm Beach, Florida, officials said. Teams are trying to figure out what happened at the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida. State and local veterinary teams are trying to figure out what happened at the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida, as team Lechuza Caracas prepared to compete in a U.S. Open match. Two horses initially collapsed, and as vets and team officials scrambled to revive them, five others became dizzy, said Tim O'Connor, spokesman for the polo club. ""A total of seven died on our property,"" O'Connor told CNN. Seven other horses died en route to a Wellington horse farm and a veterinary hospital. The cause of the deaths has not been determined, and necropsies and blood tests were underway, he said. O'Connor said each team brings between 40 to 60 horses for matches, and they are continuously switched out throughout a match to keep the horses from overexerting themselves. A meeting will be held to determine whether Lechuza Caracas will compete at a later date, he said. ""Everybody is kind of in shock and trying to figure out what happened,"" he said.

"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album. He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star. Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music. His new record is ""Untold Truths."" Only in this case, he was a movie star. Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of ""Untold Truths"" -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Back in the day, they called themselves Roving Boy. Truth be told, the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star's vanity project. It's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop. Costner sings about freight trains, dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that's pleasant, if not terribly distinct. In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater, he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen. At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Field of Dreams"" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. The mission statement from ""Field of Dreams"" seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist: ""If you build it, they will come."" Plenty of fans did come to his show that night, but earlier in the day, we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored ""SoundCheck"" session.  Listen to Costner kick it with his band » . CNN: Even though your album, ""Untold Truths,"" is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. Kevin Costner: Yeah. It's just music. CNN: What made you decide to put out an album? Costner: My wife said, ""Look, you are the happiest by far when you are making music. Why don't you keep on making music?"" CNN: People may not know this, but you've been making music for a long time. Costner: Yeah, for a long time. I have been doing a lot of things for a long time. (chuckles) It's not like we called up and said, ""Hey, we have a garage band. Can we show up?"" We have been working really hard at this for three years. All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it. It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation, people discovering the band. CNN: When you were talking to the students, you spoke a lot about being fearless. Costner: Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues, but by their parents. You only get one shot at this life. They can go to college and learn a lot of things, but they should also be encouraged to try things, even if they don't succeed. I am trying -- even if I don't succeed. You know, failure is completely underrated in America. (smiles) CNN: With this new project, there's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter. Costner: Well, that will happen no matter what I do -- so I'm not worried about that. I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable. CNN: And what is that? Costner: I don't know. It's just a moment when you feel you've given an honest effort. CNN: You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie, let alone condensing things into a three-minute song. How do you -- . Costner: I don't have that hard a time! CNN: Oh, come on! Costner: I make jokes about it a lot. You know, I make one-hour, 59-minute movies! But yeah -- telling the story, I don't believe in some conditional running length. I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically. CNN: You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago. Costner: Yeah, a long time ago. Blair (his bass player), the same. Like anybody with good sense, you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you. CNN: Which is more cutthroat, the movie business or the music business? Costner: There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under, and people ducking for exits, pointing fingers. You know, it is a cycle of life. Then someone else will take that spot, some heavy hitter. Maybe it is good to take a lesson. You have to be a little humble because maybe one day, you are not that big, swinging dog you think you are. CNN: Do you ever feel like that in your own career? Costner: Well, I am aware that a career that takes chances isn't always going to ring a bell. It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person, or the number one person, because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with. CNN: Do you read reviews? Costner: No. Sometimes they are read to me. ""Look what he said!"" I am like, ""Please don't show me."" CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. We'll see where it lands. We made a record. We made it as good as we could make it, and now we let it go. And we go and write a better song. CNN: In the meantime, you have a show to put on. Costner: There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning, and that is a great feeling. Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them. When you perform, for me, it's like filling up the gas tank.","Kevin Costner has band, Modern West; new album just out .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Move over Susan Boyle. A week after the Scottish woman became a global sensation following a barnstorming audition on ""Britain's Got Talent,"" a 12-year-old Welsh boy with a Motown voice has been hailed for his ""life-changing"" performance on the TV show after earning a standing ovation from Simon Cowell. Jafargholi impressed the ""Britain's Got Talent"" judges with a rendition of ""Who's Loving You."" Shaheen Jafargholi's prospects looked bleak when the infamously hard to impress Cowell brought the audition to an abrupt halt just one verse into his rendition of ""Valerie,"" the Zutons' song covered by Amy Winehouse. ""You've got this really wrong,"" Cowell told him. ""What do you sing apart from that?"" Jafargholi instead offered to perform ""Who's Loving You,"" written by Smokey Robinson and performed by a young Michael Jackson with the Jackson Five, bringing screams of delight from the audience as he launched into a note-perfect rendition that brought a beaming Cowell and fellow judges Piers Morgan and Amanda Holden to their feet. ""This is how one song can change your life,"" Cowell told him. ""This may be the start of something special for you young man.""  Watch Shaheen Jafargholi perform on ""Britain's Got Talent"" » . Writing in his blog for the show, Morgan said Jafargholi had been the stand-out act of the show and tipped him as a possible challenger to Boyle for the TV talent show's £100,000 ($146,000) prize. ""Once Simon got him to sing the right kind of song for his voice, he was sensational. Like a young Stevie Wonder,"" Morgan said. In an interview for the show, Jafargholi said he had been singing since he was two years old. ""When I was a bit older my mum got me some singing lessons and my voice just got bigger and bigger,"" he said. ""Hopefully this is going to be my big break."" Last week's performance by Boyle, the 47-year-old with a Broadway voice who claimed to have never been kissed, brought the show global attention, with her version of the Les Miserables' tune ""I Dreamed a Dream"" gaining more than 32 million hits on YouTube as well as earning her a string of U.S. media appearances, including on CNN's Larry King Live. Jafargholi has some way to go to match Boyle's success. By Monday morning a YouTube link to his performance had been watched just 330,000 times. Who do you prefer? Susan Boyle or Shaheen Jafargholi?

"(CNN) -- Troops in Jamaica captured an armed man Monday who had barged onto a Canadian airliner, robbed passengers and held six crew members hostage, Jamaica Information Minister Daryl Vaz said. A hostage-taker commandeered a CanJet flight at Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The crew members were not harmed, Vaz said. The hijacking suspect, described as a ""mentally challenged"" man in his 20s, had demanded that the Boeing 737 be flown to Cuba. The military captured him around 7 a.m. local time. The FBI helped Jamaican authorities handle the situation at the Jamaican government's request, a U.S. government source told CNN. The CanJet flight from Halifax, Canada, had made a scheduled landing at Sangster International Airport in the Jamaican resort city of Montego Bay and was scheduled to continue to Santa Clara, Cuba. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who was in Jamaica, told reporters that he planned to travel to Montego Bay to meet with Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding. Harper has been following the airplane security breach and may meet with the plane's crew later today. ""The hijacking is that from a mentally challenged youngster and not anything that would be of concern in terms of an international incident,"" Vaz said. The suspect gained access to the plane Sunday night through the terminal in ""a breach of security"" that ""will be investigated,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Owen Ellington told CNN. The gunman fired a shot in the boarding bridge as he entered, said CanJet Airlines Vice President Kent Woodside. No one was hit. CanJet Flight 918 was carrying 174 passengers and eight crew members, Woodside said. All the passengers were Canadian, he said. The suspect took an undisclosed number of passengers and crew members hostage before releasing all the passengers and two crew members, said Elizabeth Scotton, a spokeswoman for the company that manages the airport. Two of the six crew members who remained inside the plane Monday locked themselves in the cockpit, Vaz said. The suspect's father and Golding, who flew in by helicopter, were among those who negotiated with the gunman before his capture. The country's minister of national security also was at hand. The released passengers were taken to a hotel, and the airport was shut down for a time, Vaz said. The airport reopened shortly after the standoff, Woodside said. A CanJet airliner was on its way to Jamaica, he said, to take passengers on to Cuba or back to Canada. Christian Gosselin, a passenger on the flight, told his father that the gunman demanded cash from the plane's occupants. Vaz confirmed the account. ""The guy wanted to have all their money,"" said Gosselin's father, Alphonse. ""He [my son] told his girlfriend to take all the money and just take her passport and credit card and put it in her back pocket."" Christian Gosselin was part of a 25-person wedding party headed to Cuba. He and his girlfriend were released by the hostage-taker, and they spoke to his father in New Brunswick, Canada, while waiting for another flight. ""I didn't ask them too many questions; I was more concerned for their safety,"" the father said. ""They were a bit shaken up. It was quite an experience."" Another passenger, Brenda Grenier, called her husband and said the man apparently got aboard the plane as airport workers were loading bags. Grenier and her daughter were safe, her husband said by phone from his home in Nova Scotia, Canada.

Nobody has a blueprint and nobody is a know-it-all,"" she said of the current turmoil engulfing the global banking system. ""I can tell you I never would have thought we could experience what we're experiencing in America now,"" she added. ""Because for one we never would have thought that the Americans could be caught 'asleep,' not monitoring their financial system and therefore waking up one day and finding out that their most respected institutions are collapsing right and left."" The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the global financial crisis will have a ""major impact,"" on low-income countries. In a recent report, ""The Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Low-Income Countries,"" the Fund singled out sub-Saharan Africa as particularly vulnerable to the crisis, as lower global growth reduces export demand and depresses commodity prices. And last month, anti-poverty campaign group ActionAid forecast Africa's income would drop by $49 billion dollars between 2007 and the end of this year. Most of that, it said, would be due to a fall in export earnings, aid and income from rich countries now in recession. ""Although developing countries didn't make this crisis, it has become all too clear that they are in the firing line when it comes to suffering its worst effects,"" Claire Melamed, Head of Policy at ActionAid said in a statement accompanying the report. ""There is a real risk that development will start to go backwards in many countries as the money dries up and that the recession will lead to worsening poverty and terrible consequences for the men, women and children caught in its grip,"" she added. Wangari Maathai said many Africans had become so accustomed to their daily struggles that they assumed life could not get any worse. ""Some of the impact that the western banks or the Western people are experiencing we've been experiencing for decades,"" Maathai said. ""We've been raising and educating children who cannot get any employment. Long ago our hospitals collapsed, our infrastructure collapsed, our education system collapsed. ""That's why people are saying it can't get any worse, but you and I know it can get worse,"" she said. Now 69, Wangari Maathai has long campaigned for human rights and the empowerment of Africa's most impoverished people.  Watch Revealed: Wangari Maathai » . More than thirty years ago she founded the Green Belt Movement, a tree-planting campaign to simultaneously mitigate deforestation and to give locals, especially women and girls, new purpose. They have since planted more than 40 million trees. In 2004, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote sustainable development, democracy and peace, and has recently repeated calls for Africans to 'rise up' and demand greater accountability from their governments.

""What Africa needs to know is that now that the world has its own crisis in its own hand, if they don't take care of themselves and place themselves in a position where they can be assisted, they will suffer, the people will suffer,"" Maathai told CNN. Earlier this month, the group of 20 industrialized nations agreed an unprecedented rescue package worth $1.1 trillion to tackle the global economic crisis. It included $750 billion dollars for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), three times the Fund's previous lending capacity, as well ""special drawing rights"" to an additional $250 billion. Of the commitment, Maathai said: ""I'm glad that the G20 identified that they must help the poor people, but the biggest problem for the poor developing countries in Africa is that they are already facing so many challenges.""","Nobel Peace Laureate says Africans need to take responsibility for future .

"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses North Korea on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday. Albright, who was secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that ""it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea"" when the Bush administration took over. The communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition. Satellite images released Monday appear to show the rocket in flight, according to a  nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The following is a transcript of Albright's conversation with CNN's Carol Costello. Carol Costello, CNN: We do have this video from North Korea of this rocket taking off. What do you make of that? Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: Well, I think that the North Korean leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success, when tracking and everything has shown that in fact, it is a failure. And I think it proves a point, which is that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-Il is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on Thursday, tomorrow, there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he's generally had since he had his stroke. So this is part of their kind of Orwellian approach of saying that ""This is what happened, and wasn't it a success,"" when we know it wasn't. Costello: The U.N. Security Council hasn't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split. President Obama made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation. It sort of seems like the United States is stuck, and it can't do anything about North Korea. Albright: Well, I don't think that's true, because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries. And I have to say from my own experience of the United Nations, it does take a while to get the 15 members [of the Security Council] together. But the saddest for me is the fact that the U.N. passed a resolution, 1718, which said that this was not acceptable. So the truth is that the U.N. has to live up to its own resolutions. And Ambassador Rice, I think, is working very hard up there in order to get some action, but there have been condemnations already throughout the world. And the bottom line here is that President Obama's speech, for instance, in Prague, when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it's very clear that there's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that President Obama laid out a very, very important set of goals. amFIX: Your thoughts on the rocket launch . Costello: And, you know, there has been some criticism that President Obama turned to the U.N. to try to solve this crisis. I want to read you a quote from Politico. It interviewed Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. I want to read you his quote. Newt Gingrich said, ""The embarrassing repudiation of the United States appeal to the United Nations Security Council Sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness. This is beginning to resemble the Carter administration's weakness in foreign policy."" How would you respond to that? Albright: Well, I think that it's just kind of typical of Newt Gingrich, frankly. But the bottom line here is, I think the United States and President Obama has made very clear the leadership of the United States, his concern about, generally, proliferation issues. I think his trip, for instance, laid out a whole set of issues that prove that American leadership is essential, the respect that he gained for American leadership. And I think you're going to see additional ways that we all work together, because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation, and they will require international organizations and cooperation through NATO and a number of activities. So I'm very confident that President Obama is going to be able to prove American leadership. Costello: Well, I guess many Americans look at it this way, you know: You talk about sanctions, but sanctions have been instituted against North Korea before, and it hasn't really worked. North Korea just seems to kind of do what it wants. You've met Kim Jong-Il. I mean, what does he want? Albright:  Well, what he wants is respect. And I have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned, I met Kim Jong-Il. We were in the middle of negotiations with him. In fact, we had a missile moratorium. And President Bush came in and canceled those talks. It was confusing to everybody. And I do think that what is important now is to get the North Koreans back into the six-party talks, to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if, in fact, they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions, rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant, and hunger, in every way in North Korea, and a leadership that is shaky. But the bottom line is, I think it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea. And in the interim period, they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons, and so I hope very much that the six-party talks continue. Costello: We'll see. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. Thank you.","Former secretary of state: U.S. made ""huge mistake"" stopping talks with North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Australia's prime minister Friday slammed those engaged in human trafficking after an explosion aboard a boat carrying Afghan refugees killed three people and injured more than 40 others near Ashmore Reef, off Australia's northwest coast. ""People smugglers are engaged in the world's most evil trade and they should all rot in jail because they represent the absolute scum of the earth,"" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told reporters. ""We see this lowest form of human life at work in what we saw on the high seas yesterday. That's why this government maintains its hardline, tough, targeted approach to maintaining border protection for Australia. And that's why we have dedicated more resources to combat people smuggling than any other government in Australian history."" The boat was carrying 49 refugees, officials said. In addition to the three killed, two others were missing. Rudd would not comment on the cause of the explosion, citing the ongoing investigation. The prime minister acknowledged that human smuggling was an increasing problem exacerbated by ""global factors"" but defended his government's border security policies. ""Our staff, our naval staff, our coast watch staff, our aerial surveillance staff and others, our police, are doing a first class job backed up by our intelligence officers as well, also in collaboration with partners across the region,"" the prime minister said. ""Because it is a global phenomenon and we are finding push factors operating from around the world, our active partnership with international governments and international agencies like the UNHCR is equally critical. This is a fight on many fronts. It is a fight which we have been engaged in for some time and a fight which other governments around the world are equally engaged in with us."" Rudd said the refugees' requests for asylum ""will be treated under the normal provisions of the law through the examination of each of their individual cases.""","Explosion on boat carrying Afghan refugees killed three people and injured 40 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama on Monday gathered together every confirmed member of his Cabinet for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days. President Obama meets Monday with his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, right. Agencies will have to report how they saved on expenses at the end of the period. The federal government has ""a confidence gap when it comes to the American people,"" Obama said at the White House. ""We've got to earn their trust. They've got to feel confident that their dollars are being spent wisely."" The edict is part of Obama's ""commitment to go line by line through the budget to cut spending"" and ""reform the government,"" a senior administration official said. One potential Cabinet officer was missing from the meeting -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary-designate. The Senate has not voted on whether to confirm Sebelius to the post.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of international envoys walked out during a speech by Iran's president Monday as he accused Israel of having a ""racist government"" and committing genocide. European Union delegates leave during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech Monday. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused the West of making ""an entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering ... in order to establish a totally racist government in occupied Palestine."" Many delegates at the controversial U.N. anti-racism conference in Geneva, Switzerland, cheered his words as a minority of diplomats -- mostly from Europe -- collected their papers and briefcases and left the room. Cameras at the scene showed empty seats where delegates from France, Finland and Denmark had been sitting. The British and Spanish delegations also walked out, both countries' foreign affairs divisions confirmed.  Watch delegates make their exit » . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement criticizing Ahmadinejad for using the conference ""to accuse, divide and even incite."" Ban said he had spoken to the Iranian president and asked him not to focus on ""divisiveness"" in his address. ""It is deeply regrettable that my plea to look to the future of unity was not heeded by the Iranian president,"" Ban said. ""This is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve. This makes it significantly more difficult to build constructive solutions to the very real problem of racism,"" Ban said in a statement following Ahmadinejad's speech. During Monday's speech, Ahmadinejad paused a moment, then continued: ""In fact, in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe, they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in Palestine. ""It is all the more regrettable that a number of Western governments and the United States have committed themselves to defend those racist perpetrators of genocide,"" he said, echoing Tehran's official line on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel was established in 1948 as a homeland for Jewish people after the Holocaust, on land also claimed by Palestinians. Ahmadinejad said Zionism, the Jewish national movement, ""personifies racism"" and accused Zionists of wielding economic and political resources to silence opponents. He also blasted the United States-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Wasn't the military action against Iraq planned by the Zionists and their allies in the then-U.S. administration?"" he demanded. At least two protesters in brightly colored wigs interrupted Ahmadinejad as he began to speak, shouting: ""You're a racist!"" in accented English. But some delegates cheered as he began his speech while security officers dragged the protesters from the chamber. Later in the address, more protesters shouted at him from a balcony, leading him to pause and look down for a moment, a smile playing across his lips. He also blamed the United States for the world economic crisis. Israel withdrew its ambassador from Switzerland in protest before the conference, which the United States and a number of other countries are boycotting. Alejandro Wolff, the U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., called Ahmadinejad's remarks ""vile,"" ""hateful"" and ""inciteful,"" and praised Ban's condemnation. Speaking at a Holocaust remembrance service in Jerusalem, Israeli President Shimon Peres said Ahmadinejad's address ""constitutes an acceptance of racism, rather than the fight against it."" ""It is hard to fathom why despots such as Hitler the Nazi, Stalin the Bolshevik and Ahmadinejad the Persian chose the Jews as the main target for their hatred, their madness and their violence,"" Peres said. ""Perhaps they targeted the Jewish people because of its spiritual power - a nation poor in material possessions, but rich in values -- for he who is infected with megalomania fears the power of the spirit."" New Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu declared during the Holocaust commemoration event that Israel will not allow ""Holocaust deniers to carry out another Holocaust against Jews."" A number of European countries had vowed to walk out if Iran's president made offensive remarks. ""The UK unreservedly condemns Iranian President Ahmadinejad's offensive and inflammatory comments. Such outrageous, anti-Semitic remarks should have no place in a U.N. anti-racism forum,"" said Peter Gooderham, Britain's envoy to the U.N. in Geneva. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was quick to ""unreservedly condemn"" the Iranian president's words. Britain decided against boycotting the event being held in Geneva, although other Western countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden, and the United States withdrew in advance over concerns that the conference would devolve into a platform for some nations to attack Israel. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he instructed the country's ambassador to the U.N. to leave the conference along with his European colleagues after Ahmadinejad spoke ""in an unacceptable way."" Koucher explained that France ""would not tolerate anyone holding the conference hostage and using it as a platform for making heinous remarks."" Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told reporters that he believed the vocal opposition to Ahmadinejad's positions was a ""very positive thing"". The major problems with Iran, according to Harper, are continued threats against Israel and against the Israeli people, along with persistent nuclear ambitions. Ahmadinejad was the first speaker at the conference because he was the only head of state to respond to the invitation, conference spokesman Ramu Damodaran told CNN. ""Invitations are sent to all member states. They decide at what level they wish to be represented,"" he explained. Ahmadinejad ""was the only head of state who had confirmed as of today -- and when you arrange the list of speakers, heads of state get precedence over non-heads of states."" The United States, among others, is refusing to send any envoys at all to the Durban Review Conference. While rejecting the boycott, Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged reporters ""not allow this one intervention to mar the conference. ""I prefer to move on,"" she said at a news conference after Ahmadinejad's speech. She also criticized the delegates who walked out during his speech, saying his ""unsavory remarks"" did not ""provide justification for anyone to walk out of the conference."" Pillay said Sunday that she regrets -- and is ""shocked"" by -- the United States' decision to boycott. The U.S. State Department said Washington's decision was based in part on a conference document that ""singles out"" Israel in its criticism and conflicts with the United States' ""commitment to unfettered free speech."" Australia, Canada, Germany, Poland and Italy are among those also boycotting the conference .

"(CNN) -- The suspected killer of a 20-year-old pregnant Camp Lejeune Marine is in a North Carolina jail late Friday after being extradited from Mexico, law enforcement sources said. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, 22, was extradited Friday to the United States and held on a murder charge. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, 22, was arrested in Mexico in April 2008. He has been indicted on charges that include financial card transaction fraud, obtaining property by false pretenses and first-degree murder in the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach. Laurean, who is being held without bond, was booked into the Onslow County Detention Center about 9 p.m. ET, according to a police statement obtained by CNN. An arraignment is scheduled for Monday, the statement read. Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she disappeared in December 2007; her charred body and that of her fetus were found beneath a fire pit in Laurean's backyard near Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where both were stationed, in January 2008. Investigators accompanied Laurean, who fled to Mexico, back to the United States on Friday morning, two law enforcement sources said. Laurean will stand trial in Onslow County, North Carolina, for Lauterbach's killing. North Carolina prosecutors allege Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico. He was arrested in San Juan Vina in the Mexican state of Michoacan. Because he holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico, he could not be immediately deported and had to go through the extradition process, authorities have said. Before Laurean's extradition to the United States, Camp Lejeune spokesman Maj. Cliff Gilmore said the slaying suspect would go into the civilian jail in Onslow County and stand trial in a civilian court. He was listed as a deserter shortly after he disappeared following Lauterbach's death. He remains on deserter status, but is still considered an active-duty Marine, Gilmore said. ""[Laurean] will be treated like any other inmate in our detention center, and he will be prosecuted by the district attorney's office,"" Rick Sutherland, inspector general of the Onslow County Sheriff's Office, said in a written statement. The FBI said in a news release Thursday the sheriff's office asked for help in finding Laurean after he disappeared January 12, 2008. If convicted, Laurean would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Mexico's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives it hands over. Asked by a Mexican reporter at the time of his arrest whether he killed Lauterbach, Laurean replied, ""I loved her."" Authorities found Lauterbach's body after Laurean's wife, Christina, produced a note her husband had written claiming the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument, according to officials. Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach's neck, autopsy results indicated that the wound would not have been fatal and may have occurred after death. Lauterbach died from blunt-force trauma to the head, according to the autopsy. Prosecutors have said there was no evidence that Christina Laurean was involved in or aware of Lauterbach's slaying before she gave the note to authorities. As part of the effort to apprehend Laurean, authorities had seized a computer belonging to his sister-in-law that Christina Laurean was using to communicate with her husband, a law enforcement official had told CNN. Lauterbach had accused Laurean of raping her, and it is unclear whether he was the father of her unborn child. Her relatives have said they believe he was. Laurean had denied the rape allegation and said he had had no sexual contact with Lauterbach. Mary Lauterbach, the slain woman's mother, has said she's unconvinced that the Marine Corps took her daughter's rape allegation and other allegations of harassment seriously. Relatives said that Lauterbach's car was keyed and that an anonymous person had punched her in the face. ""Those particular actions should have been taken much more seriously because the Marines were aware of them,"" she has said. In a statement issued after Lauterbach's death, the Marine Corps said Laurean's denial of the rape allegation ""was believed to be significant evidence."" CNN's Rich Phillips, Carol Cratty and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","NEW: Cpl. Cesar Laurean, 22, booked in North Carolina jail about 9 p.m.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Timothy Connick was in agony for six years. In bed at night, it felt as if a pair of scissors was sticking out of his foot. ""I turn over, and it's just like they're getting jammed in more."" Timothy Connick got relief from chronic pain through a peripheral nerve stimulator implanted above his hip. Connick, 52 from Lynn, Massachusetts, injured his foot falling from a loading dock at work 11 years ago. ""I fell about seven feet onto the concrete and smashed my heel. It started hurting that moment and kept hurting for six years after that."" Connick is among millions. As many as one in three American adults suffer from chronic pain, according to the American Chronic Pain Association. The organization defines chronic pain as ""pain that continues a month or more beyond the usual recovery period for an injury or illness or that goes on for months or years because of a chronic condition.""  It's usually not constant, the group says, but can disrupt the sufferer's life. Over the years, Connick consulted multiple doctors and tried two dozen medications for pain management, but nothing eased the pain and the resulting depression. ""It was pretty much a no-win situation as long as that pain was going to be there,"" he recalls. He was eventually referred to neurologist Anne Louise Oaklander, director of the nerve injury unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""Pain is the No. 1 reason why patients seek medical care, but until recently it hasn't been part of the medical school curriculum,"" she says. ""Many physicians and nurses feel uncomfortable and unqualified to treat these patients."" Oaklander sees many patients whom she describes as ""bouncing around the health care system"" for years with no firm diagnosis. She divides chronic pain sufferers into two groups. ""One is the group that has an ongoing cause of their pain,"" she says. ""The classic example of that is patients with arthritis. They have pain in their joints every day."" Much more difficult, she says, is the second group: ""Patients who have chronic pain without an obvious cause of tissue injury."" Connick falls in the second category, Oaklander says, noting that X-rays show broken bones, but not nerve damage. ""It was only many years later when he was examined by a neurologist that his underlying nerve injury was identified and able to be treated,"" she said.  Health Minute: The struggle of managing chronic pain » . Oaklander says pain medications can help most patients, but there are other options. For instance, she says, if the pain is related to an orthopedic problem, physical therapy may be the best choice. In Connick's case, relief came through surgery to implant a peripheral nerve stimulator above his hip. Based on pacemaker technology, the stimulator is placed under the skin and works by giving off benign pulses that override pain signals to the brain, Oaklander explains. She cautions that minor surgery is involved, and the device works in only about half the patients who get it. For Connick, it made all the difference. ""The day they put it in and I turned it on, I was up seven flights of stairs before they stopped me. Everything that I hadn't been able to do and everything that made me happy was back available to me again and I knew it right away."" These days, Connick is back at work loading trucks. He's on his feet all day and doesn't complain about any pain. Oaklander concludes: ""If you have chronic pain, don't take no for an answer....I think it's important for chronic pain patients to keep a sense of purpose, optimism and hope despite the indignities that many are subjected to.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia  (CNN) -- Stephen Plumlee started feeling dizzy and nauseated shortly after his flight from Sarasota, Florida, landed in Atlanta, Georgia. He was wheeled off the plane by paramedics, but instead of being taken to a hospital emergency room downtown, he was treated in the atrium of the busiest airport in the world. The AeroClinic joins a growing field of easy-access medical facilities found in pharmacies and retail outlets. The AeroClinic, a new retail medical facility, offers quick, inexpensive care to travelers and some of the airport's 55,000 employees. ""We're kind of the stop in between the hospital during your travels,"" said Dr. Dominic Mack, chief medical officer for the clinic. The AeroClinic joins a growing field of easy-access medical facilities found in pharmacies and retail outlets around the country. You could say it falls somewhere between the newer, small clinics and the larger full-service after-hours clinics that have been around for many years. For about $80, a patient can be treated by a doctor or physician assistant for a minor acute illness such as strep throat, upset stomach or headache. That was the reason behind Derrick Gross' visit. The medical sales representative lives in Atlanta, but travels at least three days a week. He says he's too busy to see a regular doctor, and when he saw the sign while passing through the airport, he decided to make an appointment. Gross spent about 20 minutes with physician assistant Sabrina Jackson going through a battery of tests to try to determine the source of his headaches.  Health Minute: Airport clinic gives travelers a health-care alternative ». He received a supply of ibuprofen when the tests revealed no obvious medical problems. ""I took a chance by coming here today and I'm satisfied,"" Gross said. He agreed to follow up with his primary care physician. Mack said he treats a lot of patients like Gross. ""You have 250,000 passengers who come through Atlanta Hartsfield every day, and people are sick. What they do is delay their care or they don't get their care at all."" Dr. David Satcher, former U.S. surgeon general and frequent flier, sees the need first hand. ""I've traveled almost 40,000 miles in the last month and I know there are a lot of people who spend time in airports and a lot of people don't get the care they need,"" he said. As a member of the American Academy of Family Physicians, Satcher believes the concept of a quick-care health facility inside an airport is a good one so long as patients continue to have contact with a primary care physician at home. He serves on the board of directors for The AeroClinic and is one of the privately held company's original investors. He wants potential patients to understand the restrictions of a facility such as The AeroClinic. ""This is not the place to go when you're having chest pains. ... (But) obviously, if you have a minor illness this is an opportunity to seek care while you're traveling and not have to wait until you get back home."" The clinic's 12 staffers also offer preventive care including physical exams, routine vaccinations and monitoring of chronic diseases. The facility accepts some insurance coverage. In the fall, The AeroClinic, will open a second facility in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, airport. The staff plans to offer flu shots at mobile kiosks in the airport concourses. For now, travelers must go out of the airport security zone to reach the facility. Stephen Plumlee didn't mind the inconvenience. ""I was so out of it, I didn't know what was happening. But everyone has been very helpful."" After he rested for a couple of hours and recovered from the nausea, an imbalance in his inner ear was diagnosed. He was given medication to help him cope with the flight home and sent on his way. ""This has been good,"" concluded Plumlee. ""It's been fine to be able to do it in the airport, not have to go to some other part of the city and find my way back."" E-mail to a friend .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least seven Iraqis were killed and 23 wounded when a bomb exploded near a Shiite holy shrine in northern Baghdad on Wednesday morning, an Interior Ministry official said. The Imam Musa al-Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, Iraq, seen in 2007, is holy to Shiite Muslims. The bomb detonated near the Imam Musa al-Kadhim shrine in the Kadhimiya district, the official said. The Kadhimiya shrine is one of the holiest shrines for Shiite Muslims around the world. On Tuesday, a parked car bomb killed at least nine people and wounded more than a dozen others, also in Kadhimiya. This is the third straight day of deadly attacks in the capital, striking mostly Shiite areas. On Monday, seven bombings in Baghdad left at least 32 people killed and more than 130 wounded. Iraqi officials have warned that they expect a rise in attacks. The country's president and his deputies urged security forces to intensify their efforts to secure the country. The government has blamed the ousted Baath party and al Qaeda in Iraq for Monday's attacks, saying they were meant to create sectarian divisions. The U.S. military also pointed the finger at al Qaeda. ""The nature of the attacks and targets are consistent with past al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. We see this as coordinated attack by terrorists against predominantly Shia targets that they gauge as vulnerable to instigate sectarian violence,"" the U.S. military said.","Three days of attacks in mainly Shiite areas of Baghdad leave dozens dead .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- ""I like L.A., but there sure are a lot of ugly bastards running around here,"" says James Hunter, with a set of grotesque joke teeth in his mouth -- and tongue firmly in cheek. James Hunter has received raves for his recordings, but has yet to break through to big-time success. Midway through a lengthy tour, it's nice to know his sense of humor is intact. The boyish 46-year-old British retro-R&B singer is in a dressing room at the Sunset Strip's House of Blues, sitting in a throne-like chair festooned with Mexican Day of the Dead skulls. It's oddly fitting. Like that festival, Hunter is remembering -- through his music -- those who are no longer with us. His classic soul-inspired sound and concert style harkens back to the golden days of R&B and the men who practiced it: Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke and guitarist Lowman Pauling, among others. ""I think I probably stole a couple of tricks from people who were already dead by the time I started,"" he replies, when asked about his stage moves. Indeed, an hour later he's on stage and it's clear that if you put him in the ""Back to the Future"" DeLorean, traveled back to 1955 and dropped him off with Marvin Berry's band at the ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" dance, he'd be right at home.  Watch Hunter perform for a sound check » . That authentic old-school sound has made him a cult favorite among jazz and blues aficionados. His first two albums -- 2006's ""People Gonna Talk"" and last year's ""The Hard Way"" -- were acclaimed by critics and the cognoscenti, with the Boston Globe calling ""The Hard Way"" ""one of the year's smoothest and best discs."" He's also earned praise as a dazzling live performer, one who is known for guitar acrobatics performed with a smile. But he has yet to achieve the mainstream success of British retro-soul contemporaries Amy Winehouse, Duffy and Adele. Could it be because they've found a way to blend contemporary lyrics with an older sound? Hunter acknowledges he doesn't do enough of that in his own music: ""I think that's my downfall, to be honest. I think they picked up on a trick that I'm trying, that I've mastered. I mean, I think they're as much immersed in contemporary stuff as the old days. I think that's pretty cool. I'm trying to do that. ""Stylistically, I'm more embedded, not in tradition -- I mean I'm not into genres -- but styles, you know,"" he continues. ""The sound of things. I've got my preference in the sound and stuff. But, you know, I think I can afford to go their way a little bit, not because it's successful, but because it works."" Interestingly, few American acts have embraced the retro-soul sound with the fervor of their British counterparts. Hunter has his theories on why that's the case. ""It could be because you guys invented it, you know. I think it's possible,"" he says. ""I'm not sure these days, but initially you had the Stones and people like that, even the Beatles who were much more in awe in this American music than Americans were. It all tends to be on your doorstep and you tend to be more cavalier to the stuff that's already there. It's like the thing when John Lennon told the reporters that he wanted to see Muddy Waters and they said, 'Where's that?' "" But despite the love he has for the music of the classic soul era, Hunter understands that going forward, a healthy irreverence is what will keep it fresh for audiences -- and himself. ""I think the downfall of any type of music is to treat it with too much reverence, because the people at the time weren't treating it with reverence and they were sort of bashing it out, that was the beauty of it, the spontaneity,"" he says. ""But, when people are trying to preserve stuff -- you've got to be loyal to this or that kind of music -- that's so much nonsense.""","James Hunter known for old-school R&B recordings .

"MONTE CARLO, Monaco  -- Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva has broken her own world record in the women's pole vault with a leap of 5.04 meters as she warmed up for her Olympic defense. Isinbayeva broke her own women's pole vault world record on her third attempt in Monaco. The record came at the Monaco Grand Prix on Tuesday on her third and final attempt at the height. Her previous record of 5.03 meters was set in Rome on July 11. Isinbayeva is the reigning Olympic and world champion. Asafa Powell claimed his third 100 meters success inside a week when he raced clear in his season-best time of 9.82 seconds. Powell shaved 0.06sec off his previous season-best of 9.88, set last Tuesday in Stockholm, where he saw off fellow Jamaican and world record holder Usain Bolt. On Tuesday Powell was too hot for Davis Patton of the U.S. (9.98) and Nesta Carter of Jamaica (10.02), the fourth best time of the season all the more impressive given the calm conditions. ""I am very happy,"" said Powell. ""I feel great, very fresh. I've got a world record in my legs. I am very confident. My goal is to be consistent."" A tough headwind had compromised Powell's attempts to have a tilt at Bolt's mark although he still cruised to a weekend victory at the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace in 9.94sec. Other Tuesday highlights saw Jamaica's Melaine Walker set a year mark in the women's 400m hurdles in clocking 53.48 sec. Walker, who shattered her own personal best of 54.14 in the process, will hope her performance augurs well for the Beijing Games, where Aussie two-time world champion Jana Rawlinson will not be competing owing to a toe injury. Kenyan Daniel Kipchirchir Komen also set a year best mark in the 1500m, crossing the line in 3 min 31.49sec to take 0.08sec off compatriot Augustine Kiprono Choge's June 1 showing in Berlin. The 23-year-old's win tempered the disappointment of missing out on an Olympic berth. Britain's Martyn Rooney also improved his personal best in the 400 meters for the second successive race, following up his win in the London Grand Prix with victory in 44.72 seconds. The Monaco Grand Prix was the last major international track and field meeting before the Beijing Olympics which start on August 8.","Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva breaks her own women's world pole vault record .

"(CNN) -- Tax day is an annual stress test for millions of Americans, but Wednesday's Internal Revenue Service filing deadline may be the toughest one yet for many who can't pay their mortgages or rent, let alone a big tax bill. Jonathan Hermosa wears a costume this week to beckon customers to a tax service office in New York. ""Our message to taxpayers [is] that we're going the extra mile to help those of you in economic distress,"" IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman told the National Press Club in Washington on Monday. ""We want to get you your refunds as quickly as possible. And if you think you can't pay, please come in and let's talk about it. There are steps we can take to help."" iReport contributor Crystal Gress will need to follow some of those steps. The Coplay, Pennsylvania, bank call center employee said she doesn't know how she's going to pay the $1,200 she owes the IRS. It's the first time she's had a balance due on April 15. ""I'm really scared because I've never had to do it before,"" said Gress, 23. ""I'm used to getting a return, but this past year has been really rough.""  Watch who's more likely to get audited » . Gress adjusted her withholding last year to increase her take-home pay to cover bills; she intended the change to be temporary, but car repairs and other expenses kept coming up, she said. She used an estimating tool on tax preparer H&R Block's Web site and got the bad news. ""I was like, 'Oh, crap. I owe money.' And I don't know what to do now,"" she said. ""... I waited until yesterday to do my taxes because I didn't want to submit them."" People who know they're getting a refund tend to file as early as possible, while those with a balance due tend to file late in the season, IRS spokesman John Lipold said.  Watch last-minute tips from CNN's Gerri Willis » . ""A lot of people who were getting refunds in the past are not getting them this year,"" said Brian Joubert, owner of L&B Tax Service with five locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area and Houston, Texas. Because his clients usually pay their preparation fees out of their refunds, Joubert's company has had to make changes to accommodate them, including cutting fees in select cases, holding checks until payday or taking payments in installments. ""We've had more people to pay with a credit card this year than I've ever seen,"" said Joubert, who has been in the tax preparation business for 12 years. ""I feel like a department store in some sense."" The IRS has a monthly payment plan, but it comes with an upfront fee, stiff penalties and interest, making it more costly than a commercial loan. But a loan isn't an option for Gress, whose credit rating is hurt by lingering debt from admittedly unwise earlier choices. After her monthly rent, utilities and car payment, ""I barely have enough to buy ramen noodles,"" Gress said. iReport.com: Read more of Gress' story . She tried to refinance her $5,000 used car but was turned down, and getting a loan from her family is not an option, she said. Her fiancé doesn't make much at the auto body shop where he works, and she can't work a second job because of long hours at the call center and recent hip surgery. ""I've been looking at every option to pay my taxes,"" she said, acknowledging she'll probably have to go with the costly IRS installment plan. She won't be alone.

Others in similar situations might consider filing for an extension, but they still have to pay extra on any balance not paid by midnight Wednesday. ""Bring your checkbook when you go to file an extension,"" said Amy McAnarney, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""The tax that isn't paid by April 15 is subject to interest and penalties, so it's best to pay as much as you can even if you are requesting an extension."" In rare cases, the IRS will negotiate with the taxpayer and settle for a smaller amount in what is called an offer in compromise. In 2008, the agency worked out 11,000 offers in compromise (out of about 150 million individual returns) worth about $200 million, Lipold said. ""The IRS understands that a lot of people are having problems right now economically and is willing to work with them,"" he said. ""If you're having a problem, call now.""

Joe Lewis' job as a senior systems analyst was eliminated in January 2008, and at 56 he hasn't found anyone willing to hire him.

Patty Lewis, 55, is a former executive with a furniture company who is disabled and no longer able to work. She first shared her story on iReport.com. The $7,000 is mostly a refund of the penalties they paid when they cashed in Joe's 401(k) and a deduction for their considerable medical expenses, Patty Lewis said. The Lewises are in talks to take that money and a lump-sum payment of her private long-term disability insurance and make a deal with their lender to settle their mortgage debt, she said. ""If I cash it in, I'll be screwing myself by a couple hundred thousand dollars,"" she said. ""But if it's something that's going to save me from foreclosure, I'm willing to do anything I can to secure my home. I'm offering my lender everything that I possibly have. I'm praying to God.""

"Distance runner Gilbert Tuhabonye survived the ethnic violence in his native Burundi in 1993 and rebuilt his life in the U.S. He now coaches in Austin, Texas and has been attempting to qualify for this year's Olympics. He'll be writing about his preparations and giving his views on athletics leading up to the Games. CNN -- May 20, 2008 . Athletes and non-athletes alike often have the dream of going to the Olympic Games -- it's the ultimate experience in sports. He may have not finished the London Marathon, but Gilbert Tuhabonye has overcome greater setbacks. I am no exception and this year, I decided to go for it, but first I needed a qualifying time in the marathon. I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi. I trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race. A few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury. When I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best. The marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later. By mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit. Things began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk. The rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way. Finally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel. It was time to regroup and figure this out. This was not the worse thing that has ever happened to me. I have survived worse situations.  Watch Gilbert Tuhabonye talk about his experiences ». I started to reflect upon the fact that every time I try and train hard for a marathon, something happens. Perhaps this is just not the right time for me. Perhaps God has something else in mind for me. I am being stubborn and pushing for something that is not supposed to be right now. Now, I am home in Austin, Texas some weeks later.  Watch Gilbert coaching his Gilbert's Gazelles ». Thankfully, my hamstring was not torn. I have done physical therapy and massage therapy to repair the damage. I have been working hard at strengthening my core to support the rest of my body. I know that I still have that marathon in me, but it was not meant to be for this year. There are so many issues with these Olympics -- the humidity, the pollution and now, the terrible crisis and suffering of the Chinese people hit by the earthquake. They are the ones who need our help, our hope and our prayers.","Marathon runner Gilbert Tuhabonye writes for CNN.com leading up to the Olympics .

"Editor's note: William Jelani Cobb is Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, and author of the forthcoming ""Change Has Come: Barack Obama and the Meaning of Progress."" He blogs at http://americanexception.com/ . William Jelani Cobb says Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events. (CNN) -- The drama of an American ship captain held hostage by Somali pirates led last Sunday's talk shows. Just hours before Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the ""tests"" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign. Others wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008. Clearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror. Somalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism. Barre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support. During the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for ""nation-building"" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries. Our fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda. The 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere. The Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion. As recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping. In 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences. No matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind. These environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles. Faced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives. Given the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region. In a worst-case scenario, the region could become an incubator for terrorist cells or a depot for training international jihadists -- if it hasn't already. Resolving this problem will likely involve precisely the kind of nation-building the United States once disdained and are now engaged in with Afghanistan. They amount to the back-end costs of the Cold War. These pirates are not romantic heroes and their actions have generated an entirely different set of problems in Somalia, but they have our attention. In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here: innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes. We should also know that part of combating terrorism means addressing the conditions in which it flourishes. Extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong, but by ignoring the dumping of nuclear waste and the threats to the regional food supply, we effectively created a niche for these pirates. And Capt. Phillips' ordeal is a clear signal that humanitarian concerns are not the soft aspects of foreign policy, but rather the key to protecting our national interests abroad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Jelani Cobb.","William Jelani Cobb: Somalia piracy being seen as test of Obama's foreign policy .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Federal officials said Monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents. Claudio Lifschitz shows off the scars he says kidnappers carved on his back. Claudio Lifschitz, 43, said three hooded men threw him into the back of a truck on Friday night and put a plastic bag over his head. They then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires on July 18, 1994, he said. Eighty-five people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-Semitic attacks in the world since World War II. ""The police are investigating [the alleged kidnapping] as we speak,"" said Miguel Ambrosio, legal secretary in the office of federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. ""Once the judge heard the details of the alleged incident, he ordered an investigation to the police via telephone."" Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation. ""I heard the noise of a blowtorch, and that's when the worst started, and I started to feel a burn on my left arm, and I could smell my hair on my arm burning,"" Lifschitz told CNN. ""Then I felt them slicing my back with a knife."" Images of Lifschitz taken after the alleged kidnapping showed bloody marks on his back where the letters 'AMIA' had been scratched. The assailants also carved numbers into his arm; the significance of the digits is unclear. Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted. He was treated for injuries in a hospital. ""They told me that I wouldn't die unless they wanted me to,"" he said Sunday. Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case. Lifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation, including allegedly making a $400,000 bribe to a key witness. Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005. The investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years, with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption. Argentina, Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack. In March 2007, Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing. Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement. Former Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up. Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify. He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up. Lifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection. ""They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack,"" Lifschitz told CNN. ""And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians. That shows that the SIDE doesn't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges. ""They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge, but I told them that I don't have any copies of the tapes."" Lifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion. ""I always wear a rosary around my neck, and they grabbed me by the neck and said, 'Why are you wearing this if you're a Jew?'"" In addition to the AMIA attack, a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17, 1992, when 29 people died and more than 250 were injured in a bombing at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. No one has been prosecuted in that case. Argentina has one of the world's largest Jewish populations, estimated around 250,000. Jewish leaders from around the world called for an investigation into the attack on Lifschitz. ""We trust Argentine authorities will quickly find those who carried out this brutal attack on Mr. Lifschitz,"" said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee. ""This awful incident undermines Argentina's important progress to bring to justice those responsible for the murderous attack on AMIA's headquarters."" Earlier this month, an Argentine court ordered the seizure of property owned by a former Iranian diplomat in Buenos Aires sought for his role in the 1994 AMIA attack.","Lawyer says he was tortured by men claiming to be Argentine Intelligence agents .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The commander of a U.S. Navy submarine that collided with another Navy ship last month has been relieved of duty, according to a U.S. Navy statement issued Tuesday. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans are shown in Navy photos. U.S. Navy Cmdr. Ryan Brookhart was relieved by his superior officer, who cited a loss of confidence in his ability to command, according to the statement. While the investigation into the collision is still ongoing, Brookhart's commander, Rear Adm. Michael J. Connor, decided there was enough evidence to remove him from his leadership position. Brookhart has been reassigned to administrative duty in Bahrain. Cmdr. Chris Harkins, deputy commander of Submarine Squadron Eight, based in Norfolk, Virginia, has taken over as commander of the USS Hartford, according to Navy officials. Brookhart was in command of the Hartford, a nuclear-powered submarine, when it collided with the USS New Orleans (LPD 18) on March 20 in the Strait of Hormuz. Fifteen sailors aboard the Hartford were slightly hurt in the incident, and both vessels suffered extensive damage, according to U.S. Navy officials. The submarine also punched a hole in the fuel tank of the New Orleans, causing thousands of gallons of fuel to pour from the ship. When the incident occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy officials said. There were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship. The Strait of Hormuz is between the United Arab Emirates and Iran, linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. It is heavily used by oil tankers. Both vessels are on regularly scheduled deployments to the U.S. Navy Central Command area of responsibility and conduct Maritime Security Operations.","Superior officer cited a loss of confidence in removing the Navy commander .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In ancient China, a hat tells of social rank. For the six Ngan siblings, hats tell the story of their rise to fortune. A shop assistant displays a Beijing 2008 Olympic Games baseball cap. The Ngan siblings grew up in a poor rural village in China's Fujian province in the 1960s and 1970s in the newly established communist China. People in Fujian and elsewhere in mainland China would speak of the fortunes that could be made in the booming Hong Kong economy. Occasionally, the talk would lead some to move to the international capitalist enclave. Today, the siblings operate their own headwear making and cosmetic trading businesses. One sister's company is the only licensed headwear manufacturer for the upcoming Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. ""Everybody has opportunities in Hong Kong, it's up to you if you'll take the chance, and make use of your talents,"" says the third and the eldest sister, Ngan Po Ling, Pauline. If the hat fits, wear it . None of the Ngan siblings wear hats regularly. They say hats don't really fit their oriental faces. The eldest brother Ngan Shun Kwing, without any other job offers, found work at a hat factory when he first arrived in Hong Kong in 1972. Four years later, Ngan Shun Kwing started his own hat company with his second brother. ""Doing your own business is better than being employed,"" Ngan Shun Kwing, now 55, says. ""I have no qualifications, nobody hires me. And, when can you earn millions as a factory worker?"" The family united in 1980 when the parents and four younger siblings obtained approval to move to Hong Kong. Some of them, including their father, helped with the hat business. The company grew and later branched out to Global Headwear Ltd., which owns factories in China, Cambodia and Bangladesh with more than 10,000 workers, offices in six U.S. cities and major clients include Polo Ralph Lauren and Abercrombie & Fitch. The three Ngan brothers and some of their children manage the corporation, which has also diversified in mining and recycling. The three sisters are also entrepreneurs, but only the fourth sibling, Ngan Po Wan, Wendy, 45, is out of the headwear trade. She started Kingstar International Trading Ltd. in 1992 with her husband and the company is now the Hong Kong, Macau and China distributor of world-famous skin care products, including Guinot and La Colline. Pauline, 48, also started a company with her husband, Ngan Hei Keung. In 1986 the couple began trading headwear and promotional goods and later the company formed the group, Mainland Headwear Holdings Ltd., which was listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2000.

Watch a spokeswoman lead a tour of the plant » . Ngan Shun Kwing, Pauline and Wendy attributed their success to their parents' upbringing and tough rural life in Mainland China, which nurtured their exceptional diligence and determination in facing all challenges in life. From harsh rural life to Hong Kong . Back in the quiet life in Chishui town in Dehua, Fujian, life was very different from Hong Kong's. The siblings ate sweet potatoes in congee (rice porridge), while receiving new clothes and enjoyed meat only once a year during the Chinese New Year. At night, they hardly had electric lights on. They spoke Fujian's Chinese dialect Hokkien and the national language Putonghua. The family did small businesses. Ngan Shun Kwing and Pauline were sent to the nearby mountain Daiyun Shan to learn from farmers during the Cultural Revolution's ""Down to the Countryside Movement."" ""The hardest life in the world is being a farmer."" Ngan Shun Kwing says. ""If you can endure a farmer's life in China, nothing is even harder."" Pauline stayed with a family of six children whose mother died. As a young woman, she was assigned to a heavy responsibility in taking care of the family and the farm animals. ""Living in a society that rejects you, abandons you, look down on you, your inside gets even stronger,"" Pauline says. So when she arrived in Hong Kong, she was even more determined to work hard and become a successful person. The trip headed to Hong Kong was the Ngan siblings' first time on a train. The contrast between the rural and city lives created many exciting first-time experiences for the Ngan siblings when they landed in the city -- seeing airplanes, the hundreds of lights above their heads, ringing a door bell and using a coin-operated telephone. And, the first time to learn English and Cantonese -- the dominant Chinese dialect used in Hong Kong and parts of southeast China. ""We didn't even know there's something called Cantonese,"" Ngan Shun Kwing says. ""Even a coolie [unskilled laborer] needed to speak Cantonese to get hired."" Father Ngan encouraged the younger four siblings to study English. He told his children that English would secure a better career and provide opportunities abroad. ""My father is a very far-sighted person."" Wendy says, ""He did something that helped us a lifetime. If we didn't study English, I could have worked in a factory for my whole life."" In the first few years in Hong Kong, Pauline and Wendy had full days; two hours in English class, working two part-time jobs until 10 at night, and then more language studies until 3 in the morning. Although some classmates in the English class once looked down on them as mainland migrants, Wendy says she is grateful for her experiences; she says she now carries herself with greater confidence. ""Now as we [classmates] meet up, they would show respect and admiration for what we've become,"" Wendy says. Siblings share close relationship . Despite being in the same industry, the siblings claim different clients in the headwear market and do not have direct competition. The siblings are thankful for their self-made fortune. ""People respect our ... family, not because of our businesses, but our unity,"" Pauline says. The siblings' closeness can be understood in measurable terms: Pauline and Wendy are literally next-door neighbors; the three siblings living in the U.S. are just two to five minutes drive away. The siblings are bond by their love for work and food. When the siblings get together, they drink and chat for the entire night. They also share a favorite song -- You gotta fight, then you can win (""Ai piah jia eh iah""), originally sang in the Chinese dialect of Hokkien. The song was first published in 1988 in Taiwan, and quickly became popular among Chinese communities around the world. The song tells of the Ngan siblings' heartfelt thoughts, and of those who strived for a better living in their diasporas from villages to cities, from homeland to abroad. Pauline says she's been lucky in her life. Not many people can go through the variety of experiences she had, including the backward life in rural China, the Cultural Revolution, and Hong Kong's economic miracle. Looking back, Pauline still thinks of the ""Hong Kong Dream"" rather undreamed of. ""Today's life is like heaven,"" Pauline says, ""When I was a kid, when I think of a heaven, it's not even as beautiful as today's life."" The Ngans joined the hundreds of thousands who defined China's first modern Horatio Alger stories. Today, Hong Kong is known as a center of international finance. However, without first establishing itself as a hotbed for the textile and manufacturing industries, the city would have never made this economic progression.","""Everybody has opportunities in Hong Kong,"" Ngan Po Ling, Pauline says .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN)  -- Farmers in Argentina blocked highways and rural routes throughout the country to protest anew the lack in progress in negotiations with the government over export taxes on farm goods. Farmers stage a ""tractorazo"" in Esperanza, Argentina, on March 12 in protest against taxes on exports of soybeans. Argentine television news channel Todo Noticias showed images of trucks and cars stopped along rural routes in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios on Thursday. In the town of Armstrong, 250 miles northwest of the capital of Buenos Aires, protesters stopped traffic on Route 9, burned car tires and waved Argentine flags. The roadblocks were the latest in a year-long conflict between the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Argentina's large farming sector over export taxes on soybeans. Argentina is the world's third-largest soybean exporter. The country has been hard hit by recent drops in global commodities prices, as well as a severe drought. Last year, demonstrations by farmers caused food shortages and blocked farm products from leaving the country. On Thursday farmers once again mounted roadblocks after lawmakers failed to reach quorum in Congress to debate a bill that would reduce the 35 percent soybean export tax. As farmers gathered Thursday afternoon on the nation's highways, Fernandez was announcing new money-sharing measures. ""Soy revenues will go to a fund that will be shared with the provinces and municipalities,"" Fernandez told lawmakers at the presidential residence in Olivos. ""Seventy percent of the fund will be controlled by the federal government and 30 percent by governors and local officials."" ""It's never been our intention to take anything away from anyone,"" she said, alluding to complaints from farmers that the export taxes on soybeans were unfair. The president said $1.776 billion from the fund would be used for social infrastructure needs -- ""schools, houses, drinking water, sewers."" Fernandez cited ""the moment of international crisis"" as the reason for her decision to create ""a federal solidarity fund."" But farm leaders criticized the announcement as a political move during an election year. Fernandez has sent a bill to Congress that would move mid-term congressional elections up four months, from October to June. ""The government again will lose again with ideas like these; this is an attitude that will only serve to provoke farmers,"" Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation told Todo Noticias. ""The people are still being strangled by these taxes.""","Roadblocks are the latest in a year-long conflict over export taxes on soybeans .

"(CNN)  -- People who go to Daytona Beach, Florida, by car this weekend will probably wish they hadn't -- they'll definitely stand out in a crowd. Bobby Mitchell, left, and Sheila Justin enjoy Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida. The city is being taken over by half a million motorcycle enthusiasts enjoying Bike Week, which began Friday and will end Sunday. The economy may be in a recession, but bikers aren't passing up the chance to soak up some sun and rev up their engines for a few days in Florida for the biggest motorcycle event in the country. ""Every indication we've had so far is that this year's going to be a good one,"" said Kevin Kilian, senior vice president of the Daytona Beach/Halifax Area Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is the managing arm of the city's involvement in Bike Week, a 10-day event that Kilian said takes an entire year to prepare for. Events like Bike Week and its little brother, Biketoberfest, are what keep Daytona Beach running, Kilian said. With 8.5 million visitors each year, special events bring in about $1.3 billion. The two biker events alone generate $650 million of that, he said. The festival didn't always pack in a half-million people, though. In 1988, said Paul Crow, the Daytona Beach police chief at the time, the event had morphed into something very different from what it was when it started. He said he had to battle what he called ""the 1 percent problem"" -- the small group of gangs whose viciousness and threats against outsiders had allowed them to take over Bike Week. He decided he wouldn't have any more of their troublemaking, Crow said, so he created a task force that evolved into the office of special investigations for the Daytona Beach Police. Its specific purpose was to deal with the problem. Today, Bike Week has been restored as family-friendly event. The event has even drawn in other nearby Central Florida communities -- including Ormond Beach in the north and Port Orange and New Smyrna in the south -- giving bikers more events to attend and places to go. Bike Week caters to a wide demographic of people. ""These are people with a lot of disposable income,"" Kilian said. ""They can afford a $30,000 toy."" Factors like the economy and this year's long hard winter probably got people more excited about Bike Week because it's a chance to get away, he said. ""Everybody needs a break."" Ken Logan, 50, a radio producer from Orlando, Florida, has been going to Bike Week for four years. He said he goes to ""keep updated on motorcycle stuff as far as styles, what's done to them, meet people who enjoy bikes, to get patches and all the toy stuff, so to speak, and enjoy other people who enjoy the same thing."" The ride from Orlando is only 35 minutes, and he said that's half the fun. ""Everybody should go -- whether you have a bike or not -- at least once, just to take it in and see what it's about,"" Logan said. Bobby Mitchell, 52, also a radio producer in Orlando, grew up in Daytona Beach and has been going to Bike Week his entire life. He said it's been more fun in recent years, though. ""It's more fun when you actually have a motorcycle,"" he said. ""You get out there and ride alongside people. You're part of the roar, the noise."" Not only is Bike Week becoming more family-friendly, but it's more diverse as well, with more women participants, said Kathleen Tolleson, president and CEO of Roar Motorcycles. There's even a ""sisterhood bikeride"" in which 35 to 50 women ride together. Daytona Beach-based Roar Motorcycles specifically markets accessories and motorcycles for women. This year, Tolleson said, the company is unveiling a new motorcycle designed by women and made specifically for women and their needs. ""It's becoming more culturally acceptable, so more and more women are riding."" she said. The bike has a lower seat so that a woman can use her legs and hips when picking the bike off the stand, and can put her feet firmly on the ground when stopped. Most bikes are designed for men, who have more upper body strength and longer limbs. ""Women,"" she said, ""need a lower center of gravity."" The company is taking orders now, and the bikes will be available in six to nine months.","Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida, began Friday and ends Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Incumbent leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika has won a third term in office after a landslide victory in Algeria's presidential election, media reports said Friday. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika arrives to cast his vote at a school in Algiers. Bouteflika's victory came despite calls from his political opponents for voters to boycott the polls. They claim the election was a charade, with the other presidential candidates -- from left-wing parties to Islamists -- standing no real chance. The 72-year-old was elected with over 90 percent of the vote, Reuters.com quoted the official in charge of organizing Thursday's presidential election as saying. ""Bouteflika has won ... 90.24 percent of the votes cast,"" Interior Minister Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni told a news conference. Algerian lawmakers, most of them loyal to the president, cleared the way for him to stand for re-election last year by abolishing constitutional term limits. Critics said that would allow him to serve as president-for-life. Supporters of Bouteflika say he deserves credit for steering the North African country, an oil and gas producer, back to stability after a bloody civil conflict in the 1990s that killed an estimated 150,000 people. But critics say he is using the threat of renewed violence from Islamic militants to mask the country's deepening economic problems. ""I continue to regard the restoration of civil peace as a national priority, as long as hotbeds of tension and pockets of subversion survive,"" Bouteflika, running for a third term, said in his final campaign speech on Monday, Reuters.com reported. He has also promised to spend $150 billion on development projects and create 3 million jobs, his remedy for an economy in which energy accounts for about 96 percent of exports but where other sectors have been choked by red tape and under-investment.","Bouteflika, 72, win third term comfortably with 90 percent of vote .

"(OPRAH.com) -- The recession has millions of consumers spending less, saving more and paying off debt. The fact that we are adjusting to the reality of this economy is good news, to be sure. There are items in any budget that can be scaled back easily. Financial expert Jean Chatzky warns there are items you should not cut out of your budget. But there's some spending areas where you shouldn't budge. Retirement planning . The Pension Rights Center counted about 20 corporations in December that announced changes to their 401(k) plans. Many others have discontinued or downsized their traditional pension plans. If your company is still offering matching dollars, you should keep kicking in money to grab them. ""To get that free money from your employer is so important for the long-term growth of your retirement nest egg. Especially now, with the down market, when you're dollar-cost averaging in at lower prices, that free money has more value in the long run,"" said Derek Kennedy, a financial planner in Cincinnati. If your company has cut back, it still pays to contribute. Also consider an Individual Retirement Account. You can get your money out any time and, after five years, use it without penalty for a first-time home purchase. Insurance . Don't cut your homeowners insurance thinking that because home values have dropped you don't need as much coverage. What you're paying for is the amount it would cost to rebuild your home and replace your belongings. If you need to save, boost your policy's deductible. Raising it to $1,000 from $500 could shave 25 percent off the cost. Exercise . Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota just completed a study that found that people who go to the gym at least eight times a month have significantly lower health costs than those who don't. You can get those same benefits by going for a brisk walk, running or riding a bike or by spending less than the cost of a monthly gym membership on a pair of dumbbells. Healthcare . Some cuts are fine -- generic drugs instead of name brand, for instance. But skipping doctor visits is a bad idea, and so is canceling your insurance. ""I've seen so many people go through horrendous financial nightmares and even bankruptcy because they don't have health insurance. This is just not one you want to mess with,"" said Jonni McCoy, author of ""Miserly Moms: Living Well on Less in a Tough Economy."" Charity . Giving to others can make you feel better about yourself and your situation. If money is tight, donate items you no longer use, give canned goods, shop at thrift stores that benefit a charity or share some of your time. Oprah.com: Five steps to secure your financial future .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Comic book fans have been waiting for years for a film to be made of ""Watchmen,"" the famed graphic novel about a group of misfit crimefighters battling a plot to eliminate their members while the world awaits nuclear war. Malin Akerman, who plays the second Silk Spectre, says ""Watchmen"" will make fans proud. Now that the film is complete and set for release Friday, the cast of the adaptation is confident the movie will meet fans' high expectations. ""We've heard a few comments from diehard fans where they're just saying, 'Wow, we're really impressed,' "" said Malin Akerman, who plays Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II in the movie. Praising director Zack Snyder, whose resume includes the highly successful ""300"" and ""Dawn of the Dead,"" Akerman said the film will make fans proud. ""This is just sort of a huge feat for Zack to take on. But him being a true fan, he came in with the mind of these fanboys and really kept that in mind and I think that he did a great job,"" she said. ""Watchmen"" had a long road to the screen. The original comic book series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons came out in 1986 and 1987 and was compiled into a book. Since then it has been considered both brilliant -- it made Time magazine's list of the 20th century's greatest novels -- and unfilmable.  Watch ""Watchmen"" stars talk about the film at its premiere » . Rights passed from studio to studio, with any number of directors attached (including Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass), before ending up with Warner Bros. (like CNN, a division of Time Warner) and Snyder. A longtime fan himself, Snyder said he was determined to remain true to the book. ""Zack respected the source material so much that he knew the only way to adapt it was to hew as close to the source material as possible,"" said Snyder's wife and producing partner, Deborah Snyder. EW: A ""Watchmen"" primer . Jackie Earle Haley, who stars in the film as Rorschach, said Snyder's passion for the film will lead to its success among dedicated fans. ""I think the film does to the comic book film genre what ['Watchmen'] the comic book does to the comic book genre,"" Haley said. ""I think Zack captured it ... and it's just an in-your-face, kick-butt comic book film, but it's got that extra depth, it's a little smarter."" Fans of the comic book have been scrutinizing the film ""every step of the way,"" said Jeffrey Dean Morgan. But, he added, ""It's going to blow people away even with these high frigging expectations that everybody has."" Indeed, there have been any number of challenges. The comic book is set in an alternative 1985 in which the United States and Soviet Union are on the verge of nuclear war, so there were period details to attend to. There are some superhero accessories, such as a flying machine nicknamed Archie, as well as the character Dr. Manhattan, a blue, extremely powerful and often naked Superman type. Carla Gugino lost herself in the part of Sally Jupiter, an early female crimefighter who is the mother of Akerman's character. That immersion -- which included age makeup for scenes in which Sally is in her 60s -- made the film easier to watch, she said. ""I look at it and don't feel like I'm watching myself, which then liberates you, because I am my own worst, harshest critic,"" she said. ""There was something about watching Sally older and I was like, 'Oh, that seems like a different woman ...' and I can sort of see her for what she is."" iReport.com: Are you excited for ""Watchmen""? Billy Crudup, who plays Dr. Manhattan, said seeing himself transformed with the effects of computer-generated imaging was astonishing. ""I was totally flabbergasted by the level of detail and sophistication that went into making Dr. Manhattan real,"" he said. In some cases, the actors were as excited as they expect fans to be. Morgan enjoyed delving deep into the character of Edward Blake, or The Comedian, and said the role allowed him to live his childhood dream. ""We got to play superheroes. We got to do something that I used to do when I was 12 years old,"" he said. ""This is always the guy that I wanted to be when I was 12 and I get to do it at 40 years old.""

"(CNN) -- Thousands of taxpayers across the country aren't getting their refund or stimulus checks because criminals have stolen their Social Security numbers in an identity theft scam, CNN has learned. Some victims don't learn about identity theft until the IRS questions them about income in their name. ""We see a lot of activity right now, because clearly folks who are trying to perpetrate a fraud have to get their claims in early before a true taxpayer files their return,"" said Nina Olsen, the national taxpayer advocate for the Internal Revenue Service. Olsen, whose independent office is set up to help taxpayers, said her office fielded several thousand complaints this year connected to the scam. The Federal Trade Commission reported that approximately 50,000 taxpayers complained about tax fraud and employment-related identity theft during 2006, compared with 18,000 in 2002. ""It's a huge nightmare,"" Olsen said. ""Basically, their life can be taken over by just about every approach, trying to prove that they are who they are and other people are not. And when you think about how central the Social Security number is to banking, to credit, to school applications, for financial aid, just for everything you can think of -- plus your taxes -- it has a significant impact on a person's life."" That's what happened to Brenton King, a 25-year-old father and student from Orem, Utah. King said he was 17 when someone stole his wallet at a ski resort. Over the past four years, at least five people have used his Social Security number to report income. And since the criminals earned income on his number and never paid taxes, he and his wife, Jennifer, can't get any tax refunds from the IRS or their government stimulus check even though he reported the theft several years ago to police and the IRS. Under the government's economic stimulus plan, 130 million people were supposed to received tax rebate checks from $300 and up last year. ""We want to put that money in the bank,"" Jennifer King said. ""We want to be able to put money down on a home."" The Kings said the ordeal has been frustrating because they know when they file their tax return every year that they won't get the money back that they are owed. Initially, they said, it was difficult dealing with the IRS, which they said made Brenton feel as if he were the criminal. ""The fear is it will happen for the rest of our lives,"" Brenton King said. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, said it takes the IRS an average of about a year ""to sort out who is the real taxpayer."" ""In the meantime, the victim's tax accounts get frozen,"" Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a written statement. ""The IRS issues no refund. The money that the taxpayer was planning on doesn't come. The taxpayer waits in tax limbo, for months and months."" Baucus, who led a hearing into the issue in 2008, said other taxpayers don't learn that they are victims of identity theft until years later. ""Victims first realize that other people are using their identities when the IRS contacts them. The IRS asks them why they did not report the income that appears on W-2 forms with their names on them,"" he said. And Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on Baucus' committee, said the IRS doesn't do enough to combat tax-related identity theft. He said the IRS does not prosecute, ""and that's not very helpful. It sends a signal that you get a free pass if you're using IRS instruments."" But IRS spokesman Dean Patterson called preventing identity theft ""a top priority"" for federal tax collectors and said, ""we are committing significant resources to address the challenges posed in protecting taxpayers' identity information."" ""We have established a special unit dedicated to resolving tax issues incurred by identity theft victims and special tracking codes to monitor returns and prevent further fraud,"" Patterson said in a written statement. ""Potential identity theft victims can contact the IRS if they suspect fraud."" The IRS said it ""vigorously prosecutes identity thieves to the fullest extent of the law using tax-related laws that result in the toughest penalties possible."" The agency said it was unable to provide details of how many cases it prosecuted, however. In the meantime, the Kings have signed up with Lifelock, a private company that helps identity-theft victims. Todd Davis, the company's CEO, said cases like theirs are ""like getting a disease that's incurable."" ""Look, once your information has been compromised, it's not like when they steal your car,"" Davis said. ""Once they steal your car, you file a police report, you do an insurance claim or whatever it may be, you get your replacement car, it's over. Once they have your personal information, as exemplified by this couple in Utah, this information could be used over and over by multiple people.""","Tax fraud reports jump between 2002 and 2006, FTC reports .

"(CNN) -- More timely now than when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008, ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" an agreeable, midrange independent film, makes light work of heavy burdens. Amy Adams gets to work cleaning up as Rose in the indie comedy ""Sunshine Cleaning."" Sisters Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Emily Blunt) struggle with menial jobs and periods of unemployment. Together, they're also coping with the nasty emotional residue of their mom's long-ago suicide -- a trauma that is likely responsible for their current troubles. Self-esteem isn't a strong suit for either of them. As ""Sunshine Cleaning"" dawns, they're both scraping by. If Norah is out of work before we've settled into our popcorn, she's not overly concerned by her situation. Rose, on the other hand, is desperate to graduate from cleaning other people's middle-class homes. It's not just that the humiliation of laundering for her old cheerleader team is getting her down; she needs the money to put her ""difficult"" kid (Jason Spevack) into the kind of school that will give him a chance. It's Rose's married boyfriend -- and old high school sweetheart -- Mac (Steve Zahn) who spies a new niche for the sisters. A homicide detective, he's watching the cleaning crew bag the blown brains of a shotgun enthusiast when he overhears the proprietor of the building grousing about the ""three grand"" it's costing him. Granted, blood and intestinal juices aren't everybody's cup of tea, but that kind of return sure beats washing Mrs. Johansson's drapes for $30 an hour. ""CSM: Crime Scene Maid"" isn't a job you're likely to find down at the employment office, but somebody must be doing the dirty work. Rose and Norah -- incorporated -- find that the stench takes some getting used to, and there's a whole new arsenal of cleaning fluids to master, but they get to work with a positive attitude and like to think they're doing their bit to put the world right. From this unusual setup, the movie might have skewed in any number of ways. The sisters might have uncovered evidence of corruption and murder, for instance, perhaps implicating Mac? ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is nowhere near so abrasive or generic as such a scenario. Written by Megan Holley and directed by Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia""), it instead puts a sympathetic, gentle comic gloss on the characters' fundamentally forgivable foibles and imperfections. Norah tracks down the daughter of one suicide (Mary Lynn Rajskub) to present her with mementos that should have been destined for the junkyard. Blunt's edgy performance keeps us guessing. Norah's a bit of a flake, but she's animated by her anger and her rebellious streak. If she's hard to read, it's because she's still young and doesn't know herself yet. Rose is easier to understand. She's determined to seize this chance to dig herself out of the hole and recapture the promise she used to see in herself. Adams has a knack for putting a brave face on things -- something about the way she tilts her chin up while her mouth goes in three directions at once. She keeps our rooting interest in Rose alive even when her choices seem misguided or naive. A subplot concerning Rose's son bonding with Joe (Alan Arkin), the sisters' lovable but infuriating father (you know the kind: He buys bulk orders of shrimp off the back of a truck) tips us too far into the realm of indie quirk. The character is a useful sounding board, and an amusing grouch, but it's just about impossible to imagine this man bringing up these girls. Ironically, for a movie that's marketed with the one-liner ""Life's a messy business,"" Holley's script has been polished to within an inch of its life. Emotions are experienced most vividly when they're raw, but in ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" feelings come filtered through neat-and-tidy grace notes. The film flirts with dangerous material, but it's too intent on putting the sunny side up to get its hands dirty. The way director Jeffs tells it, not only is suicide painless it can be positively feel-good. That's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy in this well-acted and humanistic comedy. Buoyed by its up-and-coming stars and its optimistic message, it should do very nicely with discriminating audiences. ... It might even clean up.","Tom Charity: Up-and-coming stars, optimistic message buoy ""Sunshine Cleaning""

"Editor's note: This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis.

(CNN) -- At age 23 and fresh out of college, Eliot Kohan was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia. He was told he had four months to live. He survived. But the disease left him and his wife, Lindsay De Vore, who live in St. Paul, Minnesota, saddled with thousands of dollars of medical bills on top of their student loans and daily expenses. But their struggles taught them an important lesson in saving money.

""My goal was to keep moving forward. I wanted to create some stability for our us."" All of that hard work saving for the past few years has paid off. The couple is elated to be closing next month on their first home in St. Paul, thanks to the troubled economy. De Vore and Kohan first told their story on CNN's iReport.com. Share your economic survivor story with CNN. The timing couldn't have been better for the couple to purchase a modest three-bedroom, one-story stucco house. De Vore and Kohan locked into a historically low mortgage rate of 4.9 percent this month. The couple selected a foreclosed home, slashing nearly $20,000 off the final price. ""We wouldn't have been able to buy this house if the economy weren't the way it is,"" said De Vore, 25, who works in the financial aid office at a private college in St. Paul. ""We were in the perfect position."" There were more than 300,000 foreclosure filings reported nationwide in December, marking a 17 percent increase from the previous month and a 41 percent increase from December 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure listing service. Meanwhile, unemployment continues to climb to rates unseen in decades. Yet the rocky economy is having a positive effect on some Americans, who are finding it the ideal time to buy a home. Similar to many married couples, Kohan and De Vore envisioned owning a house perhaps two or three years down the road, they say. Soon the couple says they noticed interest rates and home prices dipping so low that they found themselves nabbing a home as soon as they could afford the down payment. But the couple's ability to afford their first home is a story about fiscal responsibility, patience and determination. De Vore and Kohan, who met in their freshman year at St. Paul's Hamline University in 2002, moved into a two-bedroom apartment during their last year of college. For the past five years, they have remained in the same collegiate apartment, furnished with Craigslist finds and family hand-me-downs. ""Money was a reason we've stayed here so long,"" Kohan said last week, bundled up with his wife because their apartment's heater broke. ""But at a certain point, we felt like we were growing out of it in more ways than just physically. We wanted a change of pace."" The couple says they've always been tight with money, keeping credit card usage limited to emergencies and being picky about what they spend their money on. But they became more ""money-conscious"" in June 2006, when Kohan was diagnosed with leukemia. He needed a costly stem cell transplant, and the couple did not have enough money. The sickness was evident in his frail face and bruised body. Luckily, when he went on leave from his job, his employers offered to hold his position until he recovered. Back in his hometown of Fergus Falls, a small city in western Minnesota, Kohan's family and friends threw a benefit, raising $12,000 toward the costly medical bills. He soon recovered, but the experience forced him to refocus his goals in life, including buying a house.. The couple began saving in small ways. They bring their lunch to work and eat out only once or twice a month. They cut extra expenses that many couples in their 20s enjoy, such as nights at bars with friends and date nights to the movie theater. To save on gas money, Kohan takes public transportation, a 45-minute bus ride each way, to downtown Minneapolis for work. ""The house was a big motivation,"" says De Vore, who tracks their expenses meticulously each month. When the couple married a year after his leukemia diagnosis, she opted for a small, intimate wedding. That helped cut costs too, she said. They waited nearly nine months before heading on their honeymoon trip. Instead of a grand trip abroad, they settled for a smaller trip to Orlando, Florida. Knowing that higher education would help her earn more, De Vore is taking night classes to earn her master's degree in student affairs. Her tuition is free because she chose to attend the university where she works. By December, the couple began to realize all the saving had amounted to a down payment on a home. They wanted to invest in a home for at least 10 years, they say, so they can try to build equity. De Vore found the home through a real estate agent on her lunch break one afternoon in early January. It was ""nothing fancy,"" she says, but the 1960s ranch-style house had a spacious kitchen and a small yard with enough space for a dog that they want. She knew instantly that it would be their new home, she says. ""We worked hard. We didn't cut corners,"" she said. ""We did everything we did to get here, and it's worth it, to our opinion.""","The couple will close on their first home next month in St. Paul, Minnesota .

"(CNN) -- Emmy-winning Patrick McGoohan, the actor who created one of British television's most surreal thrillers, has died aged 80, according to British media reports. Fans holding placards of Patrick McGoohan recreate a scene from 'The Prisoner' to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the show in 2007. The Press Association, quoting his son-in-law Cleve Landsberg, reported he died in Los Angeles after a short illness. McGoohan, star of the 1960s show 'The Danger Man,' is best remembered for writing and starring in 'The Prisoner' about a former spy locked away in an isolated village who tries to escape each episode. The Internet Movie Data Base Web site says the ""mysterious final episode caused such an uproar that McGoohan was to desert England for more than 20 years."" In a long career in TV and movies, he was King Edward Longshanks in 'Braveheart,' and he won two Emmys for work on the 'Columbo' series starring Peter Falk. He also did a voiceover on 'The Simpsons' cartoon of his character in 'The Prisoner.' He was born in Astoria, New York to Irish emigrants but the family returned to Ireland shortly afterwards. McGoohan was raised in Ireland and England.","Actor Patrick McGoohan dies age 80, media reports .

"(CNN) -- Watch out! Lock up your loved ones! Another bloated, over-produced, high-concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at Dreamworks Animation, and it's out to devour your kids. Susan, aka ""Ginormica,"" has to save the world in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" But don't be too alarmed. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is relatively harmless -- a toothless satire with a knee-jerk feminist theme and a sorry excuse for a plot. That sounds harsh, I know. Who doesn't want to see a 50-foot woman careening through San Francisco on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby? But think about that, just for a second. Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels. Try it with motorcars and you won't get very far. Is that too picky? Perhaps, but you wouldn't find Pixar playing so fast and loose with the laws of physics, and that kind of inattention to detail is typical of the lackadaisical storytelling here and in other Dreamworks animated features. (The talent pool for this one includes the directors of ""Shrek 2"" and ""Shark Tale"" and the writers of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""The Rocker,"" incidentally.) High concepts, top-notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script. The XXXL lady in question -- dubbed ""Ginormica"" by her U.S. military guards -- starts out plain and petite Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), until a meteorite hits her just minutes before she's supposed to tie the knot with unctuous chauvinist Derek (Paul Rudd). Her rapid growth spurt saves her from that particular fate worse than death, even if at first glance her new roommates don't look like much of an improvement. There's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a mad scientist who semi-advertently mutated with a bug; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) an amorphous blue jelly-like blob who gets on just fine without a brain; Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gung-ho amphibian who's all mouth; and a giant dust mite called Insectosaurus who isn't voiced by anyone because he doesn't have anything to say. Sci-fi fans will have fun counting off the references to myriad classics -- ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Invaders from Mars,"" ""The Fly,"" ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" ""The Blob,"" ""Mothra"" and ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman,"" for starters -- and noting a few clever bits and pieces (Kiefer Sutherland, as General W.R. Monger, riffs on George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove""). The trouble is, once the introductions are over, the filmmakers can only launch their desperately limp plot: The White House turns to these monstrous superheroes to save the planet from evil Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson), a squidlike creature with four eyes and twice as many legs, and a one-eyed tin robot to do his dirty work for him. Ginormica gets a kick-butt finale, and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie's president. (In a genuinely witty casting touch he's voiced by Stephen Colbert.) That may be good politics or at least a sound marketing decision from the studio's perspective -- it's been awhile since a family animated feature produced a genuinely strong female character (unless you count ""Coraline,"" which was way too scary for my family) -- but Susan's self-esteem is an awfully long time coming. iReport.com: What do you think of 'Monsters vs. Aliens'? (Bizarrely -- and maybe it's just my imagination -- Gallaxhar bears a passing resemblance to President Obama. I wonder ... would that make Susan/Ginormica a surrogate for Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton?) Visually, too, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is undistinguished, although its shortcomings may be disguised if you seek out the 3-D version. Funny how 3-D movies tend to produce two-dimensional characters, with ""Coraline"" again the exception to the rule. Jocular and unpretentiously trashy, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" should be a lot of fun -- and it is, in places. But the truth is it's as hung up on itself as Susan's preening fiance.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A light earthquake shook Southern California Thursday evening, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The magnitude 4.5 quake struck at 7:50 p.m. (10:50 p.m. ET) and was centered in San Bernardino, about 55 miles east of Los Angeles. A smaller magnitude 3.3 aftershock hit about an hour later. Although the quake was centered just a mile from San Bernadino's city hall, it was 10 miles below the surface, said Dr. Egill Hauksson, a seismologist with the Earthquake Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. ""It's unlikely that there's going to be damage,"" said Hauksson said. There are about 10 quakes of this strength every year in this area, he said. Initial estimates put the quake at a magnitude 5.0, but it was downgraded shortly afterward. The USGS said people reported feeling the earthquake as far away as San Diego.","Southern California shaken by light quake Thursday evening .

"(CNN) -- Sooner or later, James Richter knows the rabbit-ear antennas on his old-fashioned television will listen for a signal and hear nothing. Old TV sets at a California recycling center last month. Many analog TV owners aren't ready to switch to digital. The 36-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, said he tried to convert his analog TV to digital but was turned down for a government coupon. He doesn't seem to mind. ""With the economy, I don't have enough cash to do cable, so I'm just really debating whether or not I really want to make that switch to digital,"" Richter said. Richter will have four months longer to make up his mind after Congress voted Wednesday to delay the end of TV's rabbit-ears era. On June 12, analog TV signals will end and only digital signals will remain. Old televisions like Richter's won't accept the new form of broadcast. People with cable TV or satellite service will not be affected. The switch had been scheduled for February 17, but Congress delayed the conversion -- which had been planned for years -- to accommodate people like Richter who had not been able to update their TVs. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration offered a program to help people buy converter boxes that make old TVs work in the new era. That giveaway didn't meet demand, though, and as of late January, more than 3.2 million people were on the program's waiting list. More than 6.5 million U.S. households, or 5.7 percent, were not ready for the crossover last month, according to an estimate from the Nielsen Company. There's been little made of the people behind those numbers, though, as media reports largely have focused on the mechanics of the switch and the politics of when and how it will happen. Many of those who haven't bought converters are poor, older than 55, rural residents or racial minorities, according to Nielsen's estimates. Some of them told CNN they couldn't afford to pay for cable or satellite TV service. While a person can live without TV, some of the late converts to digital depend on television for information and companionship. ""I live here by myself, so it will be a big deal for me,"" said Monica Lawson, a 42-year-old from rural Alto, Georgia. ""Even just a couple hours a day of having that extra interaction, it's a stress reliever for me."" Lawson said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available. She's attached the box to her TV, but her signal got worse. ""Basically I'm downgrading at this point,"" she said. ""I'll go from having four or five channels I can watch on a regular basis to having one channel I can watch every now and then -- if at all."" Lawson, who is a real-estate appraiser and practices kinesiology, said she can't afford satellite service because her business has dropped with the economy. She falls into a category of people who may lose their TV coverage with the switch to digital. It's likely the result of a phenomenon called the ""cliff effect."" While analog signals fizzle out over long distances, digital signals tend to stop completely at a certain falling-off point. ""With digital, you get a great picture or nothing,"" said Mark Wigfield, spokesperson for the Federal Communications Commission. Some remote areas of the country could lose reception when analog signals stop in June, said Shermaze Ingram, spokesperson for the National Association of Broadcasters, an advocacy group that has been trying to inform people about the switch since 2006. On the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said. The National Association of Broadcasters supports delaying the change until June in part because it will cause fewer people to go without TV after the change. ""There's no question that television is an important piece of the fabric of American life,"" Ingram said. Congress elected to delay the digital switch in part because lawmakers don't want people to go without TV. George Touchine, a 64-year-old from Gallup, New Mexico, said he has not gotten a converter coupon yet and cannot find the device in local stores. He said he will check back often, though, and hopes to be able to switch to digital in the coming days. Like Touchine, more than 12 percent of New Mexico households in the Santa Fe and Albuquerque TV market are not ready for the switch, making the area the least prepared in the nation, according to Nielsen. Being left out of the switch would be a big deal for Touchine. He is retired and says he spends a substantial part of his evening watching TV with his wife. ""I just watch the news all the time, that's all I want,"" he said. ""I get the weather, the news, what's going on -- all of it -- I want to know it."" The annoyance of having to convert to digital may push Richter, the man in Atlanta, away from television entirely. iReport.com: 'You snooze, you lose' Richter said he left a bad job as a local truck driver four years ago and hasn't been able to find steady work since. He's given up luxuries like cable TV, an Internet connection and movie rentals to make ends meet. He said he applied for the free converter about a month ago but was turned down at least temporarily because all of the coupons had been given out. He doesn't buy the idea that he needs a television to alert him about emergencies or severe weather. ""I do have a radio and I also have a cell phone. If something's really, really bad, someone can call me,"" he said. ""And I figure if there's a nuclear war, it will be everywhere. Someone will let me know."" If Richter eventually gets a free converter box, he'll consider joining the digital TV world. But if not, he said won't be angry at the government for the delays. He thinks he might be better off without all that extra noise.","Congress delays nationwide switch to digital TV until June 12 .

"(CNN) -- Lessons learned from previous successful airliner ditchings helped pilot C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger save 155 lives when he put his US Airways A320 jetliner down in the Hudson River, a fellow pilot told CNN. An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 is seen just before it crashes into the sea off the Comoro Islands in 1996. Twenty-three people died when an Overseas National Airways DC-9 ditched off the Caribbean island of St. Croix in 1970, and 123 were killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 off the Comoro Islands near Africa in 1996. But Emilio Corsetti, an Airbus 320 pilot and aviation author, said those ditchings were actually successful ""because people were able to get out"" -- 40 in the 1970 crash and 52 in the 1996 incident. More may have survived if those planes were equipped like the Airbus 320 and if passengers followed standard evacuation procedures, Corsetti told CNN.  Watch how to survive a plane crash » . In fact, Corsetti said, the 1970 crash helped lead to a redesign of seat belts. The belts aboard the DC-9 were ""metal-to-fabric,"" Corsetti said, depending upon tension to keep passengers strapped in their seats. ""Those things gave out... People were thrown out of their seats 10 rows up,"" said Corsetti, who has written a book, ""35 Miles from Shore,"" about the 1970 crash. On the Hudson River on Thursday, the impact was like ""being inside a car that crashes,"" passenger Alberto Panero said. Corsetti also said that the DC-9 didn't have life raft capacity for all those aboard. Unlike the A320's escape slides, which helped dozens of passengers get out, the DC-9s rafts could hold only three or four. In the 1996 crash, the Ethiopian Airlines 767 was attempting a water landing off the Grand Comoro Island during a hijacking. The plane had run out of fuel. While it is uncertain whether there was a struggle in the cockpit, video shows the 767 nearing the ocean's surface. As it does, the plane's left engine hits a reef, Corsetti said, sending it into a cartwheel. He said the majority of the 123 who died drowned. They had put on life vests and inflated them before they could get out of the splintered fuselage, he said, and were trapped against the bulkheads as water filled the wreckage. Sullenberger had other advantages, too, Corsetti said. Putting the jetliner down into the placid Hudson River probably helped him keep the plane level. The DC-9 pilot faced 8- to 15-foot seas in the 1970 ditching and the Ethiopian jet was dealing with offshore waves.  Watch a pilot describe how plane went down » . The A320 also is equipped with a ditching button, Corsetti said, which closes all valves below the waterline, enabling it to float more easily. No matter the lessons learned from the earlier crashes, US Airways passengers were happy Sullenberger was in the cockpit Thursday. ""He's the man! He's absolutely the man!"" passenger Vince Spera said. ""If you want to talk to a hero, get a hold of him because that is the hero in this whole deal."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","Lessons from 1970 DC-9 ditching into Caribbean, 1996 crash off Comoro Islands .
