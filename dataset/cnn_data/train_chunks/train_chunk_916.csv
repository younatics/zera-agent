"By . Jill Reilly . At the end of a night of drinking many people wish they could quickly be at home in their beds rather than standing in line for a taxi. And now that dream is a reality with the creation of a studio flat in London which can transform from a mini-bar/private club into a cosy home. At just 30 square metres (323 sqft) in size and costing £625 per week, the fourth floor studio flat is one of the smallest homes ever released onto the Mayfair market - and one of the more original. Its interior design is a bar/nightclub theme - meaning its future tenant could entertain friends and family before climbing into bed only a few metres away. At just 30 square metres (323 sqft) in size the fourth floor studio flat is one of the smallest homes ever released onto the Mayfair market . The flat has a coffered ceiling with light features and a cocktail-bar shelving with wall mirrors and LED shelving . The size of a cloakroom or bathroom, the pad is designed with a cocktail bar/night-club style interior. In the corner is a black-metallic bar paneled with gold edges, complete with bar-stools. There is a coffered ceiling with light features and cocktail-bar shelving with wall mirrors and LED shelving. The flat is kitted out in Louis Vuitton style dark-wood panelled fitted cupboards and ebony coloured faux leather flooring. It even has an outside cocktail terrace complete with table and chairs. The club theme runs throughout - even the Art Nouveau style bathroom with its black and gold patterned mosaics; club lights; gold and silver feature butterflies feels like something out of Claridges rather than a small studio flat.

Hidden within the bar is a hob, oven, drawers and cupboards allowing the space to convert into a kitchen, with the worktop and bar-stools providing a breakfast/dining area . The private club theme runs throughout the Mayfair home - even the lavish Art Nouveau style bathroom has black and gold patterned mosaics decorating it . The bathroom also have Deco lights; gold and silver feature butterflies feels like something out of Claridges rather than a small studio flat . But behind the cocktail-bar exterior are all the features required to convert the space into a cosy home. Hidden within the bar is a hob, oven, drawers and cupboards allowing the space to convert into a kitchen, with the worktop and bar-stools providing a breakfast/dining area. The sofa and drinks area converts into a bedroom suite for when revelers get tired and want to retire for the night. The wall paneling opens to reveal a split-built in cupboard/wardrobe with one side serving as storage for clothing and accessories and the other a fold-away utility room with a washing machine, shelving for ironing board and other domestic appliances. Although it may be one of the smallest apartments to be offered in Mayfair, it does include an outside cocktail terrace complete with table and chairs . The view from the Mayfair flat stretches across the rooftops of neighbouring properties - this could be yours if you're happy to pay £625 a week for rent . Peter Wetherell, Chief Executive of Wetherell comments: 'Whilst this might be one of the smallest homes ever released onto the Mayfair market, it is also one of the most clever interior design schemes Wetherell have been instructed to promote' Peter Wetherell, Chief Executive of Wetherell comments: 'Whilst this might be one of the smallest homes ever released onto the Mayfair market, it is also one of the most clever interior design schemes Wetherell have been instructed to promote. 'It’s a place that needs to be seen to be understood. The design is ingenious: the living space can be arranged to provide a cocktail bar/night-club style ambience, the next, it can be transformed into a cosy home with kitchen, dining area and bedroom. 'The pad is perfect as either a pied-a-terre or a cosy main home for a singleton who likes entertaining and a home rich in character and style. For someone after studio-chic this is the ultimate pad in Mayfair!' For those happy to part with $625 a week and who are looking for somewhere bigger - but less luxurious - there are a few other options. Two properties in Mayfair are going for a similar rate as Wetherell's bar-themed apartment. Although devoid of its unique bar-style interior, what the two homes lose in luxury they make up for in space. This property, located in Grosvenor Square, costs £650 per week to rent. The 56 square metre one-bedroom flat is on the sixth floor of its building block and boasts an open plan reception, bedroom and bathroom, with city views, a lift and 24 hour porter . Another option is this single-bedroom Hay Hill apartment, costing a low £580 per week. It measures 57 square metres and is located on the fifth floor just off Berkeley Square. Again, it boasts lift access and a 24 hour porter and is located close to Piccadilly .","Flat just 30 square metres (323 sqft) in size is one of the smallest apartments ever released on Mayfair market .

"By . Aap . and Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . Joanna Abernethy was found dead at 3.38am local time on Saturday on the side of a highway in eastern Indiana after being struck by a vehicle . An Australian mother has been killed whilst on a cycling quest to complete a trip of a lifetime across America. Canberra high school teacher Joanna Abernethy was found dead on the side of a highway at 3.38am local time on Saturday. She was hit by a car in eastern Indiana, 500 miles away from her final destination Washington DC, just five days before she planned to complete her trek. Abernethy began her planned 7,200km journey on May 7 from Astoria, Oregon, to arrive at Washington DC on Thursday, August 14 to honour her hero Martin Luther King Jr. She estimated the trip would take three months. Along the way she made friends with residents offering a warm bed for the night, a shower, food and cash to help with her journey. Among them was Missouri resident and avid cyclist Frank Briscoe. 'She was such a good person who was full of determination and it was refreshing to see that,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We became instant friends and even though we had only known each other for 24 hours I knew we would be friends forever.' Briscoe said he was devastated to hear the news when he was contacted by her half-brother Jake. He informed Briscoe that it is likely that his sister was hit by a drunk driver. Briscoe, a member of the Warm Showers Organisation which offers cyclists on tours a warm and safe place to stay, first met Abernethy on July 31. 'She inspired me and I'm so proud of her tribute ride,' he said. Briscoe was so taken with Abernethy and her inspirational story he penned an article for his local paper, the Nevada Daily Mail, on August 2, but just days later he discovered his new friend was dead. 'I was devastated,' he said. 'I just sat and cried.' The 53-year-old mother was on the trip of a lifetime riding across America alone . Joanna was due to arrive at her destination - Washington DC - on Thursday, August 14 . Abernethy's big adventure was born a year ago when out of the blue, she decided she wanted to cycle alone across America. She wasn't an experienced cyclist which prompted Briscoe to advise his new friend against cycling late at night. 'But she was on a mission and she had a lot of miles to catch up on,' he said. When Abernethy started training she borrowed her teenage daughter Orly's Malvern Star bike and clocked up kilometres around Canberra. She eventually upgraded to the more suitable Vivente touring bike and bought a ticket to the US. Abernethy started a blog to detail her long journey and in it she explained the impact King, who was assassinated in Memphis in 1968, had on her. 'Like many people, Martin Luther King's life touched me deeply, because of his willingness to face into the frightening maelstrom of the times he lived in, that was necessary to bring about change,' she wrote. 'He did it with such courage, dignity, love and hope, so that all of us could have a better world. 'That is so deeply moving, and rare and was a much needed step in the evolution of consciousness, a gift for humanity, and of course a very big price to pay and sacrifice. 'I felt this well worth paying tribute to, so my hope is to share this with people by doing this ride.' Abernethy reflected on her decision in her final blog post on April 27 - a week before she embarked on her trip to the US. 'I suppose most people would like to think that they made a difference, that it meant something to be here, and we weren't just taking up space in the grand scheme of things,' she wrote. Frank Briscoe said he became instant friends with Joanna when they first met on July 31 . The Wayne County Sheriff's Department, near the Indiana and Ohio border, has launched an investigation into Abernethy's death. Her body was found on the eastbound side of the four lane US40 highway. A 24-year-old driver of a vehicle, Clifford Henry, may face charges. Wayne County Sheriff Jeff Cappa said the investigation could take 'several weeks' and then the evidence would be forwarded to prosecutors who will review and determine if criminal charges should be laid. Abernethy's family is attempting to come to terms with the loss of the free-spirited teacher. Orly, 19, is being cared for by family and friends in Canberra. 'We were surprised at first,' said Abernethy's brother, Jake, recalling the family reaction to her announcement she was going to cycle across the US. 'But Joanna was interested in spiritual things and this fit with that.' Joanna, mother of a 19-year-old, was hit by a car during her cycling trek. She was just 500 miles away from arriving at her final destination - Washington DC .","Joanna Abernethy was on the trip of a lifetime riding across America alone .

"By . Aap . Newcastle star Darius Boyd has checked out of a Sydney mental health facility following treatment for depression but will not play again this NRL season. The Knights confirmed on Thursday the Queensland State of Origin winger was released from the facility after being admitted three weeks ago. 'Darius Boyd has completed his rehabilitation program for depression in a Sydney mental health facility,' a statement on the Newcastle Knights website said. Scroll down for video . The Newcastle Knights star admitted himself into a Sydney facility on July 23 after problems with his mental health continued to escalate . The 27-year-old noted that football had become his only focus in life, revealing that he neglected his family and friends: an attitude which may have led to his wife Kayla (pictured) temporarily leaving him . 'Boyd won't return to playing this season as he continues to focus on his recovery. 'Boyd wishes to thank the club, his teammates and the fans for their support at this time.' Boyd is off contract at the Knights and, with his long-term mentor Wayne Bennett to return to coach Brisbane next season, speculation is rife the 204-game two-time premiership winner will move back north with him. The Knights said in the statement Boyd was yet to make a decision on where he would play next year. Boyd sought treatment at a mental health clinic three weeks ago for depression after he trashed a hotel room on July 17, causing $1,500 worth of damage. The Knights player and a female companion, believed to be his wife Kayla, reportedly left behind a smashed television, broken glass and a hole in one of the walls when they checked out of the Chateau Elan in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, last Thursday. The Daily Telegraph reported the manager of the Hunter Valley resort, Joe Spagnolo, said the incident had not been reported to authorities after the Newcastle Knights player called to apologise and offered to pay for the damage. It's believed Boyd was given a few days off following the State of Origin with Queensland and had booked one night at the resort. The revelation came just two days after it was announced Boyd's coach and career mentor Wayne Bennett was leaving the club to return to the Brisbane Broncos - where they first worked together in 2006. 'I don’t know what the two of them were doing and I don't want to know,' Mr Spagnolo said. 'As long as he came good with the money to repair it. The bill came to $1,500 and he's paid it so that's where it's been left, . He said the pair had spa treatments on Wednesday and believed the damage could have happened later that night. 'It's disappointing but I've seen a lot worse. We've had the CEOs of banks driving cars on to the golf course and doing doughnuts and causing all sorts of damage,' Mr Spagnolo said. 'We get a lot of footballers come in and nine times out of 10, there are no problems.' His admission came less than a week after reports that he'd trashed a hotel room in the Hunter Valley, causing $1,500 worth of damage . The resort's general manager Joe Spagnolo said the incident had not been reported to authorities because Boyd rang to apologise and offered to pay for the damage . At the time of Boyd entering the clinic, Newcastle Knights chief executive Matt Gidley the club's main focus was on the player's health. 'Depression is a serious illness in our society and we are pleased Darius has taken the first step in his recovery by acknowledging he needs help,' Gidley said. 'Football is secondary at this point, it is important Darius' focus is entirely on his treatment.' Speculation about Boyd's future has been rampant since it was announced Bennett would return to the Brisbane side after he quit as Knights coach last month. The fullback was immediately linked to Bennett's movement because he has played under the coach his entire career - following him from Brisbane to St George Illawarra, then to Newcastle. Boyd is tipped to follow his coach yet again back to the Broncos next season.

Darius Boyd has opened up about his troubled past and revealed he will attempt to contact the father he never met and the mother who abandoned him, after spending three weeks in a mental health facility. The Newcastle Knights star admitted himself into a Sydney facility on July 23 due to suffering from depression, which escalated to the point where he would not leave his own home, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'I don't adjust too well to things and there's also an unhappiness with my past and my childhood,' Boyd told the Daily Telegraph.

As part of his battle against depression, Boyd confirmed that he would not appear on the field for the rest of the NRL season in a bid to find a happy life outside of the sport. 'I just want to be open, a happier person. I want to smile,' he told the Daily Telegraph, adding that he would focus on making his family and friends the centre of his attention as he attempted to learn more about himself. The fullback also revealed what he claims is the source of his anger and depression, including his trust issues. Boyd revealed that his former teammate Alex McKinnon's spinal injury  helped tip his mental state over the edge, as he was  unable to cope with his close friend's accident .

He also revealed that eight weeks ago, he received an unexpected letter from the father he had never met or heard from, accompanied by a photograph of three girls who the letter said could possibly be his sisters.

But today, Ms Clarke, 42, said not being able to dance had 'spoiled the show' for her and Kelsey. 'It was ridiculous.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A 3-year-old girl has died in Maryland after she was stabbed and shot by her father, who was then killed in a gun battle with police while fleeing the scene of another crime and leading cops in a high-speed chase. Prince George's County police were called to a home in Camp Spring about 1 pm on Saturday. There they found a man had shot two people, believed to be the girl's maternal grandfather and great-grandmother. The suspect —  Frederick Roy Miller, 38, of Landover — grabbed 3-year-old Laila Miller, jumped into his Nissan Altima and sped away, the Washington Post reported. Miller, a disabled Marine veteran, stopped twice to shoot at officers as he zoomed through nearby Temple Hills. Six cops returned fire at him. The second time police shot back, the suspect was struck and killed. Bullet holes can still be seen in the gray Nissan Altima where police say a 3-year-old girl was found stabbed and shot by her own father after a high-speed chase in Maryland . When police got to Miller's car, they made a heartbreaking discovery. 'There’s a small child in the vehicle we believe to be his biological daughter of the suspect, but we’re still trying to confirm,' Lt. Bill Alexander, of the Prince George’s County Police, told WJZ. 'That young child was also struck some time during the encounter,' he added. We don’t know when, we don’t know by who.' Police on Sunday said that Miller had stabbed and shot 3-year-old Laila, the Washington Post reported. The toddler was taken to the hospital but died later of her injuries. Double shooting: The suspect, Frederick Miller, also shot the girl's grandfather and great-grandmother inside this home in Camp Springs . The grandparents were shot near this garage door, right before Miller sped away with 3-year-old Laila . The other two victims were hospitalized, where they remain in critical condition, according to NBC Washington. The shooting could be related to an ongoing custody fight between Miller and the girl's mother, who was not present during the incident, according to the Washington Post. The parents have been fighting in the court system since after the girl was born in 2011. Miller at first had weekend visitation rights, but was eventually restricted to supervised visits, the paper reported. 'He contacted anybody and everybody to ask for help,' one woman who knows the family told the post. 'All he wanted was to see his daughter.'","Frederick Miller, 38, first shot the girl's grandfather and great-grandmother before leading cops on a high-speed chase through Temple Hills, Maryland .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rick Parfitt will miss his first Status Quo gig since he joined the band in 1967 after doctors told him to rest . Rick Parfitt is to miss his first Status Quo gig since joining the band in 1967 after being told to rest by doctors following surgery. The 65-year-old guitarist had been due to return to the line-up tonight following an operation to correct a problem with his 1997 quadruple heart bypass. But he has now been told to continue his recuperation so a last-minute stand-in has been drafted in for a single show. Freddie Edwards - son of bass player John 'Rhino' Edwards - will step in for the concert at Clumber Park in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Parfitt fell ill during the band’s European tour and was flown home from Croatia to be treated at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London. He had a stent inserted after it was found a graft from his 1997 quadruple heart bypass had become furred. Parfitt said: 'Obviously I’m really disappointed to be missing this show but I’m pleased that Freddie will be able to step up and help the band out whilst I’m recuperating. 'I know all the Quo fans will make him welcome and I’ll be back onstage soon.' His fellow guitarist and long-time sidekick Francis Rossi said: 'It will certainly be strange performing without Rick, but Freddie performed with me when I did my solo tour so I know that he’s got what it takes - and, of course, he’s part of the Quo family.' Parfitt has weathered drink, drug and health problems over the years but the band has never gone ahead with a show without him since his arrival in the line-up. John Edwards said of his son’s opportunity: 'This is going to be an amazing experience for us - what a day for the family.' Parfitt has been cleared to return to the band by the time of their next show at Holkham Hall in Norfolk on August 23. Quo manager Simon Porter said: 'Our priority is, of course, to do everything we can to get Rick back onstage as soon as possible, but we hate letting down the fans and we’re delighted that this show will still go ahead. 'Rick is making a fantastic recovery, but his doctors have yesterday advised just a few more days’ recuperation before hitting the stage again for a full-voltage Quo show. 'This is a real piece of Quo history in the making. Rick will be back soon but, in the meantime, we look forward to welcoming Freddie into the fold for what we are sure will be a memorable one-off.'

Despite his lawyer saying in mitigation that he was the victim of 'uncontrolled teenage rage', Klein was sentenced to eight months after pleading guilty to interstate communication with threat to injure. U.S. Attorney Peter Smith said Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, which runs Hersheypark Stadium, received a call July 5 during which a male caller says, 'If One Direction plays tomorrow, the stadium will blow up.' Smith said the call was tracked to a pay phone at a 7-Eleven in Northfield, N.J., and Klein was identified from surveillance footage. The stadium was placed on lockdown before the concert, followed by a bomb sweep and a check of concertgoers' bags.

"By . Associated Press . Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry vowed Saturday to fight a criminal indictment in a defiant response that showed an old slice of swagger that he's kept holstered lately while seeking to remake his image for a potential 2016 presidential run. Perry called two felony counts of abuse of power issued by an Austin grand jury 'outrageous' and made no apologies for his 2013 veto that prompted a criminal investigation against the longest-serving governor in Texas history. Perry made it clear he will finish his term that ends in January and said it was the investigation against him — and not his actions — that amounted to an abuse of power. A Travis County grand jury on Friday indicted Perry for carrying out a threat to veto state funds to the local district attorney, an elected Democrat, Rosemary Lehmberg, who refused to resign following a drunken-driving arrest. Texas Gov. Rick Perry denounced his indictment for abuse of power, which came after he carried out a threat to veto funding for state public corruption prosecutors . 'We don't settle political differences with indictments in this country,' Perry told reporters outside his office in the Texas Capitol. 'It is outrageous that someone would use political theatrics to rip away at the very fabric of our state's constitution.' Perry, the first Texas governor since 1917 to be indicted, again dismissed the charges as nakedly political and said he would not hesitate to execute a veto under the same circumstances again. 'The details of my decision-making were very clear. I said early on that I was going to clearly veto those dollars as long as they had someone in that office who I had lost confidence in,' Perry said. 'And I had lost confidence.' Perry's veto cut $7.5 million in funding to the state's ethics watchdog housed in the Travis County district attorney's office. A Texas state judge assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the veto following a formal complaint filed by a left-leaning watchdog group, which accused Perry of trying to leverage his power to force the resignation of District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. That unit of public corruption investigators is based in Austin, a liberal haven in mostly conservative Texas and a city that reliably elects Democrats to serve as district attorney. Perry says the charges against him are abuse of power, which is exactly what prosecutors are accusing him of doing . At the time Perry demanded Lehmberg's . resignation, her unit had just begun investigating the Cancer Prevention . and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) - a $3 billion pet project of . Perry's - regarding suspicious state grants disbursed by the Institute . to allies of Perry. Perry said he was confident that he would prevail and vowed that those responsible for this 'farce of a prosecution' would be held accountable. Many Democrats criticized Perry's aggressive reaction to the indictment and accused him of trying to shift the blame. Yet state Sen. Wendy Davis, the face of the party in Texas who's running a high-profile campaign for governor, took a more cautious tone Saturday. 'The charges that were brought down by the grand jury are very, very serious,' Davis said, adding that she trusted the justice system to do its job. Tensions between Republicans and the public integrity unit have simmered for years. Conservatives have long grumbled that the unit operates through a partisan lens and targets Republicans. Former U.S. House Majority Tom DeLay and former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, two Republicans, are among the biggest past names to have been indicted in Travis County on ethics charges. Hutchison was acquitted and an appeals court overturned a guilty verdict against DeLay. In an interview with KVUE.com today, the man behind the campaign to have Perry indicted welcomed the move. Craig McDonald, the founder of Texans for Public Justice, filed the original complaint against Perry last year. 'We think any governor, particularly Rick Perry should consider stepping aside. Any governor under indictment for multiple felonies should step down,' said McDonald. 'The grand jury decided that the governor went way beyond trying to bully the Travis County DA: He crossed the line into law breaking.' On Lehmberg he added: 'She served her time. She was prosecuted for her time, and she did her time. She again then was under prosecution from the county to see if she should give up her job, that judge decided she should not.'","Travis County grand jury indicted Texas Governor Rick Perry on two charges that he abused his position .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . Coming out can be incredibly hard for gay people to do - the fear of how family and friends will react often delays announcement for years, or even decades. But for Vicky Beeching, the decision to tell the world she was a lesbian wasn't just about telling her nearest and dearest, it was was also going to risk shattering her income and having her deported from the country she lived in. For over a decade, the 35-year-old's music has been played across America's bible belt as a soundtrack to modern Christianity. From the age of fourteen, the Brit had been travelling to perform the religious music she wrote at concerts and churches from her family home in Kent. Vicky has written and performed her own Christian music from a very young age, she eventually became one of the biggest religious music stars in the US . After undertaking a Theology degree at Oxford, the success of Vicky's songs took her to across the pond to Nashville, where she got a record contract and proceeded to become a big name in religious music. But despite her career success, the Londoner never had a chance to enjoy how well she was doing, because she was constantly hiding a huge secret - the fact that she is attracted to women. She said: 'My income comes from churches - they have to pay a fee to use my music, so that paid my rent and put food on the table. Vicky traveled across both the UK and America playing her tracks in churches, concerts and rallies . 'Even when I first spoke out in support of same-sex marriage, I was boycotted by certain churches. 'They told me that because I supported equal marriage, my songs were now polluted. 'I knew that saying anything about my sexuality to anyone would make my world crumble. 'While I was living in America, even my immigration visa was tied into me doing the specific job of performing in churches, so I could have been deported from the country if people had chosen to stop booking me.' Being torn between the church and her sexuality was nothing new to Vicky. From a young age, she realised that the way she felt about her own sex wasn't acceptable in Christianity. Aged just 13, she approached a Catholic priest to confess how she felt and he prayed for her to be forgiven. Sadly, this only made her feel worse, to the extent that she broke down in her bedroom that year and sobbed over how helpless she was to change a key part of herself that her faith believed was bad. Three years later, she attended a Christian youth camp in the English countryside and made the only other attempt at reaching out that she would do before turning 30. At the camp, she decided to take part in an exorcism that would cleanse her of being attracted to women. As she stood on stage in front of thousands of people, Christian leaders shouted and screamed in tongues and called for the demons to come out of her, for the devils to leave her body. The experience traumatised Vicky enough to stop her mentioning anything about being gay for another 14 years. She said: ""The hardest part was that they made me feel like there was something evil in me taking me over, that I was being taken over by demonic powers. 'These were really important Christian leaders in the community carrying out this exorcism and saying these things to me. 'Later that night, a girl got up who must've been about 18 - two years older than me - and spoke about how she had been set free and cured of being gay. 'That made me convinced that it would work for me, but two weeks later I still felt the same way. 'The thing is, you can't feel bad towards the people who did it, because the really had the best intention in the world by wanting to set me free.' So Vicky hid how she felt for years, while travelling America's bible belt to perform at churches and rallys - places where anti-gay sentiment was rife. She said: 'A lot of churches that I would play at in America would say that homosexuality was something that the devil had designed to end the world by stopping people from procreating. 'There would be big billboards on the roads saying things like 'Turn Or Burn'. Since deciding to come out at the age of 35, Vicky feels like she is looking at life in a completely different way. She said: ""I feel like I have been given a second chance at life."" 'If I was still living in America, I could never have had the courage to do this, I would have had a genuine fear for my safety.' The turning point came when she was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease called linear scleroderma morphea, aged 30, where the soft tissue in the body turns to scarring. The disease can often be linked to a point of stress - in Vicky's case she assumed it was her hidden sexuality. While undergoing severe hospital treatments including chemotherapy, she decided to set herself an age when she would tell people she was a lesbian - that age would be 35. She said: 'So that's why I have decided to come out now, because I made a decision when I was very ill about coming out when I turned 35. 'And it just so happens that almost a month ago today,the Church Of England voted in favour women bishops. Vicky is now setting out a second career path as a religious commentator and hopes coming out will help the Church of England to get behind same-sex marriages . 'The next hurdle is the issue of same sex marriage - I'm hoping seeing people like me will help that. 'I think it will be a slow change, but it will happen faster than women bishops took. It will happen by listening to LGBT Christians, by putting faces to something instead of just looking at theology.' I told my parents at Easter, so they haven't have very long to get used to everything, but hey were great though, they said that they don't have to choose between agreeing and loving me.' It is less than 24 hours since she came out to the general public, but Vicky said she has been stunned by the response from people. She said: 'I've had people of very different faiths write to me overnight to say they don't necessarily agree with me, but they still love me. 'That's a wonderful things to be told. After being given the all-clear from her illness, Vicky is now looking forward to the next stage of her life. She said: ""Doing all of this is that it gives me the hope that some day I can get married, because until now I didn't think that was possible."" 'Obviously I have had some messages from the very conservative Christians which aren't so nice, but I am choosing not to read them for the time being. I need to be strong right now and the lovely messages I am getting are giving me so much strength.' One of the best messages was from Katherine Welby and her father Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who Vicky knows very well. She said: 'Katherine told me told me that the whole family have said that I am just as welcome at their dinner table and they still love me. I'm actually going round there for dinner next week.' 'The exciting thing about doing all of this is that it gives me the hope that some day I can get married, because until now I didn't think that was possible. 'And I'm fully in remission now from my illness and have been given the all-clear. 'I feel like I have been given a second chance at life.'","Vicky Beeching, 35, is one of most successful singers in US Christian rock .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . All frontline officers in the country's biggest police force will routinely use body-worn cameras within the next two years. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe announced that 16,000 uniformed patrolling officers will be given the devices by March 2016 at an estimated cost of £9 million. The cameras are being introduced in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, whose death at the hands of a police marksman sparked a wave of unrest that spread across the country. Police officers in the London Borough of Havering equipped with body cameras while out on patrol . A small team of firearms officers has also been trialling the cameras for just over a week but they cannot yet be used by undercover teams, and so would not have been deployed in the operation that led to Mr Duggan's death. Sir Bernard said: 'It's important for policing to be transparent. I would argue that this is going to be as significant a development as the involvement of lawyers, tape recorders and CCTV in detention areas and cells.' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe announced that 16,000 uniformed patrolling officers will be given the devices . The cameras are already being trialled in 10 boroughs across London and on August 7 pencil cameras were given for the first time to a uniformed armed unit, the Trojan Proactive Unit. It is a centrally-controlled, 14-member squad which sends out armed teams in BMW X5s, particularly to high-crime areas. They have already been used to record a confrontation with a man brandishing an iron bar. Police marksmen in south Wales will also start testing the devices next month. Strategic firearms commander Superintendent Ian Hackett said: 'The vast majority of firearms officers are very positive about this. They see it as long overdue, they've got nothing to hide. 'They want the public to see how they operate and to see the pressure that officers are under, and the split-second decision making.' A former Scotland Yard marksman identified only as E7 has been charged with murder for shooting robbery suspect Azelle Rodney in an operation that was only filmed because one of the team decided to bring a camera. Two fellow firearms officers have resigned from their marksman roles in the wake of the charging decision. It is planned that the armed teams will not be allowed to view the footage they have captured until after they have given a full statement about a shooting, which includes a vital account of why they felt force was justified. Cameras are already being rolled out in new police vans, which are replaced every two to three years.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said 16,000 officers will be given devices by 2016 .

"By . Aap . and Emily Crane . and Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . The deaths of nine West Australian fly-in fly-out workers who took their own lives will be investigated by a senior mental health clinician. Mental Health Commissioner Tim Marney told a public hearing on Wednesday that the apparent increase in FIFO suicides over the past 12 months was tragically not surprising. Suicide is the single biggest killer of people aged 15 to 44 years old, while the average age of a FIFO worker is 38, Mr Marney said. Scroll down for video . Rhys Connor gave an interview about the effect of fly-in, fly-out life on mental health just days before he took his life . The FIFO workforce is also 80 percent men, who account for four out of five suicides. Mr Marney said the FIFO lifestyle also exposed workers to damaging factors including social isolation, the inability to resolve financial and family troubles, shift work, substance abuse and high risk taking behaviour. 'You visit any mine site, the emphasis on physical health is extreme,' Mr Marney said. 'If they put that sort of effort into awareness and support for mental health we'd be far better off.' Mr Marney said there was no need for an inquiry into the causes of FIFO suicides and the services provided to workers because that was already known. But a case study into the deaths of nine workers, and perhaps more, was needed to better understand how they could have been helped before they took their lives. Rhys Connor was father to Blaize and said the fly-in, fly-out nature of his work made relationships very difficult . A FIFO employee who took his life last year had spoken out about the impact of the lifestyle on mental health just days before he died. Rhys Connor, 25, died on July 25 last year in his room at the Hope Downs mine site in the Pilbara in Western Australia after suffering depression. The father-of-one had spoken about the cost of the FIFO lifestyle on his mental health and wellbeing just days earlier, urging those considering FIFO to 'rethink' their decision. Mr Connor spoke about his experience in an interview for a government-funded project on miners released by his family on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness about the risks of isolation and depression faced by FIFO workers. 'People do struggle up there with depression and at the moment I'm going through it,' Mr Connor said in the interview. Mr Connor had a young son, Blaize, but had separated from the child's mother. Six weeks before he died he separated from his fiancée. Mr Connor suggested FIFO made long-term relationships difficult, saying that he would tell his son to work FIFO only 'if he was single'. He said that some workers 'drink every night' to cope with the lifestyle and named isolation as a key problem for FIFO-workers. 'You're in your room every night of the week. You just think about things. You think about your family and what they’re doing now... You miss your family,' he said. 'There are people out there what seem to be fine, and deep down they're not. People have got to realise that everyone's not OK.' Mr Connor's parents, Peter and Anita Miller said mining companies need to do more to look after their employees. 'Everything’s not going OK for people onsite, there’s a huge focus on safety, but there needs to be more focus on mental wellbeing,' Ms Miller told Daily Mail Australia. While she said that she does not blame FIFO for her son's death, she said the lifestyle does present particular mental health challenges. 'It's long sections away from family, missing out on major family events.' Rhys typically worked three or four weeks onsite followed by one week off. 'That's a long time away when you've got a child,' said Ms Miller. 'You're missing major developments. 'We’ve suffered hugely. Our son was just a great normal everyday guy... and bang he’s dead. It’s just too sad,' she said. After Rhys Connor (right) took his life, his family, including his stepfather Peter Miller (centre) have campaigned to raise awareness of themental health issues faced by fly-in, fly-out workers . Alan Woodward, Executive Directive of Lifeline Research Foundation, conducted a study of mental health among 900 FIFO workers last year. He found that while FIFO workers did not experience a higher rate of mental health issues compared to the rest of Western Australian citizens, they did experience specific hardships relating to mental health. 'A key concern for us out of that study was often the attitude among the workforce that it was somehow soft to say that you're having troubles,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was summed up in a phrase from one our interviews that ""if you were having troubles in your life, you just had to suck it up princess"". That was a very unhelpful attitude, that can prevent people from seeking help.' The Millers are now raising awareness of the mental health problems facing FIFO workers. Ms Miller and Rhys's sister Teagan are working with zero2hero, a suicide prevention charity, and Mr Miller recently visited Barrow Island workers to speak about mental health issues. '[Rhys] was just a normal larrikin young guy who loved life,' said Ms Miller. 'He was a water polo player, he had lots of friends. He was just a nice guy and he was a selfless person. 'We can't change what’s happened in our case, but maybe we can change what happens in someone else's case.'Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 and Beyond Blue: 1300 224 636 .","Deaths of nine WA fly-in fly-out workers who took their own lives will be investigated by a senior mental health clinician .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A community in Long Island have reacted furiously to a reverend's proposal to house illegal immigrant children in his church. Residents living near the Holy Cross Lutheran Church, in Commack, piled into the building in protest last week - with some claiming their own children would be put at risk by the move. The church wants to house 40 homeless children aged four to 17 - who have  illegally crossed the United States' border with Mexico - and their reverend, Dennis Walker, is urging people to do the 'Christian thing'. Illegal immigrants: The Holy Cross Lutheran Church wants to put up homeless children who have crossed the US' border from Mexico (pictured - a Salvadoran mother and her child join other Central American immigrants as they surrender to U.S. Border Patrol Agents in Texas) Thousands of children illegally enter the USA from Mexico each year - often in an attempt to reunite with lost family members. The unpopular proposal to house some of them in the church was initiated by the Lutheran Social Services of New York,  Newsday reports. The Manhattan-based agency said they would cover costs for the renovation of the building, using federal funds. Reverend Dennis Walker also claims the church is in dire financial straits and says the immigrant children program could bring in $8,000 - $10,000 a month. He claims the plan would create jobs, help pay off a $25,000 debt - and allow the church to do the Christian thing. Mr Walker also says that community opposition was being fueled by misinformation and that he hopes 'people will reconsider in a more rational light, insisting the project would have 'minimal impact on the community with substantial benefits'. Outrage: Protesters from the local community piled into the Holy Cross Lutheran Church in Commack, Long Island (pictured) to oppose the move to house illegal immigrant children . But residents living nearby are firmly against the idea, with one mother, Sheryl Cambria, 35, calling it 'scary'. The special-education teacher at Lindenhurst High School said: 'I have two little kids. Who's to say my house is going to be safe?' Another resident, New York City firefighter Michael Cantwell, 44, added: 'It's basically going to be a hotel right next to my house.' The church had to cancel a meeting last week as a result of the angry protest, but Mr Walker said the idea is still being considered and a decision is yet to be made. Rally: Children ride horse during recent immigrant rights rally, Trail for Humanity, in San Diego - people marched from Merced, California, to San Diego in support of rights of undocumented immigrants and in particular the plight of Central American mothers who illegally cross the US border . The children living in the church would be subject to hearings before federal immigration authorities and could ultimately be deported. The church would be guaranteed a minimal three-year pact to house children. Kenneth J. Wolfe, a spokesman for the federal Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the immigrant children program, was unable to confirm whether the Lutheran church was going ahead with the plan. Nationally, the organisation projects it will have to find beds for as many as 60,000 children in the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. The figure is more than double that of the previous year - where around 25,000 were placed.","Holy Cross Lutheran Church, Commack, wants to house immigrant children .

Two UK-based artists, Victor Ivanov and Lewis G, have created a gimp suit made entirely of raw chicken skins. The pair have now paraded their finished project called FLESH around the streets of London, including visits to famous landmarks in the capital like Trafalgar Square and Camden Lock. Scroll down for video . Artist Lewis paraded around Camden Lock in a gimp suit made of raw chicken skins, he later took part in an aerobics video wearing the costume . The bizarre street-art experiment is making a statement about our vanity-driven culture, which Victor predicts could end with the world ending and: 'everyone standing on the ashes taking selfies.' Afterwards, Lewis also filmed an 80s-style aerobics video wearing the chicken suit. In an interview with Art Map London, the artist described the difficulty involved in making an gimp suit out of raw chicken skin. He said: 'Originally I started using flesh at university, as more of a way to experiment with biodegradable matter. 'It's a little crass because obviously it's a very direct approach to interpreting our environment but nonetheless something that I want to experience first hand. The chicken suit was extremely unpleasant to make. Artist Victor Ivanov said: 'it was really quite a horrible experience because just the feeling of piercing the flesh, you know it's wrong' Lewis G also wore the raw chicken suit to one of the capital's most famous landmarks - Trafalgar Square - which attracts thousands of visitors every day . 'I envisaged using it like any other material but the reality is it doesn't work quite in the same way because it's flush, you can't help but respond emotionally yourself. 'When I first did it, it was really quite a horrible experience because just the feeling of piercing the flesh, you know it's wrong and you imagine it being alive and you doing that.'' The idea first originated from a much smaller project, where Victor and Lewis made a teddy bear using the skins. From there, they decided to create a costume big enough for Lewis to roam the streets of London. As well as the live performance, the men have now created a line of products using the chicken skin print that includes flip flops, shower curtains, mugs, iPhone covers, and baby dummies. Big fans can even cover their whole home in chicken skin as there is also a range of chicken skin wallpaper, duvet covers and cushions. Anyone who wants to try involved in the project will also be able to print out a chicken skin print from the artists' website and pose up in a tourist location themselves for a photo, to try and make the picture go viral.

In an identical letter to the Mosque and two Muslim charities, HSBC told the groups their business was outside the bank's 'risk appetite'. Retired stockbroker, Mr Barber, said: 'It's absolutely monstrous. This is a bullying major bank. 'They claim they are in the business to support people with entrepreneurial flare, but they closed us down after 25 years with not even a meeting to explain why they are doing it. 'I know why, it's the word Persian but they will not tell us. When people think of Oriental carpets, everyone says Persian. 'We sell carpets from all over the Far East, we just happen to be called Persian Carpets. We do no direct banking with Iran and never have done.' Mr Barber said HSBC made the decision to cancel their account after his daughter, Sara, the company's founder, bought three carpets from an Iranian businessman at a fair in Hamburg. Cancelled account:  Picture shows street in Sudbury, Suffolk, where shop, Persian Carpet Studio, is based . Payment for the first two carpets went through but the third was not honoured by HSBC - who wrote to them two days later telling them that their account was being closed. Mr Barber added: 'That was in April and they wanted it closed by May. It really incensed us, we never had any meeting, no explanation was given at all, no excuse. 'There are not many Oriental carpet retailers and carpet restorers in the country and we are one of the biggest. 'But like all high street businesses we have be careful about our cash flow and this does not help.' His 46-year-old daughter, Sara, who founded the business, added: 'We never had an explanation as to why. That made me extremely angry, it's been very badly handled. 'We can only assume it's because of the nature of my business, the fact I am importing items that originate from Iran. No explanation: Mr Barber has said HSBC are bullies for closing their account after 25 years . The mother-of-one added that it had cost the business thousands in solicitor’s fees to open up a new account with Natwest. Mr Barber claims the vast majority of Persian Carpet Studio's suppliers are based in London, with only a few in Europe. After writing to his MP, Tim Yeo, he received a letter from the Treasury which confirmed the shop was 'perfectly in order to sell Persian carpets'. He added: 'It said we never ever tried to send any money to Iran. We are not breaking any sanctions. The business was perfectly legitimate.' He has accused the bank of being frightened of a US treasury department who are handing fines to banks linked to sanction- breaking or money laundering activities. He went on: 'All our banks are so frightened of what the US Treasury department is doing to them, that they are running around like headless chickens and closing down anything to do with Iranian connections. 'Our Government is not doing anything to protect our banking industry. I think the US Treasury is trying to decimate the UK banking industry for their own gain.' After writing to HSBC's chairman he was told the bank would now only accept correspondence from his solicitors. In 2012, HSBC were forced to pay £1.2bn to settle allegations it allowed Mexican drug-traffickers to move money around the financial system. Commenting on the situation with Persian Carpet Studio, bank spokesman, Steve Gracey, said: 'We do not discuss individual customers, nor do we confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer. 'For context however, HSBC was fined US$1.9 billion in December 2012 by the US and UK governments and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. 'We are committed to adopting and enforcing the most effective standards to combat financial crime across our operations globally. 'This includes ensuring we have appropriate policies for how we do business and with whom. The bank is applying a programme of strategic assessments to all of its businesses. As a result of these ongoing reviews, we have ended relationships with business and personal customers in over 70 countries. 'Decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly. 'We take our responsibilities to customers and society very seriously, and remain committed to supporting our small business and charity customers.'","Suffolk shop sees business bank account cancelled after 25 years .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Jailed:  David Geddes, 49, stabbed his son, David Jr, 23,  in the chest after a family row at their home in Nelson, Lancashire . A jobless alcoholic father-of-14 stabbed his son and left him to bleed on the kitchen floor as he washed and hid the blade - before asking  'I didn't see a knife - did you?'. David Geddes, 49, who drinks 20 pints of beer a day, stabbed David Jr in the chest during a family row. The argument began after he accused his son of bringing home a male friend said to have had an affair with one of Geddes' former partners. After the attack, Geddes smiled as the victim lay begging for help - ignoring his pleas as he washed the knife and put it back in the kitchen drawer. Paramedics eventually arrived at the bloody scene in Nelson, Lancashire, and rushed David Jr to hospital. The victim, 23, lost nearly two litres of blood and suffered severe damage to his liver and lung requiring life-saving surgery, with medics cutting open his back to repair the internal injuries. In his impact statement read at Burnley Crown Court, David Jr said: 'A father should not do that to his son and I don't want to have anything to do with him again.' Geddes, who fathered his brood of children with five different women over 25 years, would normally consume a staggering 300 units of alcohol per week - the equivalent of 150 pints of beer. After being arrested over the incident, which took place last December, Geddes laughed during a police interview when officers suggested he had stabbed his son. Passing sentence, Judge Ian Leeming, QC, told Geddes : 'Very sadly, your victim was your son. Words fail me. This was appalling behaviour of an extreme nature. 'The victim cannot comprehend how a father could do to his son what you have done to him.' During the trial, a witness said Geddes was 'acting strangely, like he was someone else and was out of control.' He kicked and punched his son and pushed away the victim's girlfriend when the trouble spilled outside the front door. Traumatic:  David Jr (left) has not been able to sleep since the savage attack and has been left with a huge scar from where surgeons had to cut his back open to perform life-saving surgery . Scarred: David Jr posted this picture on Facebook sending a clear message to his alcoholic father . Geddes then followed his son back inside the property, walked towards him and stabbed him. With the scene soaked in blood, Geddes went about hiding the blade before asking the witness: 'I didn't see a knife. Did you?' Prosecutor Michael Maher said: 'The defendant went inside. His son was haemorrhaging and was banging on the window, asking his father to call an ambulance. 'A witness states he refused. He did call 999, alleged his son had threatened him with a knife and then he hung up.' Blood soaked: A witness said there was blood everywhere when Geddes began to wash and hide the knife at the house in Nelson, Lancashire (above) last December . In the months after after the attack Geddes admitted himself to be treated for his heavy drinking, where he made 'chilling' remarks about his ex-partner - threatening to inject her with unknown substances and use battery acid to maim. David Jr suffered a wound to his right chest wall and injury to his diaphragmatic muscle and a right artery, which bled so profusely it had to be secured at both ends with surgical clips. Speaking about the effect the incident had on the victim, Mr Maher continued: 'He says he had to take pain killers for six or seven weeks. 'He couldn't sleep because of pain and he was regularly having nightmares. The incident has disfigured him and affected him emotionally.' Geddes was found not guilty of intending to do grievous bodily harm and was jailed for just 33 months. He was also made subject to a permanent restraining order, banning him from contacting his son and other members of his family. In mitigation, Geddes' counsel, Rick Holland, said: 'This is both a serious and depressing case, involving, as it does, father and son. 'David Geddes is very much a different character to that person who offended and indeed that person who is reported to have made those threats. 'He does have a deep sense of regret, that his own flesh and blood suffered as a part of this incident.' After the case, a neighbour said: 'No one has a good word to say about him. He's just a layabout. 'For a dad to treat a son like that, where's the respect? Where's any family morals? Obviously none in that household.'","Alcoholic David Geddes, 49, of Nelson, Lancashire, stabs son, 23, after row .

The four were traveling in a car which lost control and struck a tree at 2am on a straight stretch of road close to the New Hampshire Turnpike in Unity. The vehicle was cut in half by the force of the collision. Brittany Bailey, 18, of Claremont, died at the scene along with two 17-year-old boys, Brandon Rock and Jonathan Varnum. Brittany Bailey, 18, died in a car crash in the early hours of Sunday in New Hampshire along with two 17-year-old male friends when their vehicle struck a tree. The other 17-year-old girl survived and is in hospital . The driver of the car was killed, police said, adding that drugs or alcohol were not involved but speed may have been a factor. It is not clear which teen was driving but the person lost control on the southbound side of the road, according to police, and slammed into the tree. The injured teen, 17-year-old Selena Carrier, was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition. The four teenagers were students at Stevens High School, friends and family told ValleyNews.com. Miss Bailey graduated in June and wanted to be a cosmetologist. Rock and Varnum were due to begin their senior year. The two boys were described by relatives as fun-loving and people who always looked out for their family and friends. The crash involving a 1997 model Saab happened in front of the home of Larry and Diana Owen. Jonathan Varnum, 17, was also killed in the crash with two other friends on a New Hampshire road in the early hours of Sunday . Mr Owen said that the noise of the crash woke him and he believes that if it hadn't been for the oak tree, the car could have plowed into his front bedroom and killed him. The couple were the first to call 911. He told ValleyNews that  the force of the horrific accident caused his front windows to break and that the car had been cut in two. He told the newspaper: 'It was not recognizable as a car.'

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Clive Palmer has come under fire for 'racist' comments about Chinese people, which Liberal politicians say could hurt Australia's trade relationship with China. Clive Palmer launched the bizarre attack while appearing on Q&A on Monday night, calling Chinese people 'bastards' and 'mongrels' who 'shoot their own people'. The Palmer United Party leader defended his comments this morning, writing on Twitter: 'My #qanda comments not intended to refer to Chinese people but to Chinese company which is taking Australian resources & not paying'. But one important voice has been missing from the debate. Scroll down for video . Missing in action: Clive Palmer's Chinese-born senator Dio Wang has kept mum on the whole dispute. Australia's Palmer United Party leader was on the panel of ABC television programme Q&A on Monday night when he hit out with the racist comments . Chinese-born PUP Senator Dio Wang has kept mum despite today's furore. When Daily Mail Australia called the Senator Wang's office this afternoon, a spokeswoman said Mr Wang was 'in a meeting' and therefore unavailable to comment. The senator was still in a meeting when the Mail called back 20 minutes later. 'He is in a meeting (for) the whole day,' the spokeswoman said. 'He doesn't have time to respond to this'. Cabinet ministers have condemned Mr Palmer's comments, with Treasurer Joe Hockey saying they were 'hugely damaging'. 'I would say to Clive Palmer please do not bring down the rest of Australia because of your bias,' he said. Mr Hockey added that Mr Palmer was himself the beneficiary of Chinese investment. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop reiterated that Australia's relationship with China was 'very important'. 'I will contact the embassy and let them know these are the views of one member of parliament, they are not representative of the majority of parliament and certainly not the majority of Australian people. 'It really isn't appropriate for [Mr Palmer] to vent on a national television programme about his bitterness about a legal dispute he’s having with a Chinese company,' she told 3AW Radio. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce remarked this morning that Palmer's remarks were 'not helpful' and could be harmful to Australia's business relationship with China. 'Clive started with a company called China First. He wanted to make a lot of money out of dealing with China. You can't blame the Chinese for being tough business people. That's what business is about. But the emotive and colourful language is not the way that you do business,' Mr Joyce said on ABC News Breakfast. There has been no word from the Palmer United Party's Chinese born Senator Dio Wang, who represents Western Australia. Clive Palmer (right) on the panel with opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong (middle) and talk show host Tony Jones (left) Clive Palmer's comments come as he is locked in a legal battle with Chinese-owned Citic Pacific over a series of disputes. The first concerns a bank account operated by Mr Palmer's company Mineralogy, for which Mr Palmer was the only signatory of the account at the time of the incident. Citic claims that the account was only to be used for covering the operational costs of Port Preston, an iron ore port in Western Australia. Two cheques were spent from this account in 2013, one for $10 million that went to Mr Palmer's Cosmo Development and a $2.17 million check that went to the PR firm Media Circus. Citic has accused Mr Palmer of using the $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013. On Monday's episode of Q&A Tony Jones tried to get Mr Palmer to admit whether or not he had spent any money from the Mineralogy-operated account on his election campaign. One of Mr Palmer's companies, Queensland Nickel, put $12.7 million back into the account after media accounts of the incident first emerged. There is an ongoing dispute between Palmer's Mineralogy and Citic about the Sino Iron Project. The dispute concerns royalties for the project, with Mr Palmer claiming he is owed $500 million. Even former One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, who said in her maiden address to Parliament in 1996 that Australia was in danger of being 'swamped by Asians', condemned his comments, saying he should 'stick [his] nose out of other people's business'. 'Maybe Clive Palmer should take a position over in China in Parliamentary seats. I’ve always said clean up your own backyard before criticising other people. It’s not up to Clive Palmer or anyone else. It’s not for us or Australia to get involved in that,' she told Sunrise. Mr Palmer was on the panel of the ABC's flagship programme when he launched into a tirade about Chinese business interests in Australia, accusing Chinese people of trying to take over Australia . 'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said. The controversial MP made the comments when he was being questioned by host Tony Jones about allegations he used money from one of his business accounts to fund his election campaign. Mr Palmer repeatedly refused to answer Mr Jones's questions, saying he would be answering them in court this week and would not be subjected to a 'trial by media'. He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.' 'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said. Outraged Q&A viewers took to social media and expressed their disgusts over the mining billionaire's derogatory views. Activist group GetUp! tweeted: 'Hey, that was pretty racist @CliveFPalmer, and that's not okay'. 'To say what Clive Palmer just said on #qanda. I'm surprised if that's legal. Or free speech absolute in Oz?' Peter Johansson tweeted. 'I love how @clivefpalmer is celebrating Australia's cultural diversity in an anger racist Palmer kind of way,' Raphael tweeted. Silas Palmer wrote: 'Was that [the snarling, racist and ruthless] the Real Clive Palmer'. 'Dear @JulieBishopMP , If you need help with your portfolio perhaps @CliveFPalmer may help with a diplomatic mission to China,' tweeted Viscount Mike OBE. Some expressed support for Mr Palmer, with Raiderette tweeting: 'Good on ya Clive keep speaking freely!' and Michael Brown writing: 'Fair enough Clive.' The 56-year-old is a mining billionaire and established the Palmer United Party last year . The 56-year-old was on the panel for the weekly Australian talk show hosted by Tony Jones. Other panellists were deputy prime minister Warren Truss, opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong, businesswoman and RBA board member Heather Ridout, national CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society John Falzon. In 2009, Clive Palmer criticised the Labor government's trade policies, which made trade more difficult for Chinese investors than U.S. investors. In an address to the Queensland Media Club he called the current policies 'racist' and said there was 'a great cry in Australia about Reds under the bed'. But Mr Palmer argued that 'capital is now in China, it's not in the US' and that Australia had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with China 'if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve.'","The leader of Palmer United Party was on live television when he made 'racist' comments on Monday night .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Jessica Watson, the Queensland woman who in 2010 became the youngest person to sail solo and unassisted around the world, has defended herself against critics of her weight and argued that too much emphasis is put on the physical appearance of young girls. Writing in a blog post, the 21-year-old spoke of the attention placed on her physical appearance by teenagers to whom she gives motivational talks at high schools. 'A group of girls gathered around me to ask questions. But a comment from one girl shocked me, ""Wow, you're so skinny"",' she wrote in a guest post for Free Spirit Girl. Scroll down for video . Jessica Watson became the youngest person to sail around the world solo and unassisted in 2010 at the age of 16 . 'I was a little disappointed that this was the only thing that the girl had taken away from my visit. She seemed more interested in the way I looked, rather than what I had to say.' In the post, Ms Watson said body image was something she never thought about while growing up because she was completely focused on her goal of sailing around the world. 'Body image had nothing to do with boats, navigation or weather systems, so it didn't enter my head! I was blissfully ignorant to the pressure placed on young girls and the way they should supposedly look,' she wrote. But since she has started talking to groups of high school students about her achievements, the world-record-holder says she has realised just how strong the pressure is that is placed on young women to look a certain way. Ms Watson cited her family's attitudes as part of the reason she remained oblivious to societal pressures about appearance for so long. 'I've always been surrounded by family and people who placed far more value on what you thought, than the way you look,' she wrote. In the motivational post, Ms Watson encouraged girls to see fitness as part of 'feeling your best both mentally and physically' and to 'chase your dreams… It's incredible what we can achieve if we set our minds to it!'

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . The woman who survived a vicious attack, during which her ex-partner hacked her arms off with a samurai sword, has written a book about the horrific ordeal and her inspiring recovery. Simonne Butler, 39, from Auckland had both her arms reattached by doctors after they were cut off by killer Antoine Dixon. Dixon also attacked Ms Butler's friend Renee Gunbie, whose left-hand was cut off and could not be reattached, before he went on a drug-fuelled crime spree in January 2003. Ms Butler and Ms Gunbie were left for dead by Dixon and paramedics called to the scene said they were minutes away from dying when they arrived. Simonne Butler had both of her arms chopped off by her ex-partner in a horrific attack in 2003 . Eleven years after the brutal attack, Ms Butler has written a book about her ordeal and her healing . Antoine Dixon was convicted for murder, shooting at a police officer, wounding, aggravated robbery and kidnapping in relation to the attack in 2003 . Dixon then murdered  a man at an Auckland petrol station in a spray of bullets from a machine gun, before taking another man hostage and engaging in a standoff with police. Dixon, who had taken methamphetamine during the day of the crimes, eventually surrendered to police and was sentenced to life in prison with a 20 year non-parole period. He died in prison in 2009, from what were believed to be self-inflicted injuries. More than 11 years after the horrific events, Ms Butler has written a book about the ordeal and her physical and emotional healing. 'It was the most intense moment – or five minutes, or however long it lasted – of my life,' Ms Butler told Daily Mail Australia. 'It could be the defining moment [of my life]. But I think my healing journey is what's defined me as a person, rather than the incident.' Between 2003 and 2008, Ms Butler underwent 12 general anaesthetic surgeries and about 100 procedures to reattach and repair her arms. 'It wasn't a really sharp samurai sword that just sliced my arms off. It took five, six, seven, maybe ten hacks to get them off,' she said. The bones in her left arm were smashed so severely that she required a bone graft from her hips to reconnect the bones. She still has very little function in her left hand and is only able to move her wrist and thumb a few millimetres. Her right hand was sliced vertically in half and her forearm was chopped diagonally, though was not completely severed, and after multiple surgeries and years of physiotherapy she now has between 60 and 70 percent of normal function in her right hand. After 12 general anaesthetics and 100 procedures, doctors were able to reattach her arms and she now has 60-70 percent of function in her right arm . Simonne still does several hours of physiotherapy every day in order to keep her hands working . Ms Butler was in a relationship with her attacker Antoine Dixon for five years and had separated from him when he went on a violent rampage, ending with him murdering a man at a petrol station . The physical healing process has been incredibly demanding, but the emotional recovery has proved even more challenging. Ms Butler says it took her years to deal with the emotional trauma of the attack, as well as the five-year abusive relationship she had with Dixon before it occurred. 'I was ashamed and embarrassed and it took me years to deal with that. For me, the emotional side of it was forgiving myself. I'd done so many dumb things, made so many bad choices and put myself in danger so many times. I didn't have the self-respect to say, ""You can't treat me like that,""' she said. Ms Butler said she was not surprised that Dixon, who had stalked her for six months before they started dating and been physically abusive to her throughout the relationship, was capable of such violence. 'He used to threaten to slit my grandparents' throats in the night and burn down their house,' she said. 'It ended up being a very sick and twisted cycle in my head that I deserved to be punished for making the terrible decision to be with him.' After the incident she had 'lots and lots' of panic attacks. 'Whether it was over going out in public, or about the thought of him getting out of jail and finding me, not even finding me to be violent, just showing up with a silly big grin,' she said. Ms Butler says her 'healing journey' rather than the horrific attack in 2003 have defined her as a person . Ms Butler's left arm was so badly damaged in the attack that she can only move her fingers a few millimetres. Her right arm has 60 to 70 percent function . She hit a low point in 2007, when Dixon's conviction for murder, wounding, kidnapping, shooting at police and aggravated burglary was overturned due to a mistrial. 'When I found out there was a mistrial I had such a panic, I didn't understand what had happened, I expected him to turn up at my house,' she said. Dixon was convicted a second time in 2008 after a re-trial and died in prison, from what were believed to be self-inflicted injuries, in 2009 at the age of 41. When Ms Butler learnt he was dead, she felt incredibly liberated. 'I was dancing around my house with joy. I felt so light and so free and really amazing,' she said. But Ms Butler has put the terrifying ordeal behind her and is moving on with her life. 'It's a long time ago now,' she said. 'I don't think about him or even the incident. I've got so much going on.' Ms Butler says she does not think about the attack or her former partner, because she has too much going on in her life . Since the attack, Ms Butler has taken up horse-riding, completed her diploma in naturopathy and is half-way through a course in flower essence therapy and a shamanic apprenticeship with a master shaman . Since the attack, Ms Butler has taken up horse-riding, completed her diploma in naturopathy and is half-way through a course in flower essence therapy and a shamanic apprenticeship with a master shaman. On top of this she has just finished writing a book about her experience, titled Recalibrate. 'That's what I did to myself. I had to fully recalibrate my mind, my body, myself,' she said. She plans to self-publish the book with Mary Egan Publishing and she is currently crowd-funding the final stages of the book's production. Despite everything she has achieved, Ms Butler acknowledges that she cannot help but continue to be affected by the traumatic events of her past. 'I'm so much better, but I haven't been in a long-term relationship yet. I had two six months flings with boys I could very much control. I like to think I'm fearless, but I think it is [fear] that holds me back. 'I made such a terrible mess the last time I fell in love.' For the meantime, Ms Butler's love is reserved for her supportive family and friends – 'I live in a perpetual state of gratitude for all the amazing people I have in my life' – and for her work. '[The book] has been a labour of love.

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Education Minister Chris Pyne refused to support Treasurer Joe Hockey's comments that poor people 'don't have cars or actually don't drive very far', despite being asked the question directly six times during an interview. Mr Pyne was asked whether he agreed with Joe Hockey's controversial comments when he appeared on the Today show this morning with Shadow Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese. Mr Pyne stated that the treasurer had the government's 'full support' and that he wouldn't 'cop any criticism of Joe Hockey on these remarks', but when directly asked whether he supported Mr Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive' he refused to answer, instead repeating that Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job as treasurer'. Scroll down for video . Education Minister Chris Pyne was asked six times during a television interview whether he supported Joe Hockey's controversial comments . Mr Albanese jumped in, pointing out Mr Pyne's refusal to back Mr Hockey's comments explicitly, telling the Education Minister: 'You had six opportunities to support what he said and you refuse to do so. Why? Because what he said was rubbish.' 'If you are in an outer suburb or a regional community you have no choice but to drive and this is the guy who cut all funding for public transport in the budget… and then he says that poor people don't have cars or don't drive very far,' Mr Albanese said. '[Mr Hockey] should go to western Sydney today and have a look at people driving all the way in to the city, or all the way into their workplace in any capital city from the outer metropolitan areas, they spend a higher proportion of their income than high income earners.' Mr Hockey has come under fire after remarking to ABC Radio on Wednesday that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households. 'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he said. Mr Pyne said he thought Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job' as treasurer but refused to confirm whether or not he supported Joe Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive' Joe Hockey has come under fire for his comments, which were made on ABC Radio as he was defending the government's proposed fuel excise . Mr Hockey made the controversial comments while defending the government's proposed fuel indexation, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest. The comments have caused widespread outrage, prompting Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to call Mr Hockey 'the cigar-chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics', as well leading to criticism from Greens MPs, Coalition MPs and welfare groups. NSW Nationals senator John Williams and Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald criticised Hockey's comments on the grounds that people in the bush need cars. 'You have to have a car whether you're rich or poor, you need a vehicle to be able to get from one place to the other,' Mr Macdonald told ABC Radio on Thursday. 'Regional Australians don't have the alternative of public transport of other means of getting there.' Mr Hockey was also lambasted on social media with people using the hashtag #OtherThingsThePoorDontDo to poke fun at Mr Hockey's remark. Tony Abbott was also questioned about Mr Hockey's gaffe, which occurred while the prime minister was in the United Arab Emirates visiting Australian personnel participating in the international humanitarian aid drops in northern Iraq. He refused to directly address Mr Hockey's comments, instead saying: 'I'm very proud of the budget the treasurer and I have brought about. I want to focus on the fundamental challenge facing the country… how do we get our economy under control?'","Chris Pyne was asked six times whether he supported Joe Hockey's comments in an interview but refused to answer .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . ASOS is launching its first ever erotic accessories range, which includes multi-use collars, cuffs, headbands, tassels . and blindfolds. The diffusion line from luxe label Holloway Smith Noir is aimed at 18-25-year-olds. The Gigi Noir range is priced from £33-£57 and all items come in both gold or black, all made from sequins, recycled leather and Swarovski crystals. Playful and fun erotic accessories label, Gigi Noir, launches on ASOS this month - aimed at 18-25-year-olds . In conjunction with the launch of the brand new . Gigi Noir range and deal with ASOS, the firm's founders launch a . campaign for better sex education and better sex called, ahem, . Ladies Come First. Stocking the accessible range from the makers of the most luxurious (and expensive, £265) nipple tassels in the world is a bold move for ASOS, . and a completely new category for them. And sister CEOs Sophie and Alice Holloway - the so-called Mistresses of Teasewear - say what really won the online . retailer over was their passionate, positive message about sex and . sex education. 'Playfulness and fun are the key messages . behind the collection,' says Sophie. 'The . luxury erotic industry is geared towards an older more mature audience . who are at a different stage in their economic lifetime,' says Sophie. 'We . believe young adults also deserve access to high quality teasewear and . this belief has lead to our collaboration with ASOS.' Sister CEOs Sisters Sophie (right) and Alice (left) Holloway - the so-called Mistresses of Teasewear - say what really won the online retailer was over with their passionate, positive message about sex and sex education . Gigi Noir's sexual responsibility campaign, Ladies Come First, hopes to help young men and women explore sexual issues such as consent, pleasure, confidence and communication. 'This . campaign gives us the opportunity to get some basic principles laid down . right at the beginning of young people's sexual journeys,' says Sophie. 'We . don't believe all porn is bad but it's certainly not how you should be . learning about sex. Ignoring problems won't make them go away, you have . to be the antidote. 'Ladies Come First is going to empower people to have better sex, and who doesn't want better sex?' The company wants to give out a pocket book guide to female orgasm at university freshers weeks . Ladies Come First is a social sexual responsibility communication campaign and hub of pleasure-based sex education and information - 'a place to start such conversations'. The sisters have been selling their products at cabaret shows every weekend for the last three years and what they've been hearing from their customers is that while they love the idea of sex accessories, they're not getting enough out of the act as they'd like. As just 30 . per cent of women are orgasming during sex, Sophie is adamant that is . not a  physiological problem but a societal one. 'We . were hearing from a breadth of women that they were interested in . building anticipation and gaining more pleasure from sex,' says Sophie. The campaign starts now via their website, www.ladiescomefirst.co.uk, and social media accounts. They are planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign for £10,000 on Inidegogo for their Guide To The Female Orgasm. The sisters want to give out the pocket book at university freshers' weeks and are in talks with three British institutions for starters; Royal Holloway, Birmingham and Cambridge. 'Sex education at the moment is not . aware of the fact that young people are growing up with exposure to the . internet and hardcore pornography, and this has to be addressed,' says . Sophie. This collar necklace comes in black and gold, like all the products, and features a playful tassel . The sisters felt like there wasn't anyone marketing erotic accessories to a younger audience . These cuffs can be used as restraints and bed post ties . 'We want to rebrand what young and sexy is, and move away from this porn star thing - that going from your day life to your sex life should require a transformation into this object. 'Young women need the confidence to . know their bodies and know how to express that to their partner. 'We felt like there wasn't anyone marketing erotic accessories to a younger audience, and that there is this blank period in between being able to afford Agent Provocateur and being comfortable in your sexual preferences - so we created this range that has a good price point and a fashion-forward aesthetic.' All Holloway Smith Noir and Gigi Noir products are handmade in the sister's Holborn studio.

"By . Ruth Styles . She was the Hollywood poker princess who hobnobbed with celebrities and raked in up to $4million a year before an encounter with the Mafia and an FBI sting brought her world crashing down. Glamorous: Molly Bloom, now 36, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle funded by hosting high stakes poker games . But despite her losses, Molly Bloom, now 36, says wants to move on from the experience and hopes to one day mentor up-and-coming female entrepreneurs. Petite and pretty with a curtain of glossy dark hair and a slender figure, Bloom looks more Hollywood star than convicted criminal. Perhaps it was that that made her a favourite with A-list clients, among them Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Affleck, although as Bloom explains, some had a dark side. 'When Leonardo Dicaprio walked in the first time, all I . saw was Jack Dawson from Titanic and my voice caught in my throat,' she remembers. 'He . smiled and handed me a stack of cash that totalled $10,000. Each player did the same. 'Each player was legendary in his own right. Tobey Maguire was also there. He was at the pinnacle of his career and was . starring in Spiderman. It was completely surreal.' The games, which initially took place in a back room at the infamous Viper Room bar on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, frequently saw huge amounts of money won and lost on games. On that first night in 2004, Bloom did nothing more than serve drinks to the players but racked up $3,000 in tips which she converted into glamorous designer frockst. Later, after Bloom was given control of the games by her boss, who she names only as 'Reardon' in her new memoir, play moved to private homes and luxury LA hotels such as the Peninsula where huge stakes of up to a quarter of a million dollars were wagered on a single hand. This, says Bloom, left her feeling increasingly uneasy. 'The size of the game in terms of how . much money was at stake, the wins and losses was absolutely insane,' she says. Poker face: Tobey Maguire was allegedly a great player but a bad loser who tried to humiliate Bloom . 'It . definitely made me uncomfortable.  I didn’t see how these guys could . lose this much and still want to play. 'I also couldn’t help but feel a . twinge of guilt. This was recreation to them but the sums could have . changed lives of those less fortunate. But I was right there with them, . profiting from the egregious wins and losses.' And the rewards both personal and financial, were vast. 'In the beginning I made sure to save . just in case it all went belly up,' she explains. 'But when I started spending, it . was like a drug. 'Growing up, my parents made sure we had what we needed but it was . always discount basics. All of a sudden I had cash, I had an American . Express card and I could buy myself whatever I wanted. 'I shopped on . Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, 5th Avenue in Manhattan. I bought a Bentley, I . chartered private planes, I had a staff, a driver and I rented $100,000 . homes for summers in the Hamptons and in Malibu. 'It was shallow, but it . was fun. A lot of my friends were bought these things by their . boyfriends but I loved that I did it all by myself.' Lavish: The £245-a-night Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles was the scene of many a high stakes poker game . The nicest man in Hollywood: Bloom has fond memories of Ben Affleck and says he is the 'guy you root for' She counted some of Hollywood's starriest names among her friends, among them Ben Affleck. 'Ben was very nice, polite, smart, and funny,' she reveals. 'He’s someone you root for. He’s nice to everyone.' Maguire, by contrast, was not. Then 32, the actor, although initially friendly, soon began to humiliate Bloom, asking her to 'bark like a seal' for chips and reacting angrily when she refused. 'I'm not kidding,' he allegedly said to her. 'What's wrong? You’re too rich now? You won’t bark for a thousand dollars?' The gambling goddess said that she refused to stoop to the level of barking, but says in return, 'He gave me an icy look, dropped the chip on the table and tried to laugh it off but he was visibly angry.' 'In the beginning he was very nice to me,' she adds. 'I felt like he respected me and wanted to help me. 'I guess at that . time he saw we had a mutual interest: more games, more players, bigger . stakes, more frequency and so on. We were both profiting in a big way. 'As I . started learning how things work, playing to the needs of the entire . game as opposed to just his, and making more and more money, his . attitude and the way he treated me changed. High stakes: Molly Bloom's lavish lifestyle ended in a conviction, a year on probation and a $125,000 fine . 'I guess it was then that I . realised the game wasn’t recreation for rich guys, it was big business . and most people weren’t friends with each other. 'They showed up to take . each other’s money. I can’t say my feelings weren’t hurt, but I tried . hard to not take it personally and to see it for what it was.' But Maguire's enmity cost her more than her dignity. It also resulted in the end of her Hollywood poker career, with Molly eventually conceding the field and moving to New York. Already raking in up to $50,000 a night, the poker business had become too lucrative to give up and so, the games continued with a new group of super-rich clients in the Big Apple. There, the stakes were even higher with hands of up to $4million played by the wealthy bankers, financiers and traders who flocked to her games. And Molly needed the money. Spending had become 'like a drug' to her with lavish shopping sprees, private planes and $100,000 holidays all part of her poker-funded lifestyle. But the end of Molly's lavish existence was in sight. Visits from the Mafia, who wanted a slice of her lucrative trade, and the trial of a disgraced former player who had been running a Ponzi scheme, put her on the FBI's radar. Titanic wins: Leonardo DiCaprio was a regular player in Bloom's circle, which had a buy-in of up to $100,000 . Memoir: Molly has now written a memoir lifting the lid on the shady side of Hollywood . In March 2011, 20 FBI agents invaded a game although Bloom, then visiting family in Colorado, wasn't there. Instead, they seized her assets, with Bloom horrified to find her bank account suddenly $9,99999 in the red. 'It was terrible, terrifying and one of those . moments when you realise nothing will ever be the same,' she says. 'I realised it was about to get really tough.' The FBI had wanted to talk to her about her involvement with organised crime but soon let her go after her lawyer successfully argued her innocence. But just two years later, in April 2013, Bloom was arrested and charged with profiting from hosting illegal poker games. 'It always felt I was operating in a grey . area but I did my best for the majority of the time to stay above . board,' she admits. 'But I did cross the . line. 'During . the first seven years they were completely legal. After I moved to New York, I . was doing many more games and it was harder to control. 'I was getting stiffed by people who weren’t . paying their debts so I started taking a rake [a small percentage of each . pot] as an insurance policy. 'I made a decision to go ahead with the . rake, and I regret it everyday.' Although she initially pleaded not guilty, Bloom changed her plea in December 2013 and was fined $125,000 and sentenced to a year's probation in May. She has, she says, learned her lesson and is now concentrating on moving forward, with her memoir, Molly's Game: High Stakes, Hollywood's Elite, Hotshot Bankers, My Life in the World of Underground Poker, the first step. 'I learned a lot of lessons both good and . bad,' she says. 'I learned how to be an entrepreneur, and build a business. I . learned how to make it in a man’s world. I feel it’s a hard world for . girls.' Next up, she says, is finding a way to get involved with coaching female would-be entrepreneurs, encouraging them to stop taking selfies and use their brains. 'I would . also like to raise a fund and build a board of advisors to get behind . female entrepreneurs,' she adds.  'And, I definitely want to have a family.' From high stakes poker to stay-at-home mother? Stranger things have happened in the mad world of Molly Bloom.

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Aldi looks set to almost double its sales in the next five years . Aldi sales could double in the next five years, putting pressure on the Coles-Woolworths supermarket duopoly, according to a new report from investment bank UBS, reports the Australian Financial Review. Sales at the German discount supermarket chain are projected to increase from their current level of $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion by 2019 taking an estimated $250 million to $350 million of sales from each Woolworths, Coles and Metcash, which owns IGA. The projected increase in sales will come as Aldi opens more stores across the country and improves conditions to appeal to wealthier customers. Aldi, which launched in Australia in 2001, currently has 350 stores across the country, and plans to open 25 new stores a year for the next few years, including expanding into Western Australia and South Australia, which it plans to do by 2016. The report from UBS also indicated the chain could reach sales of $13 billion, which would present a serious challenge to the stranglehold of Woolworths and Coles on the Australian grocery market. In order to reach sales of $13 billion Aldi would need to fix problems identified by a UBS survey of 600 customers, including lengthy checkout queues, lack of quality fresh food and items being out of stock, three areas that Coles and Woolworths have prioritised. Aldi originally appealed to low-income earners, but it is increasingly appealing to wealthier customers and young families. Stefan Kopp, Aldi's joint group managing director, told the Australian Financial Review that the increase in sales to $9 billion predicted by UBS was 'achieveable and slightly optimistic', though he denied Aldi would ever be a 'big player' or reach the size or Cole and Woolworths. Aldi's increasing sales may threaten the Coles-Woolworths duopoly of the grocery market in Australia .","Aldi sales are predicted to increase from $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion by 2019 .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . Levi Bruce, pictured, told his victims that in 'five seconds' they would be blind after squirting them with a noxious substance thought to be drain cleaner . A man told two teenage boys that they would be blind 'in five seconds' after squirting drain cleaner in their faces causing serious burns. Levi Bruce from Swanley, Kent attacked the two boys aged 16 and 19 on January 21 at their home in Gravesend. Bruce, 31, was involved in a feud with members of the boys' family. Maidstone Crown Court heard that Bruce approached the 16 year old and said he wanted to fight his father. He then rang his older brother who appeared at the scene. As soon as the second brother showed up, Bruce squirted a corrosive liquid, thought to be drain cleaner at the two boys. Prosecutor Damian van Dagvenbode said: 'The defendant said he wanted to fight the victim's father. 'After this, without warning Bruce pulled out some sort of container and discharged a liquid into his victim's face, from about two metres away. It happened very suddenly. 'Before the victim knew it, there was a noxious substance squirted on to his face. Then the defendant said to him ""in five seconds, you will be blind"". He said it felt like someone had held up a blowtorch to his face.' Bruce was jailed for seven years at Maidstone Crown Court after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent. The court heard that the younger boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered burns to his chin, chest, arms stomach and leg. His elder brother described the attack as the same as being burned by a blow torch. Detective Constable Roger Harris of Kent Police said: 'To say this was a malicious and mean-spirited attack is an understatement. 'Drenching two men in a corrosive substance is an appallingly violent thing to do. 'Bruce claimed in interview that he just threw the contents of the bottle at them in self-defence and had no idea what sort of liquid it contained. I absolutely reject this idea. 'Both victims will be scarred for life from their injuries and have months of medical treatment ahead of them. 'I welcome the news Bruce will be behind bars for the part he played in this disgraceful incident.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . and David Wilkes . Streaking across the sky, this massive bolt of lightning was part of a huge electrical storm that brought chaos to rail and road users. Eurostar had to cancel services after the lightning struck an electrical sub-station next to the Channel Tunnel entrance in Cheriton, Kent, causing a fire. It caused a loss of power and resulted in four Eurostar trains being stopped from travelling through the tunnel in both directions. Several hundred passengers were delayed as the trains were returned to where they started. A series of smaller blazes also led to commuter rail services out of London being cancelled. Eerie: Photographer David Shackle, 62, was capturing the sunset over his home town of Folkestone, Kent, last night when 'suddenly the sky went red and clouds rolled in' Mr Shackle said within seconds the sky changed from red to black, and shortly before 6.15pm the first lightning bolt struck the Creteway housing estate in Folkestone . One of the lightning bolts hit . 25-year-old Sophia Swarbrick’s home in Folkestone, Kent, while she was . putting her children to bed – but luckily her family escaped injury. Miss . Swarbrick said: ‘Fluorescent blue light lit up the house, then the . whole place rumbled and the lightning hit the roof. It was terrifying.’ Photographer . David Shackle, 62, captured the astonishing pictures of the lightning . strike over Folkestone on Thursday night after climbing a hill . overlooking the port to take pictures of the sunset. He . said: 'I thought I would shoot the sunset and I got a nice panorama of . Folkestone before the sky suddenly went red and it felt very eerie . indeed. 'The sky changed . from red to black and clouds came tumbling in, so I decided to stay and . see what happened.  Then the lightening strikes came - great loud cracks . from the sky down onto the Creteway housing estate.' Electric atmosphere: Another CTG (cloud to ground) lightening bolt struck in the same area of the town exactly a minute after the first during last night's storm . Massive storm: The third, and loudest, lightening bolt struck a house in Eversley Road belonging to Sophia Swarbrick, who said on Facebook she cried from fear . Photographer Mr Shackle took this stunning panorama of Folkestone just before sunset last night, just before the sky turned red and an electrical storm struck . Now, however, with a sunshine weekend forecast, you could be forgiven for thinking that it is already summer. And . you would not be the only one… The unseasonably warm temperatures have . tricked some of our most beautiful flowers and trees into blossoming . early. Summer bluebells, . which normally form carpets of blue in May, are already flowering. And . our gardens are also full of colour from blooming tulips, peach blossom, . blackthorn and the May tree – which usually only erupts into white . flowers in time for May Day. Most plants stop growing when day and night time temperatures fall below 6C (43F) or 4C (39F). But . despite the devastating floods up until last month, the average . temperature was 5.2C (41.4F) throughout winter across Britain – making . it the fifth warmest winter since records began in 1910. Because the soil is far warmer than usual, plants have begun their spring growth early. Three day forecast: Much of Britain will enjoy a warm and sunny weekend, particularly the south east, and the warm temperatures will continue into next week . Official British Summer Time starts on Sunday, but this morning Dartmoor in Devon saw its first snow of the winter or spring, leaving daffodils wilting under the weight . The . Woodland Trust, which collects sightings of blossom each year for its . Nature’s Calendar project, has already had 14 reports of bluebells in . Berkeley, Gloucestershire; Colchester in Essex and as far north as . Hexham in County Durham. Last . year, the average date for bluebell flowering was May 2. Hawthorns have . began to bud three weeks early and blackthorn, another hedgerow tree, . is already in blossom. Meanwhile, . many daffodils and snowdrops have already bloomed and withered. Magnolia have been in full bloom for the last couple of weeks across . much of the country, while peach blossom, which normally bursts out in . early April, is now at its peak. Apple . trees do not usually flower until late April, but some are already . showing buds. The Woodland Trust has also had dozens of reports of . tortoiseshell butterflies and hundreds of sightings of ladybirds. Dr Kate Lewthwaite, project manager of the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar, said: ‘Spring is well and truly on its way.’ Guy .

"By . Lydia Warren For Mailonline . A quick-thinking state trooper has saved a suicidal man after spotting him just as he was about to jump off a bridge. Video taken by the camera on Maryland State Trooper Joshua Kim's cruiser recorded the dramatic moment he ran towards the man and pulled him away as he tried to climb over the edge. The heroic rescue came after Kim saw the man walking along the road while he drove across the Millard E. Tydings Memorial . Bridge over the Susquehanna River on Saturday. Kim also saw a parked car so he turned around to check on the man. Scroll down for video . In danger: A Maryland State Trooper spotted this man standing near the edge of the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge and approached him. The man can be seen trying to wave him on . Quick thinking: But as the trooper climbs out of his cruiser, the man goes to jump off the side of the bridge . As the cruiser slows down, the video shows the man apparently dismissing him with his hand before starting to climb over the wall. But Kim is quick on his feet and runs towards the man, grabbing him around the chest and pulling him backwards away from the edge. 'Most of what you see in that video is me . thinking on my own, because I didn't want to go over the bridge with . him, so I got down on my knees and pulled him back,' Kim told WBAL. Both men fall on the ground and Kim is able to put handcuffs on him for his own safety, the video shows. The man, who told Kim he had been thinking about jumping off the bridge for about an hour after struggling with medical issues and problems with his daughter, was not charged. Tackle: He grabs him and pulls him back from the edge just moments before the man would have jumped . Saved: He pulls the man to the ground. He later revealed he was suffering medical problems and was having problems with his daughter and had been thinking about jumping off the bridge for an hour . The trooper took him to Hartford Memorial Hospital, where he is being evaluated. Kim has been a trooper for two years and this is the first time he has saved a person's life, Maryland State police spokeswoman Elena Russo told the Havre De Grace Patch. 'It could have been tragic for both of . them,' Russo said. 'It took a lot of courage putting his own life in danger.' The video was shared on YouTube and the Maryland State Police's Facebook page, where viewers praised the trooper for his work. 'Our heroes at work!!' one wrote. 'Fantastic response and reaction.

"By . Jenny Awford . This is the moment a heroic grandmother grabbed a knife-wielding thug and foiled his attempt to rob a corner shop. Katrina Mooney, 39, has revealed that her only thought was to protect the young female employee who was being threatened by the hooded robber. CCTV footage recorded her berating the offender and pulling him away from the counter – eventually forcing him out of the Merseyside shop. Scroll down for video . Super-gran Katrina Mooney, 39, confronted the hooded robber who was brandishing a knife and threatening a shop worker at News Plus in Wallasey, Merseyside . Despite being confronted with a weapon Mrs Mooney said she felt no fear as she made him abandon his plan to rob News Plus in Trafalgar Road, Wirral. The 39-year-old mother-of-two, who also has a grandchild, said: 'I was just trying to protect the girl. I had already seen the knife but he was waving it around a lot, but then as he went to walk out the door he waved the knife and I just said: 'Get out'. 'Then I said - What do you think you are doing threatening young girls with a knife – get out. 'When I grabbed him the first time, he pulled away from me and I just pulled him out. I just wanted him outside the shop.' Mrs Mooney, who works in a shop herself, said she was not scared at any point during the attempted robbery on August 2. The mum-of-two, who also had a grandchild, said she felt no fear when she stood up to the hooded thug who was brandishing a large blade . 'That thought never even entered my head,' she said. 'I was going in the shop to get something and that's when I saw her and heard something was going on. 'He was just staring at me, he didn't say anything until he got over the road and then he said he would be back for me.' People have now been stopping her on the street and calling her a 'hero'. But she insisted her bravery was just a natural reaction to the situation. She . said: 'It was just the thought of seeing the knife in the girl's face, . it was horrible. People are asking me if I'm alright. I'm fine, don't . worry about me.' Katrina is then seen dragging the male offender from the shop to make sure that he does not threaten the female employee again . Police have not made any arrests, but they have seized a car  which they believe may be connected to the incident. The thug entered News Plus in Wallasey just before 6pm, tapping an employee on the shoulder as she refilled the fridge then brandishing the knife. Shop owner Jane Callister said: 'He came in and the girl who was working was filling up the fridge at the time. 'He came up behind her and I think he first tapped her on the arm. She thought he wanted to get in the fridge so she stepped out of his way not realising. The super-gran is seen pushing the robber out of the shop and she then follows him outside. People have now been approaching Katrina in the street and calling her a hero . 'Then he said, very quietly, 'Don't say anything, get all of the money out the till', and waved the knife at her. 'He pushed her behind the counter and followed her in towards the counter. She went over to the corner and he was stood waving the knife at her.' After a brief exchange the man left the Trafalgar Road shop - just as Jane arrived from the back with her dogs. Jane said: 'This woman, she just grabbed him by the arm and said 'what are you doing?' The attempted robbery took place on August 2 at News Plus in Wallasey, Merseyside. The hooded thug demanded money and threatened a shop-worker with a knife . 'She is a proper hero. He pulled away and she grabbed him again and said 'don't you be threatening a young girl with a knife'.' Jane, 42, said she knew the courageous customer and would thank her for her heroics with a bottle of wine. She added: 'It just seemed a bit surreal, the whole thing did to be honest.' Detectives from Wirral CID have released CCTV stills of a man they want to speak to following the attempted robbery on Saturday August 2. A man was seen driving off from the incident in a Fiat Punto. A similar vehicle was later seen on Toronto Road by officers, and two men made off from the vehicle. Detective Sergeant John Christiansen said: 'Although nothing was stolen, this was an extremely frightening attack on the staff member and we are keen to hear from anyone who recognises this man.' Anyone with information is asked to call Wirral CID on 0151 777 2262 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Super-gran Katrina Mooney confronted the hooded thug in the corner shop .

"By . Associated Press . Former Vermont U.S. Sen. James Jeffords, who in 2001 tipped control of the Senate when he quit the Republican Party to become an independent, died Monday. He was 80. Jeffords died in Washington, said Diane Derby, a former aide to Jeffords. He had been in declining health, she said. Jeffords had announced in 2005 that he would not seek a fourth term, citing his and his wife's health problems. FILE - This May 25, 2006 file photo shows Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt. on Capitol Hill in Washington. Jeffords, who in 2001 tipped control of the Senate when he quit the Republican Party to become an independent has died. James Jeffords was 80.  (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File) 'I have had an enormously satisfying career, one that I would not have traded for any other,' Jeffords said when he retired. 'In no other job do you have both the freedom and obligation to solve problems and help people on a daily basis.' Vermont's sole congressman, independent Bernie Sanders, was elected to Jeffords' Senate seat in 2006. U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Monday that Jeffords was a partner and friend who worked for Vermont. 'He was a Vermonter through and through, drawn to political life to make a difference for our state and nation,' Leahy said. 'Part of his legacy will also stand as an enduring chapter of the Senate's history.' Jeffords served more than 30 years in Washington. He won election to the House in 1974 as a Republican. The post-Watergate year was a strong one for Democrats nationally, but Jeffords was running as Vermont was just beginning its shift from a century of solid Republicanism to its current status as among the most liberal states. The Rutland native, a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School, already had won statewide office as attorney general and was from a well-known Vermont Republican family. His father, Olin Jeffords, had been chief justice of the state Supreme Court. FILE - In this March 14, 2003, file photo, Sen.

Jeffords, who in 2001 tipped control of the Senate when he quit the Republican Party to become an independent, died Monday, Aug. 18, 2014, in Washington. He was 80. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) During his time in Washington, . Jeffords stood out as a moderate to liberal Republican during a time . when the party was moving to the right. He was a strong backer of . legislation supporting education, the environment, job training and help . for people with disabilities. He . was the only Republican in the House to vote against President Ronald . Reagan's tax cuts in 1981. After election to the Senate in 1988, . replacing another moderate Republican, Robert Stafford, Jeffords opposed . the first President Bush's appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court. A decade . later, when Republicans had gained control of both the White House and . both houses of Congress, Jeffords, upset with President George W. Bush's . opposition to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, decided . that was the last straw. In May of 2001, he declared he would leave the . Republicans and caucus with the Democrats. Long political career: February 20, 2005, photo, Senator Jim Jeffords, talks during an interview at the Statehouse in Montpelier, Vermont . Republicans . were apoplectic, particularly since Jeffords' switch cost them control . of the closely divided Senate. GOP Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi . dubbed Jeffords' action a 'coup of one,' and described it as 'the . impetuous decision of one man to undermine our democracy.' At the heart of Jeffords' decision was . a belief that Republicans in general and President Bush in particular . had become too conservative and that he could not remain in a party that . favored tax breaks for the wealthy over full funding of education . programs for the disabled. He . complained at the time that the Republicans in control of both the . White House and Congress 'were set out on an agenda that did not fit . into what the average American wanted to see.' The . Democrats' control of the Senate was brief. Republicans took it back 18 . months later, and added to their gains the 2004 elections. But . Democrats regained Senate control in 2006. Jeffords . became a hero to Democrats, attracting huge crowds as he traveled the . country helping to bring in millions in 2002 and 2004 for Democratic . candidates. But he resisted calls that he drop the independent label and . become a Democrat himself, saying he could not go against several . generations of family history. 'For . more than 30 years, Jim has fought to do the right thing, standing . against extremism,' former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who later served as . chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said when Jeffords . announced his retirement. 'His work ethic, patriotism and commitment to . serving the people of Vermont have made him a model to all of us who . know him and have had the honor to work with him.' Jeffords . was said to be eager to run for re-election in 2006 to show Republicans . that Vermont would elect him as an independent, and he had won the . endorsements of state Democratic leaders. The state GOP chairman called . him a 'turncoat' in a fundraising letter. Eventually, . though, the health problems he faced and those of his wife prompted him . to retire. Jeffords' family and staff had questioned whether the . then-70-year-old senator was physically and mentally up to a statewide . campaign. He had stumbled in a radio interview and was confused about . some of his votes. His wife, Liz, died in 2007 after battling cancer. He later lived in a retirement home in the Washington area and stayed out of the limelight.","Former Vermont Senator James Jeffords has died .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A woman died at a care home after she became engulfed in a fireball while setting  the carpets alight, an inquest heard. Staff were alerted to the shocking tragedy in March by the screams of another resident and described how they rushed to help 58-year-old Patricia Bryan. But the 60-a-day smoker did not make a sound as she was consumed by the fireball, and instead walked purposefully towards an outside smoking area. Patricia Bryan, 58, died at a care home in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, after she became engulfed in a fireball while setting the carpets alight . Care assistant Alex Robertson told the inquest in Nottingham: 'Pat was on fire and she was walking towards the rear exit. 'The carpets were also on fire and I reached Pat just as she got to the bottom of the steps and I discharged the fire extinguisher at her. 'She had stopped walking and was just stood facing me.' The inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death, concluding that schizophrenic Ms Bryan had set herself on fire with a disposable lighter at the privately-owned Thistle Hill Hall care home in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, but said they believed she had not intended to die. Earlier in the three-day hearing, the jury heard that Ms Bryan had walked through the home, where she had been a resident since 2007, setting fire to carpets as molten fabric dropped from her clothing. Ms Bryan died at the privately-owned Thistle Hill Hall care home in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire (pictured here) She died from her injuries seven hours later after being flown by air ambulance for specialist care at a hospital in Birmingham. She had suffered 68 per cent burns. The tragedy triggered a multi-agency investigation involving the NHS, the Health and Safety Executive, police, social services, and the home. Assistant coroner Jane Gillespie directed the jury to rule out verdicts of suicide or neglect due to a lack or evidence. Speaking after the hearing, daughter Tracy Stone said: 'There should be a law preventing residents in homes like this from carrying lighters or even a full smoking ban.' Ms Bryan was banned from having her own lighter in the home, the inquest heard. But she would frequently buy them when she went into the community unsupervised, or borrow a lighter from other residents. She had initially been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, but was later placed on a Community Treatment Order in a bid to help her live more independently.","Patricia Bryan, 58, died at a care home in Nottinghamshire .

"He denies having an affair with another woman while his wife Elizabeth Vargas was in rehab for alcohol abuse. But now Marc Cohn is admitting the married couple of 12 years are dealing with their fair share of difficulties. In a statement to People, the Grammy-winning songwriter reveals 'long-standing issues' exist in his relationship with the 20/20 anchor. Issues: Marc Cohn revealed there are 'long-standing issues' with his marriage to 20/20 anchor Elizabeth Vargas, pictured here together in 2012 . 'I will not comment on what is an extremely sensitive and private family matter – addiction and recovery are serious challenges and it's been a tough road for all of us,' Cohn told the magazine. 'I have been supportive of Elizabeth in the past – and will continue to be – regardless of the long-standing issues in our relationship.' While he does not go into further detail regarding those issues, Marc is making reference to reports that he had an affair with another woman- the couple's mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman- after he was spotted having dinner with her shortly after Vargas returned to Manhattan from rehab. Rumours: With the cheating allegations and his wife's stint in rehab, Cohn said 'it's been a tough road for all of us', pictured here in December 2012 . A source close to the magazine said Cohn 'has a strong emotional investment in how the story is told because his primary concern are his kids and he doesn't want to look like a bad guy when he's not.' The source further added, 'It's a complicated situation since what seems new in the public is a longstanding challenge for them over the years.' Despite the cheating allegations, the Walking In Memphis songwriter has tried to remain tight-lipped. 'I have no comment regarding vicious rumors about a so-called “affair,”' he told MailOnline through a spokesperson. Friend or foe: The affair was reported when a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with he and Elizabeths' mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman, one of the founders of Flywheel Sports spin studios . 'I have encouraged and supported Elizabeth's recovery as her years of struggle have been hard on everyone. Out of deference to my family's privacy, I will not comment further.' Sources have confirmed to MailOnline that Vargas and Cohn are still living together and have not separated, but his side suggested that it is because he wants to remain as 'a stabilizing force for both Elizabeth and the children'. Adding to the love triangle is the fact that both Vargas and Cohn were friends with Zuckerman, the divorced head of Flywheel Sports, ahead of the alleged affair. They met her by taking spinning classes at her workout chain. Unidentified sources told MailOnline that in spite of the allegations, Cohn and Vargas are still living together and have not separated. Opening up: Vargas spoke on The View in February about her recovery and how her husband was the one to alert her to a dependency problem . The source also said that they never separated and were still a couple both during and after Vargas' treatment in spite of the reports that a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with Zuckerman near the Flywheel outpost in Manhattan's Flatiron district at some point after her treatment ended. Vargas left the treatment program in mid-November and then gave several interviews when she returned to work in January. A different friend told The New York Post said that Cohn and Zuckerman had been more than friends for more than just one meal. 'It was disgusting that he was with Ruth while Elizabeth was in rehab,' the source told The Post. Legal definitions: Friends of Cohn, known best for his hit 'Walking in Memphis', said that he has not moved out or ended his relationship with Vargas. Zuckerman, right, is divorced . Friends of the 'Walking in Memphis' singer denied that anything untoward happened in the first place and said that Cohn and Vargas had separated but MailOnline's sources denied that any a split had ever happened. Cohn, 54, and Vargas, 51, were introduced by Andre Agassi at the U.S. Open in 1999. They dated for three years before getting married in 2002 and Vargas gave birth to their first son Zachary six months later. Their second son Sam was born in 2006. During her post-treatment interviews, Vargas said that her husband was the one who encouraged her to get help for her alcohol dependency. 'Mark has been extremely supportive of Elizabeth over the years and its been a long haul,' a friend close to the family told MailOnline.","Marc Cohn has issued a statement admitting 'long-standing issues' in his marriage to Elizabeth Vargas .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A young mother who kept a diary recording her experimentation with legal highs died after taking a new drug known as 'benzofury' which has since been criminalised, an inquest heard today. Lucy Simms, 26, was discovered lying dead on her bedroom floor in Southampton, Hampshire after taking APB - also known as benzo fury - to get a ‘buzz’. Just days after her death the drug, which had been bought on the internet, was listed for reconsideration and has now been upgraded to a Class B substance. Drug: Young mother Lucy Simms, 26, was discovered lying dead on her bedroom floor in Southampton, Hampshire after taking former legal high APB - also known as benzo fury - to get a 'buzz' The inquest into the blonde mother-of-one's death heard how she made and took a ‘bomb’ of APB by wrapping the powder up in a Rizla cigarette paper while at home. Police investigating her death discovered that Miss Simms had kept diaries of her experiments with legal highs and their effects on her body - and she had previously written ‘my heart is going to attack’. Winchester Coroner’s Court heard Miss Simms’s lover Lloyd Phillips, who ran a store selling legal highs, had given her the drug and was there when she took it on June 3 last year. He left to spend the night at his own home at around 8pm, kissing her goodbye at the door, and returned as arranged the next afternoon - only to find her body. A post mortem examination on Miss Simms, who was found lying naked on a nightdress with electrical cables looped loosely around her upper body, had around 80 bruises and abrasions. Police launched an investigation due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and Phillips was arrested and questioned, but later released without charge. There were no signs of anyone causing her death. At . the time of Miss Simms's death, Phillips was on police bail, preparing . to take the stand in a retrial concerning the rape of a 22-year-old . woman. He was later . convicted of drugging her before wheeling her unconscious into a London . hotel and attacking her during a nine-hour ordeal. Miss Simms had a young daughter with her former partner Gary Willoughby (pictured), who attended today's hearing . Phillips . was jailed for 11 years after being convicted of two counts of rape and . four counts of serious sexual assault and pleading guilty to drugs . charges. In a statement read . to the inquest today, Phillips described how he and Miss Simms had . spent the day before her death relaxing in the garden and she had taken . the drug. 'As I got closer to the bedroom door I realised Lucy’s bed had been moved and was closer to the door,' he said. 'I could see her lying on the floor. I think I shouted to her to stop messing around and there was no response. 'I stepped onto the bed and as I stepped over onto the other side I realised something was up. 'Lucy was lying still on her back and there were blue marks on her body and her hands were in front of her chest. 'I . pulled the cover off and saw her eyes were open and blue marks on her . face. I went to the other side of the bed and went downstairs. 'I was in shock. I had a glass of water. Some of Lucy’s powder was on the side and I turned the tap on and disposed of it. 'I then went outside and left the bag in a bin.' He then dialled 999 and paramedics and police attended at around 1pm on June 4, 2013. Toxicology tests showed Miss Simms, had 7.5 microgrammes of APB per litre of blood in her body. Experts . said ABP’s adverse effects are similar to those of amphetamines and . ecstasy, and include elevated blood pressure, raised heart rate and . hyperthermia. There were also antidepressants in her system. Pathologist . Russell Delaney said: 'Lucy had been experimenting with this drug and . other drugs and had been keeping a diary of the effects she was . experiencing. 'She had described having raised heart rate and she had written at one point: ‘My heart is going to attack’. 'Lucy had been experimenting with this drug and . other drugs and had been keeping a diary of the effects she was . experiencing' Pathologist Russell Delaney . 'It is consistent with what somebody might be experiencing if they were having those signs and symptoms.' Police Sergeant Gareth Jones said packets of APB 5 and 6 were found in the property, along with Miss Simms diaries of her attempts ‘to create the maximum buzz’. Miss Simms had a young daughter with her former partner Gary Willoughby, who attended today's hearing. Hampshire and New Forest Coroner Grahame Short said Miss Simms had ‘fatal levels’ of APB in her blood and concluded she died as the result of an accident. It was classified as a class B drug on June 10, 2014. 'Having heard all the evidence I am satisfied that on the balance of probabilites the death was caused by very high levels of APB found in Lucy’s body,' Mr Short said. 'There is no evidence any third party forced Lucy to swallow APB, which was believed to be in the form of a bomb. 'There was a lot of evidence Lucy chose to consume it and was experimenting with various drugs to record the effects on her. 'I have read her notes, they are very methodical and she recorded the results of a series of tests and the effects they were having on herself. 'She has described some of the symptoms which were described by others. 'There is no indication she intended to cause her death so I have ruled out suicide. 'This was therefore an accidental death. 'The evidence shows Lucy did not intend to end her life but did not fully understand the effects of the drugs she was taking and the chemical effect of the things she was swallowing.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Jeremy Paxman has angered elderly people after joking about them on his stand-up comedy debut . Jeremy Paxman has angered elderly people after suggesting that euthanasia clinics should be set up on every street corner during his stand-up comedy debut. The former Newsnight host made the controversial comment during a warm up gig for his new Edinburgh Fringe show at an Islington theatre last night. The 64-year-old qualifies for his own pension next year, but the Evening Standard reported that he said on stage: 'The dislike of old people - I share this prejudice despite almost being one myself. 'The problem with old people is they are bloody everywhere. You cannot get on a train or go to a country pub. 'They are all full of old people. 'Through no fault of their own, they believe the state owes them a living. 'They are under the illusion they have paid to a pension fund all their lives. But they haven't.' He went on to blame the government, saying: 'Successive governments have comprehensively mismanaged the whole pension arrangements in this country. 'Their pensions are being paid out of what you earn. 'So we all have to keep working so they can stay in that state of euphoria. 'I would like to invite you all to join my crowd-funded project for franchises of Dignitas clinics. 'We will have them on every street corner. It would be rather like Sweeney Todd's pie shop and will be disguised as tea shops. 'You will take Aunty Doris there and drop her off and she will say ""see you next Tuesday"" and you'll say ""probably"".' Dignitas is an organisation in Switzerland which assists people in taking their own lives when they have a terminal or severe mental or physical illness. Pensioner groups have spoken out against the journalist's comments, slamming them as 'inconsiderate' and 'unjust'. Neil White, Director of Southwark Pensioners Centre, said: ‘A lot of people have paid into this county through many decades of their lives and everyone has the right to pay into it and later withdraw a pension. ‘The older generation are the ones who fought for our rights and our dignity as a country. 'They’re the generations who went through the wars and saw the roots of the NHS, the are who we should honour and respect. Paxman quit as Newsnight host in June, and is being replaced by journalist and Dragons' Den host Evan Davis . ‘They . deserve retirement, a lot of them have worked for many years and . supported their children through many difficult circumstances. ‘They have paid in so they deserve to reap the benefits.’ ‘It’s . unfair and not very considerate what Mr Paxman said. Everyone has . grandparents and parents, you only have to speak with them to see the . challenges they have gone through and face now. ‘If . Mr Paxman would like to find out how the other half live we’d love to . introduce him to some of our members who have fought for this country . and sacrificed a lot to pay into the system and support their families . and communities.' Mr White added the TV presenter's comments about Dignitas were unhelpful and muddied a controversial debate. ‘The . Dignitas comment is not a helpful comment, it’s a controversial issue . and he would be more advised to do more research and find out what the . real situation is.’ ‘Every . day we see people come to us for guidance who is relying on benefits . and some of them have contributed to the UK economy for 50 or 60 years.’ ‘We need to support older people as a society. ‘ . Paxman's . Islington performance was a warm up for the main event -  his new show . 'Paxo', which he is taking to the Edinburgh Fringe next week. He quit as Newsnight host in June, to be replaced by Evan Davis, and though he continues as quizmaster on University Challenge, he has turned to stand-up to fill the void. Around 200 people attended the gig at the Pleasance Theatre, which saw him use a spinning wheel labelled with different topics, which he would then rant about in trademark style when the needle landed on them. Paxman's new show will play all week from Monday August 18 at the Pleasance Cabaret Bar in Edinburgh.","Former Newsnight host riles pensioners with assisted death quip .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A heartbroken sister has pleaded for a crackdown on 'legal highs' which she believes left her brother 'looking like a vampire' before his death this week. Father-of-three Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath, Angus, passed away at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee following a five-month addiction to new psychoactive substances (NPS), which caused him severe heart problems. Laura McKay, 35, wants her brother’s case to highlight how people are being made vulnerable to 'dangerous' unregulated and untested substances - some of which are readily available over the counter. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath (pictured left when he was 15 years old) died 'looking like a vampire' because of legal highs, his sister Laura believes . She spoke after figures revealed that deaths involving NPS in Scotland have more than doubled since last year. Miss McKay, who has her own cleaning business, believes that people don’t understand the dangers associated with using these substances. Family: Laura McKay, 35, wants her brother's death to highlight how people in society are being made vulnerable to 'dangerous' unregulated substances . She said: 'Michael had his personal difficulties in the past. He was a heroin user but had managed to put that behind him. 'He started buying these new drugs from a shop in Arbroath and you could see immediately he was addicted. 'He started taking them in May this year and the physical change in him was frightening. He lost four stone in five months. He ended up looking like a vampire. 'I think I’m past being angry. But I want people to know how these drugs killed Michael, and make sure no one’s children or brothers have to go through what he did.' She added: 'A lot of people in Arbroath thought he was a kind, lovable man. He was just extremely lost.' Doctors initially thought Mr McKay was suffering from pneumonia before discovering an infection around his heart valves. Miss McKay said his condition had improved at the beginning of this week, following a course of antibiotics, and thought her brother had got over the worst of it. She last saw him the evening before he died. She said: 'I left him at 8.45pm, gave him a cuddle and said I loved him loads. And that was it. 12.10am, he was gone.' She has . lauded the work of the police-led Tayside Intensive Support Service, . which she described as a lifeline for herself and Michael. She . said: 'They saw Michael at his worst, saw him come on in leaps and . bounds, and saw him deteriorate. They have been with us all the way.' Decline: Miss McKay (pictured with her brother when he was seven years old) said he lost four stone in five months after he started buying the substances from a shop in Arbroath . The Reverend Martin Fair of St Andrews Church in Arbroath has been at the forefront of the campaign to try and close the town’s two shops selling ‘legal highs’. He said: 'I have been working with young people in Arbroath with addiction problems. In the last 18 months since these so called legal highs have been available it has just been fuel to the fire. 'The death toll is rising and until the authorities have the legislation or the powers to stop the sale of these substances they will continue to rise. I just wish these shop owners who are dealing this stuff would develop a conscience. 'I have known Michael for some years and although he had his problems over the years he was a really nice young guy. Sadly it looks like I will be conducting his funeral now.' Troubles: The father-of-three had a history of drug abuse and his sister believes he was 'extremely lost' Psychoactive substances are now openly available . The new psychoactive substances (NPS) have always been available in some form or another, with partygoers long using freely available substances like amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide to get a fix. However, the recent explosion in legal high use came with the rise in popularity of a class of drugs known as cathinones, particularly mephedrone, from 2007 onwards. The drug, which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets. The effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of MDMA, amphetamine and cocaine. It is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy, but with the short-lived hit of a line of coke. Mephedrone's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet and when the substance was finally banned in 2010 a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place. Many of them were produced by laboratories in China and bought and imported by entrepreneurs using popular wholesale websites like Alibaba.com. However their purity was difficult to ascertain. One legal drug which followed mephedrone in rising to popularity was 6-APB, known commonly as Benzo Fury. A molecule of the same phenethylamine class as MDMA, it marked a fresh attempt by enterprising chemists to circumvent drugs laws by slightly changing the chemical makeup of popular drugs. Those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators, with chemists synthesising new substances faster them Parliament can ban them, spawning a whole industry to feed Britain's hunger for mind-altering substances. However, unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known, the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery.","Michael McKay, 33, died in hospital this week after suffering heart problems .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A letter penned by Horatio Nelson using his right hand months before he lost the arm in battle is due to go up for auction . A letter penned by Lord Horatio Nelson using his right hand months before he lost the arm during a battle is set to go up for sale. The note, which is dated August 16 1795, was addressed from the then-Captain to a diplomat in Genoa, Italy, named Francis Drake. In the note, Nelson boasts about the size of his squadron after being promoted to the rank of Commodore earlier in the year. He also explains his frustration about being kept 'completely in the dark' by the army about their movements on the continent. The correspondence, which is expected to sell for £10,000 when it goes up for auction, is a rare example of Nelson's handwriting before he lost his right arm following the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797. In 1795 Nelson was serving as a Post-Captain on board HMS Agamemnon in the fleet of Admiral Hotham, disrupting French convoys in the Mediterranean. On March 13 and 14, during the Battle of Genoa, Nelson distinguished himself after taking on the French vessel Ca Ira. Despite being massively outmanned and outgunned by the larger ship, Nelson managed to inflict significant damage, which later led to the Ca Ira's capture by British forces. Later the same year Nelson was promoted to Commodore following the Battle of Hyeres Islands on July 13 when he was one of only a few British ships to engage Rear Admiral Pierre Martin's French fleet, causing one of the vessels to burst into flames and explode. Dated August 16 1795, the letter is from Nelson - writing with his right hand - to Francis Drake, a diplomat in the Italian city of Genoa . Nelson had just been promoted to Commodore before the letter was written, and in it he boasts of the size of his squadron, saying it 'may never be this large again' In the letter, which is dated August 16, a 37-year-old Nelson can be seen flexing his muscles after his recent promotion. In the note, Lord Nelson expresses his disappointment that Francis Drake will not meet Admiral Hotham until he returns from Leghorn. At the time Nelson was under the command of Admiral Hotham. In the letter he laments the fact that Drake will not get to meet his commander . Lord Nelson said: 'I went off a great distance and wrote to the Admiral but his resolution to go first to Leghorn was so fixed that nothing could turn him. 'His despatches from the Admiralty are of such a nature as require him to head his fleet together for constant readiness for service. 'Perhaps you will still come here with what I can do with my present squadron, which may never be so large again, you can rest assured will be done. Ever your most faithful Horatio Nelson. 'If you could, without great inconvenience, come for a day to Vado I should like to know from you, the exact plans which the army is to follow, at present I am completely in the dark.' The provenance of the letter is confirmed by a note on the reverse of the paper that it was given to a descendant of Admiral Drake in September 1868. The letter, which was found in a house near Derby, is estimated to fetch between £8,000 and £10,000 when it is sold at Hansons Auction House on September 27. Charles Hanson from the auctioneers said: 'We are pleased to offer such an important part of our maritime history. 'The letter highlights even our greatest maritime war hero was often “in the dark” as to the movements the army were to follow. 'We always perceive Nelson to be at the helm of every battle and conflict and clearly in this letter he was somewhat concerned.' In 1795 Nelson was serving in the fleet of Admiral Hotham in the Mediterranean, on board his favourite ship the HMS Agamemnon. While Nelson, who was 37 at the time, started the year as a Post-Captain he was promoted to Commodore by the end of July after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Genoa, and than again at the Battle of Hyeres Islands. The letter, dated August 16, shows Nelson flexing his muscles in his new command. Writing to Francis Drake - a diplomat in Genoa, not the famous explorer - he boasts of the size of his squadron which 'may never be so large again.' He also laments the fact that Drake will not get to meet Hotham as he the commander been asked to depart for Leghorn, otherwise known as the Italian port city of Livorno. And, showing that Nelson has not yet reached the peak of his career, he also asks Drake for information on what the army is doing on shore, confessing that he is 'completely in the dark' about their movements. Nelson penned the letter in his right hand, two years before it was removed after he was wounded at the battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797 .","Letter written by Nelson in August 1975 when he still had his right hand .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Mark Bridger, 48, demanded thousands of pounds in compensation after he was attacked by a fellow prisoner, but has now been told he will get nothing . The killer of schoolgirl April Jones was today refused compensation after being slashed across the face by another prisoner. Paedophile Mark Bridger, 48, was also told that his request to move to another jail following the attack has also been rejected. Bridger is serving life at for kidnapping and murdering April, five, and has complained of threats and attacks by inmates at the maximum security prison where he is being held. He was slashed across the face with a blade by fellow murderer in July last year which left him needing hospital treatment and caused a scar across his face. Bridger claimed he was fearing for his life and demanded a move from HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, and thousands of pounds in compensation for the attack. But the family of murdered schoolgirl April Jones were today told his demands had been refused by the Ministry of Justice and he would not be receiving any money. In a short statement April’s parents Coral and Paul Jones said: 'Mark Bridger is not moving to a new jail. He is not getting any money for his cut on his face.' Father-of-six Bridger snatched April near her home in Machynlleth, Powys, in October 2012 and was given a whole-life sentence following a murder trial at Mold Crown Court in May last year. The five-year-old’s body has never been found - despite the largest search in British police history. Bridger was sent to the notorious HMP Wakefield, which has been nicknamed 'Monster Mansion', which is believed to house the likes of Stuart Hazell, who murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharpe, and Charles Bronson.

Bridger was attacked and slashed across the face by Juvinai Ferreira, 22, an inmate who is serving a life sentence for murder. Bridger needed hospital treatment for a face wound but was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched up. April’s mother Coral said at the time: 'I hope he’s threatened every day for the rest of his life. Every day I’m suffering - I’ve got a lifetime of hell to live through. 'Him wanting to be moved is disgusting. He did the crime, now he’s got to do the time.' In January, Bridger abandoned an appeal against his sentence just 11 days before the hearing. He will now die behind bars after judges rejected a European ruling that no-parole terms breached human rights.

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A bus company in Cornwall has confused commuters after attaching a timetable to a lamppost down the road from where passengers can actually get on to the bus. Bus company First Group said they were forced to put the sign up on a pole 400 yards from the bus stop because it was the closest post they could attach it to. The rogue timetable has lead to some residents in St Austell, Cornwall, waiting for buses in the wrong spot, with one local claiming a man was clipped by a car while trying to walk to the lamppost. Passengers in Cornwall have been left confused after a bus company attached a timetable to the lamppost despite the nearest stop being 400 yards up the road . The company says it was unable to attach the timetable closer to the actual bus stop (pictured) because there was no nearby lamppost to attach it to . Locals say passengers have been left waiting for the bus in the wrong spot after the timetable was attached to a post 400 yards away from the actual bus stop . Local resident Andrew Perrin said: 'It is a death trap to walk there. Some of the buses have refused to stop there because that road is just so bad.' He added that some buses have even started stopping next to the timetable, further adding to the confusion. David Edwards of Cornwall Council said: 'The bus stop at Phernyssick Road has not been relocated and is still sited in the same place. Residents say one man was clipped by a car while trying to walk to this lamppost, and worry that someone might get run over while waiting in the wrong place . 'The confusion has been caused because one of the bus companies has added a timetable case to a pole situated further up the road as there is no pole close to the bus stop. 'This has led to some people wrongly regarding this pole as the bus stop.

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Who should be England's next captain? Former team-mate Jamie Carragher is confident England's loss will be Liverpool's gain after Steven Gerrard announced his retirement from international football. Carragher, who played alongside Gerrard for both club and country, believes the 34-year-old midfielder has several more years in his legs as he prepares to embark upon another Champions League campaign. The former defender told Sky Sports News: 'Listen, for Liverpool Football Club, it's a great decision. I am sure the Liverpool supporters will be happy. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard announce his retirement from England duty . Stepping aside: Gerrard has decided to call it a day after competing in six major tournaments for England . Backing: Gerrard's friend and team-mate Carragher thinks he has made the right decision . 'You get a fresher Steven Gerrard. He had a great season last season with the demands of England. 'But there will be more demands on Liverpool this season, more expected because of the season they had last year, and Steven Gerrard is still a vital part of Liverpool - and I think he will be for the next two or three years, so for (manager) Brendan Rodgers, it's a great decision by Stevie.' Carragher insists Gerrard could have continued to represent both Liverpool and England, as he did last season, although he admits the demands of Europe's most prestigious club competition lie behind his decision. He said: 'I think he could have. I think he has shown that throughout his career, he has been able to deal with the demands of Liverpool and England. Leader: Gerrard captained England at two World Cups and one European Championship . 'I think just that fact of Liverpool being back into Europe now, that adds to the schedule of games. 'At times, you are playing two or three times a week because he is still vitally important to Liverpool, and I think he is also for England in some ways because there isn't a natural person you could see taking the role he has now with England in terms of that holding role, that sitting role. 'There are not many young players coming through in that role, but England will have to find someone to fill that role.' Wonderstrike: Gerrard scores in England's 5-1 win over Germany in 2001 . Gerrard ended his England career having won the last of his 114 caps at an ultimately disappointing World Cup finals in Brazil, and Carragher admits he will have done so, like many of his contemporaries, regretting the fact that a so-called Golden Generation never quite reached the heights expected of it. He said: 'Of course, that's not just Steve, that's a whole generation of those players, that they never got quite close enough, maybe even getting to a semi-final or a final in a big tournament. 'You think of the players they have had over the last decade or so, I think it will be a big disappointment for all of them. Glory days: Carragher (left) and Gerrard celebrate winning the Champions League in 2005 . 'That's why it probably was a bigger decision, because England didn't do so well in the summer. 'I think he would have loved to have had a great World Cup, the team do really well, all come back and then his decision to retire may have been a bit easier because I think he, along with a lot of those players who played in that decade or so, may feel we probably should have achieved more.' Former England colleague Rio Ferdinand took to Twitter after hearing the news. Ferdinand tweeted: 'Next England captain??? Gerrard has been an incredible player. Surpassing 100 caps is some achievement.' He was joined by former England striker Gary Lineker, who posted: 'Steven Gerrard has retired from international football. He's been a wonderful servant to his country. A great player who always gave all.' England midfielder Jack Wilshere tweeted: 'Amazing international career, inspirational Captain, an absolute honour to play with someone I looked up to growing up and still do! #SG4.' Old friends: Ferdinand (second right) with Gerrard on international duty back in 2006 . Role model: Wilshere (right) played alongside Gerrard for England at the World Cup . Former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry paid tribute to an international captain who allowed his football to do his talking. Parry said: 'Steven was the sort who led by example. He wasn't necessarily always demonstrative or the one that made the most noise, but he was a true leader by example. 'He had a quieter determination, a phenomenal will to succeed and he's the sort who would have gone around making his point to the players one by one and quietly without being as demonstrative as some. 'But I know it was something that he cared absolutely passionately about. Despite all the honours he had won, it was a great honour for him when he was finally given the captaincy.'","Gerrard retires from international football at age of 34 .

De Boer’s 50-yard pass, which was from within his own half, Bergkamp . somehow controlled the ball immediately, delicately bringing it down . with a touch. But that is just the first of three moments of exquisite . football. The second is the switch in body shape to touch the ball onto . the ground and swivel past Roberto Ayala. Floored genius: Bergkamp lies on the floor after his wonderful strike ended Argentina's World Cup hopes . Mobbed: Bergkamp is grabbed by Ronald de Boer and Pierre van Hooijdonk after his wonder strike . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands highlights . ‘After . the second touch I know this can’t go wrong,’ said Bergkamp, though . plenty of ordinary footballers couldn’t vouch for that quite as . certainly. Good as his word, the finish, leaving goalkeeper Carlos Roa . no chance, formed the third part of a moment of aesthetic beauty. ‘You’re . in that moment,’ said Bergkamp later. ‘That’s the feeling. After the . first two touches… that moment! It’s like your life has led up to this . moment.’ It . wasn’t just that magnitude of the game that elevated the goal. Holland . had been down to ten men, with Artur Numan having been sent off, and . Bergkamp wasn’t even playing well. In fact he shouldn’t have even been . playing at all, give that he had stamped on Yugoslavia’s Sinisa . Mihajlovic in  the previous round, an act of aggression the referee had . missed. Early lead: Patrick Kluivert fired Holland ahead in the 12th minute with a typically instinctive finish inside the box . Level pegging: Claudio Lopez fired Argentina level six minutes later after outwitting Van der Sar . Argentina . looked the more likely winners when, on 87 minutes, Ariel Ortega . advanced into the Dutch penalty area and took on Jaap Stam before . falling to the ground. The referee was not deceived, no penalty was . awarded and as Edwin Van der Sar walked over to berate the Argentine for . diving, Ortega jumped up, directing his forehead at the Dutch . goalkeeper’s chin in a head butt. Ortega was off and suddenly it seemed . the match had been equalled up with ten against ten for extra time. Except . that, 53 seconds after the re-start following Ortega’s red card, . Bergkamp’s strike was landing in the back of Argentina’s net. On the back foot: Artur Numan (No 5) is sent off after receiving his second yellow card of the game . Losing his head: Edwin van der Sar falls to the ground after being headbutted by a wild Ariel Ortega . A game which had been slipping away from Holland had turned on a minute of frenzied action. ‘I . don’t think you can ever play a perfect game,’ said Bergkamp once, . before being reminded of that goal. Wasn’t that perfection? ‘Yeah,’ conceded Bergkamp. ‘That moment is perfection.’ But perfection never lasts. Holland went out on penalties to Brazil in their semi-final three days later. VIDEO Van Gaal hopeful of Van Persie fitness .","The Dutch maestro's magnificent winner against Argentina 16 years ago remains one of the great World Cup goals .

Real Madrid appealed against midfielder Xabi Alonso being suspended for the Champions League final after he picked up a third booking in the semi-final, but UEFA ruled that appeal was inadmissible. Should FIFA overturn the yellow card it would be hugely controversial and would allow other teams to claim that the governing body is favouring the hosts.

"By . Chris Wheeler . ‘You're Man United and your captain is Scouse’ sang the Swansea fans at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. It was a fitting taunt towards the United supporters who were still revelling in Steven Gerrard’s misfortune when missing out on the title last season, some of whom will never forget that Rooney wanted to leave their club not once but twice. Others will accept that United need Rooney now more than ever, as he proved with an acrobatic equaliser in his first game since being installed as Louis van Gaal’s captain on a permanent basis. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: Rooney must be a captain off the pitch too . Lion's roar: Wayne Rooney celebrates his first goal of the Louis van Gaal era as Manchester United captain . Have a word: Rooney makes his feelings clear to a team-mate as United fell to defeat against Swansea . Acrobat: Rooney slams home United's equaliser with an overhead kick from Juan Mata's corner . Vocal: Wayne Rooney makes his feelings known with the captain's armband proudly on his sleeve . ‘Let it fly’ has been Van Gaal’s advice to the England striker and he followed it to the letter. Going airborne to meet the ball with an overhead kick in the second half, Rooney hauled his team back into the game. It will be by no means the last time they lean heavily on him for goals this season. Traditionally that goal would have been the point United kicked on and overran the opposition but those days now seem depressingly distant for their supporters. Rooney’s strike ultimately proved to be irrelevant and it will irk him that his first game as official club captain ended in defeat to Swansea City. Van Gaal’s words of advice alluded to the England striker not allowing the added responsibility of being skipper to weigh him down and inhibit his game. Leading the way: Rooney looked the part sporting the armband during the pre match pleasantries . Setting an example: Rooney jumps out of Jordi Amat's way as he attempts a challenge on the striker . Jumping for joy: The Old Trafford crowd were delighted with the England striker's equaliser . Inspiring the Reds: Rooney led by example on his first appearance as full-time United captain . Suits you: Rooney doesn't hide his delight after scoring to cap his first game as United skipper . Great captains grow in stature with the armband and Van Gaal saw signs from Rooney against Valencia on Tuesday night that he was trying too hard to justify his appointment ahead of Robin van Persie. It is difficult to know at what stage a player is trying too hard; when he stops dragging his team forward and they start dragging him down. In the first half it certainly felt like the latter as Rooney tried to raise United from an attacking stupor. One ambitious effort was attempted from 30 yards. Had he caught the shot properly and hit the back of the net, Old Trafford would have been on its feet. Dejection: Rooney and his vice-captain Darren Fletcher reflect on what has gone wrong after going behind . Pushing hard: Rooney's goal wasn't enough for United even as he tried to make up the deficit . Instead it bobbled rather embarrassingly along the ground and only just made it through to Lukasz Fabianski. Another shot from range was easily anticipated by Jordi Amat and a downward header from Ashley Young’s cross was directed straight at Fabianski. There was no denying Rooney eight minutes after the interval, however, and he almost put United ahead with a clever free kick that clipped the outside of Fabianski’s left upright. Gylfi Sigurdsson silenced Old Trafford, however, and as the United fans once again drifted away wondering where it has all gone wrong, the fact that the club’s captain is Scouse was the least of their worries.","Rooney wore the armband in Louis van Gaal's first game against Swansea .

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . There was always something a bit ridiculous about FIFA banning Luis Suarez from ‘all-football-related activity’. It was a bit like a school headmaster dishing out a month’s worth of detentions to an unruly pupil and then adding: ‘And you have to go to bed early every night with no dinner’. They were out of their element; ruling beyond their area of jurisdiction. Barcelona pay Luis Suarez’ wages if they want him clocking in at 9.30 sharp for training at their Joan Gamper training complex who is Sepp Blatter to tell them that can’t happen. What FIFA do about a player’s participation in their competitions, however, is another matter and it is no great surprise that the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS) have not over-ruled them on that part of the ban. Although both Suarez and Barcelona were hoping for more, CAS has limited itself to reigning-in the game’s governing body, rather than meddle in the number of matches it felt fitted the crime. Ruling: Luis Suarez's camp were hoping that the length of the ban would have been reduced . Autograph: The Uruguayan forward sing footballs for fans outside the court . As to the question: are nine missed matches for Uruguay and 11 for Barcelona excessive? There are two ways of looking at the ban. One is that after a third offence of the same nature, an exemplary punishment was inevitable. The other is that in view of the three-match ban given to Zinedine Zidane for poleaxing Marco Materazzi with a headbutt to the sternum in the 2006 World Cup final, 20 games is a disproportionate penalty and more a reflection on who was offending, rather than the offence itself. Suarez’ legal team took such an argument to Lausanne with them as well as the apparent contradiction inherent in such a lengthy ban being given for a bite which did not prevent Georgio Chiellini from finishing the match, and the decision to take no action against Blaise Matuidi’s leg-breaking challenge on Ogeny Onazi or Juan Zuniga’s assault on Neymar that also broke a bone. CAS has chosen not to involve itself in the debate over whether punishment should reflect the victim’s time out of the game. Instead they have just fairly and squarely pushed FIFA back over the line it had crossed. In view of the fact that they have limited themselves to changing the details of the ban and not its length the only surprise is perhaps that it took them a week to do so. Incident: Luis Suarez bite's Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup match . The timing of their decision does mean that Suarez can play Barcelona’s last pre-season friendly against Mexican club FC Léon de Guanjuato on Monday and be presented to supporters. The lifting of the ban on non-official matches means he can also play for Uruguay in forthcoming friendlies against Japan and Korea although the fact that he definitely misses the Copa America, to be played in Chile next year, will perhaps make his involvement in those games unlikely. The Suarez camp had high hopes on Thursday morning but there was also an expectation that getting any FIFA ruling over-turned was going to be impossible. Suarez can at least start feeling like a footballer again. He does not have to go running in the Pyrenees or in disguise along the beach of his new home on the Costa Brava. Bite: Suarez was not even booked after the incident, but was later handed a four-month ban . Marks: Chiellini attempted to show the referee the bite marks on his shoulder, but to no avail . And he can now begin training alongside Leo Messi and Neymar – the trio Barcelona hope will put them back in the trophies after last season’s failings. The club can arrange as many trial matches as possible to make sure he is as fit as possible for October 25 when his ban ends, and for the following day when Real Madrid will be the rivals in his long-awaited debut. Those who want him locked up and the key thrown away will rejoice that the matches-ban stands. Those who know him off the field will hope when he comes back he can finally overcome the unpleasant, bizarre, and ultimately only self-destructive trait that currently means he starts every season at least a month after everyone else.","Luiz Suarez's ban was not overturned by Court for Arbitration in Sport .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Nothing sums up the gap between Burnley and their first Premier League opponents Chelsea quite like the sight of manager Sean Dyche conducting his opening press conference in the lounge of an old bungalow overlooking the club’ s picturesque Gawthorpe Hall training ground. It used to be the home of Burnley’s former groundsman and 1960s striker Arthur Bellamy which might explain the anaglypta wallpaper. 'I grew up with this,’ says Dyche admiringly. 'I remember stripping it off my bedroom wall. No health and safety or nothing.’ The 43-year-old probably wouldn’t think twice about doing the same now. After all, he celebrated Burnley’s promotion from the Championship in April by putting together a bed for his son Max. On a high: Sean Dyche guided Burnley to the Premier League last season . Ready for battle: Dyche and Burnley will face Chelsea in their first game back in the Premier League . As this old Lancashire town prepares to welcome Premier League football for the second time when Chelsea visit Turf Moor on Monday, Dyche remains typically unaffected by the hype. ‘I put together a bed for my son and it brings normality to me,’ he said. ‘I cut the lawn for a reason – the kids have to learn that’s what dads do. ‘It keeps me a bloke because I am just a bloke. I don’t get too worried about “oh look at you, Premier League!” It’s not really my bag that. ‘The Premier League manager tag doesn’t make me feel any different. I still go home and take the kids into the garden for a game of football, and I let my daughter do my head in asking for a new dress, every day. She’s nine going on 16. My life is the same outside of this. I’m no different.’ Comparisons: Dyche has the nickname 'The ginger Mourinho' and will face the real deal on Monday . Keeping things largely the same is the key to Dyche keeping Burnley in the top-flight. There have been six new signings so far and changes are inevitable (the home dressing-room has been upgraded, for instance, though not the away one). But he has to draw on the togetherness and team sprit that took Burnley up against the odds if they are to defy the bookmakers again by not going straight back down, as happened in 2010. The fixture list has not been particularly kind. The season starts with Chelsea and a match-up between Mourinho and the man they call the Ginger Mourinho. Burnley’s second game at Turf Moor is against Manchester United, the team they beat in their home opener five years ago. Chance to shine: Lukas Jutkiewicz celebrates scoring for Burnley in pre-season . ‘There will be a vast gap in resources available, that’s the reality of it,’ said Dyche. ‘There are probably still eight Championship clubs I could name off the bat who have got a better player wage level than we have now. ‘But look at what you’ve got not what you haven’t. We have to find a way of operating to get where we want. Behind my extremely bouncer-like look, there are a couple of brain cells in there. ‘Never say never. Was it Cardiff who got three points off Man City early last season? I don’t think many would have been expecting that. ‘There are no guarantees in any division in any season, let alone the Premier League, so we have to earn the right and fight hard to get what we can off anyone.’","Sean Dyche and Burnley kick off new season against Chelsea .

Stambouli played as a defensive midfielder, centre-back and full-back for Montpellier last season and, with so many players leaving Wales, his versatility will be an undeniable asset.

Following their Community Shield win over Manchester City last Saturday, the Gunners kick off their Barclays Premier League campaign against managerless Crystal Palace on Saturday. The Gunners have spent £60million on fresh talent this summer, with Alexis Sanchez, Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers all arriving. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger hint at another big signing for Arsenal! Up and running: Arsenal face a challenging start to the season . But Arsenal are faced with an testing start to the season, given they face a crucial two-legged Champions League qualifier against Besiktas - the first of which is on Tuesday. And Wenger insists his side are not at their optimum going into the new campaign. He said: ‘Honestly we are a bit short in our preparation because after the World Cup, we had 11 players at the World Cup and many of them had longer holidays after that. Concern: Arsene Wenger has warned players could get injured due to lack of preparation . ‘I think this year, the final of the World Cup was on July 13, the start of the league is August 16, if you want to give some holiday to the players your preparation becomes very short. ‘I think we could have done with one week later for all the competitions, the Champions League and the Premier League. ‘If you don’t give players enough holiday or enough build-up in their preparation and play them straight away then they get injured.’ Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski will not be considered for Saturday's clash as they only reported back for pre-season training on Monday following Germany’s World Cup success. Mertesacker has retired from international football, aged 29. Dilemma: Captain Mikel Arteta has only been offered a one-year contract extension . Wenger will make a late call on whether to include Laurent Koscielny, who is struggling with an Achilles problem, against Palace given the first clash against Besiktas is just four days away. Wenger also admitted that his new captain Mikel Arteta must accept the club’s policy of offering 12 month contracts to over 30s. Arteta is out of contract at the end of the season and Wenger said: ‘You know the policy. Nobody accepts it but ideally you want to sign at 75 for one more year. ‘He is a strong personality, Mikel Arteta. I don’t really doubt that he will extend his contract but at the moment it is not done.’","Arsenal kick off their Barclays Premier League campaign  on Saturday .

The photographer, 36, form Surrey, dedicates her fantastical picture series to her late mother Maureen, an English teacher who spent her life inspiring generations of children . with imaginative stories and plays. Following Maureen's death from a . brain tumour in 2008, Kirsty channelled her grief into her passion for . photography. A phenomenal portrait of an the Greek goddess Gaia marks the beginning of the final chapter in Kirsty Mitchell's Wonderland . The photographic series . began as a small summer project but grew into an inspirational creative . journey. 'This . escapism grew into the concept of creating an unexplained storybook . without words, dedicated to her [my mother], that would echo the . fragments of the fairytales she read to me constantly as a child,' says . the artist, who was named the first female Nikon UK Ambassador for Fine Art Photography in July. The latest addition is a powerful and emotional vision of the Greek personification version of Mother Earth, Gaia, creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans and the Giants. It is called Gaia, The Birth Of An End, and is two metres high. She wears a grand golden headdress which was handmade by Kirsty, who has a background in fashion and costume design. The piece took her over two and-a-half months to finish. 'I was heavily influenced by Inca . gods, and my trip to Tibet in 2012, during which I had specifically . collected traditional bells and tribal necklaces. 'I . began by building up an entire new lower level to the piece, that would . help surround the face and balance the enormous proportions of the top . section. 'The headdress was . entirely hand painted, dyed and beaded by myself and weighs so much, . that it had to be wired to a wooden beam in my studio to take the weight . off the model's head,' she says. The base is made from solid plaster with metal mesh embedded into it for extra strength. Kirsty prepares to take a photo of model Marianna, who is made up as the goddess Gaia and wearing a heavy handmade headdress . Finishing touches are applied by photographer Kirsty and makeup artist Elbie .

The photographer worked alongside make-up artist is Elbie Van Eeden to transform model Marianna Toka into the goddess. 'Wonderland is in its final phase,' she tells MailOnline. 'It has been running for four and a half years and is entirely self funded. The project's purpose is to create a extraordinary storybook without words. 'The characters are all my own creation; the costumes props and sets. I construct them like mini film sets in the woodlands around my home. Everything is real and real scale, and can take months to make. Kirsty Mitchell, pictured left, wearing blue, throws yellow powder at the background .

'The characters are not based on anything that already exists - they are the result of my faded memories of the stories my mother read to me as a child, the original book illustrations, poems, paintings mixed up with dreams. I wanted to create pictures that people will project their own ideas on to, and lose themselves in. 'The project currently has 69 pictures in the collection, with another 10 coming. All the new pictures, the last 10, have been made and shot over the last 9 months, and we are now retuning with them, as well as the films.

Kirsty wanted to create a body adornment for Gaia, which came in the form of these over sized necklace pieces. Every part has been handmade, beaded and painted by her aside from the central traditional necklace . 'I named this first portrait Gaia, The Birth of An End, as it about the last seen character Gaia's transition from a mortal to her true goddess form. 'I named her after the Greek equivalent of our Mother Earth, and this picture represents her incarnation, (birth) surrounded by an explosion of vibrating, shimmering energy. Her character affects everything. As she changes so to will the landscape, creating a butterfly effect that sets in motion the end of the story. 'It was heavily influenced by how I see the human spirit; after losing my mother people often ask me what I imagine comes afterwards, and my only answer is my belief in an endless energy, the circle I feel we are all a part of. My mother is with me always, she is the earth, the rain, the wind in my hair was I walk to work. The body may cease, but I feel the vibrations of people continue, like ripples from a stone cast in a lake, and it was this power of spirit that I have tried to express within the picture.'

It has become a crucial rite of passage for teenagers everywhere. But for 16-year-old Terri Calvesbert her school prom was even more significant than most.

And, of course, there was only one way for the excited teen to arrive in style - in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. Like most other teenagers, she was slightly nervous before the prom, but once on her way, Terri had a great time. She said: 'It was really nice to be with my friends and with the teachers. It was a wonderful evening. Having a ball: Terri Calvesbert and students from the former Westbourne Sports College enjoyed their evening held at All Manor of Events in Henley . 'There were more than 100 people there and it was just great to have such a good night out.'

But he is evidently more than happy to do the same at home, judging by his appearance in the gardens of Clarence House last night. Both he and the Duchess of Cornwall sported animal masks at a ball they threw in support of conservation charity the Elephant Family, with guests including models Cara Delevingne and Jerry Hall. Must one wear this? Prince Charles and Camilla at the ball in support of conservation charity the Elephant Family . Camilla kept strictly to the theme in a sparkling elephant mask, while Charles opted for a golden design featuring a prancing tiger. At first the prince struggled to see under his mask, laughing: ‘I am slightly anxious about this thing, I can’t see a thing.’ Camilla, who had been spotted peeking from an upstairs window at the royal residence earlier, told the Daily Mail: ‘When you look from above it looks rather like a mad Ascot!’ She may have wished she had her mask on when she bumped into Miss Delevingne, 20.

Kate let slip earlier this year that her baby was due in mid-July. But in recent weeks there has been speculation that the public had been misled and the baby was due earlier, although this was strongly denied.","The Prince and Duchess hosted the ball in the gardens of Clarence House .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Florida Army veteran accused of stabbing to death a stranger sent a text message an hour after the deadly altercation admitting to the alleged crime, it was revealed in court Thursday. John Orr, 39, is facing a second-degree murder charge in the October 2011 killing of 63-year-old Jon Wayne Joseph in Naples. Orr told police after his arrest that he was acting in self-defense because Joseph rammed him with a bicycle, pinned him to the ground and bashed his head after the two exchanged some words. Fight to the death: John Orr, 39 (left), is on trial for allegedly stabbing Jon Joseph, 63 (right) 75 times during a fight sparked by a verbal spat with the victim's girlfriend . Investigators say Orr pulled a pocketknife on Joseph and plunged it into his body 75 times. At the time of his arrest, Orr was covered in blood, Naples Daily News reported. In court Thursday, detective Robert Young, who led the investigation into the killing, read a text message sent by Orr to a friend saying: 'I think I just killed a guy, stabbed him.' Another text read: 'This isn't good.' The jury panel also heard from Joseph's live-in girlfriend, Roseann Hannigan, who testified that it all started when on October 3, 2011, Orr approached her in the driveway as she was drinking beer with Joseph and asked after his friend Bert Newcombe. Hannigan replied that no one by that name lived there, and Orr took his leave after apologizing for making a mistake. But Hannigan said that as Orr was walking away, she overheard him utter the words, 'bitch,' 'whore' and 'liar.' The name-calling prompted Joseph to mount his bike and go after Orr, but Hannigan insisted in court that the 63-year-old did not appear angry - just frustrated. Grisly scene: Joseph was found lying on the ground in the Lake Park section of Naples, Florida, October 2011 after suffering 75 knife wounds . The woman told the court that her boyfriend’s last words to her were, 'Hon, I'll be right back. I'm going to see what's going on.' She never saw him alive again. In his testimony Thursday, Orr's friend Colby Meeks said he was on the phone with the retired soldier when Joseph confronted him, telling the man never to come back. Meeks added that Joseph sounded 'confrontational,' and he then heard the sounds of a brawl. ‘I could hear just, fighting basically, and at that point, John said, you know, “Don’t ever try that trick on me again” and I heard a gasping voice say, “OK, I won’t, I won’t,”’ Meeks told the jurors. Defense strategy: Orr told police he was in fear for his life because Joseph pinned him down and bashed his head into the ground . The witness recalled that at that point he hung up because he said it sounded like Orr had the upper hand in the fight. At a pre-trial hearing in 2012, Orr claimed that his opponent, nearly 30 years his senior, got on top of him, bashed his head into the ground and threatened to kill him. Orr's attorney, Mike McDonnell, attempted to use Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' doctrine to secure immunity for his client saying that Joseph was in control of the situation and Orr was in fear for his life. The presiding judge, however, rejected the motion based on physical evidence, namely blood splatter, being inconsistent with Orr's version of events. Prosecutor Andreas Gardiner pointed out to the jury Thursday that the victim was an elderly man who was unarmed. He suffered 75 knife wounds, while Orr had no injuries to support his head-bashing story. Orr’s attorney said the 39-year-old defendant will take the stand later in the trial. If convicted of second-degree murder, Orr could face a life in prison. The trial is expected to conclude next Wednesday or Thursday, after which the case will go to the jury for deliberations.","John Orr, 39, claimed self defense saying he was in fear for his life after Jon Joseph, 63, pinned him down and bashed his head on the ground .

"By . Vanessa Allen . 'Regret': Andy Coulson told the hacking trial he 'regrets' his treatment of David Blunkett in 2004 . Andy Coulson was accused of ‘pure hypocrisy’ yesterday over his decision to expose a senior politician’s affair while he was himself involved in an illicit relationship with Rebekah Brooks. The former News of the World editor admitted there was an ‘irony’ in his confrontation with David Blunkett over the then Home Secretary’s relationship with married magazine publisher Kimberley Fortier. Coulson, 46, has admitted he learned of the affair when he was played voicemail messages in which the Labour politician ‘effectively declared his love’ for the Spectator publisher, and conceded he had misled Mr Blunkett when he claimed the affair had been revealed by ‘sources’. He told the hacking trial of his ‘regret’ over his treatment of the politician and accepted the irony of his actions, in the light of his on-off affair with Brooks, his predecessor as editor at the News of the World. Coulson, who later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications director, was asked if he felt ‘shame’ about his treatment of Mr Blunkett, described in court as a ‘decent man’. He replied: ‘This story was about someone’s love life, about them having an affair. Given what was going on in my own private life, the irony of it is not lost on me.’ David Spens QC, the lawyer for former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, responded: ‘It’s pure hypocrisy, isn’t it?’ Coulson replied again: ‘The irony is not lost on me.’ The jury has heard Coulson and Brooks were involved in an on-off affair which started in 1998 and which was rekindled while both of them were married to other people. Coulson’s wife, Eloise, has been in court for most of his evidence. Voicemails: Coulson admitted he learned of the affair between Blunkett and publisher Kimberley Fortier after being played voicemail messages . Coulson told the court he regretted his . decision to tell Mr Blunkett the affair was revealed by the newspaper’s . sources, rather than admitting it was uncovered when a journalist hacked . his voicemail messages to his lover. News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck played Coulson excerpts from the messages in August 2004 - the ‘first and only’ time Coulson admits hearing hacked phone messages. The former editor was blasted for his ironic behaviour in light of his affair with Rebekah Brooks . He said he did not ask Thurlbeck how he had got the messages and did not discipline him over the apparent intrusion, but did tell him to stop. Thurlbeck has admitted phone hacking. Coulson said he did not tell police about the Thurlbeck messages in 2006, after royal editor Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were arrested for hacking Palace aides, but has denied he was part of a cover-up. Mr Spens, for Goodman, accused him of trying to save himself. He asked: ‘You chose not to tell police about Neville Thurlbeck hacking because you were concerned to save your own skin.’ Coulson replied: ‘I certainly accept the impact on me was a factor, but there were other factors.’ Mr Spens responded: ‘Self-preservation usually comes first doesn’t it?’ Coulson denied he put Goodman under pressure to plead guilty or that he offered him work in a bid to stop the journalist from implicating him or others at the News of the World. Goodman and Mulcaire both admitted hacking royal aides and were jailed in 2007. Coulson resigned as editor of the News of the World and was subsequently appointed as the Conservative Party’s director of communications. Coulson and Brooks, 45, both deny charges that they were part of a six-year conspiracy to hack phones at the News of the World, or that they made allegedly corrupt payments to public officials. Goodman, 56, is not accused of hacking in the current trial but also denies conspiring to pay public officials. All seven defendants in the case deny all the charges against them.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If anyone in your house is already bubbling with excitement about their high school prom, you might want to hide this article. It could give them some rather expensive ideas. Barbie dolls  Emily Pounde, pictured left, and Hannah Jagger, pictured right, arrive in life-sized packaging on the back of a trailer . Crowds gathered to see the Barbie dolls arrived at the prom before they step out in perfect condition . It’s every girls dream to make a . spectacular entrance on their prom night, but these girls certainly win . the crown by arriving encased in life-sized Barbie doll packaging, . despite being pulled along by a rather unglamorous trailer. Emily Pounde and Hannah Jagger, both 16, finished off their princess look of ballgowns, tiaras and flowing hair by arriving inside the home-made plywood and Perspex boxes, complete with Mattel branding, to mimic their childhood idol. The . boxes were made in just two days by Emily's mum Christine Pounde at a . cost of £250 after the girls discussed ways to stand out from the crowd. On the big night the boxes were . loaded onto a flat-bed trailer and the dressed-up girls climbed inside . for a carnival-style tour of Crewkerne in Somerset, to cheers from . amazed onlookers. Emily said: ‘Hannah and I thought of the idea together and it suddenly became reality when mum liked it too. Best friends Chloe Webb and Lauren Huggett, pictured, certainly arrived in style at their prom party . ‘We wanted to do something different and I really loved Barbies when I was little.' The . pair, who attend Wadham School in Crewkerne, Somerset then stole the . show when they arrived at Haselbury Mill, the country house venue of . their prom where their Year 11 pals were waiting. But the girls weren't the only eye-catching attendee at the school's 2012 prom. Their fellow pupils competed to arrive in the most unusual and outrageous way possible. Family, friends and local residents . looked on in amazement as a cavalcade of bizarre vehicles made their way . to the glamorous event, including a Union Jack Mini and a Massey Ferguson . tractor. Two girls even rolled up the driveway in a fully-functioning ice-cream van. While the boys rose to the challenge, one group opting for a vintage Rolls Royce and a sporty Ariel Atom. Their Barbie outfits may have won . prizes for creativity, but Emily Pounde and Hannah Jagger failed to pass . muster when it came to their chosen mode of transport. Chloe Webb, left, and Lauren Huggett, right, take off with pilot Andy Moorhouse for the special journey to their prom . The girls, who were also joined by Lauren's dad, Jason Huggett, enjoyed a 30 minute ride before being dropped off at the Whitminster Inn, Gloucestershire for their prom . Family friend Adam Dance towed them on a trailer hitched on to the back of his white Vauxhall Corsa. But the girls were not focusing on the transport, but on their elobrate boxes. Emily . added: 'We took a big long drive to show off the boxes, people on the . streets were wondering what was happening because they could only see . the car at first, but when they saw us their jaws dropped. 'It was the same with people at school, they were only focusing on the boxes, not the trailer.' Earlier this week best friends Chloe Webb and .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . David Cameron broke off his holiday for a crisis meeting with security chiefs yesterday following the beheading of a US journalist by a British jihadi. He travelled back from Cornwall to co-ordinate the hunt for the Islamic State fanatic who murdered James Foley. In a statement last night he said it appeared ‘increasingly likely’ that the ‘deeply shocking’ killing had been carried out by a British citizen. Mr Cameron watched the appalling video of the murder himself ‘to inform his understanding of the type of threat we face’. The Prime Minister was then briefed by security and intelligence chiefs on the hunt to identify the fanatic in the video, who appeared to speak with a London accent. David Cameron arrives at Downing Street yesterday after cutting short his holiday in Cornwall . Sources said every effort was being made to identify the killer – but stressed that finding and apprehending him in a war zone was a major task. Number Ten would not say when the Prime Minister would resume his holiday, which is his second break of the summer. They had announced that he was returning from his Cornish trip just 90 minutes after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was not coming back. At 8.30am, Mr Hammond said Mr Cameron was ‘entitled to a break’, and, in any case, remained fully briefed on developments. ‘The Prime Minister is only a couple of hundred miles down the road,’ he told the programme. ‘He is in constant contact with ministers and officials throughout the day. ‘It is no different to him being in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland on a visit.’ Mr Cameron stayed in Downing Street last night, but could return to Cornwall as early as this evening. Sources said a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’, despite growing clamour from MPs on all sides. The Prime Minister yesterday said he did not want a ‘knee-jerk’ response to the crisis but said ministers would ‘always look at new proposals for even tougher laws to deal with terrorism and extremism’. Downing Street said he was focused on countering the threat posed by Islamic State fanatics in the Middle East – and by the risks posed by returning fighters. At least 500 British jihadis are thought to be fighting in Syria and Iraq. A further 250 are thought to have already returned to the UK where the police and security services are attempting to monitor them. A recall of Parliament, however, is still not being considered . The Government yesterday said that 23 people have had their passports confiscated this year to prevent them travelling to the war zone. Seven people with dual nationality have been stripped of their British citizenship while abroad. There have also been 69 arrests in this country relating to activities in Syria and Iraq. Mr Cameron yesterday issued ‘refreshed guidance’ to police to clamp down on those fomenting support for Islamic State in this country. Number Ten said police had been reminded they had the powers to arrest anyone distributing leaflets or flying terrorist flags. Earlier, Mr Hammond said British troops could be sent to Baghdad within weeks to help train forces to fight against the extremists who have cut a swathe across northern Iraq. He also suggested British jets could play a greater reconnaissance role in Iraq and that the UK could help arm the Kurds, as Germany yesterday agreed to do. He said Islamic State was ‘waging war against the West, and we have to deal with them on that basis’. Mr Hammond acknowledged that Britain now had in Islamic State a ‘common enemy’ with the Syrian regime, but played down the prospects of forming an alliance with tyrant Bashar al-Assad. Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said Parliament should have been recalled ‘weeks ago’, given the seriousness of events. Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart said: ‘If we are talking about putting military forces on the ground in Iraq, even for training purposes, then I don’t think there is any choice but to recall Parliament.’ Former Labour minister Gisela Stuart, a member of the Commons defence committee, suggested that the reluctance to recall Parliament suggested Mr Cameron does not yet have a coherent strategy. Miss Stuart said: ‘All we have heard is increasingly big words and rhetoric with nothing underpinning them.’ Tory MP Conor Burns also stepped up his demand for a recall, saying: ‘It is incredible that we have got to the point where the Pope is virtually calling for air strikes but we are still opposed to carrying them out.’ Mr Cameron yesterday insisted Britain ‘is not going to get involved in another Iraq war’, adding: ‘We’re not putting combat troops, combat boots, on the ground.’ He added: ‘We will stick to the very clear foreign policy and the very clear strategy that we have which is to work with the new Iraqi government, to help make sure the Kurds get the arms they need to fight off these brutal extremists, to work with our allies.’","Cameron has returned from holiday in Cornwall to deal with beheading crisis .

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . Charged: Oklahoma English teacher Jennifer Sexton is charged with following her 15-year-old English student 650 miles to Mississippi, where she allegedly had sex with him in a hotel room . An Oklahoma middle school English teacher allegedly followed a 15-year-old student on his summer vacation 650 miles away to a Mississippi hotel room, where police say she had sex the the boy in June. Jennifer Sexton had quit her job at Hollis Middle School just two months before amid suspicions in the community that something inappropriate was going on between her and the student. 'People seeing a teacher alone with a child may or may not be anything. It could just be innocent contact,' Harmon County Assistant District Attorney Eric Yarborough told the Oklahoman. Until the June arrest, those hunches were all authorities had to go on and the boy was uncooperative. 'The child said nothing’s going on, she’s just a nice teacher,' said Yarborough. Now the unnamed victim has revealed several sexual encounters with Sexton. In fact, in Oklahoma in the months before they were caught together in a Best Western, he said they had sex several times. He told police they had sex in Sexton's classroom for the first time just days before she resigned. They also allegedly had sex in her SUV and in her home. The boy even said they had sex in the home of Sexton's pastor father. Scene of the crime? Sexton and her middle school student were allegedly caught together in this Mississippi Best Western, where police say the 28-year-old had sex with the boy in June . A month before Sexton drove her SUV to Olive Branch, Mississippi and allegedly picked up the victim from a church, she won a divorce from her husband and took back her maiden name, Caswell. Whether she's going by Sexton or Caswell, she's now an accused sex offender. She turned herself in this past Friday and faces three counts of second-degree rape, two counts of enticing a child, a one forcible sodomy count.

"By . Julie-anne Barnes . Distraught: Gary Wells, 36, was left 'unable to cope' when long-term girlfriend Diane left him last month . A jilted lover killed himself by standing in front of a train driven by his ex-girlfriend, it emerged last night. Gary Wells, 36, was said to be distraught after splitting from Diane MacDonald three weeks ago. Miss MacDonald, 29, was powerless to prevent a collision after he stepped on to the track in front of the train she was driving on one of Britain’s most scenic rail routes. Mr Wells died instantly as he was hit by the train. Miss MacDonald, the first woman train driver on the West Highland Line in Scotland, was left so distressed that she required sedation after the tragedy, which happened at Inverlochy, near Fort William, on Tuesday morning. Mr Wells had been in a long-term relationship with Miss MacDonald but friends said their relationship ended around three weeks ago. Sources said the break-up had left Mr Wells struggling to cope. Last night, a school friend told how Mr Wells was a devoted father whose weekends were spent with his son Lewis, who was from a previous relationship. The friend, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Gary was a nice guy. ‘He and Diane were like peas in a pod. They were together for eight or nine years and split up a few weeks ago. I can’t believe he did this. I heard Diane had to be sedated. ‘It’s so sad. He loved spending time with his son Lewis. His weekends were devoted to him.’ Mr Wells is thought to have been working at a local engineering company and had previously worked some evenings and weekends as a pub bouncer. His family was too distressed yesterday to talk about what happened. In a statement, Miss MacDonald said last night: ‘The circumstances are extremely upsetting for everyone involved. We would ask the media to please respect our privacy while we come to terms with what has happened.’ British Transport Police confirmed they are investigating the incident. A spokesman said: ‘We were called to a rail crossing in Inverlochy, Fort William, shortly before 8am on Tuesday, August 19, to a report that a man had been struck by a train. Colleagues from Police Scotland and Scottish Ambulance Service also attended, but a 36-year-old man from the Fort William area was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘His death is currently not being treated as suspicious. ‘The man’s family have been informed. A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.’ Shock: Diane MacDonald, the first woman driver for West Highland Line, was sedated at the scene . No one was available for comment last night at MacPherson Welding and Engineering in Fort William, where Mr Wells is understood to have worked. Miss MacDonald became the first female train driver on the West Highland Line – and the youngest qualified driver working for First ScotRail – in 2009. She started her railway career when she was 19, working part-time at Fort William station, then became a conductor on the West Highland Line, working out of Mallaig, before applying to become a driver. At the time, she said: ‘I’m excited and proud to have qualified as a train driver. The training was intense but worth it. ‘The West Highland Line is one of the best routes to work because of the amazing scenery.’","Gary Wells, 36, 'distraught' when Diane MacDonald, 29, left him in July .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . Eight men who held down an armed robber so hard he died were acting within the law, a coroner has ruled. Clint Townsend died of a heart attack after the have-a-go heroes piled on top of him during a raid at Oxford's Covered Market in March last year. The 33-year-old, who was wearing motorcycle gear and a helmet, had smashed the window of a jewellery shop repeatedly with a sledgehammer, before wrestling with the store's manager and owner. Raid: Clint Townsend, 33, died after eight men piled on top of him during a raid on a jewellery shop last year . 'Within the law': A coroner has ruled the men were 'brave' and acting lawfully when they piled on top of Townsend for three to four minutes in the diamond merchant shop in Oxford's historic Covered Market . But witnesses rushed to restrain him, and held him to the ground 'in a big heap' for three to four minutes when police officers arrived. Townsend was heard to say 'I can't breathe', before falling unconscious. Despite numerous resuscitation attempts, he was left in a coma and died the next day. Alison Thompson, assistant coroner for Oxfordshire, reached a verdict of misadventure today and said: 'I am not satisfied to the required standard of proof that any of those men acted unreasonably and unlawfully... There has been a deliberate act but the consequences and the fatal outcome was not intended by those people.' She praised the men's bravery in detaining Townsend in a 'terrifying situation,' and called the robbery 'a reckless attack.' A pathologist, who performed a post-mortem examination on Townsend's body, discovered he had severe heart disease and one coronary artery was clogged to just one millimetre of blood flow. Mrs Thompson said: 'I don't think there was any idea from anybody involved of what was going to happen because of his heart condition. He succumbed and gave up the struggle much more quickly than anybody realised because his heart was failing.' Six-foot-tall Townsend and an accomplice were dressed in motorcycle leathers and had the visors of their helmets pulled down as they walked towards John Gowing Jewellers pushing a stolen Kawasaki motorbike at 9.15am on March 30 last year. CPR: Police attempted to resuscitate Townsend, who had pushed a stolen motorbike through the market . The accomplice stayed with the bike as Townsend rained blows on the store's display window with a sledgehammer. A number of smoke grenades were also thrown into the shop, the coroner heard. The shop's manager Andrew Hill and owner John Gowing grappled with the raider - who hit Mr Hill with the sledgehammer and head butted him with his motorbike helmet - before onlookers intervened. The accomplice ran off, leaving the motorbike lying on the floor, and witness accounts varied between there being three and eight people restraining Townsend on the street outside the upmarket store. Police were on the scene within minutes and realised Townsend had stopped breathing. Officers started CPR and called for an ambulance, which took him to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford at 9.44am. Townsend, of Headington, Oxford, was found to have been left brain dead by oxygen starvation to the brain and was pronounced dead at 1.15pm the next day. Mrs Thompson made it clear in her findings that the misadventure verdict referred specifically to those who had restrained Townsend. Incident: Townsend and an accomplice wore motorcycle leathers and their helmet visors pulled down as they walked towards John Gowing Jewellers. The accomplice stayed with the bike as Townsend hit the windows . 'It was an intended and risky activity which had unintended consequences,' she said. Townsend's parents, sisters and girlfriend Hailey were present at the inquest, but made no comment after the coroner's findings. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Ali Driver, who led the investigation, said: 'I think the coroner rightly mentioned the bravery of those people who got involved. 'It was a very frightening event for those people not used to dealing with physical violence. I think everybody has acted incredibly bravely. Family: Relatives arrived at Oxford Coroner's Court to hear the verdict of the inquest this morning . His family declined to comment on the outcome of the inquest after the coroner gave a verdict of misadventure . 'This was a tragedy for all involved and our thoughts and feelings go out to the family of Clint Townsend as they continue to come to terms with his loss. 'Our thoughts are also with those involved in the restraint of Mr Townsend - none of whom wished the outcome to be as it was, and all of whom believed that they were doing the right thing.' Three men were arrested after the incident. One, aged 44 years, was released without charge, while two others, both aged 32 years, remain on police bail. The police are understood to have no plans to charge anyone in relation to Townsend's death.","Clint Townsend, 33, smashed window of store in Oxford's Covered Market .

"By . Jenny Awford . A couple fear they could have been killed when a 1.5 stone slab of frozen human waste fell from a passing plane and plunged into their garden. Farmer Peter Grey, 72, from Midgham, Berkshire and his wife Barbara says the giant ice block made a nine inch hole in their lawn and landed just 25 yards away from their house, cars and barn. The couple have lived at the property for 35 years and are positive the unexpected missile came off an aeroplane. Scroll down for video . Barbara Grey from Midgham, Berkshire, holding a lump of ice believed to have fallen from an aeroplane . 'There is no other feasible explanation. We are west of Heathrow and aircraft do fly over us, from time to time, but not frequently,' said Mr Grey. 'My wife Barbara and I count ourselves so lucky it did not land on our roof or barn. No doubt, this could have killed one of us if we were out in the garden in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'We didn't know what it was at first but it was a big shock. You wonder how many times this must happen.' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority admitted that the ice was probably the result of a 'leak' from a plane - and possibly from the lavatories. This is the nine inch hole left in Mr Grey's lawn when a 1.5 stone slab of ice fell from an aeroplane . 'The ice can also be the result of a leak on the plane either from the toilet facilities, the air conditioning or running water,' said the spokesman. 'These incidents are very rare but they do happen occasionally. 'In comparison to the 2.5 million flights a year in UK airspace, approximately 25 ice falls per year are reported to the CAA. 'Some of these instances may occur because ice which has naturally formed on an aircraft at higher altitudes breaks off as it descends into warmer air.' Over the past 40 years there have been five recorded cases of people being hit by 'waste' ice from plane toilets. In May 2013 Caroline Guy, 52, had the roof of her caravan wrecked when a block of ice fell through the ceiling in Pattingham, Staffs. And in 2009, David Gammon, 76, suffered bruising when a lump of ice the size of a grapefruit landed in his lap as he sat in his garden in Bristol.

"By . Jack Doyle And Ryan Kisiel For The Daily Mail . The Lib Dems were accused of losing their ‘moral compass’ last night after Lord Rennard was allowed back into the party despite claims he groped a string of women activists. Alleged victims reacted with fury, saying the party’s reputation had been ‘torn to shreds’ and women would desert it in droves. It also emerged last night that Lord Rennard will keep his position on an influential party policy committee – and will be free to stand for high office within the party and campaign at next year’s General Election. Lord Rennard, pictured, is free to rejoin the Liberal Democrats group in the House of Lords after the decision . Susan Gaszczak today hit out at the decision to clear Lord Rennard of bringing the party into disrepute . Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Lib Dems could still consult Lord Rennard and ‘use his expertise’ in the forthcoming campaign. Mr Cable said: ‘I’m sure people will want to use his expertise. But my understanding is that won’t be in a major full-time role.’ There was outrage at the party’s handling of the announcement, with alleged victims told only moments before the news broke on Twitter, late on Tuesday night. In a statement, the peer said he was ‘pleased’ with the outcome, stressing that none of the claims against him had been proved. He even warned media outlets against repeating the accounts of the women who claim he groped them, which he said were ‘defamatory’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the party had ‘taken a long hard look in the mirror’ over the allegations and insisted changes had been made. Party officials said Lord Rennard would have no role in the manifesto process nor in the party election campaign. But there will be nothing to stop him campaigning as a Lib Dem supporter and he remains an elected member of the policy committee. Lord Rennard was feted by senior party figures because of his skill in masterminding many of the party’s past triumphs at the polling booths, and can now retake his place among the Lib Dem group in the Lords. He was suspended last year during a disciplinary process after four activists – Bridget Harris, Alison Goldsworthy, Alison Smith and Susan Gaszczak – publicly accused him of touching them inappropriately. In May last year he issued an apology for encroaching on their ‘personal space’ – prompting several of his alleged victims to call for him to be permanently expelled. After police dropped their probe into the allegations, a QC, Alistair Webster, was asked to produce an independent report. He concluded that although the evidence against the peer was ‘broadly credible’, the allegations could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Then last night the peer was formally reinstated by a party committee which concluded he had not brought the party into disrepute by refusing to apologise for what happened. Miss Harris, a former aide to Mr Clegg, said she was ‘very disappointed’ by the decision. Miss Gaszczak, 42, quit the Lib Dems in fury over the handling of her case. ‘People, especially women, are telling me they will never vote Lib Dem again,’ she said. ‘You are risking a lot when you are a woman when you come forward with a story like this and nothing has happened. ‘We’ve been told we’re “credible” in our claims but then ignored. It’s not like when the party went against its policy on student fees – we’re talking about half the population with women voters. All they have done is pay lip service to those who came forward with claims. Mrs Gaszczak, a former ward councillor in Bedfordshire, added: ‘There has been no change in the party, just an awful lot of words and no action. I think he has got away with it – he’s been extremely lucky. I just hope he reflects on it and doesn’t do it to anyone else. The mother of three said: ‘The party has shown no leadership on this matter. They just don’t have a moral compass when it comes to things like this. ‘I found out about five minutes before it broke on Twitter.’ Another former Lib Dem female worker, who made complaints about Lord Rennard but does not wish to be named, said young women would be reluctant to vote for Mr Clegg. She said: ‘The parochialism of the party has engineered a no-verdict rule on Rennard, allowing him to get off scot-free. ‘A dubious character had gotten off on a technicality, but his reputation and that of the party has been torn to shreds. ‘Young women will be looking at this and think: “I can’t vote for Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems if this is how they treat women”.’ Mr Clegg acknowledged that many women felt ‘let down’ but insisted the party had changed to ensure complaints would be handled better in the future. He said: ‘The Liberal Democrats have taken a long, hard look in the mirror since these allegations were made last year and I am confident that the party has changed. ‘It is clear that a number of women in our party felt let down that the party failed to act on their complaints appropriately. I am determined that no member of our party should find themselves in that position again.’ Lord Rennard said: ‘I am pleased that all disciplinary investigations against me have been brought to an end and that the suspension of my party membership has been lifted.’ Friends of Lord Rennard, pictured, said he had been subjected to a 'witch hunt' over the past several months .","Lord Rennard was accused of groping several female party members .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Pleaded guilty: Lee Jezard boarded an empty plane and breached security at Birmingham Airport by climbing through a baggage carousel . A drunken 22-year-old hotel manager who managed to sneak aboard a plane despite not being booked on a flight told staff he was the airliner's co-pilot, a court heard today. Lee Jezard, of Redditch, Worcestershire, has pleaded guilty to boarding an empty Lufthansa plane and breaching security at Birmingham Airport by climbing through a baggage carousel. Jezard - who lost his job as a hotel manager when his employer found out about the incident on July 17 - also admitted stealing £36.45 worth of food from the airport’s Caffe Nero. At Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, he was fined £95 for each of the three offences and ordered to fully compensate to the coffee shop, together with £185 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. David Devine, prosecuting, said that despite reports Jezard was at the airport after missing a flight to Ibiza, a study of all plane manifests revealed ‘he was never booked onto any flight’. He described the actions of Jezard as a ‘drunken escapade’. In mitigation, Jezard’s solicitor said his client ‘really had very little idea how he arrived at the airport’ after going on a drinking binge with friends in Birmingham city centre. Tariq Khan added that in a further ‘bizarre’ act, Jezard was seen on CCTV behind a coffee shop counter at the deserted airport ‘charging his mobile and checking it - in line with his state’. Jezard was discovered aboard a Lufthansa Embraer 195 by cleaning staff, and initially told them ‘I’m the co-pilot’, said Mr Devine. ‘When they asked him for ID, he had none, and then told them “I work for the Navy”. He then said: “I’m breaking into places to see if people can catch me - I go to prisons and other places”.’ Airport police arrived and the man was arrested, and interviewed. He told officers: ‘I was trying to show how easy it was to get on that plane - and I did it. I told the cleaners I was the co-pilot.’ He struggled to recall everything that had happened, telling police he ‘wanted a walk around and thought it would be a good idea’. Security cameras showed Jezard crawling through the opening of a baggage carousel, getting on to the airport’s tarmac apron, and then getting aboard the plane. Found: Jezard was discovered aboard a Lufthansa plane at Birmingham Airport (pictured) by cleaning staff . Mr Khan said his client ‘really had very little idea how it was he arrived at the airport, but the guess is it was by train’. Police had already spoken to a ‘wandering’ and ‘clearly intoxicated’ Jezard, after spotting him in other parts of the airport in the hours before the security breach, said Mr Khan. It was the same police officer who later ‘frog-marched him off the aeroplane’ following his discovery on board. Mr Khan said although it was a relatively low-level security breach, the incident had implications beyond Jezard's drunken activities. Lufthansa planes: The court heard that although it was a relatively low-level security breach, the incident had implications beyond Jezard's drunken activities (file picture) ‘I am sure airport staff and management will have been having a close look at events, and security will have been tightened up, because of the implications this could have been a more serious breach than it was in this case,’ he said. 'I work for the Navy. I’m breaking into places to see if people can catch me - I go to prisons and other places' What Lee Jezard told cleaning staff . His solicitor said Jezard's crimes had left him ‘ostracised’ by his own family, who were ‘not impressed’ by his night-time escapades. ‘He had a very good job as a manager in a hotel and has lost that job and is now without employment.’ Following the hearing, an airport spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our passengers is our number one priority. ‘The individual penetrated the terminal boundary and was subsequently arrested by the police. A full investigation has taken place.’","Lee Jezard, 22, boarded plane after climbing through baggage carousel .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . UKIP's Janice Atkinson caused outrage after referring to a Thai constituent as 'Ting Tong' A Ukip MEP has apologised ‘profusely’ after calling a Thai constituent a ‘Ting Tong’. Janice Atkinson, who represents the south east, was recorded making the comments after meeting Fa Munday, a mobile food seller in Ramsgate, Kent and her husband Vincent. Mr Munday, a Ukip supporter, said the couple had been left shocked by the ‘outrageous’ comments. ‘It's a bit outrageous, her comments have come as a bit of a shock,’ he told BBC South East Today. ‘I'm quite offended.’ Ms Atkinson's comments were captured by the BBC team while she spoke to local people and Ukip members in Ramsgate. She said: ‘..so that was good. We've got Fa who's, I dunno, she's a ting tong from somewhere.’ Ms Atkinson's remarks may have been influence by the BBC show 'Little Britain', which featured characters called Ting Tong, played by Matt Lucas, and Dudley, played by David Walliams . But the UKIP MEP insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was ‘incredibly sorry’ for offending the couple. She said: ‘I deeply regret the words I used and am incredibly sorry. 'It was poor judgment and naivety on my part rather than words spoken with any malice. 'I am devastated that I have caused hurt and apologise profusely to both Mr and Mrs Munday.’ A Ukip spokesman said: ‘Janice has apologised for the words she used. 'Ukip in no way condones the use of language that may reflect prejudice or cause offence and we sincerely hope this matter can be resolved privately.’ The latest gaffe is a blow to the party, which has repeatedly inisted that it is not a racist party. Before the European elections in May UKIP leader Nigel Farage was forced to pull the plug on a 'Carnival of colour' arranged to highlight the party's multi-ethnic supporter base. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has attempted to rebut accusations that his party has a problem with ethnic minorities . UKIP was criticised over its immigration-centred poster campaign ahead of the European elections in May . Mr Farage was forced to abandoned the event in Croydon, South London, after campaigners clashed with party members. The event was a follow-up to a rally Mr Farage held featuring candidates and members from ethnic minorities. It came after Mr Farage was condemned by politicians from the three main parties after declaring in a radio interview that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans after saying he was uncomforble with the idea of a group of Romanian men moving in as neighbours. He added: ‘Can we just have an honest appraisal of what has happened to post-communist Romania? Across the whole of the European Union, amongst all 28 member states, 7 per cent of all crime is committed by 240 Romanian gangs.’","Janice Atkinson made comments after meeting Fa Munday in Ramsgate .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . It's the household staple for healthy bones and pearly white teeth. But for one woman, a love of British whole milk has turned into an uncontrollable addiction which sees her drink ten pints of the white stuff every day. Sandra Heap from Southport, Merseyside, depends on the drink so much, she won't allow her family to touch her full-fat supply. Scroll down for video . Sandra Heap drinks up to ten pints of full-fat milk every day and craves it more later in the evening . Mrs Heap says she becomes 'narky' if someone in her household dips into her supply of whole milk . The 46-year-old foster carer will even shun alcohol for a glass of the white stuff on nights out. Mrs Heap, who lives with her husband, son and foster child, didn't drink milk as a child but now can't make it through the day without her fix. 'During the day I have at least two or three, I usually top six pints between 9am and 10pm,' she said. 'But I really crave and want milk after 10pm at night, I don’t know if it is something psychological. 'It doesn’t matter if I’m drinking a glass of wine, but if my husband asks me if I want another glass I’ll say ‘no I want a glass of milk’. 'I could even be drinking champagne or be out in a restaurant and if people ask me I’ll say ""you know what, can I have a glass of milk?"" 'I did drink milk when I was younger and when I was a kid and my brother is a big milk drinker. 'He likes milk but not like me - he doesn’t have to have it every single day, seven days a week.' On a typical day, Mrs Heap will drink milk in her coffee when she wakes up and then a pint or two with lunch. She drinks another pint with dinner, but can get through an entire six-litre bottle while watching television between 9pm and 11.30pm. Sometimes she'll opt for two strawberry milkshakes with double cream instead. Between 11.30pm and 2am, the foster carer can drink a four-litre bottle. She added she sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night and walks to a 24hour shop to stock up on milk if she's run out when the craving strikes her. While working at a primary school, Mrs Heap even urged children to swap their milk for fruit juice so she would have more, she said. In a designated fridge at her family home, she keeps her supply of blue-topped full fat milk. The 46-year-old said her favourite way of drinking milk was if it is ice-cold and in a wine glass . The foster carer buys herself whole milk and stocks up on semi-skimmed for her husband, son and foster child . And while her children have a habit of ducking into her supply, her husband Graham is less fond of it. 'Graham actually has a small phobia of milk, it’s God’s honest truth he actually can’t stand the stuff, he’ll have a bit in coffee but other than that if you offered him a £100 to drink a glass - he wouldn’t.' 'If I want a kiss I have to wipe my mouth of the milk or he won’t kiss me. But I think it’s nothing bad, it’s not like I’m on drugs or alcohol.' 'The problem is I put on weight with it, if I didn’t drink milk I’d be a size 10, but I’m pushing a 12 or size 14 now. 'I would love get hypnotised, but it’s the money, if someone offered to do that I would take it. 'It’s got so bad I don’t even like the taste of water and I think that’s because of all the milk I drink. 'I get narky if I go to the fridge and someone has drunk the blue milk, I ask ""who’s done that?’ I tell them ""you don’t use the blue stuff, you use the green""'. 'I buy the big six-litre bottles, then I have to buy a four-pint of semi-skimmed milk for the family, I don’t drink that but I’ve got it there if I am desperate. 'The milk bill easily is topping £25 a week, and then the cream I buy is on top of that, but I’ve tried to cut down on cream. 'As far as my health is concerned I must have great bones.' For centuries doctors have encouraged milk as a source of calcium which strengthens the bones and teeth. Children were administered the drink at schools across the country and overseas. If so good for our bones and bodies, can there ever be such a thing as drinking too much milk? According to the Dairy Council, whole standardised milk has a fat content of 3.5% compared with 1.7% in semi-skimmed, and 0.1% in skimmed. 'Relatively small quantities of milk can provide a significant proportion of daily nutrient requirements for all age groups making it nutrient rich relative to its energy content,'  the Council's website states. But with an estimated 149 calories in a single glass of full-fat milk, drinking large amounts of the substance can lead to weight gain or digestion problems. NHS Milk and Dairy Guidelines state: . 'Much of the fat in milk and dairy foods is saturated fat. 'For older children and adults, eating too much saturated fat can contribute to becoming overweight. 'It can also cause raised levels of cholesterol in the blood, and this can put you at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke. 'If you're trying to cut down on fat it's a good idea to go for lower-fat milks. 'Semi-skimmed, 1% fat and skimmed milks contain all the important nutritional benefits of milk, but are lower in fat.'","Sandra Heap won't let her family touch her supply of full-fat milk .

As puzzled guests waited for them to return to their reception the trapped trio used the intercom to call for help. Trapped: Emma Hamilton (centre) and husband Christopher (right) got stuck in a lift on their own wedding day along with best man Jake Julian (left) - and promptly started taking selfies . But rather than panicking, the trio passed the time taking a series of selfies as alternative wedding photos. Firefighters freed them after half-an-hour and they were able to rejoin their celebrations at the Hotel Victoria in Newquay, Cornwall. Mrs Hamilton said: 'I had the groom and best man with me and we were going up to the fourth floor when the lift stopped. We did not even make it to the first floor before we got stuck. 'We pressed the bell button on the lift and spoke to the reception who told us the fire brigade would be on their way. Fire crews were called to the Victoria Hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, after bride Emma and groom Christopher (right with their rescuers) hit the emergency button. Crews lowered the lift so they could climb out (left) 'I thought they were joking so we phoned a friend and to our surprise confirmed it was true. 'We could not believe it was happening on our wedding day. We were supposed to be having our wedding photographs taken before sitting down for the meal but it was quite funny. 'The firefighters were brilliant. They had to cut the power off for the lift and lower us down by about six foot. 'We even had our photos taken with the fire crew so we could remember what happened on our wedding day.' The pair tied the knot on August 8th after being together for four years. Christopher, 27, is a scaffolder and his wife, 28, is a full time mother to their two children, Tylor, three, and one-year-old Charlie, who was also stuck inside the lift with them.

Victoria Nethercott, a funeral director the company, said some families forget to pick up the ashes, but others are simply too upset . 'However, we understand that there are many reasons why families may choose to leave the ashes in our care. 'For some, collecting them is too painful, in some cases it can be down to a breakdown in family communications on who will collect the remains.

'We believe it is only right that every individual is given the opportunity of a peaceful final resting place.' The funeral directors has now launched an appeal to have the 405 unclaimed sets of ashes reunited with families.

"By . Charles Martland . Eric Abidal has been officially unveiled as an Olympiacos player. The French left-back signed for the Greek champions early last month, but was only pictured with his new shirt on Monday. Abidal held up his favoured No 22 shirt as he was presented inside his new club’s Karaiskaki Stadium in Piraeus, the port town near Athens. New boy: Eric Abidal shows off his No 22 Olympiacos shirt after signing for the Greek champions . The 34-year-old, who was diagnosed with a liver tumour in 2011, has also represented Lyon and Barcelona and lifted the Champions League trophy for the latter in the same year, having been handed the captain’s armband in honour of his recovery. Olympiacos’ managing director, Ioannis Vrentzos, was full of praise for the veteran defender, describing him as 'nothing short of a jewel for our club.' He added: '[He is] a fantastic football player, an incredible athlete, but most of all a remarkable individual.' Strategic advisor Christian Karembeu also told the assembled media that Abidal would help strengthen the club’s partnership with UNICEF, the charity with whom Olympiacos have a strong association. Speaking at a press conference which also featured build-up to the team’s friendly with Athletic Bilbao this Wednesday, Abidal spoke of his delight at joining Greece’s most successful club. Happy: Abidal says it is 'truly a great joy' to sign for Olympiacos after leaving French club Monaco . He said 'It is truly a great joy for me to have signed with such a top club like Olympiacos. I will try really hard to contribute with my knowledge and experience and help the club.' The signing, when announced last month, was hugely surprising, especially as the Frenchman had only just penned a year’s contract at Monaco. His departure has been put down to Monaco’s decision not to sign Abidal’s former Barcelona team-mate Victor Valdes, which the defender reportedly sees as a broken promise. The goalkeeper is a free agent after ending his association with the Catalan giants which spanned more than 20 years. It remains unclear whether the Greek club, who have also signed Dutchman Ibrahim Afellay on loan this week, paid a fee to Monaco for Abidal’s services.","Abidal was officially presented on Monday at the Karaiskaki Stadium .

"By . Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . Rugby league great and one of the Palmer United Party's star recruits, Senator Glenn Lazarus, is on the back foot today amid claims he has been ripping off information from Wikipedia to inform followers about his state of Queensland. The accusations of plagiarism stem from his personal website senatorlazarus.com, where details about the state's primary industries appear to have been simply cut and pasted onto his page. Local media reports suggests the new senator has been sidestepping questions about his party leader's controversial comments about China. Scroll down for video . Senator Glenn Lazarus, the footballer they called 'the brick with eyes' is now in the eye of a political storm amid allegations he has plagiarised Wikipedia's Queensland website . The Courier Mail in Queensland reports that Senator Lazarus has refused to respond to questions about Australia’s economic future, what his plans for the state were and the comments made by party leader Clive Palmer and fellow Senator Jacqui Lambie. As a Senator, Glenn Lazarus, enjoys a base salary of more than $195,000 plus a raft of entitlements including travel. It's been a tough initiation for one-time football great, heckled during his maiden speech, accused of going to ground by sections of the media and now this. It remains unclear as to who actually posted the content for the 'About Queensland' dropdown on his website. And the words used to describe the role of the Senate and a member's role in it, strike a remarkably close resemblance to the details provided on the site of South Australia's Independent Senator, Nick Xenophon. What a week to forget for the Palmer United Party. Clive Palmer (right) and Senator Jacqui Lambie have been embroiled in the war of words of Australia's relationship with China and now PUP Senate leader Glenn Lazarus is in hot water . The following are the second and third paragraphs on Senator Lazarus' website: . 'Queensland is the largest state and the third most populated with a population of some 4,560,059 people. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia’s third largest city. Referred to as the ‘Sunshine State’, Queensland is home to 10 of Australia’s 30 largest cities and is the nation’s third largest economy. The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain’s longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.' Palmer United Party senators Jacqui Lambie (left) and Glenn Lazarus are making headlines for the wrong reasons . Before entering politics in 2013 with the Palmer United Party, Glenn Lazarus (pictured playing for NSW against Queensland) enjoyed a stellar rugby league career, considered one of the code's greatest players . And the following are excerpts from Queensland - Wikipedia: . 'Queensland (abbreviated as Qld) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in Australia. 'Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. 'The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. 'Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy. 'The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day.

Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.' Apart from some re-ordering of sentences, there appears to be very little differentiation between the two pages. Reading further, there are arguably too many similarities to be a coincidence. As the Queensland Wikipedia site appears today . The words on the Queensland page of the Glenn Lazarus site senatorlazarus.com strikes a remarkable resemblance to those on Wikipedia (top) With Senator Lazarus now facing the first real test of his political career, questions are being asked whether the pressure will prove too much to bear, as was the case for his former football team-mate Mal Meninga. Meninga, another rugby league great who starred for the Canberra side, is remembered for perhaps the country's most short-lived of political careers. In September 2001, just a few days after deciding he would run as an Independent in the ACT elections, he pulled out of the race while in his first political interview, saying quite simply: 'I'm buggered, I'm sorry. I have to resign'. Daily Mail Australia has sought comment from Senator Lazarus about the allegations but is yet to receive a response.","He's the Palmer United Party (PUP) leader in the Senate .

The implicated Mr Brown says his reputation has been sullied and told 2UE radio that, ‘simple homework checking would have stopped the damage to me and my family.’ Mr Brown claims it took him four minutes and $19 to prove the error, using the ASIC search website. Scroll down for video . Bestseller 'He Who Must Be Obeid' has been pulled from shelves due to allegations of defamation. The wrongfully implicated businessman, Christopher Brown AM . Co-authors Kate McClymont and Linton Besser pose for a photograph in the former parliamentary office of Eddie Obeid, following their the launch of their book at the NSW State Parliament building, in Sydney on Wednesday, July 30, 2014. The book, entitled He Who Must Be Obeid, is a non-fiction account of business dealings of former NSW Labor Minister Eddie Obeid. It has since been revealed that they misidentified businessman, Christopher Brown in the expose. The exposé was withdrawn from sale yesterday after an injunction was placed on the book by Mr Brown, amid warnings of legal action. The publisher, Random House confirm the imputation of the wrong man and say amended copies of the books will be on sale within the week. ‘The book contained misidentification and that was included in error,’ Random House marketing and publicity director Brett Osmond told Daily Mail on Thursday. ‘We have acted quickly to ensure the small amount of text that required a rewrite has indeed been rewritten to correct the error. A reprint will be in stores next week.' Christopher Brown was accused of being in business with Eddie Obeid's son Paul (pictured left, with his brother Moses leaving the ICAC hearing in April this year) and daughter Fiona. Mr Brown has hired defamation lawyer, Mark O’Brien and is demanding a public apology, after he was accused of being in business with two of Eddie Obeid’s children, Paul and Fiona. ‘I’m still sitting here waiting for a phone call from the journalist who haven’t bothered to say sorry despite one of the worst cases of defamation in a long, long time. ‘These books sit on people’s bookshelves for 40 years. Every time someone picks the book up, it says I’m a crook,’ Mr Brown told 2UE Radio. Mr Brown is the Chairman of Taylor Street Advisory and was Managing Director of the Tourism & Transport forum for almost 20 years. Mr Brown also serves on various Government boards and is a Fairfax media contributor. Former Labor minister Eddie Obeid is the subject of journalists, Kate McClymont and Linton Besser's expose, 'He Who Must Be Obeid' 'My legal team has injuncted the book, had it forced off the bookshelves to be pulped, a new edition to have corrections included, with public apologies to be issued in due course for damages obviously to be lodged,' Mr Brown told ABC Radio. Ms McClymont, who was covering the latest NSW corruption inquiry, tweeted on Thursday a formal apology would be made. She wrote: ""#icac media room helpfully offering suggestions re any new version of He Who Must Be Obeid. Formal apology to come re mistaken identity (sic)."" Dymocks Bookstore on Sydney's George Street confirmed on Thursday all copies of the book had been removed from its shelves. An employee said about 150 copies were taken down, adding that the book had been selling well since it was released last month. The book was listed as number one independent book bestseller as of the week ending August 2, according to Nielsen BookScan.","Publishers confirm misidentification of a man in He Who Must Be Obeid .

"By . Sarah Michael For Daily Mail Australia . The Australian Defence Force has banned topless barmaids from an army club after a soldier's mother exposed photos in an attempt to prove 'double standards' in Defence's attitude to her son's bisexuality. Defence banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club which is located next to the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The photos, which appeared on ninemsn, show soldiers in the company of topless women, one of whom is tattooed and blonde. A soldier's mother exposed photos of topless barmaids at Gratwick Club in Western Australia in an attempt to prove 'double standards' in Defence's attitude to her son's bisexuality . Defence has since banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club . Another photo shows a brunette woman with pink nail polish holding up a peace sign in the foreground of a photo, with uniformed soldiers pictured sitting at tables in the background. The mother of a former special forces soldier, who uncovered the photos, claims her son has been mistreated over his sexuality. He's being investigated  by Defence over allegations he bought illegal medicine. She says the allegations are false and only occurred after officers discovered her son was bisexual in April, and show a 'double standard' in the defence force because topless barmaids are allowed in government-owned clubs. 'The actual allegations (about the medicine) themselves have come from a person who had issues with my son's sexuality,' she told the Herald. 'He is being discriminated against because of his sexuality, about which he was open, by the same management that condones women being exploited in the manner of those photographs.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Defence for comment. This comes amid mounting calls for a royal commission into the military's handling of abuse claims and the abolition of the Australian Defence Force Academy following a number of claims over the past two decades that cadets and soldiers were assaulted and raped. Recently ABC TV's Four Corners program aired fresh stories from four former female cadets who claim to have been raped, sexually assaulted or denigrated while at ADFA in the 1990s and 2009. The women criticised the military's response to abuse claims - the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce - as inadequate. They have also been joined by former Australian Defence Force magistrate Ken Northwood, Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie and lawyer Gary Rumble - who led a review into ADFA abuse allegations - in calling for a royal commission to fully uncover the extent of abuse and hold the perpetrators to account. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce is still responding to claims.

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . Police officers in Melbourne are reportedly confiscating the meager earnings of street beggars and labelling the loose change as the 'proceeds of crime'. There have been at least eight cases in the past year where homeless people in the Victorian city's centre have had their cash seized, according to charity Youth Projects. 'Our outreach teams have reported seeing people quietly begging and having their little cup of change taken away because it is an offence to beg,' the welfare group's chair, Melanie Raymond, told Daily Mail Australia. She said it is a 'common problem' and hundreds of her clients have been fined around $100 for begging. Scroll down for video . Police have reportedly seized money from homeless people in Melbourne's CBD under begging laws. This is a stock photo taken of a man sleeping in freezing temperatures on the street . 'There's a lot of myth around how much people make begging. It is opportunistic and short lived. They normally make around 12-20 dollars. And they might only beg for a couple of hours just to make enough cash for what they need, a meal or toiletries, because they hate begging,' Ms Raymond said. One client had his begging change seized on Christmas Eve. 'He was begging because he knew there was a public holiday and he knew that non of the charities would be open for support,' Ms Raymond reasoned. 'He was devastated to lose that money because he had two children that he was hoping to see and would arrive empty handed.' Police on the streets of Melbourne's CBD reportedly told The Age newspaper on Tuesday that they enforce begging laws. However, Victoria Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sharon Darcy said she did not know of any cash seizures. There are over 100,000 homeless people in Australia. This photo shows a homeless man begging for money in Sydney's CBD . A 1966 Victorian law called 'begging or gathering alms' states a person must not beg or gather alms and a person must not cause, procure or encourage a child to beg or gather alms. Alms are defined as gifts of money, clothes, or food to poor people. The maximum penalty if found guilty is 12 months imprisonment. Ms Raymond has called for the law to be scrapped and said it is an old law 'from different times that is ineffective and doesn't reflect reality'. Some of her clients have been fined three times in one day. Once police have seized cash from begging they do not return it, Ms Raymond explained. Instead, she said some officers have taken her clients to charities and tipped the cash into communal donations boxes. She called this process an 'inefficient redistribution'. She explained there has been a 40 per cent increase in homelessness in Melbourne's CBD in the past year which has led to beggars on the street seeming more common. She said their need is 'very genuine' and that while they are sleeping on the streets many concur that they may as well place a sign in front of them to ask for help at the same time. 'It is a sign of crisis in plain sight in our streets,' she said. One man's begging cup was seized by police on Christmas Eve, the charity Youth Projects said . She also explained she believes giving money, while a 'deeply personal choice', is more helpful than giving food to the homeless. 'Try to imagine what it would be like if you never ever had the chance to choose what to eat,' she said. 'People are living off a constant diet of bad food and fast food and people would rather choose what they can eat.' The Youth Projects is the only free medical clinic for the homeless in the Melbourne CBD and The Youth Projects Living Room cares for 6,000 people each year. There are currently 105,237 people in Australia who are homeless. The state of Victoria has 22,789 homeless people, the second largest amount behind New South Wales which has 28,190, according to the 2011 ABS Census of Housing and Population.","Homeless charity says eight people had their cash seized by police .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . A Brisbane mother-of-one’s hopes of ever having another child have been destroyed after she almost lost her life from being accidentally given a spoonful of oven cleaner. Amanda Merrifield, from Runaway Bay in Queensland, has not eaten a meal in 15 months since coming out of a three-day-coma and enduring 37 operations to help clear her destroyed tongue, throat and oesophagus. As if feeding through a tube for the rest of her life wasn’t enough – the 40-year-old also had to face the heartbreaking news that being fed commercial oven cleaner by mistake meant she can never have another child. ‘That was taken away from me – it wasn’t my choice it was somebody who ripped that away,’ she said about the night she ingested the corrosive substance at the Point Restaurant at Paradise Point on May 30 last year. Scroll down for video . Amanda Merrifield was lucky to survive being fed oven cleaner and can no longer have anymore children . Ms Merrifield's son (pictured) was what pulled her out of her three-day coma . Ms Merrifield labelled the restaurant owner as a 'coward' for not apologising for ruining her life and she had also not received a cent from his insurance company . 'Instantly, instantly I don't know how to explain it. If you've ever been shot it was like an instantaneous pain like you would not believe,' Mrs Merrifield told A Current Affair. She said restaurant manager Paul Jeynes gave her the cleaning product, which he thought was vinegar, to help cure her hiccups. 'He gave it to me and said ""here you go – down the hatch"" and I hesitated a bit and then I was like oh ok you know, so I took it straight down - swallowed it all in one.' She labelled Mr Jeynes as a 'coward' for not apologising for ruining her life and she had also not received a cent from his insurance company. 'I just think they're waiting for me to die – they are just pushing paper around,' she said. 'Everybody is shocked - they can't believe that essentially it's just, you know, business as usual.' Mr Jeynes' insurance company, Lumley, has accepted indemnity on behalf of their client for this 'unfortunate event' and are working to 'settle as quickly as possible'. Ms Merrifield said that her insides were so badly burned from the oven cleaner that doctors did not expect her to survive the night. 'It damaged everything — my tongue, my voice box, all the way down and stopped at the top of my stomach,' she said. 'I heard one of the doctors say to another ""I heard it's really bad"" and she said ""it's catastrophic"" and then said ""72 hours"".' The 40-year-old has been forced to leave her career as a lawyer behind and fork out over $100,000 for her medical bills, while having to rely on a full-time carer for her three-year-old son . She has also been left unable to eat and relies on liquid bags of food that cost over $500 a week . 'Instantly, instantly I don't know how to explain it. If you've ever been shot it was like an instantaneous pain like you would not believe,' Mrs Merrifield said . Ms Merrifield has been forced to leave her career as a lawyer behind and fork out at least $150,000 for her medical bills, while having to rely on a full-time carer for her three-year-old son. But it was her son that pulled her out of the coma three days later. 'That’s when I was thinking of my little boy - I was thinking 'he needs me, he needs his mum', she said. 'I remember just mentally going – ""you’ve just go to fight – you're not going to die like this'.' However, choosing to live has cost her a lifetime of unbearable pain and a financial cost of $1,000 per week for medication and liquid food. 'You have to go to another place in your mind because the pain is so bad that you would do anything to get away from it,' she explained. 'I have the feeding tube so that is like my main back up nutrition – that’s what has kept me alive.' The restaurant's insurance company is yet to pay out Mrs Merrifield's compensation claim despite the restaurant and it's owner, Paul Jeynes (pictured), admitting liability .","Amanda Merrifield was given commercial oven cleaner by restaurant staffer .

"By . Peter Lewis . BLAZING STAR: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE EARL OF ROCHESTER by Alexander Larman (Head of Zeus £25) The first law of fiction is that bad characters are more rewarding than good ones. Much the same can be said of history: vice is more interesting than virtue. The Earl of Rochester, the baddest of bad hats at the wicked court of Charles II, has always had that appeal. Good-looking and highly talented, this dandy poet is remembered for wrecking his own life and dying far too young. His life was made into a film, The Libertine, starring Johnny Depp, but attempts at his biography have usually failed because the many anecdotes about his behaviour are often of doubtful provenance, as is his literary oeuvre: any smutty verse of the period is automatically credited to him. The Libertine: Johnny Depp starred as the dandy Earl of Rochester in the 2004 of the same name . Alexander Larman picks his way with care through this minefield and gives us the most comprehensive portrait of Rochester yet. He also paints a vivid picture of the society of Restoration London, which was wild. The 1660s were in some ways like the 1960s — a time of excess in rejoicing, namely at the ending of the killjoy Cromwellian Commonwealth. Women behaved with abandon at their liberation, following the example of Charles himself. His mistresses and illegitimate offspring were legion. Nicknamed ‘Old Rowley’, the king had insatiable appetites for food and sex, which inspired his court, not least Rochester. Born John Wilmot, he was the son of Charles’s most loyal crony during his escape and exile in France. Henry Wilmot was rewarded by being made Earl of Rochester, whereupon he died before his friend Charles returned home as king. The baddest of the bad: The Earl of Rochester was one of the most vice-ridden men of Charles II's court . Charles rewarded his son in his stead with a pension of £500 a year (worth £40,000 today). Next he made him a Gentleman of the Bedchamber with another stipend and appointed him Ranger of Woodstock Park with a lodge to live in. Rochester would have been rich if the emoluments had only been paid regularly. But the Crown was always short of money, so they were not. In addition, Rochester was a spendthrift, so continually hard up. While a teenager, Rochester had been given an Oxford degree (at the age of 14), done the Grand Tour of Europe for two years, then volunteered for service in the sea wars with Holland. While under fire, he behaved with bravery. At 18 he came to court, and by the time he was 20 he had married an heiress, Elizabeth Malet, whom he’d attempted to abduct from her coach after becoming infatuated with her. He had been caught and an angry Charles sent him briefly to the Tower; Elizabeth, however, forgave him. Rochester seems to have loved his wife and their children, but saw little of them at the country house in Oxfordshire they shared with his mother. He was too busy at court. He was already a heavy drinker — he once claimed he’d been continually drunk for five years. His drinking companions, including George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and his best friend Henry Savile, called themselves ‘The Merry Gang’ and ‘The Ballers’. Samuel Pepys once had dinner with them. ‘Lord! What loose, cursed company was this, though full of wit,’ he told his diary. The drunken exploits often ended with the gang doing damage. The most notable was the night they got into the King’s Privy Garden at Whitehall, where his latest, most expensive timepiece, a chronometer, lay — adorned with glass spheres engraved with royal portraits. Rochester proceeded to smash them to pieces with his sword. Charles II had 14 illegitimate children . Charles was not amused. He was always banishing Rochester from court, but would send for him again soon afterwards to enjoy his conversation and charm. The custom of the wits at court was to write scandalous verses that were circulated by hand in manuscript, like an early version of Twitter, though much more literate. Charles was delighted with Rochester’s couplet about him that ran: . ""He never said a foolish thing . Nor ever did a wise one."" He was not so pleased when he read Rochester’s Satire on Charles II: . ""Restless he rolls about from whore to whore . A merry monarch, scandalous and poor… . His sceptre and his p***k are of a length . And she may sway the one who plays the other."" The result was banishment — yet again. Some of Rochester’s verses are so explicit and outspoken as to be shocking even today, when almost anything can be printed. Unusual courtship: Rochester became infatuated with Elizabeth Malet (played by Rosamund Pike) and once attempted to abduct her from her coach . He delighted in exposing the naked lust of all classes, including the most respectable. He listed them in A Ramble In St James’ Park, a place of assignation down the centuries. But there was a dark side to Rochester that often turned sexual congress to ashes. A Ramble ends by cursing women, as do several other poems, which depict them as game for all-comers. It would be easy to take him for a misogynist. A likely reason for this is the misfortune bestowed on him by his wholesale whoring — an incurable dose of syphilis, which was to kill him. ‘I’ve swived more whores than Sodom’s walls e’er knew,’ he declares. ‘I’ve out-swilled Bacchus, blasphemed God and libelled Kings . . . the quickest way to hell’s by Rochester.’ It is not boasting but self-disgust that inspired him. Monkeying about: Rochester once declared that all men are knaves, and he'd rather be a monkey . His satires grew more wholesale until they encompassed everyone — A Satire Against Mankind declares that all men are knaves, but he’d rather be a monkey. It was with a monkey that he chose to be painted. His disillusion with love was complete when he fell for the actress Elizabeth Barry, a leading lady of the Restoration stage who entertained numerous other lovers. He, of all people, hardly had the moral right to complain of infidelity, but it seems to have enraged him. By the time she bore him a daughter, the affair was over. He did not even go to see the baby, but two years later he abducted the child to be raised with his other children by his uncomplaining wife. He took no great part in their upbringing. By that time, he was more often absent from the family home and court through illness. He must have been well aware that his time was nearly up. He sent for a future bishop, Gilbert Burnet, with whom he had long, sceptical discussions about God. Rochester could not believe in a heaven or hell, but he did express remorse for his life. As Dr Johnson observed: ‘He blazed out his youth and health in lavish voluptuousness.’ The strange thing is that after his death in delirium at the age of 33, he became more famous than ever because of his deathbed repentance. This was announced in a biography published immediately by Bishop Burnet. Larman points out that his penitence rests entirely on the testimony of Burnet and Rochester’s mother Anne, who wrote his formal Remonstrance (‘I detest and abhor the whole course of my wicked life’) and much more in the same vein. Rochester had signed this in a shaky hand. But did he mean, or even know, what it said? His mother then set about destroying any of his work she could lay her hands on. How much we lost we do not know. But what remains of his clever, anguished poems is enough to keep his name and talent evergreen.","The Earl of Rochester was the baddest of the bad in Charles II's court .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The terrifying power of sharks has been revealed in a stunning video where a great white attacks a robotic vehicle. The Remus SharkCam was deployed off Mexico’s Guadalupe Island to film the predators in the wild. But the researchers hadn’t banked on a shark feeling threatened by an intruder in its territory - and were stunned when on-board cameras recorded a formidable encounter. A robotic vehicle off Mexico's Guadalup Island has been attacked by a shark (shown). The dramatic footage was captured by six cameras on the Remus SharkCam . The robotic vehicle was being operated by a research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). A surge in shark attacks around the Hawaii Island of Maui hasn’t stopped surfers getting into the water. Instead, locals are placing their trust in technologies that claim to keep the predators away by sending an electric pulse through the water. One particular device, known as the Electronic Shark Defence System (ESDS), has enjoyed massive popularity on the island. ‘They just cannot make these things fast enough,’ said Hawaiian Island Surf and Sport owner Dennis O'Donnell, who keeps a waiting list for the products and sells out as soon as he's restocked. Users strap the devices to their ankles, wetsuits or surfboards. Some are about the size of an oversized watch, others the size of a wallet. They range in price from £249 ($399) to £390 ($649). The cylinder-shaped vehicle has six cameras facing in all directions to provide a panoramic view of its environment. It uses special acoustic tags to follow objects or animals in its vicinity. ‘But the hunter soon became the hunted,’ the video explains. Remus was approached by a great white shark, which soon swam into it at high speed and began biting the vehicle. During its attempt to eat the vehicle the shark closes a flap of skin over its eye known as the nictitating membrane to prevent any damage from flailing prey. Once it realises the vehicle isn’t food, however, it then merely considers it a threat. In the video (shown) the shark tried to eat the robotic vehicle like it is a seal . When the shark realises the vehicle is not food it begins to attack it and mark its territory. The video could help reveal how sharks hunt in the water . It begins swimming past and ramming the vehicle, showing clear signs of a creature exhibiting territorial behaviour. It lurks in the darkness before swimming up and attacking. The researchers were surprised when the vehicle was pulled back out of the water only to find teeth marks all over it. As one expert explains in the video, causing such damage would have required a great force. ‘If you banged on it with a screwdriver you wouldn’t get the same amount of damage’ he said. It’s hoped the footage will help reveal details about shark strategies in hunting and interacting. The shark lurks in the darkness before springing its attack upon the robotic vehicle . Six cameras on board Remus film a panorama of its environment, with the shark shown in the front-right here . An expert explains how the teeth marks they found would be hard to replicate with a screwdriver .","A robotic vehicle off Mexico's Guadalupe Island has been attacked by a shark .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Canadian man was sentenced to 60 days in jail this week for slapping his 13-year-old daughter so hard that she later died. Moussa Sidime, 74, from Quebec, had pleaded guilty to a manslaughter charge stemming from a 2010 confrontation with his teenage daughter, which ultimately resulted in her death. According to court documents, the man got into a heated argument over chores with 13-year-old Noutene Sidime and slapped her on both sides of her face. Moussa Sidime (left) was sentenced to 60 days in his daughter's 2010 death; Noutene Sidime (right), 13, died from brain hemorrhaging after being slapped twice in the face with great force . The girl collapsed to the floor unconscious with blood trickling from her nose. Mr Sidime called 911 and Noutene was rushed to a hospital, CTV News reported. The 13-year-old girl spent three days in a coma at the Montreal Children's Hospital before succumbing to her injures . A medical examiner determined that the teenager died from a cerebral hemorrhage caused in part by the slaps. Moussa Sidime was initially charged with aggravated assault causing death, but the count was later changed to involuntary manslaughter. On Wednesday, a judge in Quebec ruled that the 74-year-old patriarch will be able to serve his 60-day sentence on weekends over the course of 30 weeks. Judge Richard Marleau took into account the defendant’s obvious remorse and his spotless criminal record. Sidime’s jail term will be followed by two years’ probation. Domestic dispute: Mr Sidime told the court in February that he was upset with his daughter for talking back to him after he scolded her for leaving dirt under the carpet in their Quebec apartment . Freak accident: The teen was found unconscious with blood flowing from her nose because of a raptured artery; she died three days later without ever coming out of a come . The Sidime family rallied around the father, described as a pillar of the Guinea-Canadian community, insisting that the girl's death was a tragic accident. ‘We knew that in his heart he meant only the best for his daughter,' said Aissatou Sidime-Blanton, the victim’s eldest sister. Crown prosecutor Julie Laborde said after the hearing that the sentence sent a message that corporal punishment is never the answer to a child's misbehavior. Pleased: Aissatou Sidime-Blanton, the victim's eldest sister, was happy with the sentence, saying their father never intended for this to happen and was filled with remorse . On October 6, 2010, Nouténé Sidime was washing the floor in the family’s apartment in Longueuil when her father came up to her and scolded her for missing dirt under a carpet. The 74-year-old married father was on his way back to the living room when he said he overhead his daughter talking back to him, he told the court in February. He slapped the child twice on the face and once on her backside. A few minutes later, Mr Sidime heard a thump coming from the kitchen. He went to investigate and found Noutene lying on the floor with blood on her face. The man tried to revive the girl after calling 911, but she never regained consciousness. An autopsy later found that Mr Sidime’s blows caused Noutene to twist her neck in such a way that an artery was ruptured, cutting off the flow of oxygen to the brain. ‘If I had known one slap would kill her ... I can't believe it could be fatal,’ a sobbing Mr Sidime told the court in February, saying that it was the first time he raised his hand on Noutene, according to Toronto Sun. The father described Noutene, a gifted young artist who aspired to be a lawyer, as the kindest of his children and insisted, ‘I’m not a villain.’ ‘We love her dearly, we didn’t want her to go, but it was what God wanted at that time. This is one of those freak accidents that, as he has said, if he could take it back, he would take it back,’ Sidime’s eldest daughter told Toronto Star after the sentencing.","Moussa Sidime, 74, will serve his 60-day sentence on weekends over 30 weeks followed by two years' probation .

"By . David Wilkes . Pilots were forced to divert a plane after a drunk passenger threw her prosthetic leg at members of the cabin crew. After her demands for ‘cigarettes and a parachute’ were denied by stewards, the  48-year-old took off the false limb and hurled it at them in a fit of rage.

"By . Mike Anstead . Follow @@mike_anstead . 'Would you like to fly the plane now?' asks the pilot with what I detect is a small chuckle. I'm just trying to reacquaint myself with our old friend the horizon after coming out of a giant loop-the-loop, 3,000ft above the ground. I'm sitting in the front of a tiny two-seater plane that is designed to do the kind of acrobatics that put your local circus act to shame. Behind me at the controls is Datuk Halim Othman, a Malaysian Air Force pilot whose office is often the cockpit of a jet-fighter. He's definitely the Top Gun in this partnership. So, yes, I think I'll leave the flying bit to you, thanks Halim. I've been offered this unique opportunity during a trip to the Red Bull Air Race in Rovinj, a beautiful terracotta-topped town on the northern coast of Croatia. 'You must eat a good, solid breakfast. Bacon and eggs,' advised Paul Bonhomme - Britain's Lewis Hamilton of the skies - the previous night. Easy for you to say, mate. After nibbling my way through some fruit and toast, it's time to head for the hangar. The RedBull Air Race takes place over several different events throughout the year - the next one will be at Royal Ascot in August - and is a visual spectacle unlike any other. Combining high speed and low altitude it is a wonder to behold from the ground, as some of the world's most exceptional pilots guide their planes through an aerial racetrack featuring air-filled pylons in the fastest possible time, incurring as few penalties as possible. Flying low: The race involves aircraft taking on a variety of tight twists and turns as they negotiate a course . The world turns upside down: Mike keeps composed as the Red Bull jet performs a stomach-churning 360 degree loop above Croatia . The safety . briefing I receive is pretty straightforward: keep your eyes on the horizon, . tense your body when the G-Force hits you and please don't be sick in . the cockpit (there's a bag on the side if the worst happens). As . we walk to the plane (an Extra 330 LX, for any of you reading this with . a pilot’s licence), I try to avoid looking at the bloke from Austria . who flew before me and is now slumped on a sofa with a face that is . roughly the same shade as a Granny Smith apple. Fitted in a flight suit with a parachute on my back, I pull on the helmet through which I can also hear Halim dish out advice. I suddenly feel rather small as the canopy is closed above our heads. 'Flight No 4, please taxi to the runway for take off.' There's no going back now. Acrobatics: The planes perform the stunts at low altitudes so the crowds can watch from below . We’re off the ground in just a few seconds and soon rising sharply to the left above the emerald waters of the Adriatic. In the distance - eyes fixed firmly on the horizon - I spot the uncompromising racecourse for the pros. I may have dodged that, but I'm about to have a small taste of what they do. 'Enjoying the view?' asks Hamil. 'Yes.' 'Ready for some moves?' 'Erm, I think s...' Before I've had time to add the 'o', we dive down sharply towards the trees below. It's loop-the-loop time. What is the Red Bull Air Race?It is a world championship that was launched in 2005. Pilots race specially-designed planes through and around air-filled pylons on a course. Whoever finishes in the quickest time wins, with points for all those in the top eight.Where can I watch it?It's a global event, with this season's races being staged in Abu Dhabi, Croatia, Malaysia, Poland, China and two in the United States (Las Vegas and Dallas). Closer to home, the race comes to Ascot racecourse in Surrey. Qualifying is on August 16, with the race on the following day.Who races in the championship?There are 12 pilots in the world championship, including two Brits - world champion Paul Bonhomme and Nigel Lamb. There is also a Challenger Cup series for up and coming pilots, with 29-year-old Brit Tom Bennett tipped for big things.Is it dangerous?Like Formula One, there will always be dangers with super-quick racing, but the emphasis is very much on safety first. The world championship had a three-year hiatus as technical and safety rules were tightened, before returning this year.What do the pilots do when they are not racing?All the pilots come from commercial or military backgrounds. Bonhomme - champion in 2009 and 2010 - flies Boeing 747s for British Airways in his day job.For more details and tickets to Ascot on August 16-17, go to www.ascot.co.uk/airrace . Thrilling: Several competitions are held throughout the world over the course of the year . Ready for take-off: Mike Anstead gives a thumbs-up to the camera before taking to the skies for his acrobatics . 'Strain' warns Hamil. He then lifts the plane's nose upwards so all we have in front of us is cloud. The G-Force kicks in - I get the feel of four Gs (the pros experience 10 when they loop in the races - 'it's like being sat on by an elephant' is Bonhomme's verdict). It's an amazing sensation as gravity pins me back in my seat. Keeping my eyes locked ahead, a few seconds later the water and then the trees come back into my now deranged view. It's like someone's turned the world inside out inside my head. After another loop-the-loop (why not?), . Hamil switches to a barrel-roll - tipping the plane to the right and . turning it 360 degrees until it's back level again. The manoeuvre turns . the land below into a distorted ball of trees. It's the first time my . stomach rings the doorbell to ask what's going on. He survived!: Mike gives crew another thumbs-up as he lands safely back on land after his daredevil ride . 'More barrel-rolls?' asks Hamil. 'I think one's enough fella...' He winds the plane down and down in a series of sharp left turns before blasting forward at 200mph just 25m off the ground through a set of air-filled pylons like those used on the real course. Two days later, I watch on from my standpoint on the bay of Rovinj as Bonhomme misses out on winning the final by 0.08s. I have a new-found respect for these daredevils in the sky. You can do the same at Ascot next month. And with your feet firmly on the ground, you won't have to worry about keeping your eyes on the horizon.","Malaysian Air Force pilot puts reporter through his paces .

"By . Chris Pleasance . They say thrill-seekers enjoy living life on the edge, and one extreme sportsman has taken the phrase literally by performing death-defying handstands all over the world . Daredevil Scott Young, 25, from Baskingstoke, Hants., has travelled as far afield as India and China, and has even completed one handstand on top of a 40-storey skyscraper. Scott climbs to the edge of the building's roofs and performs a handstand without any safety ropes - and films the vertigo-inducing views on a camera built into his shoe. Scroll down for video . Extreme sportsman Scott Young, 25, from Basingstoke, performs handstands in crazy places all over the world including on the top of this building in Shanghai, China . Scott performs the stomach-churning feats with no safety equipment and films his exploits using a camera mounted into his shoe . Scott, pictured here in Greece, is a professional freerunner - meaning he performs stunts in urban environments such as climbing tall buildings and jumping between rooftops . 3RUN, the team to which Scott belongs, provides performers for films and, between the performers, holds five Guinness World Records . He said: 'When you do a handstand, you have to focus on the ground in front of you to keep your balance. If it's only a few feet away that's fine, but I look right down to the bottom of the building - it's so far I just have to block it out of my mind. 'It's more of a mental thing than anything else - you've just got to focus your mind on what you're doing, not what might happen.' Professional freerunner Scott, part of the 3RUN team of acrobats, has so far performed his 'Handstands in High Places' in three countries. Scott, of Basingstoke, Hants., first filmed himself last month doing a handstand on the edge of a 20-storey derelict building in Delhi, India. He said: 'We were in India filming and I just thought 'why not?' It was scary but I'm very confident with my body and what I can do.' Scott says the trick to performing a handstand is to focus on the ground beneath you. Here he is pictured on top of a wire fence barely the width of his thumb in his hometown of Basingstoke . Scott first filmed himself completing a handstand on top of this abandoned building on the edge of a housing estate in Delhi, India . Scott's stunts are so risky he says that even his team have begged him not to risk his life before, but he can't get enough of the rush that comes with doing them . An expert in the art of freerunning, Scott has been practising the sport since he was 15 and says the key to success is mental focus . The ultra-strong athlete has also filmed himself on a car park roof in his home town - balancing on a fence only a couple of inches wide. He said: 'This was more of a technical challenge, because the flat top of the fence was only as wide as my thumb. 'Plus, if I'd fallen off the side, I would have probably died and my mum would have killed me because of the scandal it would cause.' He has also balanced precariously on the top of a 40-storey skyscraper in Shanghai, China - 480ft up. Scott said: 'Even my teammates wanted me to put on a harness, but I knew I'd be able to do without.' Scott's mum Samantha Young is so terrified by her son's stunts that she refuses to watch them. He added: 'She got a bit annoyed when I showed her the first video, so I've stopped telling her about them now.' Scott posts videos of his exploits on the internet, but says that his mother refuses to watch them because she is so worried he will hurt himself. Here he is pictured in Greece . Scott, who has incredible strength and skill, has been employed doing stunts on film sets including The Incredible Spiderman . Scott says that he has torn muscles and ligaments and has even broken his ankle at a film premier after landing half on and half off a crash mat . Scott has been practising the urban sport of freerunning since he was 15 and has starred in films such as The Amazing Spiderman. He said: 'I've had a few injuries in my time. I've torn ligaments and things in my shoulder, but they're usually just repetitive injuries rather than from bad falls. 'The worst I've done is snap my ankle at a film premier when I landed half on the crash mat. The irony is that if I'd landed smack bang on the concrete I would have just rolled it off and been fine.'","Extreme sportsman Scott Young, 25, performs death-defying handstands on the edge of very tall buildings .

"By . Bianca London . She captured the nation's attention for all the wrong reasons in December 2008 when she claimed she had been in a seven year long extra-marital affair with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. But now Sarah Symonds - who touted herself as a professional mistress after indulging in multiple affairs (she counts Lord Archer among her conquests) - says she is the 'worm that turned' after setting up a Wife School to help woman prevent their husband cheating. And controversially, 43-year-old Sarah's top tip for wives to ensure the fidelity of a husband is to stop spending so much time in the kitchen and act more like their mistress. As a well-known mistress, Sarah Symonds has set up an online help forum called The Wife School to coach women on how to  to become their husband's mistress . Sarah, who is not married herself but is currently dating ('only single men!') believes that men’s needs are . actually very simple, and if women are smart enough, they can satisfy . them and stop infidelity creeping into a relationship. 'It’s all about ""the skills"". I call it the ESF rule: Men need to Eat, Sleep, and Fornicate,' she says in an exclusive interview with MailOnline . 'Give them those in abundance and you might just get a monogamous husband.related] . 'Yes, it is controversial that I founded . this organisation as a well-documented Other Woman. But who better than . someone who has been on the inside of infidelity for so many years? 'I didn't want to be that person anymore. I see it as a way of trying to give something back . to the world, to try to make up for so many of the wrongs I have . done,' she said. Sarah, from Newport, Wales, established Wife School, an online advice forum, after the success of her Canadian show The Mistress, which followed her on her mission to rescue women caught in the despair of an extra marital affair. Sarah then appeared on hit U.S. show Dr Phil . and took five mistresses on the show with her to discuss their . livelihood; the show proved to get the best ratings of the entire series. Sarah says she is a changed woman - and despite claiming to have slept with Gordon Ramsay (who, for the record, said of the claim: 'Did I have a torrid seven year affair with her? Did I f***!) now says she sees the school as a way to make up for the wrongs she has done . After her success over the pond, she moved back to Wales and set up Wife School, a non-profit making organisation ('you can't ask women in despair for money'), after . hearing from so many wives asking for her advice. She . now receives a constant flow of emails from wives in despair who worry . that their husband is cheating and are desperately seeking tips on how . to stop it happening. Speaking about her latest venture, she said: 'Wife School found me. I was working on my show The Mistress over in Canada which highlighted the topic and I had so many wives contacting me for advice. Sarah answers women's questions when they fear that their husband is having an affair or simply want to spice up their marriage to stop their husband cheating . 'The school is . geared towards making today’s marriages more successful and to . ultimately lessen the divorce rates, and the subsequent demise to our . society’s structure. 'Any marriage or committed relationship needs daily . maintenance and nurturing - people just don't seem to realise that. 'Marriage should be likened to a high powered job, once you land that job . you know you need to show up daily, put a huge amount of effort into . your role in order to keep it - and prosper within it - otherwise there . is always the risk that someone may come along and take it from you. 'Therefore, if more people treated their marriage as they do their job, . more marriages would last the lifetime they are supposed to.' Sarah . maintains that she has a hawkeye when it comes to spotting the signs of . cheating - and she wants to point them out to other women before it's . too late. The self-proclaimed relationship guru . maintains that it's the men who bury their heads in the sand, those who . join the gym, change their routine and influences are those having . affairs, and she is keen to open women's eyes to this. 'Don't allow space in your marriage for other women to walk into,' she adds. Her main advice to women is: Do more in the bedroom than the kitchen. Stay up late at night to see how his day went. Be affectionate and be a good listener. 'I'm not a trained professional but I can relate and I know how men lie; I've got secrets and tips.' Her long term plan is to turn her . online venture into a physical school for women to engage in self-image . lessons, learn communication skills and even fitness tips. I . believe that the whole Sisterhood has to bond together to beat these . cheats right out of the sheets,' she says. 'A lot of men should worry because I am here to beat the cheats.' 'I am here to wake other women up and teach them not to be a mousewife,' she adds. And if all else fails, there’s always Wife School.'

"By . Harriet Hernando . Former primary school Martyne Airey, 51, pictured at an earlier hearing, sniffed and tickled children's feet - and he walked free from court . A primary school teacher who sniffed and tickled children's feet to get a kick walked free from court with a suspended sentence. Martyne Airey, 51, made children play a game of ‘sniff and tickle’ where they had to take their shoes off and pick a card from a deck. The court heard that depending on which card was picked he would then smell or tickle their soles, getting a sexual thrill out of sniffing sweaty feet in particular. He was . caught after teachers confronted children for being late to classes. They explained that they had . been with Airey and said what had happened to them. After . Airey was arrested, police found a voice recorder in his bedroom . featuring a young boy reading a story about a woman who had been . kidnapped, bound, gagged and was wearing dirty socks. iPhone records showed that Airey, of Blackburn, Lancashire, had been visiting foot fetish websites. Airey, . who had worked as a teacher for around 18 years before he was . suspended, pleaded guilty to eight counts of sexual assault on a child . under 13 at Preston Crown Court. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison – which was suspended for two years – and made to sign the Sex Offender Register. At an earlier hearing, a parent of one of the children said his behaviour was weird. 'It was not normal behaviour. I was really angry and disgusted when it all came out. Another said: 'You normally expect your children to be safe with a teacher, but this fellow obviously needs some help.’ Placing Airey on a two-year supervision order, Judge Newell said: ‘I can fully understand why any reasonable parent would feel affronted and distressed by what you, a teacher, have done to their children. A judge at Preston Crown Court handed Airey a suspended sentence for two years and ordered him to sign the Sex Offender Register . ‘Parents place great trust in teachers. They expect them to be looked after. ‘You abused that trust and it is a high degree of trust.’ In Airey’s defence, Tina Landale said her client was the carer for his elderly mother and brother. ‘Mr Airey sits before you a man with a reputation in tatters,’ she said. ‘He is ashamed of himself. He is disgraced and feels a great sense of revulsion as to what has happened. ‘He cannot really explain how he let himself become involved in this except to say that he enjoyed his teaching career, enjoyed the contact with the children. ‘He is described as a likeable teacher who got on well with people and for some inexplicable reason, he allowed himself to start playing this so-called game with a number of children at the school.’","Martyne Airey made children play 'sniff and tickle' game after lessons .

The figures have been unveiled under a freedom of information request. Almost 5,000 children - including babies - have disappeared from council care in the past two years, new figures have revealed (stock picture) They show that 4,852 looked-after children were reported . missing between January 2012 and December 2013, the Sunday Times reports. There were 24,320 cases logged - as many disappeared more than once. The large majority were teenagers but dozens of those who disappeared were between four and nine years old. The number includes a one-year-old girl missing since July 2013. Kent County Council reported the most children missing - with 458 children disappearing on 2,623 occasions. Peter Oakford, Kent County Council cabinet member for specialist children's services, said: 'It is always a huge concern when children and young people go missing, even if just for a few hours. 'In Kent, we face particular issues due to being a port authority and receive the highest number of unaccompanied minors in the UK. 'When unaccompanied asylum seeker children arrive from abroad, we don't know what sort of ordeals they have gone through on their journey. They are scared and many have been told by traffickers to run away and meet contacts when they arrive in England.'

The second highest number was in . Nottinghamshire where 215 children disappeared. In Hertfordshire there were 209 missing children. Tom Rahilly, head of strategy for looked-after children at the NSPCC, told the paper: 'When children and young people in care go missing it should be no different to when any other child disappears from home. This is very alarming.' He said children may disappear because the parent decides to remove them without going through the proper channels, and often teenage mothers in care decide to leave with their child. The Department for Education said it had improved guidance to councils regarding children missing from care.","Almost 5,000 children  - including babies - disappeared from council care .

"By . Associated Press . Former star pitcher turned television analyst Curt Schilling announced on Wednesday that he is battling cancer. The 47-year-old Schilling, who spent 20 years in the major leagues before retiring in 2009, divulged the news in a statement released through his employer, Bristol-based ESPN. It did not indicate what type of cancer Schilling has, when he was diagnosed or what his prognosis might be. 'With my incredibly talented medical team I'm ready to try and win another big game,' he said. 'I've been so very blessed and I feel grateful for what God has allowed my family to have and experience, and I'll embrace this fight just like the rest of them, with resolute faith and head on.' Scroll down for video . Curt Schilling announced he had cancer on Wednesday but he did not specify which type of cancer . ESPN spokesman Mike Soltys said Schilling is taking a leave of absence. He recently signed a multi-year contract extension with the network and was to be part of the 'Sunday Night Baseball' broadcast team, as well as contribute to the network's studio coverage, including its spring training coverage, Soltys said. 'Our thoughts are with Curt and his family during this challenging time,' the Bristol-based network said in a statement. 'His ESPN teammates wish him continued strength in his cancer fight and we look forward to welcoming him back to our baseball coverage whenever he's ready.' Schilling played for five teams during his Major League career. He won three world championships, with the Arizona Diamondbacks (2001) and Boston Red Sox (2004, 2007), sharing the World Series MVP award with teammate Randy Johnson in 2001. He won 216 games and struck out 3,116 batters during his career, but is perhaps best known for pitching in the 2004 ALCS and World Series after having stitches to mend an ankle injury. His bloody sock was later put on display in Cooperstown. Schilling has been in the news recently after the failure of 38 Studios, a video game company he owned in Rhode Island, with the help of a $75 million state loan. The company went bankrupt last year, leaving Rhode Island taxpayers on the hook to pay back tens of millions of dollars. Schilling said he invested and lost as much as $50 million. This is not the first time he and his family have battled health issues. Schilling recently revealed he suffered a heart attack in November 2011. His wife, Shonda, successfully battled melanoma in 2001. Schilling was a starting pitcher for the Boston Red Sox .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Veteran ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas appeared on 'Good Morning America' Friday to publicly discuss for the first time her addiction to alcohol, which she had been keeping a secret for many years. Vargas, 51, will be back co-hosting '20/20' tonight for the first time since October, when she took a leave of absence to seek treatment for her problem. 'I am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos in an interview pre-taped Thursday night. 'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time to admit it to my family, but I am.' Scroll down for interview . Coming clean: ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas, 51, appeared on Good Morning America to speak out about her battle with alcohol addiction . Tete-a-tete: Vargas sat down for an interview with her long-time colleague George Stephanopoulos on the eve of her return to '20/20' Looking back on the years Vargas said she had spent hiding her addiction from her colleagues and friends, the TV presenter summed up the experience as 'exhausting' and a 'staggering burden to carry.' ‘You become so isolated with the secret and so lonely, because you can’t tell anyone what’s happening,’ she explained. Vargas, a married mother of two, told Stephanopoulos that for a long time she was living in denial about her addiction. ‘I started thinking “Well, you know, I’ll only drink, you know, on weekends,” she said with a laugh. ‘I’ll only drink, you know, two glasses of wine a night. I won’t drink on nights before I have to get up and do “Good Morning America.” But those deals never work.’ She initially had entered rehab in the fall, but left after 28 days against her doctors' wishes. Vargas came home for five days, but then returned to the treatment center and remained there until the medical staff gave her the green light to leave. Her most recent Twitter message was . posted in mid-November announcing her return from the treatment facility . where she had been staying. 'Hello . everyone!  I am home, and so grateful for all your support and well . wishes. I am so much better and taking it one day at a time,' she wrote . to her 40,000 followers. 'We are proud of the steps Elizabeth has taken and are pulling for her recovery,' an ABC spokesperson said at the time. According . to the New York Daily News, senior staff at ABC were told last October . Vargas was on 'medical leave', but many suspected she was being treated . for alcoholism. Back to work: ABC's 20/20 host Elizabeth Vargas is expected to be back in the anchor chair this Friday after three months off the air . When asked about the cause of her . addiction, Vargas revealed that she has been suffering from severe . anxiety since she was a little girl. Vargas' father served in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and she recalled that . when her mother would leave the house to go to work, she suffered daily panic . attacks that carried into adulthood. The Emmy-winning journalist recalled how one time she even had a panic attack on air while anchoring a live news show on Chicago's WBBM, where she got her start before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline. Vargas' husband, Grammy Award-winning singer Marc Cohn, was the only one who . knew about her struggles with alcohol, and when he finally confronted . her, the ABC anchor recalled feeling 'really angry' while acknowledging . that he was right. However, . it took her a long time to seek treatment because Vargas said she did . not want to feel like a failure and was still able to function in her daily . life. Vargas recalled that . her ‘aha' moment came one day when she arrived at work to film a '20/20' segment and realized that she was too drunk to do it. Childhood trauma: Vargas revealed that she has been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since she was a little girl when he father was deployed in Vietnam . Rock bottom: Vargas (center), pictured with Stephanopoulos (far right) on the set of GMA in 2010, said her 'aha' moment came when she realized she was too drunk to do her show one day . Every . night like clockwork, the TV host and mother of two would come home and . have a glass of wine - her drink of choice that was dubbed 'mommy's . juice' by her 10-year-old son, Zachary. 'I thought that was hysterical,' she recalled. 'It didn’t occur to me that that was a problem.' Vargas said she used wine to treat her anxiety and deal with the stresses of her work. ‘That’s . exhausting, to live like that. And it becomes very easy to think “I . deserve this glass of wine. I’m so stressed out …,”’ she said. As . a co-anchor of '20/20' since 2004, Vergas had done six specials on drinking, but . reporting on alcoholism in others had failed to give her the push she . needed to seek help for herself. When . Vargas finally decided to enter rehab this fall, she and her husband . told their sons that she was suffering from an alcohol allergy. ‘I . didn’t want to use the word “disease” with them, even though that’s how . it’s classified by the medical profession,’ she said. ‘It’s too scary, . you know, the connotation for them is disease is something deadly.’ Wife and mother: Vargas is married to Grammy Award-winning musician Marc Cohn (left), and the couple her two sons (right) Go-to drink: Vargas said her drink of choice was wine, which her older son, Zachary (right) used to call 'mommy's juice' Vargas . admitted that even now it is hard for her not to drink, but she has . been relying on prayers, meditation and a great support system to . conquer her urges triggered by stress. ‘There . are lots of people who feel a lot of stress,’ she said. ‘Not everybody . turns to a glass of wine or three like I did, or four, like I did on . some occasions. What I learned to do when I was away was to feel the . feelings.’ The 51-year-old anchor is also a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and has a sponsor. 'Alcohol for me is no longer an option,' Vargas concluded.","Vargas, 51, told George Stephanopoulos on the eve of her return to '20/20' that she had spent years secretly self-medicating her anxiety with alcohol .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Despite being held captive in Pakistan for five years, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has refused contact with his parents in the four weeks since his release, according to an Army official. The Wall Street Journal has reported Sgt Bergdahl - who started a desk job at the army headquarters on Monday as part of his return to duty - has chosen not to see or speak to his parents . The family have not commented on the situation, and the cause of the tension is not known. Following the controversial decision to trade Sgt. Bergdahl for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, his parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, appeared at a White House announcement alongside President Barack Obama. The estrangement comes after it was revealed Bergdahl may also receive $350,000 from the US government without paying taxes: $200,000 would be for wages earned during his captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a prisoner of war, according to Fox News. Money earned while in a combat zone is excluded, per IRS regulations. Bergdahl will also have a sponsor as he returns to work as a 'normal soldier' with a desk job. The sponsor is described as 'a person who's designated, not only for him, but for every soldier in Army North [...] and assists with assimilating into the unit.' The sponsor helps with 'very basic administrative functions,'  such '[helping become] a part of the unit, processing records, becoming familiar with the day to day schedule.' Return to duty: This is Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl six weeks ago at his handover by the Taliban to US forces.  The US Army said Monday he will return to active duty . Accompanied by President Barack Obama, Jani . Bergdahl and Bob Bergdahl speak during a news conference in the Rose . Garden of the White House in Washington on Saturday, May 31, 2014 about . the release of their son. It has now been revealed they have not spoken to Bowe Bergdahl since his release . In a statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).' 'He will now return to regular duty within the command where he can contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is still ongoing.' According to the New York Times, Bergdahl was in therapy at Fort Sam Houston and will meet with Major General Kenneth R. Dahl, the head of the Army's investigation. Since his return from Afghanistan, Sgt. Bergdahl has been involved in debriefings with his superiors, the paper said. Just last week, a photo of Bergdahl, . smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan . was posted on Twitter. The undated . photo, likely taken during Bergdahl’s five years in captivity, was . posted on the social media site on Wednesday by @khorasan3, an account . associated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Along . with the image were the words ‘#US Solider #Bergdahl with Martyr . #Taliban Leader Badar'udin Haqqani(RH) S/O Shaykh Jalaludin . Haqqani(HA).’ This photo of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, was posted on Twitter on Wednesday . The . Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) confirmed Bergdahl was photographed next to Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani . network in Afghanistan. The son of Haqqani head Jalaluddin Haqqani, he reportedly handled everyday operations and . was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2012, CNN said at the time. Later . @khorasan tweeted a series of messages in which they claimed Bergdahl . was never tortured by the Taliban and only treated with kindness during . his five years in captivity. Former POW Bergdahl was controversially released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees. Last . week it emerged that Bergdahl is being allowed to wander off the Texas base . and while under supervision he has visited a library, a supermarket, . stores and fast-food chains near the camp. Bergdahl alternates between civilian and military clothing and shakes hands with passerby when they recognize him, an Army spokesperson told CNN. The . details have emerged as soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he . left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 revealed to Fox News they have still not been . contacted by military investigators. Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009 . The former . soldiers told the news channel they believe the Army has already made up its mind about how Bergdahl ended up in . the hands of the Taliban - and that they believe he deserted his post. But when he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, President Obama gave him a hero's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health. 'I think it's very clear he . deserted his post,' Army Sgt. Evan Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he . was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have . witnesses who saw him walking away. Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened . 'And if you’re walking away in one of . the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and . gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.' Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow . Of the investigation, Buetow added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.' Former . Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also told Fox News said he had not been contacted by Army . officials - but that here are probably still sworn statements by the . unit's members made after he left the post. 'I . have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've . been public.' Both Buetow and Vierkant told Fox they believe Bergdahl deserted his unit. Speaking out: Former Army Sgt.

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . Mournfully but movingly, those bereaved by the River Thames Marchioness pleasure boat tragedy have remembered their loved ones at a cathedral service on the 25th anniversary of the disaster. Crowding round a flower-strewn, candle-lit memorial stone at Southwark Cathedral in south London, the families, and some survivors, heard the names read out of all 51 young people who died in the tragedy. It was on August 20, 1989, that the riverboat Marchioness, packed with partygoers, collided with the dredger Bowbelle and sank in the Thames in central London. Among those who died was Francesca Dallaglio, 19, the sister of former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio and merchant banker Antonio de Vasconcellos, whose 26th birthday was being celebrated aboard the boat. Scroll down for video . Loss: The wreckage of the Marchioness, which sank in the Thames 25 years ago today. A total of 51 young people lost their lives in the tragedy.

Eileen Dallaglio, mother of former England rugby captain Lawrence, throws flowers into the Thames at the spot where her daughter Francesca died in the Marchioness disaster in 2001 . The names of the dead had also been read out at a lunchtime Eucharist in the cathedral during which bereaved mother Judy Wellington, whose son Simon, 20, was lost on the Marchioness, gave a Bible reading. The cathedral was adorned with 51 red roses and 51 candles were lit to honour each of the dead. A launch was provided to allow families to drop flowers at the spot on the river where the accident happened. Among those at the cathedral was Margaret Lockwood Croft, 75, who lost her son Shaun, 26, in the disaster. She said today: 'Shaun is always in my thoughts. I have to hold on to all the memories - his laughter, his caring ways. 'He was born on the same day as me. He was the greatest birthday present I ever had.' Through the Marchioness Action Group, Mrs Lockwood Croft spearheaded the campaign for improved Thames safety standards which eventually led to lifeboat services, and other safety features, being provided on the Thames. Representatives of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) and the Port of London Authority were at today's service. Sombre task: Police assist in the removal of the dead from the boat in 1989 .

Right, a lifeboat officer places a rose in the River Thames on the 20th anniversary of Marchioness disaster in August 2009 . The bereaved families had to endure a 10-year wait for the announcement of a public inquiry into the disaster following an earlier 1991 report from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). That first report said the failure of both vessels to mount a proper look-out was the immediate cause of the tragedy. This was the same conclusion reached by Lord Justice Clarke when his 2001 report was published after the public inquiry, announced in 1999, was finally held. While the MAIB report said that there were marine regulation faults going back 25 years, the Clarke report said it was 'a catastrophe that should never have happened'. In the years between the two inquiries the families had to absorb the news that the Bowbelle captain, Douglas Henderson, was formally acquitted after juries at two separate trials failed to reach verdicts on a charge of his failing to keep a proper look-out.

The families also had to come to terms with the decision by Westminster Coroner Dr Paul Knapman to cut off the hands of more than 20 of the Marchioness victims for identification purposes - an action criticised in the Clarke report. The Clarke report was also critical of Captain Henderson, who had drunk six pints of lager in the afternoon before the tragedy. There was also criticism of the owners of both vessels. An inquest jury into the disaster returned a verdict of 'unlawful killing'.

"By . Amanda Williams . A wealthy businessman who accidentally killed his four-year-old daughter when he lifted her into the rotor blades of his helicopter took his own life by gassing himself in his Mayfair office, an inquest has heard. Managing director of MFH Helicopters Nicholas Hawkings-Byass, 59, was found dead at his office on March 7 this year, the hearing was told. Westminster Coroner's Court was told that 18 years ago that helicopter enthusiast Mr Hawkings-Byass had taken his son Alexander, and four-year-old daughter Lydia for a flight near to the family’s country home in Gloucestershire. Managing director of MFH Helicopters Nicholas Hawkings-Byass, 59, who accidentally killed his four-year-old daughter when he lifted her into the rotor blades of his helicopter took his own life by gassing himself in his Mayfair office, an inquest has heard . After the flight had landed he was just about to set off again, when his young daughter ran to him and asked to be picked up. She was struck by the rotor blades as he lifted her onto his shoulders. The coroner at the time recorded a verdict of accidental death. But the court heard that Oxford University graduate Mr Hawkings-Byass had to live with the tragedy for the rest of his life. Son Alexander, who saw his sister killed in 1996, was at Westminster Coroner’s Court to hear that his father’s company was not 'making any profit', according to the company secretary of 25 years Sara Macdonald. Coroner Shirley Radcliffe told the inquest: 'The company secretary has said in her statement that there were some financial problems but nothing particularly serious, but personally, the tragic incident with his daughter may have been playing on his mind.' Westminster Coroner's Court was told that 18 years ago that helicopter enthusiast Mr Hawkings-Byass had taken his son Alexander, and four-year-old daughter Lydia for a flight near to the family¿s country home in Gloucestershire . Sara Macdonald described how she found Mr Hawkings-Byass in a statement read to the court. She said: 'I last saw him on March 5th at around 4.30pm and he was alive and well in the office. 'He said he had a cold and was feeling ghastly. I left the office and I thought he would do the same.' The inquest heard how the next day the office door was locked, and his secretary assumed he was at home, but when she received a call from his wife, she became concerned. She continued: 'His wife called and asked where he was. 'His office door was still locked so I called the locksmith out. When he opened the door, I pushed it open and I saw him.' Coroner Radcliffe told the inquest that when paramedics arrived, they did not attempt to resuscitate Mr Hawkings-Byass as they 'recognised he had been dead for some time.' The court heard that Mr Hawkings-Byass, who was a keen sportsman and enjoyed hunting and skiing, had suffered from hepatitis at the time of his death, and was one-and-a-half times over the legal drink-drive limit. She said the amount he had drunk would not 'make him intoxicated enough to not have a clear thought.' The Coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, as Mr Hawkings Byass, of Marlborough, Wiltshire, had left a note addressed to his wife Clare. She told the inquest that there had been a 'hint of depression' and said that due to the note, she was satisfied that Mr Hawkings- Byass intended to kill himself. She said: 'The letter suggest that he had given premeditated thought to his act. There is significant evidence to suggest that he intended to kill himself.' She gave the cause of death as mechanical obstruction of the upper airways. She told his son Alex: 'Please send my condolences to your family and in particular to your mother in such tragic circumstances.'

"By . Associated Press . Eric Garner (pictured) died on July 17 after being put in a choke-hold by an NYPD officer . A New York prosecutor will ask a grand jury to consider charges in the death of a black man placed in an apparent choke-hold by a white police officer, he said today. Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan announced that an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence next month in the July 17 death of Eric Garner. 'I assure the public that I am committed to conducting a fair, thorough and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner's death, and that I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor,' Donovan said in a statement. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, could be heard on an amateur video shouting 'I can't breathe!' as Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in an apparent chokehold. Police said the officers were arresting Garner on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A second video, which appeared to have been shot shortly after Garner was handcuffed, showed him lying on the sidewalk, apparently unresponsive. More than three minutes in, medics arrive and one checks his pulse. Garner is lifted onto a gurney and transported to a waiting ambulance about two minutes later. A bystander asks why no one is performing CPR and one officer responds, 'because he's breathing.' Garner, who had asthma, died a short time later. Donovan said his decision to take the case to a grand jury was based on his office's investigation and the medical examiner's ruling that the death was a homicide caused by neck compressions from the chokehold, chest compression and Garner's prone position while being restrained. Donovan said a court granted his request for the extra grand jury on Monday. He said in a statement that he would make no additional comment about the panel's work, including possible witnesses and charges, to maintain proceedings' secrecy. Eric Garner's body lies in a casket during his funeral at Bethel Baptist Church in the Brooklyn borough of New York on July 23 . Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, was stripped of his gun and badge after Garner's death and another officer was placed on desk duty. Two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians were suspended without pay. Pantaleo's lawyer, Stuart London, said it was too early to say whether his client would testify before the grand jury. 'That's a decision that I weigh very carefully,' London said. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the union expected a grand jury investigation and is encouraged that the process is moving forward. 'We are confident that a fair and impartial grand jury that is allowed to conduct its deliberations based on facts and not emotion or political considerations will see that justice is served,' Lynch said in a statement. Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton plans to lead a march to Donovan's office on Saturday. Protesters are calling for Donovan to file criminal charges or let federal prosecutors take over. Several members of New York's congressional delegation last week echoed the call for the Justice Department to investigate. They questioned whether Donovan, a Republican, could adequately investigate the case given his close working relationship with police and the borough's large population of police officers. Sharpton said he, Garner's family and the family's lawyers will meet Thursday with U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to reiterate their desire for a federal investigation. 'This announcement does not impact our move for federal takeover of this case at all,' Sharpton said in a statement.","Eric Garner, 43, suffered from asthma and stopped breathing after the choke-hold by NYPD .

"By . Jason Groves - Deputy Political Editor, Daily Mail . Billionaire former Tory chairman Lord Ashcroft has released a series of polls carried out in key swing constituencies . Labour is tightening its grip on key election battlegrounds across the country as Tory voters desert to Ukip, according to a major new poll. The survey of eight Tory-held marginal constituencies shows that each one would fall to Labour if an election were held tomorrow. And polling in four Labour-held marginal seats suggests only one would be a close contest, with Labour comfortably holding the other three. The study, conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests David Cameron still has a mountain to climb in order to stay in Number 10 next year. And it suggests that Ed Miliband’s prospects are being boosted by the reluctance of Tory defectors to Ukip to desert Nigel Farage. Just under seven out of 10 people who voted Conservative in 2010 said they would do so again next year. Of the remainder some 17 per cent said they would now vote Ukip. The findings will increase pressure on Mr Cameron to adopt a tougher line on both Europe and immigration in the run-up to the election in a bid to persuade defectors to return to the Tory fold. Mr Miliband receives a further boost from the collapse of the Liberal Democrat vote. Barely a quarter of those who voted Lib Dem last time say they will do so again. Of those who did not almost a third say they will now vote Labour. Lord Ashcroft said the findings ‘confirm my view that it’s going to be close, but the Tories have most to do’. Lord Ashcroft’s research has previously looked at the 12 most marginal Conservative-held seats, where he has found a strong swing to Labour. This time, polling focused on the ‘second tier’ of marginal seats, where Labour needs a bigger swing to win. Voters were polled in Bedford, Carlisle, Dewsbury, Lincoln, Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, Stroud, Warrington South and Weaver Vale. In all eight seats Labour would now win, thanks to an average swing from the Tories of 6.5 per cent. Ukip achieved double-digit support in each of the seats, and attracted support of more than 20 per cent in Carlisle, Dewsbury and Plymouth. The Lib-Dems, by comparison, failed to reach 10 per cent in any of the seats. The polling also revealed that Labour would hold on to three key marginal seats – Bolton West, Birmingham Edgbaston and Hampstead and Kilburn. Only in Southampton Itchen would the Tories run them close. The polling appears to confirm the Tories’ key message that Tory supporters who back Ukip risk putting Mr Miliband into power by the back door. Tory high command plans to hammer home the message ‘Vote Ukip, get Miliband’ next year. But more than two-fifths of Tory defectors (41 per cent) polled in the latest survey ruled out going back to the Conservatives under any circumstances. David Cameron has a mountain to climb to win the next election, according to a survey of marginal constituencies . But despite the apparently gloomy message for Mr Cameron, the new survey contains some cheer for Tory supporters. Despite the average 10-point Labour lead in the marginal seats polled, the majority of voters in these constituencies are either satisfied with Mr Cameron’ s performance (29 per cent) or prefer him to Mr Miliband (29 per cent). Just 31 per cent of voters in these seats (including only two-thirds of Labour voters) would prefer to see the Labour leader in Number 10. In another positive finding, the majority of voters in all twelve seats polled believe the economy will do well for both the country and their own families in the coming year – suggesting that Labour’s focus on the cost of living ‘crisis’ may be running out of steam.","Survey of eight Tory-held marginal seats shows each one falling to Labour .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . and Luke Salked . If you were hoping for a final burst of summer sun, then you might want to lower your expectations. According to forecasters, the season could well have come to an early end – with low temperatures, storms and gales set to sweep across the country. A band of low pressure means colder air is on its way, and there have even been predictions of snow across some areas in the north. Temperatures are expected to fall noticeably over the coming days throughout the country, with most parts of the UK facing a dip down to the low teens, almost five degrees below the average for this time of year. Anyone looking to get out and about on the August bank holiday will have to wrap up warm, as winds of up to 50mph were recorded yesterday, and could continue throughout the week. Desperate for cover: These festival goers sheltered from the rain using the lid of a bin during day two of the V Festival, at Hylands Park in Chelmsford . Taking cover: Festival goers sheltering from the rain during day two of the V Festival, at Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex . Still having fun: Music fans at V Festival at Hylands Park wore ponchos and hid under umbrellas and blankets as they braved the wet weather . The UK’s seaside areas will also see large waves rolling in to batter the coastline. Chief . Met Office forecaster Eddy Carroll said yesterday: ‘While wind gusts . would not be unusual in the autumn and winter, they are likely to pose a . few more problems in the summer holiday period, especially for those . engaged in activities such as sailing or walking.’ He added: ‘Some . minor disruption to transport is possible, for example delays to . ferries, bridge restrictions and perhaps minor damage to trees.’ Despite . a brief let-up towards the end of the week, wet weather is predicted to . return in the middle of the bank holiday weekend. And higher areas of . Scotland could see snow later this week as the low pressure sends a cold . north-westerly wind across much of the country. Areas above 1,300 . metres, such as the Cairngorms and the Munros in the Highlands, could . see flurries of snow arrive a whole month earlier than last year. A . spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘A spell of low pressure sitting . north of Scotland is to blame for the colder temperatures and showers . expected across the UK this week. We’re looking at average or below . average temperatures and the nighttime low could be down to single . figures.’ They added: ‘It’s getting cooler definitely. It’s the end of . summer.’ And former BBC forecaster Michael Fish said: ‘It could well . get cool enough around the middle of the week for some of those showers . to fall as snow on the mountains.

Looking miserable: Music fans shelter under a tree as they attempt to avoid getting a soaking today at V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex . However Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts . offered a more optimistic outlook, saying: ‘Into the bank holiday it . looks like conditions will be returning nearer to normal for the time of . year.’ She went on to stress: ‘We can often see sunny and warm weather to September and beyond.’ Today, music . fans at V Festival at Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex, had to wear ponchos . and hide under umbrellas and blankets as they braved the wet weather. Winds of up to 50mph have already been . recorded in parts of the North West and the Scottish Highlands as the . areas were battered by rain. However . temperatures of 20C (68F) were recorded around London and the South . East. The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for much of the North and Scotland today with gusts of up to 50mph forecast. Coastal areas have been put on alert for ‘large waves’ and meteorologists warned transport links could be hit by disruption. The . blustery and wet conditions are set to continue into the first part of the . week, with yellow ‘be aware’ warnings for wind also in place for today. The mercury is also set to fall well . below the average for late summer and there is even the possibility of . some frost on the ground during the week. Calum . Maccoll, another Met Office spokesman, said there is a ‘very autumnal’ and ‘unseasonably cool’ feel to the conditions in northern areas. High winds: Aircraft landing at Leeds Bradford Airport struggled to land today, crabbing to align with the runway and fight the high crosswind conditions . Not the best day for it: A couple struggle with a tent in the wind on Brighton beach in East Sussex at lunchtime today . Rain: Things are not getting better any time soon, with parts of the UK set for an early taste of winter as high winds sweep in and temperatures plunge .

Despite the wind weather warnings, there are no rain warnings in place for this week. Performers today at V Festival in Essex - an event which also happens in Weston Park, Staffordshire - include The Killers, Paolo Nutini and Lily Allen. Meanwhile, bookmakers Ladbrokes were offering 2/1 for snow to fall somewhere before the end of the Bank Holiday weekend later this month.

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany believes Liverpool could struggle to mount a title challenge like last season given the demands of the Champions League. The Reds were odds-on favourites to win their first English crown in 24 years until a late-season slip allowed City to oust them from top spot. The rivals meet at the Etihad Stadium on Monday night — both opened with victory on Sunday — and they will learn their Champions League group-stage opponents three days later. Scroll down for videos... Things will be different! Vincent Kompany has played down Liverpool's title hopes this season . Slip up: Liverpool had the title race in their hands before falling away in their final few games . Kompany and City have failed to emerge from the first phase in two of the last three seasons, and the Belgian said: ‘When the Champions League comes in it will be a different competition all over for Liverpool — and for all the clubs that are involved in the Champions League because it will get more demanding as the weeks go on.’ City were 2-0 victors at Newcastle on Sunday and Kompany believes it was important to lay winning foundations in the bid to defend their title. ‘Newcastle was important for us because it takes a lot of pressure away from the Liverpool game,’ he said. ‘It is one of the most poisonous away games you can have at the start of the season and we did really well.’ Staying power: Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Sergio Aguero have all signed new contracts at the Etihad . City rewarded David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov and Samir Nasri with new long-term contracts during the summer and are currently in discussions with Edin Dzeko and Joe Hart. And Kompany believes securing the future of his team-mates is worth just as much as bringing in new faces. ‘It is one thing to make new signings but it is another to make sure we have a core of players who know the league and have enjoyed success in the league,’ he said. Kompany missed 10 league matches last season because of injury, but insists he is ready for the physical demands of the campaign ahead. Red hot! Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring in Liverpool's opening league win against Southampton . ‘I feel great,’ he said. ‘That (Newcastle) was the first test for me .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A newborn baby died of severe brain damage after midwives advised his mother to stay at home when she fell desperately ill during labour, an inquest heard. Lewis Booton-White died in his mother Vicki's arms shortly after being born at the Serenity Unit in Birmingham's City Hospital last May. The 24-year-old, from Smethwick, West Midlands, had been vomiting and had unknowingly been bleeding heavily during labour, but was told to stay at home by midwives. Vicki White's newborn son Lewis passed away in her arms after problems occurred during her labour. She had repeatedly informed midwives she was unwell during her labour but told not to attend Birmingham City Hospital . She had been checked out earlier in the day at City Hospital, but was told everything was fine and sent home, the inquest heard. However, her worried mother later called midwives as her daughter was in so much pain that she could not get to the phone - but she was still instructed not to return to hospital. Eventually, her concerned family called an ambulance and she was taken back to the Serenity Birthing Unit, where doctors discovered the unborn baby's heart rate was dropping. Young Lewis was born a short time later but was not breathing and had no heart rate. After being briefly revived by doctors, he was placed on life support. Medics warned Ms White that if her son did survive, he would be left seriously brain damaged. After having Lewis baptised, the devastated mother took the decision to stop his life support and he later died in her arms. The 24-year-old eventually went by ambulance to Birmingham City Hospital (pictured) but Lewis was not breathing when he was born and had no heart rate. He was placed on a life support machine but later died . At an inquest into his death, HM Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict and said: 'Lewis died from acute hypoxia which occurred during labour because he had a small placenta.' The hospital has denied that any alleged staff failings contributed to the death. The hearing was told how Lewis was a small baby and there had been a small placenta but previous scans suggested he was growing within the normal parameters. During an inquest, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital Trust told Ms White (above) that there were no failings that could have caused her son's death . Lawyers acting for Ms White claimed a Serious Incident Report carried out by Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital Trust following the death had highlighted some staff failures. These allegedly included that the midwife team had poor record keeping and the instructions given to the expectant mother about when to return to the unit were not clear. A telephone log should have also been used, it was claimed. Victoria Blankstone, from Irwin Mitchell lawyers, who represented Ms White at the inquest, said: 'Vicki has been left devastated by the death of her baby boy and for the last 15 months has struggled to come to terms with her loss. 'This is a very difficult time for the family and the inquest has gone some way in providing answers to the questions they had about why Lewis died.' Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital Trust offered condolences to Ms White and her family and said an internal investigation had been undertaken with findings provided to the coroner. 'Through this investigation we found that whilst there were some areas that could have been improved, there were no failings that could have caused or contributed to baby Lewis' death,' a spokeswoman said. 'We accept the Coroner's finding that baby Lewis died of acute hypoxia which occurred during labour because of an insufficient placenta.'","Lewis Booton-White died in his mother's arms at Birmingham City Hospital .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . This bizarre CCTV footage shows a pair of thieves stealing a sacred cow - by forcing it bottom-first into the back seat of their tiny hatchback and driving off with it. Watch out! The unsuspecting cow wanders over to the car and is spotted by the passenger . The incident happened in Chennai, India, where cow slaughter is illegal, but these two thieves did not seem to care as they crammed the poor creature into their vehicle to take home for food. Initially, the cow does not seem to out up much of a fight - it wanders over to the car of its own accord before one of the opportunists seizes it two minutes into the video.

The dramatic footage, taken on the rider's head-cam, shows the man cycling along a road in Romford, Essex. A car then pulls across his path - sending him and his bike flying through the air. Scroll down for video . Head-cam footage shows a cyclist riding along a road in Romford, Essex when a car (top) pulls in to his path . In heart-stopping footage, the man can be seen slamming on his breaks as the car pulls in front of him . The unnamed man then crashes down on the bonnet of the car - before sliding off and landing on his feet. Thankfully, he appears to be unscathed - and can be seen back chatting to a roadside witness just seconds after the crash. The footage has been posted on YouTube by the cyclist, known by his username Cycle Jack, who said he was travelling at 22mph along the road when he was hit. The footage has emerged following the deaths of two cyclists on roads in Greater London within a days of each other. The cyclist wrote on YouTube: 'The second time I rode into London in an effort to gain some fitness, rather than take the train ended like this.

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s eldest daughter and her husband have purchased a Sydney mansion for $10.65 million from an Australian rare earth mining magnate. Prue and Alasdair MacLeod, who own retail businesses on the affluent Woollahra village strip, bought the Queen Street property from Lynas Corporation chairman Nick Curtis and wife Angela. The couple, who have been together for 25 years, sold their home in Vaucluse in 2012 and have been renting in the Woollahra area ever since. The lavish property was marketed at close to $12 million in February but was then adjusted to $10 million. Property Observer speculated it sold for around $10.5 million in the June sale based on what was being told to other prospective buyers, but the marginally higher official figure was revealed this week.

The massive block is also home to a separate two bedroom cottage at the property which was marketed as ‘a blue ribbon retreat with comfort and convenience’. In 2010, the MacLeod's discretionary investment trust Wyelba Pty Ltd, spent $4.6 million on the then shop premises of Collette Dinnigan, now Zampatti . A year later, the couple also bought the then Howell and Howell antique premises at 84 Queens Street for $4.25 million, now with Anna Thomas as the tenant. The upper level is run as boutique serviced apartment for tourists.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . Mothers of the bride and groom will be added to marriage registers for the first time, David Cameron announced today. The Prime Minister said the change – the first in 150 years – addressed ‘another inequality in marriage’. The current system, which dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign, only records the fathers’ names. But Mr Cameron said this did not reflect modern Britain. David Cameron, speaking at the Relationships Alliance Summit at the Royal College of GP's in central London this morning, said mothers should be included on the marriage register . Marriage certificates in England and Wales only record the names of  couples fathers  - not mothers . He said Britain had recently sent a ‘powerful message’ by legalising gay marriage but needed to go further. It comes after tens of thousands of campaigners signed a petition calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates. There is space for the name of the father of the bride and the father of the groom and their occupations . Today, Mr Cameron said: 'We're going to address another inequality in marriage too. 'The content of marriage registers in England and Wales has not changed since the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. 'At the moment, they require details of the couples' fathers but not their mothers. 'This clearly doesn't reflect modern Britain – and it's high time the system was updated. So I have asked the Home Office to look at how we can address this too.' The petition calling for mothers’ names to be included on the certificate, published on the campaigning website change.org, appeals for a move away from the view in which marriage is seen as ‘a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom’. The last change to the marriage register rules took place during the reign of Queen Victoria, the Prime Minister said today . Currently, in England and Wales, marriage certificates include space for the name of the Father of the Bride and the Father of the Groom, with separate boxes allocated to each of their occupations. The mothers of the happy couple are excluded from this official documentation. Civil partnership certificates, as well as Scottish and Northern Irish marriage certificates, do supply room for the names of the bride and groom's mothers. According to the petitioner, the lack of mothers' names on marriage certificates in England and Wales ‘is part of a much wider pattern of inequality. Women are routinely silenced and written out of history.’ The format of the English and Welsh marriage certificate has remained unchanged since the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1837. Mr Cameron’s announcement that mothers’ names would be added to the marriage certificate came in a speech in central London this morning in which he called for more to be done to help families. Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the speech, he insisted he was not judging single parents and couples who split up by praising traditional families. He said single parents did ‘an absolutely brilliant job in bringing up children’. He added: ‘There are some cases where it is better for parents to split up. ‘I wouldn't for one minute want to stop that. But where you can help people come together and stay together, then surely the government should play its part.’ Government figures also show Britain has 500,000 ‘troubled families’, costing the state more than £30billion a year. He announced there would be a new ‘family friendly test’, to ensure every new policy does not damage family life.","PM says only recording fathers' names does not reflect modern Britain .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . An egg that was sent by a schoolgirl to troops in World War One and then returned to her in one piece has been discovered intact after 100 years. Vida Sheppard from Frome, Somerset was 13 when in 1915, as part of a school project, she posted a hen's egg as a present for soldiers fighting in the trenches of the Western Front. The youngster scrawled on the shell in pen her name, her school and a message which read: 'Health and luck to dear Tommy Atkins, God bless him'. Tommy Atkins was the slang term for soldier. This is the remarkable egg which Vida Sheppard sent to a random British soldier serving on the Western Front on 1915, the solider Ernest Devall ate the contents before returning the shell along with a note for the youngster . Vida Sheppard, pictured, was 13 when she sent the decorated egg as part of a school project to France in 1915 . Pte Devall, who was serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps returned the eaten egg in a tobacco tin . Several months later she received a package in the post containing a tobacco tin and, to her amazement, inside was her egg, minus the yolk. The shell was signed by a Private E Devall, who had written his address as 'somewhere in France' and added 'returned with thanks.' Accompanying the egg was a touching note from Private Devall, a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps, thanking her for the present and explaining his reasons for returning it. In the letter, dated May 23 1915, Private Devall said he had sent the egg back as a 'souvenir of this terrible war' but only after eating its contents which he said he 'enjoyed very much'. The letter continued: 'I hope that in the near future the Allies will be victorious. I must conclude thanking you for your kind wishes and please accept the same from me in return.' Vida stuffed the egg with cotton wool to prevent it from breaking. After the war she married Samuel French and the pair lived in Frome, Somerset. The egg was kept in her husband's smoking cabinet and on her death in 1977 it passed to her son Brian French. The amazing tale has been told for the first time in a new book by Paul Atterbury, an expert on the Antiques Roadshow. The youngster kept the egg and the note until she died in 1977 when it passed on to her son Brian French . Vida Sheppard, left, pictured with her father Walter, centre and mother Margaret during the First World War . The book, called 'Antiques Roadshow: World War One in 100 Family Treasures,' highlights stories that came to light in the making of the programme's WWI centenary episodes but never made it to air. Mr French, 83, a retired civil engineer from Guildford, Surrey, said: 'The egg was always about in the house when I was a boy. I knew it was there but mum never talked about it. 'It was kept in my dad's smoking cabinet and remember taking it out and looking at it then putting it back again but I never really got the full story. 'It was obvious that my mother had written on an egg, send it off and received it back again but we never really talked about it. 'We think she had been asked to take the egg into school to be sent off to the soldiers because eggs were rationed. 'It was meant to be a morale booster for the troops. 'She wrote her name and school on the eggshell as well as a message saying ""Health and luck to dear Tommy Atkins God bless him"". 'Amazingly the soldier who received the egg then sent the shell back in a tin along with a letter back thanking her for her gift. 'I've always wondered whether he survived the war. Private Ernest Devall deployed  on August 24, 1914 with the Royal Army Medical Corps  according to his medal card held by the National Archives in Kew, where he served with the No12 General Hospital in Rouen, France . 'As I child I never really registered the significance of the eggshell - it was just something that was in the house. 'It's amazing to think now where this egg has been. It is incredible really that the egg shell has survived all this time. 'I'm very proud of it and it will continue to be passed on through our family.' Private Ernest Devall, deployed on August 24, 1914 with the Royal Army Medical Corps to the No 12 General Hospital which was based in Rouen race track in northern France. According to his medal card, Private Devall was awarded a 1914 star for enlisting at the start of the war. He was later awarded the British and Victory medals. He was later awarded a Silver War Badge which indicates that he was discharged from the army. Unfortunately, it seems many of Private Devall's records may have been destroyed in 1940, but the lack of any notes in the remarks section of his medal card indicates that he survived. According to the Washington University School of Medicine RAMC General Hospital No 12, where Private Devall served was one first deployed to France at the outbreak of the war. The injured service men were treated in tents while administrators used the permanent buildings and offices. Only 60 beds out of 1,300 were contained within a wooden structure. The rest were under canvas, which regularly froze solid in winter. Private Devall's hospital was one of the main receiving units for victims from the Battle of the Somme. After patients were stabalised, they were sent down the River Seine and back to England for recovery. Royal Army Medical Corps General Hospital No 12, pictured, was one of the first medical units deployed to France in August 1914, within a fortnight of the conflict's outbreak where it dealt with thousands of casualties .","Vida Sheppard from Frome Somerset sent the egg as a school project .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell was elected MP for Great Grimsby in 1977 but will step down at the next election . The growing number of female MPs in the Labour party is making it too ‘gentle’ to wield power after the next election, a veteran MP has said. Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby, said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘amenable and leadable’ women obsessed with feminism. Mr Mitchell, 79, who is stepping down at the next election, said Labour was becoming more ‘family-friendly, gentler’ but ‘less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind’. He also hit out at Labour’s so-called ‘red princes’ – who he dismissively referred to as ‘the scions of our great dynasties, the Kinnocks, the Straws, the Benns, the Blairs’. He said they were the only ones allowed to bypass all-women shortlists. Labour introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female Labour MPs - 81 out of 257. The veteran MP said the party’s new ‘preoccupations’ will be ‘social, educational and family issues’ which have all been ‘brought to the fore by the feminisation of Labour through the obsession with All-Women’s Shortlists’, . Mr Mitchell said all-women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as Yorkshire and the North as a form of punishment ‘for their earlier male chauvinism’. He said: ‘It cannot be denied that feminisation and youthification will make Parliament brighter, smarter and nicer. ‘Yet the Commons will also be more preoccupied with the local rather than the international (not necessarily a bad thing) and small problems rather than big ideas and issues (a very bad thing as it will be less exciting and lead to sixth-form essays read out word for cut-and-pasted word, replacing oratory). ‘The Left will be even smaller but the party more manageable and reasonable, for apart from obsessive feminism, women MPs are more amenable and leadable and less objectionable. But it might not make us tougher. ‘If Labour wins in 2015, how a family-friendly, gentler party, less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind, will face up to Tory hooligans who feel they’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that’s their due, is a more worrying matter.’ Almost half of Labour's cabinet are women and Ed Miliband is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today. Labour's leading women, pictured here, from left back row: Caroline Flint, Angela Eagle, Maria Eagle, Rosie Winterton, Emily Thornberry, Margaret Curran, Baronness Royall. Front row: Rachel Reeves, Liz Kendal, Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Tessa Jowell . Mr Mitchell said the parliamentary party was undergoing ‘the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day’. But he added: ‘Whatever the state of Labour’s policies for the next Election, there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger, more attractive body of candidates. The 79-year-old also said ageism was ‘rampant’ in Parliament. He said the Lords was being used as a ‘marvellous political retirement home’. But he said: ‘Neither the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] nor the Commons are good places for oldies with any ambition.’","MP says number of female MPs in the Labour party is making it too 'gentle'

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . Diana, Princess of Wales' former chef has attacked her brother Earl Spencer for what he calls the neglect of her final resting place at his Althorp Estate in Northamptonshire. Darren McGrady, who cooked for Diana as well as the Queen has posted several photographs of the memorial on Twitter, showing the lake near her grave covered in algae. However, the estate has maintained that her burial site is being well looked after, saying the hot summer months had caused the algae to spread quickly, making it more difficult to remove - and that this has been a widespread problem for waterways across the country. Scroll down for video . Former Royal Chef Darren McGrady, centre, said he was disappointed by the state of Diana's Althorp memorial . In a series of emotional Tweets, Mr McGrady implored Earl Spencer to remove the algae around the memorial . A spokesperson for Althorp said a team regularly cleans the lake but the algae is a problem in hot weather . Taking to Twitter, Mr McGrady said: 'If I cared for Princess Diana in life as you are doing in death I would have been fired. 'Please tidy up the vegetation on the island.' Posting photographs after apparently visiting the site, he added: 'Made me so sad to see how Althorp Estate has neglected Princess Diana's resting place.' The exact spot where the the princess is buried is secret for security reasons, but a memorial to the mother-of-two was located on a small island in the middle of a lake. Visitors pay £18 to visit the house and 14,000-acre estate and can lay flowers at a specially constructed temple near the island, with thousands visiting every year to pay their respects. Gardeners . and contractors have been battling to control the spread of algae in . Round Oval lake, and after taking advice from experts have taken measures such as placing bales of barley in the water. Some . 2,000 carp have also been introduced into the lake in the hope they . will eat the algae blooms, which are almost impossible to completely . eradicate. Siblings: Earl Spencer (left) with his sister Diana (center) on Prince Charles' (right) 21st birthday . Earl Spencer, right, arriving at his sister's memorial with former South African President Nelson Mandela . Diana was buried in her childhood home of Althorp in Northamptonshire, pictured, following her death . 'Algae is an unsightly problem for many lakes in the summer months,' a spokesman from the Althorp Estate told MailOnline. 'Althorp employs contractors to deal with what is a highly invasive and fast-growing weed on a regular basis, and the Althorp gardeners also tackle it as part of their summer programme - the exceptional temperatures of this summer have made the task of keeping it entirely under control extremely difficult.' The spokesman added that the gravesite's security and maintenance were dealt with by Earl Spencer 'with matchless care', and that he takes his responsibility for the site 'extremely seriously'. Algae has been a common sight across many of the UK's waterways this summer. Blooms can be caused by a combination of soaring temperatures and sharp downpours. Algae blooms are more prevalent in very sunny spots. The chef spent 11 years working Buckingham Palace but left the Royal household after Diana's divorce from Prince Charles in 1996. He then went to work for Diana in Kensington Palace. Mr McGrady is now living and working in Texas and has written  cookery books featuring recipes enjoyed by the royals. Earlier, McGrady paid a visit to the Paris underpass where Diana died following a high speed car crash . In the hours after Diana's death, several rows erupted between the Queen, Prince Charles and Earl Spencer. The Queen, it was reported, did not want Diana's remains brought to any royal palace upon their return from Paris. Prince Charles went to France to accompany his ex-wife's body back to the country. In a  misjudgement of public opinion, the Queen initially refused to cut short her annual holiday in Balmoral . It is understood that Prime Minister Tony Blair had to mediate. However, Diana's mother Frances Shand Kydd and a spokesman for Buckingham Palace later denied reports of any row, describing it as 'a rag-bag of nonsensical speculation'. Downing Street and Earl Spencer also denied any rift. The Queen wanted any funeral to be a private affair, however, the public demanded a major ceremony to allow them to pay tribute. Earl Spencer then decided that Diana should be buried on the Althorp estate rather than committed to family's crypt in the church in Great Bington because of security concerns.","Darren McGrady spent 11 years working in Buckingham Palace .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Extremist: New BNP leader Adam Walker, who received a suspended sentence and a driving ban last year after chasing down three boys aged between ten and twelve in his car, before slashing their bike tyres with a knife . Nick Griffin has been ousted as leader of the British National Party after 15 years and replaced by a disgraced former teacher. Griffin – who received a  suspended sentence for distributing material likely to incite racial hatred in 1998 – was a Euro-MP but lost his seat in May and recently declared himself bankrupt. He was forced out at a meeting of his party’s national executive. As well as losing his Euro seat, the BNP have lost all but two of their local councillors this year. The far-right party have replaced him with former teacher Adam Walker, who received a suspended sentence and a driving ban last year after chasing three boys aged between ten and 12 in his car, before slashing their bike tyres with a knife in 2011. Walker, from Spennymoor, County Durham, claimed they had provoked him. He was later banned from teaching for life by former education secretary Michael Gove. Last year, as a BNP organiser, he described Britain as a ‘multicultural s***hole’. He claimed that British people were being ‘ethnically cleansed’ by excessive immigration and claimed that Lee Rigby-style executions would ‘become  the norm’. A party spokesman said yesterday: ‘Recently appointed deputy chairman, Adam Walker, has accepted the role of acting chairman of the British National Party after Nick Griffin stepped aside at a meeting of the BNP national executive held on 19th July, 2014. Nick Griffin has taken up the position of president.’ The party’s support has plummeted in recent years. It won more than 6 per cent of the national vote in the 2009 European election, but just 1 per cent in May this year. The BNP blamed its poor performance in the polls on the rise of Ukip, which it said had become the party of choice for protest votes about Europe and immigration. Mr Griffin ¿ who received a suspended sentence for distributing material likely to incite racial hatred in 1998 ¿ was an MEP but lost his seat in May and recently declared himself bankrupt . Griffin . went to Cambridge University in 1977, where he studied history and law . at Downing  College. While there, he founded the Young National Front . Students and gained a boxing blue. He joined the BNP in 1995 and ousted John Tyndall as leader four years later. In 1998, . he was convicted of inciting racial hatred after he was found . distributing material saying the massacre of six million Jews in the . Holocaust was a hoax. He received a suspended prison sentence. The party went on to win council seats in Oldham, Burnley  and Bradford. The BNP . won more than 500,000 votes at the 2010 general election, up from . 192,000 in 2005. Griffin, 55, was elected an MEP in 2009 for the North . West of England and lost his seat in May this year. At their . height in 2006, the BNP capitalised on tensions over immigration in .

'Lewis didn't let me by although he was ordered to so, so that's obviously not good, and we need to discuss that internally,' said Rosberg. The German still leads the championship, but he saw his gap reduced to 11 points after Hamilton managed to finish one place higher than pole-sitter Rosberg despite starting from the pits. Rosberg held a 10-second lead in the opening phase of Sunday's race before a safety car was deployed following Marcus Ericsson's crash in the wet conditions. I'll drink to that: Lewis Hamilton finished third in Sunday's race despite starting from the pit lane . Rosberg lost time behind the safety car, which saw Hamilton leapfrog him at the first round of pit-stops. The 29-year-old has since questioned the timing of its deployment. 'The safety car, the way it came out was just wrong I think from the race officials,' added Rosberg. 'They sent it out at the wrong time and I got stuck behind it. 'You are supposed to do this average speed, slow lap but I got stuck behind it. It was slow so all those guys got by me and that is not supposed to be the case, so that was the main problem.' Blow: Rosberg was leading Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix until the deployment of the safety car . Rosberg then rued an issue with his brakes which saw him lose two places in the immediate aftermath of the first safety car period. He was also left disappointed that he failed to pass Hamilton on the final lap despite being presented with an opportunity to pass the Briton after he locked up heading into Turn 2. 'The thing I am most annoyed about is the last lap because I had a little opportunity – just so close but I didn't manage to do it – 30 centimetres missing or something,' he added. 'What he [Hamilton] did was OK, the way he defended, because the guy on the inside it is his corner so the guy on the outside needs to make it far enough in front that the other guy can't push him out and he managed to do that and that is what annoyed me most.'","Hamilton controversially defied team orders in Hungary race .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Tens of thousands of homes across Australia are not getting their rubbish collected after the country’s largest waste management firm has grounded its entire fleet. Transpacific has called an urgent safety audit of its 2,800 vehicles following one of the company’s trucks smashing into three stationary cars killing a man and a woman, and critically injuring two others, including the truck driver in Adelaide on Monday. The Queensland-based company, which has more than 100 municipal contracts in almost every state, confirmed most services would be delayed by 24 hours this week, while some services had completely stopped. Most rubbish removal operations were expected to be back to normal by Monday. Scroll down for video . A Transpacific truck smashed into three stationary cars killing a man and a woman, and critically injuring two others, including the truck driver in Adelaide on Monday . The accident has prompted truck company Transpacific to pull all 2,800 of its fleet off the road to conduct safety audits . The areas have been affected in almost every state including five suburbs in Darwin, the three Victorian cities of Benalla, Geelong and Melbourne and at least two Adelaide councils along with some regional South Australian areas, the ABC reported. Western Australia is one of the hardest hit with tens of thousands of homes in Perth and the state’s south-west services have also ground to a halt. Transpacific spokeswoman Megan Taylor told the ABC it was unclear how long the fleet would be grounded in WA. ‘The vehicle will need to be deemed safe before they can return to the road,’ she said. ‘In the meantime, there will be no rubbish collections.’ Queensland will also suffer from the safety audit including Cairns, Rockhampton and the Somerset Regional Council. The collection stoppage will also affect Sydney residents in Parramatta, Hornsby, Bankstown, Ashfield, Canterbury, Hawkesbury, and the Hill Shire council regions. The incident in question occurred late Monday afternoon, when a garbage truck ploughed into three stationary cars that were stopped at traffic lights at the intersection of the South Eastern Freeway and Cross Road in Adelaide. A 56 year-old male driver of one of the cars was killed, while two female drivers aged 41 and 49, and the 28 year-old male truck driver were taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a critical condition. The 41 year-old woman passed away on Tuesday evening. Police are investigating whether brake failure or speed played a part in the incident while Transpacific said the truck driver had undergone thorough safety training. The Queensland-based company has more than 100 municipal contracts in almost every state across the country . Transport Workers Union secretary Tony Sheldon said truck driving was Australia's most dangerous job with 330 people killed every year in crashes . TWU national secretary Tony Sheldon said Transpacific's decision to ground its fleet was further evidence of the economic pressure imposed by clients on transport companies and their drivers. Mr Sheldon said truck driving was Australia's most dangerous job with 330 people killed every year in crashes. 'That pressure is killing truck drivers, and its killing motorists and pedestrians,' he said. He said economic pressure on drivers could be addressed through action in the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, a national safety watchdog which sets safe rates of pay and conditions in heavy vehicle transport. Meanwhile, Sue Posnakidis released a statement, on behalf of the family of John Posnakidis, who died in October 2010 in a crash on the South Eastern Freeway, requesting that media desist from seeking further interviews following that latest tragedy out of respect for the family’s privacy. 'We are devastated by the further loss of lives and injuries suffered as a result of the collision on the South Eastern freeway on Monday. This revives traumatic memories for our family.' 'Our hearts and prayers go out to all the families involved. We are hopeful that the findings and recommendations of the Deputy Coroner will assist in stopping these horrific tragedies from happening yet again,' she said. 'At John's inquest Mr Schapel said that this will happen again, and it has. It has to stop. Truck drivers and motorists need to be protected and safe on the freeway. We don't want John's life and the others lost on Monday and in recent years to be lost in vain.'","Tens of thousands of homes in Australia are not getting rubbish collected .

Disgrace: Former soldier Lauren Dobbs, 23, who risked her life detecting explosives in Afghanistan, has been left homeless after being denied council housing . Private Dobbs said: 'I think it is just ridiculous - I am very annoyed but there is nothing I can do. 'It is completely unfair. I have colleagues in the Army who have had to rejoin, or have not been able to leave, because they have not been homed.' Private Dobbs spent six years in the Army, and was a military dog handler in the Vet Corps - a job involving handling specialist dogs capable of detecting arms and explosives. Six months after leaving the armed forces she claims her plans for a new independent life are being scuppered by the failure of Bromley Council, in Kent, to find her a new home. Furious: Private Dobbs has been instead offered a bed at a night shelter - but only if the temperature falls below freezing . Fortunately Ms Dobbs, who is . currently studying to be a personal trainer, has been able to stay with . her mother, but she has been angered by the council's failure to look . after her. She added: 'I left because I wanted to move on and do other things. 'The Army was what I had always wanted to do and after that the personal training. I think it should be a higher pay band. 'The fact you are paid as much as you are makes it harder when you leave.' Her mother, Michelle Lynn, 47, of Biggin Hill, said: 'My daughter's friends have had their limbs blown off, they have been killed and this is all the council can do. 'It is not good enough. My daughter was fighting for her country. 'It is disgraceful that they treat someone who fights for their country like this. 'When soldiers leave the army they cannot afford a mortgage, their wages are atrocious - what are they supposed to do?' Bromley Council said: 'It is not appropriate to discuss someone's individual circumstances but we can confirm our approach is to work with a person faced with homelessness and with their families to help prevent this happening. 'This includes giving advice and guidance and helping them look at the different housing options available. 'We work with a person to establish their circumstances and whether they are priority need under existing housing legislation.'","Lauren Dobbs offered bed at night shelter - only if temperature plummets .

"By . Emma Innes . A dangerously ill teenage boy was told he had an anxiety disorder and depression for more than a year before doctors finally realised he was actually suffering from liver failure. Shockingly, David Acott, 16, only received an accurate diagnosis after he was rushed to hospital suffering from acute liver failure with yellow eyes and bloody urine. By the time he was finally found to have liver failure, he was dangerously ill and had to have a life-saving transplant within a week of his diagnosis. David Acott, 16, was told for more than a year that he had depression and anxiety before doctors eventually realised that he actually had liver failure. He is pictured with his sister just days before his diagnosis . His mother, Janet Acott, 47, from North Norfolk, told MailOnline: ‘The speed of it was mind-blowing – to go in seven days from him being okay and having “depression” to getting a new liver. ‘But, it was good to know there was a reason he was feeling so awful.’ When David was 13 he started to show signs of depression. He started to vomit in the mornings and not to want to go to school. He had recently lost his grandmother and moved house and school so his mother and doctors thought he was suffering from depression. His condition gradually got worse until he was missing a lot of school and was often too ill to get out of bed. Ms Acott, a . primary school teacher, said: ‘He would get so upset before school he would be sick. He was in an awful state and he was just . not engaging with life.’ David saw a counsellor and was then prescribed antidepressants which finally caused his condition to improve slightly. David was only diagnosed when he turned yellow and had to be placed in an induced coma in hospital while waiting for an emergency liver transplant . David (pictured with his mother, Janet) now knows that his depression and anxiety were caused by his underlying liver condition which meant copper was building up in his body . His mother said: ‘He was so desperate to be better and it seemed to improve. We thought we had finally cracked it.’ Ms Acott says that, at this point, she believed her son was suffering from depression and anxiety as it never crossed her mind that there could be another underlying cause for his illness. However, everything changed just after David finished school for the year in July 2012. During the first week of the holidays the family went on a caravan holiday. Ms . Acott says that before they left she noticed that David’s stomach was . slightly swollen but that she did not think a lot of it. Wilson's disease is a disorder which causes the body to have higher than normal levels of copper. An overload of copper is poisonous and can cause damage to the liver, brain and other organs. The copper overload is caused by a genetic defect that prevents the liver from being able to metabolise copper. If Wilson's disease is diagnosed early enough it can be treated effectively. But, if it is not treated, it is always fatal. The build up of copper in the liver causes cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. In the brain, it can lead to confusion, tremors and clumsiness. It can also cause personality changes, anxiety, depression, psychosis and suicidal thoughts. In extreme cases, patients may require a life-saving liver transplant. Source: British Liver Trust . She told MailOnline: ‘It was the sort of thing only a mother would notice. I didn’t think much of it but as his mum I noticed it.’ She explained that a few days later, he was very sick and vomited repeatedly but that she was not overly concerned because he had a history of being sick in the mornings so it was not particularly unusual. However, when he returned from the holiday his eyes started to turn yellow. Ms Acott took him straight to the doctors where a urine sample was taken and she was horrified to see that it was red with blood. The next day he had blood tests and was sent straight to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. Doctors at the local hospital were so worried that they had him transferred to King’s College Hospital, in London, within hours of arriving. Ms Acott says that once they arrived at King's, doctors spent 24 hours attempting to establish what was wrong with David before eventually diagnosing him with Wilson’s disease.

But, if it is not treated, it is always fatal. The build-up of copper in the liver causes cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. In the brain, it can lead to confusion, tremors and clumsiness. It can also cause personality changes, anxiety, depression, psychosis and suicidal thoughts. Ms Acott said: ‘When we were given the diagnosis and looked up the condition it suddenly all clicked and everything made sense.’ Since his transplant, David (pictured with his mother, Janet) has made a full recovery and is running triathlons . She was told David would need an emergency liver transplant and as he was becoming delirious he was put in an induced coma. Incredibly, because he was put on a super-urgent transplant list, he was given a transplant just 48 hours later. His mother said: ‘We feel blessed that he got a liver. It’s the ultimate gift and he wouldn’t have survived otherwise. ‘His condition was critical – he was being kept alive by machines.’ She added: ‘We were lucky in a way as we never lived with Wilson’s disease and he now no longer has it because the transplant was effectively a cure. ‘It has all worked out of the best really – although losing your own liver is traumatic he was lucky not to have to live with the disease. David (pictured before his illness) no longer has Wilson's disease as the transplant acted as a cure . ‘Now I just feel sad that he has missed out on a normal teenage-hood.’ David spent a month at King’s College Hospital before he was well enough to be transferred back to his local hospital. While he was in London his parents were offered accommodation close to the hospital by Ronald McDonald House Camberwell. The house has 24 en-suite bedrooms as well as a kitchen and garden and it offers free accommodation to the families of children being treated at King’s College Hospital. It can provide accommodation for any length of time – some parents say just for a few days while others stay for a year. Ms Acott said: ‘They were fantastic – they provided a room in the hospital and then they provided a little flat. Ms Acott says she is not angry at David's misdiagnosis but that she is just sad that he missed out on having a normal teenage-hood. David is pictured (right) before his illness with his brother, Howard . ‘It was so important – it gave us a home in London.’ David is now much better – he has to take anti-rejection medication but he has taken part in a triathlon and is at college. Ms Acott told MailOnline: ‘He is trying to build-up his fitness now. ‘The illness has made him a different person – since the operation he is much happier and a nicer person to do things with. ‘Hopefully that is because his body is no longer poisoning itself so he feels better.'

"By . Simon Jones for the Daily Mail . Manchester United will offer a new contract to Tom Cleverley this week. The 25-year-old, who missed United’s opening Barclays Premier League game on Saturday due to illness, has been the target of abuse from certain sections of United’s support who cite him as an example of the club’s fall in standards. Yet the central midfielder’s attitude and determination in the face of such criticism has drawn admiration from senior figures within the club, not least from new manager Louis van Gaal. New deal: Tom Cleverley is to be offered a contract extension by Manchester United this week . Staking his claim: Cleverley challenges Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during a pre-season match in Miami . Cleverley was handed the captaincy for the pre-season friendly with Roma and Van Gaal sees his versatility and short passing game as qualities that can fit into his system. Although Cleverley is not necessarily first choice, Van Gaal wants him to stay and the player is keen to extend a current deal that has one year left to run. Everton manager Roberto Martinez has a strong interest in £10million-rated Cleverley and will consider a bid should the two parties fail to reach an agreement, but following preliminary talks United will offer a three-year extension on terms of around £70,000 per week. Midfield general: Cleverley has been given a second chance by new United manager Louis Van Gaal . Second chance: Van Gaal wants Cleverley to remain at Old Trafford despite poor performances last season . Meanwhile, Sporting Lisbon are interested in taking United winger Nani on loan. The Portuguese came on as a substitute at half time yesterday but he is one of a number of players thought to be on his way out of Old Trafford, and Sporting want to give him the chance to play regularly. United are continuing negotiations over a deal for Sporting defender Marcos Rojo.

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Very few saw the funny side when West Brom’s Saido Berahino was filmed inhaling laughing gas last season. But the England hopeful was back to putting smiles on faces with two goals on the opening day of the season. His breakthrough campaign had included a hat-trick on his full debut and an England Under 21 call, only to end with the ‘hippy crack’ controversy and team-mates blaming him for the surrender of a last-minute lead against relegation rivals Cardiff. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Second half reaction pleasing - Poyet . Back with a bang: Saido Berahino scored twice as West Brom drew 2-2 with Sunderland on the opening day . Spot on: Berahino strokes home a penalty just before half-time for the first of his two goals . Sunderland have not won on the opening day since Darren Bent scored the only goal at Bolton in 2009. West Brom, however, survived, and so did Berahino. And on Saturday he delivered a reminder as to the talent which sees him touted as a future full international. The 21-year-old converted a first-half penalty – cancelling out Lee Cattermole’s early stunner - and volleyed a second after the break before Seb Larsson salvaged a late draw for the visitors. But Berahino – pacey, problematic and potent - had been the game’s best player and insists last season’s travails served an invaluable lesson. ‘I have learned a lot,’ he said when asked about inhaling the legal high and the dressing-room bust following Cardiff. ‘It’s made me a better player and a better person off the field. I am more aware of stuff that goes on in and around football, so it’s made me a much better and stronger person. Letting fly: Lee Cattermole unleashes the shot that gave Sunderland an early lead at The Hawthorns . Opener: Cattermole (right) is joined by team-mates John O'Shea (left) and Jack Rodwell to celebrate . Salvaged: Sebastian Larsson scored late on to rescue an opening day point for Sunderland . ‘(Cardiff) is in the past and everyone has moved on. We drew a line under it straight after the game and we’re all just looking forward to this season.’ New Baggies boss Alan Irvine has had no issues with Berahino – who fled war-torn Burundi aged 10 after his father was killed – and expects him to remain at The Hawthorns this season. ‘I have not had to talk to him about his discipline. I was aware of (his problems) as they were well documented,’ said the Scot, who swapped Everton’s academy for the Premier League dugout in June. ‘Saido has been a model professional. What happens in the past, people make some bad decisions at different times, we have all done it. ‘But he is a pleasure to work with. I hope he doesn’t feel the need to pursue a career beyond here. He could be a top player. He has got so much talent.’ 'Model professional': Baggies boss Alan Irvine was full of praise for Berahino and his performance . The respect is mutual, as Berahino added: ‘Outsiders might see him (Irvine) as a surprise choice but he’s a really good coach and from the first day he came in he’s had us all working together as a unit and he’s got everyone back to happiness. ‘So we are all just working together great and we’re lucky to have him because he’s a good man and a good coach.’ Sunderland, meanwhile, had new dad Larsson to thank for rescuing a deserved point five minutes from time. The 29-year-old Swede – whose wife gave birth a baby girl last week – climaxed a swift breakaway from close range after debutants Jordi Gomez and Patrick van Aanholt had combined. The Black Cats won four of their final five games to escape the drop last season but Larsson feels there is renewed optimism under Gus Poyet. VIDEO Second half reaction pleasing - Poyet . Good week: Larsson became the father to a baby girl this week and celebrated accordingly . England hopes: Jack Rodwell, who made his debut for Sunderland, is hoping for an international recall . ‘I’m pretty confident that we’re not going to be in trouble this season,’ he said. ‘I’ve really been looking forward to this season – more than for any other in a long time. I just feel that we’re going places.’ Poyet handed a debut to £10million Jack Rodwell – who hopes to win an England recall this month – but he was subdued and was replaced midway through the second half. On this evidence, it is Berahino who you’d back for a place in Roy Hodgson’s Three Lions squad.","Saido Berahino scored twice as West Brom drew with Sunderland .

Ibe knows the Championship after a loan spell with Birmingham last season and was part of the team that avoided relegation on the final day after a dramatic draw with Bolton at the Reebok. The England Under 19 star has featured for Liverpool in pre-season, impressing against AC Milan and coming on against Borussia Dortmund and his style of play is similar to Sterling's. He made his Wycombe debut at just 15 and 244 days and is the club's youngest ever player in the Football League. He joined LIverpool aged 16 for an undisclosed fee.

China's economic growth slowed unexpectedly in the first three months of the year, causing panic to grip financial traders worldwide and the price of gold to plummet to its lowest point in more than two years. The world's second-largest economy grew by 7.7 per cent over a year earlier, down from the previous quarter's 7.9 per cent, and short of hopes for about 8 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 155 points, approximately one per cent, by about 1:30 p.m. today. The Nasdaq average was down more than 50 points, more than one and a half per cent. Traders on Wall Street sold in a panic following news of slower-than-expected growth in China during the first quarter . The Standard & Poor's 500 index . slumped 18 points to 1,570, a loss of 1.2 percent. Of the 10 industry . groups in the S&P 500, materials and energy stocks fared the worst, . sliding 3 percent. The FTSE 100 Index in London slumped 72.1 . points to 6312.3, with fears over Chinese demand causing mining stocks . to fall by as much as 13 per cent. By 12.45pm, the index was down 74.08 . at 6310.31. A recovery still is under way but is 'really very soft - very slow and gradual,' said Societe Generale economist Wei Yao. Financial markets around the world dropped after news of China's slower-than-expected growth was announced . Frank Fantozzi, CEO of Planned Financial Services, a wealth management firm, said: 'I think you're getting some panic selling right now. 'People who have been holding on to gold expecting a rebound are now thinking, ""I better get out.'"" Analysts have warned that China's recovery from its deepest slump since the 2008 global crisis is weak and is being supported by bank lending and government-led investment, while growth in consumer spending is subdued. A slowdown in Chinese growth and demand for goods ranging from iron ore to factory technology and consumer goods could send out ripples in the global economy. The price of gold dropped by more than $30 in a matter of minutes at one point this morning. Shortly before noon, the gold spot price was down almost 9 per cent today, at $1,370 per ounce. Besides the disappointing news in China, Gold is already under pressure from a . variety of factors including a proposed sale of Cypriot gold holdings . and disappointing U.S. numbers last week. Investors slashed their exposure to . commodities, with oil, copper and silver falling hard and fast. Oil fell . nearly three per cent, silver dropped 10 per cent, and industrial . metals plummeted, with copper hitting its lowest in over a year. In the . grains market, wheat, corn and soybeans were all down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped more than 177 points by 2 p.m. today, more than a full per cent point . In gold, 'what we now see is panic selling, perhaps triggered by the Fed's stimulus view. 'The Fed has given . the signal that there's a possibility to reduce QE (quantitative . easing), and that took a lot of trust out of gold,' said Dominic . Schnider, an analyst at UBS Wealth Management. 'And people recognise that an environment where you have no inflation is a powerful driver to get out of the metal.' Investment bank Goldman Sachs said last week that the price of gold could weaken further. The . warning came days after French bank Societe Generale put out a report . called The End Of The Gold Era, predicting gold would keep sliding this . year and next. 'If you . want to be worried about China, there's plenty to keep you awake at . night,' said Sean Corrigan, chief investment strategist at Diapason . Commodities Management in Switzerland. They are trying to avoid job losses while they pursue more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption instead of exports and investment. Falling value: Investors are selling commodities - including gold, silver and copper - today on fears over China's growth. Gold dropped to its lowest price in more than two years as it dropped below $1,400 . The latest quarterly growth was above Beijing's official target of 7.5 per cent for the year. That is well above forecasts in the low single digits for Western economies and Japan but far from China's blistering growth of the past decade. Recent economic data in China has given mixed signals, raising questions about whether a full-fledged recovery was gaining traction. The Chinese government had hoped for 8 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2013 . Inflation fell in March, indicating consumer demand might not be as strong as Beijing hoped. Import growth accelerated, suggesting companies and consumers were buying more, but some analysts said those figures might be distorted and unreliable. Also in March, growth in factory output weakened to 8.9 per cent, down 1 percentage point from the first two months of the year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was the lowest growth since August 2012, when fears of an abrupt 'hard landing' of plunging growth were strong. Beijing responded by boosting lending and government spending. Chinese leaders are unlikely to repeat that strategy after a 60 per cent surge in credit in the first quarter produced a lackluster response, said IHS Global Insight analysts Xianfang Ren and Alistair Thornton in a report. 'We have lost confidence in a robust recovery,' they said. The rise in credit prompted ratings agency Fitch to cut its rating on China's long-term local currency sovereign debt last week, warning of potential financial risks. Fitch said China's total credit, including informal lending among private entrepreneurs, may have risen to the equivalent of 198 per cent of gross domestic product in 2012 from 125 per cent in 2008. Forecasters who expected growth to accelerate might have been misled by inaccurate trade data due to companies falsely reporting higher exports as a way to evade capital controls and bring money into China, said Moody's Analytics economist Alaistair Chan. The price of gold has plunged to a two-year low today as investors dump commodities (Source: Gold Made Simple) Despite the surge in lending, Monday's data showed a slowdown in investment growth that is driving the latest recovery. First-quarter growth in spending on factories, real estate and other fixed assets declined to 20.9 per cent from the 21.1 per cent rate for the first two months of the year. That shows the economy suffers from structural problems including excess production capacity in some industries that makes more investment unprofitable, said Yao. Beijing's central business district. By 12.45pm the FTSE 100 index was down 74.08 at 6310.31 in response to the Chinese growth announcement . 'Given all this credit injected into the system, the future should look better,' said Yao. 'Nevertheless, the level of efficiency in the economy has declined. The same amount of money will no longer produce the same amount of growth.' In a positive sign, growth in retail sales edged up to 12.6 per cent in March from 12.3 per cent for the first two months of the year. Recent increases in required minimum wages and an improved housing market should help to boost household spending, said Moody's Analytics economist Fred Gibson in a report. Still, he cautioned, consumer confidence could be hurt if China's export weakness persists. Also Monday, the World Bank trimmed its growth forecast for China this year by 0.1 percentage point to a still-robust 8.3 per cent.","Dow Jones has dropped more than 155 points, one per cent, by about noon .

"By . Joe Ridge . Follow @@JoeRidge87 . Perhaps the most telling thing about Mark Robins’ departure from Huddersfield after just 18 months as their manager, and just one game into the new season, was that it was not a surprise. The tale is one typical of the Championship in recent years. Incredibly, Steve Evans is the longest-serving manager in the division having been at newly-promoted Rotherham for two years and 124 days. That, in times gone by - even recent times - would be considered barely a bedding in period. Telling: Mark Robins departed the managerial post at Huddersfield after just one game of the new season . Servant: Rotherham boss Steve Evans is the longest-serving Championship manager at 2 years, 124 days . Steve Evans - Rotherham: 2 years, 124 days . Lee Clark - Birmingham: 2 years, 46 days . Eddie Howe - Bournemouth: 1 year, 302 days . Dougie Freedman - Bolton: 1 years, 292 days . Mick McCarthy - Ipswich: 1 year, 283 days . Yet there are 22 clubs in the second tier with managers who have been in their posts for less than two years - and that was the case even before Robins was sacked. The only other manager to have been in his job for over two years, Lee Clark, is on thin ice at Birmingham having kept them up only in the dying seconds of last season, and following an abject defeat at Middlesbrough at the weekend. Evans is only 19th on the list of the longest-serving managers in England’s top four divisions. Ahead of him are four from the Premier League, eight from League One and six from League Two. And, let’s not forget, the Rotherham boss was a League One manager until three months ago. Championship waters are the most treacherous for managers in England, and it’s no coincidence. Relegated teams arrive with the intention of getting straight back up to the Premier League and increasingly, with foreign investment dripping down in to the lower leagues, teams promoted from League One have the same ambition. In Leagues One and Two, there are plenty of clubs and fans just happy to maintain their Football League status, just as in the Premier League where the majority are content with staying put. Runner up: Birmingham boss Lee Clark is second on the list at 2 years, 46 days . But if you are just happy to be in the Championship, as Yeovil were last season, you’ll come straight back down. Yeovil manager Gary Johnson, ironically, would be the longest-serving manager in the Championship had his side stayed up - maybe those trigger-happy owners have a point after all. It is its volatility that makes the Championship so exciting, just maybe not for the managers. Three is the magic number . The Premier League season may not have started yet but Louis van Gaal has already had an effect on English football. The Dutchman’s use of a 3-5-2 formation at the World Cup - where the system was also used successfully by Costa Rica, Chile and Mexico - inspired several managers to try it out on the Football League’s opening weekend. Watford have used the system for the past two seasons in the Championship under Giuseppe Sannino and Gianfranco Zola, and League Two Exeter’s long-serving boss Paul Tisdale has regularly used three at the back over his lengthy tenure in Devon. Advocate: Watford boss Guiseppe Sannino has been using 3-5-2 like Louis van Gaal . But it is in League One where the Van Gaal effect seems to have really taken hold, with Bristol City, Coventry and Swindon all trying the formation which worked so well in Brazil. Bristol City shocked Sheffield United 2-1 at Bramall Lane, Swindon - fielding a side with an average age of just 21 - were very impressive in beating Scunthorpe 3-1, while Coventry performed well despite going down 3-2 at Bradford. Expect to see more teams try it out as the season goes on. Talent scout: Igor Vetokele (Charlton) It has been a turbulent 2014 so far for Charlton, but their 1-1 draw at Brentford on Saturday provided hope for the future, not least the performance of 22-year-old striker Vetokele. The Belgium-born Angolan international who arrived from FC Copenhagen was a powerful threat all day long at Griffin Park, and scored the opening with a header from a corner. Promising: Charlton's 22-year-old forward Igor Vetokele looks a useful addition for the Addicks . However, while his performance will have delighted boss Bob Peeters, too many more like that and parent club Standard Liege could come calling in January.","Robins leaving Huddersfield after just one game is typical of Championship .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Cannabis plants have been growing for months next to iconic London landmarks. A group known as Feed The Birds has planted seeds around Westminster, Big Ben and along the South Bank in a guerrilla protest against 'ludicrous' drug laws. The move, they claim, demonstrates that marijuana naturally flourishes in Britain and should, therefore, be legal. Protest: Feed The Birds campaign group has planted marijuana plants across London (pictured by Tower Bridge and City Hall) in a bid to highlight that it naturally flourishes in Britain and, therefore, should be legal . It is also a bid to raise awareness about medicinal uses of the drug - while growing crops for users so they do not have to rely on black market dealers. Releasing images of the illegal plants next to Tower Bridge, the Shard and a busy London high street, the campaigners have urged the Government to follow Uruguay and a number of American states in legalising the Class B drug. Finn Hemingway, a farmer and representative of the group, explained their actions. 'We have two primary objectives,' said Finn, who is in his 20s. 'We want to raise awareness for medicinal users who need cannabis to improve their quality of life. Trend: The protest follows similar moves in Germany as campaigners urge the Government to follow the lead of Uruguay and some American states, which have recently legalised the Class B drug . Landmarks: This small cannabis plant is pictured growing on London's South Bank, while others have cropped up near the Shard. The group claims they will give the crops to medicinal users to cut out black market dealers . 'We also want to supply medicinal and recreational users with seeds so they are no longer dependent on the black market dealers.' The stunt echoes a protest in the town of Gottingen, Germany, where thousands of cannabis plants sprouted up last year due a similar protest movement. Finn said: 'The war on drugs is a catastrophic failure, and I think that cannabis growing openly on the streets of London emphasises how ludicrous our drugs laws are. 'Putting a human in a prison cell for using a plant is the crime.'","Campaign group Feed The Birds planted seeds to protest 'ludicrous' laws .

"By . Matt Blake . The family of an American jihadist who went to Somalia to wage holy war have spoken of their heartbreak at his transition from gifted student to terrorist, declaring: 'We will love him until the day we die.' Omar Hammami - a native of Alabama who is now on the FBI's most-wanted list - moved from Alabama to Somalia in 2006 where he joined al Qaeda-linked group al Shabab. But fell out with the group last year and since then claims there have been numerous attempts made on his life, the most recent of which was last month when he was shot in the neck as he sat in a tea shop. Now his family have told of their shock at how Hammami - who now answers to the name Abu Monsour Al-Amriki, or The American - went from gifted high school student to alleged mastermind of at least one deadly suicide bombing. Scroll down for video . Attack: Omar Hammami, an American jihadi in Somalia, posted this picture of himself on Twitter showing injuries he said he sustained in an assassination attempt . Shafik and Debra Hammami first heard . their son was a terrorist when they sawhim on an Islamic propaganda . video broadcast on television. 'When . I first saw the . interview on TV, I knew that was the end of life as we knew it,' said . Shafik from his home in Daphne, Alabama, his voice breaking with . emotion. 'I knew . we would never be the same again. It's devastating for both of us. He is . our only son. We only have one son. And now, we have none.' Describing Omar as a 'very sweet, intelligent child', he told CNN he . excelled in the classroom and on the sports field, adding: 'I would . have loved for him to be engineer or a doctor but that wasn't in the . cards.' He said Omar showed no signs of . radicalization at the University of Alabama - even as president of the . Muslim Student Association he was vocal in his condemnation of the 9/11 . attacks. But he married a Somali woman and . moved to Egypt to deepen his study of Islam. But a few years later, the . family received a phone call from his wife saying he had gone to Somalia . to visit her relatives but not returned. The next time they heard of him he . was decrying America and its corruption by sin on a jihadist video, . flanked by masked Somali warlords. The U.S. then named Hammami on its Most . Wanted terrorist list in March and is offering a $5 million reward for . information leading to his capture. Al Shabab fighters are not eligible . for the reward. Hammami in 2011 with deputy leader of al Shabab Sheik Mukhtar Abu Mansur Robow under a banner which reads 'Allah is Great' 'Of course I tried my best, and so . did my wife, to raise him the best we could [but] he chose the path he . did, and I do not approve of it,' added Shafik. 'But there is nothing I . can do to change it.' They say the stigma of having a . terrorist convert for a son is an uncomfortable truth in a town of . 22,000 where Omar Hammami is known as 'that terrorist from here'. Daphne, a Christian herself, said she . has been abused in the street but remains strong through her faith in . God and the support of 'wonderful friends'. In . a 127-page autobiography, posted online, Omar attempted to explain his . relationship with the American dream: 'The real fear that the . Americans feel when they see an American in Somalia talking about Jihad, . is not how skillful he is at sneaking back across the borders with . nuclear weapons. Wanted: Hammami fell out with militant group al-Shabab after accusing its leaders of leading a decadent lifestyle . Militants: Hammami was once a member of militant group Al-Shabab (pictured) which has been blamed for a terrorist attacks in Somalia . 'The Americans fear that their cultural barrier has been . broken and now Jihad has become a normal career choice for any youthful . American Muslim. Trying to show them how serious I am about . slaughtering Disbelievers is the side of me they would like to . capitalize on to estrange the Muslims from our cause.' Hammami is now one of the two most notorious Americans in overseas jihadi . groups after moving from Alabama to Somalia around . 2006. There are scant details about what made Hammami go from being a gifted student, president of his Sophomore class who dated the most sought-after girl in school, to a key figure in one of the world's most ruthless Islamist insurgencies. He was brought up as a southern Baptist who went to Bible camp and sang 'Away in a Manger' at Christmas time. His mother was a typical Southern Belle with a distinct Alabama accent and taught at an elementary school. His father came to America from Syria and became an engineer though was said to keep a strict household. Hammami's upbringing was immersed in American culture yet still remained culturally Muslim, shoes were left at the door, Koranic inscriptions decorated the walls, pork was forbidden. As a teenager, his passions fluctuated between Shakespeare and Kurt Cobain, soccer and Nintendo. He had dreams of being a surgeon. Friends in his class said he was a natural leader and compared him to the main character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It was a trip to Damascus the summer before his sophomore year would make a lasting impression on him. When he came back, he said he was torn between Christianity and Islam. He fought alongside the group for years while . gaining fame for posting YouTube videos of jihadi rap songs in the hope of attracting young American Muslims. But he fell out with al Shabab and has engaged in a public . fight with the group over the last year. Since then, Hammami has been a thorn in the group's side after accusing its leaders of living extravagant lifestyles with the taxes fighters . collect from Somali residents. Shafik, . who calls Al . Shabaab 'a bunch of thugs,' says Al Shabaab's top leadership who now want him dead because he . disagrees with taking money from the poor to fund their lavish . lifestyles and targeting civilians in suicide bombings. 'He is against those things,' said Shafik whose only way of staying in touch is by reading Omar's frequent Twitter posts. Another Hammami grievance is that the . Somali militant leaders sideline foreign militants inside al Shabab and . are concerned only about fighting in Somalia, not globally. But despite what he has done, Omar's family are still his family. 'Even if I can't see . him, I just wish he stays safe,' says Shafik. 'And I wish... I wish he will know ... that I . will love him until I die.' Al Shabab have criticized Hammami publicly in a December Internet statement, . saying his video releases are the result of personal grievances that . stem from a 'narcissistic pursuit of fame'. The statement said al Shabab . was morally obligated to stamp out his 'obstinacy'. The U.S. named Hammami on its Most . Wanted terrorist list in March and is offering a $5 million reward for . information leading to his capture. Al Shabab fighters are not eligible . for the reward. Along with Adam Gadahn in Pakistan - a former Osama bin Laden spokesman - . Hammami is one of the two most notorious Americans in jihad groups.

Women's 400m round one - Tuesday 12th - 17.00 (BST) Christine Ohuruogu begins her campaign to capture the one major title that has eluded her - European gold. The reigning World Champion admitted to doubts about whether she was in shape to win but her credentials mean she will go in as favourite. Final piece of the jigsaw: Christine Ohuruogu has her sights set on the 400m title . Getting back on track: Mo Farah will look to put his recent illness behind him in the Men's 10,000m . Men’s 10,000m final - Wednesday 13th – 18.50 (BST) After pulling out of the Commonwealth Games, Mo Farah – who withdrew because of abdominal pains - has a chance to prove his fitness and get his season back on track against a weaker field than he would have faced in Glasgow. Farah is also expected to run in the 5,000m. Women’s 200m final – Friday 15th – 19.25 (BST) Jodie Williams is ranked second in Europe behind Dutch heptathlon star Daphne Schippers. Former junior star Williams, who won Commonwealth silver last month, has hit form at the right time after being plagued with injury for two years. Silver lining: Commonwealth Games medallists Jodie Williams and Adam Gemili will hope to go one better . Men’s 200m final – Friday 15th – 20.50 (BST) Adam Gemili wasn’t selected for the 100m team, the event he won Commonwealth silver in, so all his energy will be focussed on the 200m, where he is joint favourite for the title alongside reigning Champion Christophe Lemaitre of France. Men’s long jump final – Sunday 17th – 15.00 (BST) Greg Rutherford predicted he may have to break his own record of 8.51 metres if he is to add a European title to Olympic and Commonwealth glory.

Women's high jump final - Sunday 17th - 14.15 (BST) Morgan Lake is only 17 and the youngest athlete of any nationality at the European Championships. Fresh from winning two golds at the World Junior Championships, she will focus on the high jump here. The 1.93m personal best she set in Oregon last month would have been enough for bronze two years ago so a medal is within her reach. Women's 800m final - Saturday 16th - 15.05 (BST) Scotland's darling of the track Lynsey Sharp, who won silver in Glasgow despite being hooked up to a drip hours earlier, will go up against teammates, 19 year old Jess Judd and Eildh Child who is number one in Europe this year.","Mo Farah, Christine Ohuruogu and Greg Rutherford tipped for gold medals .

"By . Lee Moran . Updated: . 11:40 GMT, 19 November 2011 . A hypersonic flying missile that can strike a target anywhere in the world in just 30 minutes has been unveiled by the U.S. military. The Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW), which travels five times the speed of sound, was successfully tested yesterday. It was launched by rocket from Hawaii at 11.30am, glided south westwards through the upper atmosphere over the Pacific at 'hypersonic speed' before hitting its target on the Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands - some 2,500 miles away. It comes hot on the heels of the U.S. Air Force announcement that it has taken delivery of eight, 15-ton bunker buster bombs, called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, that can blow apart 200ft of concrete. And if it is rolled out by the U.S. military, it will mean America will no longer have to rely on stationing missiles in foreign countries. The Pentagon did not reveal how fast the AHW, which unlike traditional ballistic missiles can be manoeuvred, reached. Zeroed in: The weapon, which could look similar to this Falcon HTV-2, left, was fired from Hawaii, glided south westwards through the upper atmosphere over the Pacific at 'hypersonic speed' before hitting its target on the Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands - some 2,500 miles away . Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Melinda . Morgan said the test was aimed at gathering data on 'aerodynamics, . navigation, guidance and control, and thermal protection technologies'. The U.S. Army's AHW project is part of the 'Prompt Global Strike' programme. It seeks to give the U.S. military the means to deliver conventional weapons anywhere in the world within an hour. Project: The Pentagon test flew another hypersonic glider, dubbed HTV-2, earlier this year, which is capable of flying 16,776 miles per hour . Scientists classify hypersonic speeds as those that exceed Mach 5 - or five times the speed of sound - 3,728 miles per hour. On . August 11, the Pentagon test flew another hypersonic glider dubbed . HTV-2, which is capable of flying 16,776 miles per hour. But it was a . failure. Threat: USAF specialists stand under a mock-up of the new bunker busting Big Blu . The AHW's range is less than that of the HTV-2, the Congressional Research Service said in a report, without providing specifics. Despite half the circumference of the earth at the equator measuring 12,450 miles, the maximum distance travelled by the AHW will be significantly less, as it will follow a trajectory rising into the upper atmosphere before making its descent. The Pentagon has invested $239.9 million in the Global Strike program this year, including $69 million for the flying bomb tested yesterday, CRS said. The news comes the day after the USAF . revealed it would now be using the 15-ton bunker busting Massive . Ordnance Penetrator bombs. B-2 . Stealth Bombers will use the six metre long GPS guided rocket, dubbed . the Big Blu and fitted with 2.5 tons of explosives, to smash open . underground bunkers and tunnels suspected of containing weapons of mass . destruction. The delivery . of the super bomb, and testing of the AHW, is in the same week U.S. President Barack Obama said America would act firmly against any nuclear . proliferation activities by North Korea. And . it comes as an International Atomic Energy Agency report renewed calls . for a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.","U.S. may no longer rely on stationing missiles abroad .

The winner of the last 11 European Super Cups has alternated between the reigning Champions League winners and the reigning UEFA Cup/Europa League winners. With Bayern Munich winning last season, Sevilla must win the 2014 edition for this trend to continue.
Real Madrid are the only team to lose a European Super Cup to a golden goal; they were beaten 2-1 by Galatasaray in 2000.

Sevilla were also the last Spanish side to lose this game; they were beaten 3-1 by Milan in 2007. The last four Spanish sides to qualify for this competition have won.
Real Madrid have won only one of their three previous European Super Cups. They were beaten in 1998 and 2000 before beating Feyenoord 3-1 in 2002. Iker Casillas started the 2000 and 2002 games.
The last 13 La Liga meetings between Real Madrid and Sevilla have seen 64 goals scored; an average of just under five per game.
The Whites have won nine of their last 11 meetings with the Andalusian side in all competitions, but have lost the last two away from the Bernabeu (both away league games).

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 16 goals in nine La Liga games against Sevilla; he has scored more goals against them than any other side in the competition.
James Rodriguez could make his first competitive appearance for Real Madrid in this game. He scored six goals in five World Cup 2014 appearances, collecting the Golden Boot in the process.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Not for the first time, Newcastle United have done the bulk of their summer spending in the duty free European aisle. It is a prudent ploy: they pick up quality goods at a competitive price, repackage them as a Premier League commodity and place them in the 'Sports Direct' window perused by the Champions League elite. This year's continental sweep, however, has bought manager Alan Pardew the one stock he so desperately craves – time. New boys: Karl Darlow (right) and Jamaal Lascelles (left) are Alan Pardew's latest acquisitions . Seven new signings - plus yesterday's . arrival of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest, who . will return on loan - have lifted the depression which had descended in . the second half of last season, a period in which the Magpies won just . five of 21 matches, Pardew headbutted Hull's David Meyler and 2,000 fans . protested against the regime by walking out during the final home game. But the uprising fell flat and a steady stream of summer unveilings have, for now, quelled the dissenters. Optimism . on Tyneside, however, will always be tempered while Pardew and owner . Mike Ashley are in power; time, then, is a provisional luxury, no matter . the six years remaining on the manager's contract. Les Ferdinand – who scored 50 goals for United in the mid-Nineties - agrees. 'The jury is still out on the manager and the signings,' he told the Mail on Sunday, 'and a good start is huge for them. 'But . I've always had sympathy with Alan Pardew and I think he hasn't been . helped at all by the owner in the past couple of seasons. 'He hasn't had the money when he's needed it and they've struggled because of that, it's frustrating.' Respected . radio commentator Mick Lowes has covered the club for more than 20 . years and, while siding with Ferdinand, he feels Pardew is now under . pressure to return on the £30million investment. On the hunt: The Newcastle manager has made seven summer signings so far . Main man: Emmanuel Riviere (centre) seems to have hit the ground running in a Newcastle shirt . 'There . was always a feeling that he was a manager operating with one hand tied . behind his back – well that hand has been loosened now,' he said. 'Last . season will not be forgotten if they start badly, but the fixture . computer has been kind and he has to take advantage of that. There is no . excuse that he has not been backed by the owner this time.' And . what of that backing? To give the sudden splurge some perspective, the . arrival of Ayoze Perez from Tenerife for £1.6million in June was the . club's first permanent signing in 17 months. So it was due. Their . soccer-market sweep has again seen them journey down the autoroutes of . the continent, picking up France midfielder Remy Cabella and Holland . internationals Daryl Janmaat and Siem de Jong, as well as Monaco striker . Emmanuel Riviere, Argentine forward Facundo Ferreyra and, a lot closer . to home, Jack Colback from Sunderland. And . BBC Newcastle's Lowes added: 'In terms of numbers and quality it's . better than we ever expected. The likes of Cabella, Janmaat and De Jong . are top-class players and fit that mould of Yohan Cabaye and Mathieu . Debuchy, internationals who were then sold for a big profit.' Jury still out: Les Ferdinand (left) believes a good start is crucial for under-fire Pardew . Ferdinand . admits to a sense of anticipation, although he is scarred by the . experience of Spurs. They splashed more than £100m on seven new players . 12 months ago but both Andre Villas-Boas and then Tim Sherwood – . assisted by Ferdinand – were sacked before the season's end. 'You . look at the players Newcastle have brought in and you'd say it's been a . very good summer and I can see why fans might be excited again,' he . said. 'I have been to watch Siem de Jong play for Ajax a good few times and he is a top player. 'It will be interesting to see how that translates to the Premier League because I thought he was very good in Holland. 'But I was at Spurs last year and we spent a lot of money on new signings and everyone expected us to challenge for the league. 'It . didn't happen that way and you'll probably find Spurs come back better . this season for those lads having had a year to settle in. 'That could be the same at Newcastle, but has the manager got that time?' The . answer to Ferdinand's question, of course, is dependent on results. The . United boss has been afforded more time than many anticipated – new . signings have helped see to that. But time and goodwill have a limited shelf-life at St James' Park. Pardew must hope his new goods are not faulty. Continental: France midfielder Remy Cabella (left) in action during a pre-season friendly .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Liverpool’s penalty shootout win over Manchester City in New York will be little consolation for losing out in the Premier League title race on the final day of last season, but it gave some indication that Brendan Rodgers’s side are set to be contenders again. Both sides are expected to line up quite differently on August 17 and made a number of changes throughout Wednesday’s match, making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress. MailOnline looks at what we learned from the slug-out at Yankee Stadium … . Scroll down for videos . First blood: Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly . Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho impressed among the Liverpool starters and Raheem Sterling gave his side a much sharper attacking edge when he came on in the second half before scoring the late equaliser. It wasn’t the best of days again for Steven Gerrard whose latest slip let in Stevan Jovetic for City’s opening goal, but Rodgers has no doubt his skipper will be a key player in that deep-lying role again this season. ‘We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Stevie and Jovetic got a toe on it,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘But he’s been playing that role for the last 12 months and I’m sure he’ll play it this season as well. He’s got a wonderful range of pass, his movement is good to get on the ball and he’s very committed.’ Red leader: Steven Gerrard (C) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield . Making up for lost time: Stevan Jovetic scored both of Manchester City's goals in normal time . It’s early days but already Jovetic looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury-hit first season at City. The Montenegro international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour, and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from Fiorentina for £22m. Joe Hart made three fantastic saves after coming on at half-time even though he was outshone by Simon Mignolet in the shootout. The Liverpool keeper kept out Yaya Toure’s effort as the Ivorian made a subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer. Liverpool changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track. Rodgers may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well. He said: ‘We played two different formations – a 4-4-2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season. At times we worked it well but it was good to see it. Second half it was more of a 4-3-3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4-2-3-1. Multi-talented: Philippe Coutinho's versaility gave Liverpool plenty of options with formations . Double salvo: Jovetic scores City's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties . ‘We had a connection through Coutinho who played a lot from the sides and the top of the diamond. The last 20 minutes he played in behind Daniel Sturridge to connect midfield and the front men. That made passes shorter and the movement better.’ City lined up in more of a conventional 4-4-2 formation with Edin Dzeko and James Milner their first World Cup players to make an appearance in the US, although Manuel Pellegrini will probably revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1 once the season starts. It will be interesting to see how new £12m signing Fernando fits in with Toure and Fernandinho occupying those defensive midfield slots last season. City certainly have more in reserve with David Silva, Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo among the unused substitutes at Yankee Stadium. They are also waiting to welcome back captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis, who report back on Monday. Super sub: Raheem Sterling made an impression after coming off the bench at the Yankees Stadium . In the family: City goalkeeper Joe Hart embraces brothers Kolo and Yaya Toure at full-time . ‘The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko, I think that they will be ready for the Premier League,’ said Pellegrini. ‘We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.’ Sterling made the biggest impact of Liverpool’s substitutes, but Lucas Leiva supplied a sublime touch for Henderson to score their first goal and Mignolet emerged as the hero of the shootout. Both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening’s exertions, if not the quality of parts of the playing surface. Coach Rodgers was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from a goal down. ‘Even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive,’ he said. ‘The players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was a really good game. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. City are a top side, one of the best teams in Europe.’ Coach trip: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (L) and Man City's Manuel Pellegrini (R) were generally pleased . Coach Pellegrini knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw. ‘It was a very useful game for both teams,’ said the City boss. ‘We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.’ Liverpool still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of Luis Suarez and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season. New signing Rickie Lambert wasted a gilt-edged chance in the first half and Daniel Sturridge was also subdued for long periods. Kolo Toure and Sebastian Coates started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost Liverpool dear last season. Weak link: There were question marks over Kolo Toure's performance in central defence . City, meanwhile, need to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala which has been dragging on since January. Despite signing Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Willy Caballero, a new centre-back was the priority and Mangala does not seem to be falling over himself to come to Manchester. Judging by the form of Kelechi Iheanacho on tour, City also need to sort out a work permit for the Nigerian teenager as soon as possible. Of the squad that turned up at Yankee Stadium, Scott Sinclair, Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts.","Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup pre-season friendly, New York .

"By . Shari Miller . Surgery may soon be a thing of the past for breast cancer patients, thanks to a new technique that destroys tumours by freezing them. A supercooled needle tip is repeatedly inserted into the cancerous tissue to turn it into a ball of ice, before it is then defrosted, leaving the tumour damaged. Not requiring anaesthetic, the technique can be completed in about 15 minutes and could provide a better alternative to the current method of surgery, which requires women to stay in hospital for up to a week and can leave scars. Putting the freeze on cancer: Using a supercooled needle, cryoablation turns tumours into a ball of ice . Thirty breast cancer patients are currently trialling the system, which uses a needle cooled to -170C (-274F) by pumping liquid nitrogen through a network of tiny tubes. The surgeon can control the size of the ice ball produced to ensure it freezes the entire tumour in a procedure known as cryoablation. Scientists from the Israel-based company IceCure Medical, which developed the device, say it could be used on cancerous masses up to the size of a golf ball. Cancer hope: IceCure Medical chief executive Hezi Himelfarb . 'There have been attempts before to use heat to destroy cancer cells like this, but that can be extremely painful because our bodies are very sensitive to heat,' chief executive Hezi Himmelfarb told The Sunday Telegraph. 'Cold has an anaesthetising effect, so the patients feel very little pain during or after the procedure. 'We have developed the system so it can be carried out in a normal doctors' surgery as it is minimally invasive and relatively quick.' The device could help some of the 50,000 women annually diagnosed in the UK with breast cancer. Each year, around 39,000 lumpectomies are carried out, which involves the surgical removal of a lump from the breast. One in five women need further surgery after a lumpectomy, because not all the cancerous tissue is removed. The device has already been approved for use in the United States and IceCure is hopeful of getting European approval next year. Scientists believe cryoablation could also be used to treat kidney, prostate and liver cancer. Supercool: The needle is cooled to -170C with liquid nitrogen and inserted repeatedly into the tumour .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Sitting in the stands watching Jamaica’s ‘Sunshine Girls’ play netball on Wednesday was Usain Bolt. These Commonwealth Games needed an icon and it is this man, the superstar holder of six Olympic gold medals. He chewed gum, waved a Jamaica flag and talked with his little clique, including his attack-dog of an agent, Ricky Simms, and his friend from school, Nugent Walker Junior, known as NJ, his Man Friday. Bolt scurried off with his retinue after the match ended in a 50-42 loss to New Zealand, rushing past the reporters shouting one word: ‘Awesome.’ It was intended as his verdict on these Games, a sentiment he retweeted in full charm-offensive mode later in the day. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Usain Bolt turning on the charm at Commonwealth Games . Loving life: Usain Bolt waves a Jamaican flag during the 'Sunshine Girls' game at the SECC in Glasgow . The only problem is that a day before, while waiting for his car in rain outside the athletes’ village, he was seemingly more candid, giving the opposite view. He derided the Games as a ‘bit s***’ and said he was ‘not really’ having fun. Those words, taken down in contemporaneous notes, appeared in The Times on Wednesday morning. The story prompted Bolt to tweet: ‘I’m waking up to this nonsense… journalist please don’t create lies to make headlines.’ Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, told the daily press briefing: ‘I think Usain’s tweet has said it all. I take his word that it is lies.’ That seemed a touch complacent, dismissing a reputable publication so readily in deference to the event’s leading man. Loyal supporter: Bolt, with his sunglasses on the back of his head, was on his feet to cheer on Jamaica's girls . Glasgow can't be that bad? Bolt plays the tourist as he takes a quick snap inside the SECC . All smiles: The six-time Olympic champions didn't look too bothered by how 's***' Glasgow might be . To try to elicit some sort of clarification, I walked up to the spare seat next to Bolt and introduced myself, reminding him that we had met briefly in Kingston, Jamaica, a couple of years ago. Before he had a chance to respond, security heavies manhandled me out of the way, one of them ripping my accreditation from around my neck. So much for the Friendly Games. This furore is extremely sensitive for the organisers because Bolt has a multi-million pound deal with Virgin Media, who are the ‘official presenting partner of athletics’. His image is plastered on Virgin billboards across the city, including on the main road to Hampden Park, where he is expected to run in the 4x100metres relay. On Glasgow Green, spectators have the chance to run against a hologram of Bolt, courtesy of… Virgin. The gangly Jamaican is the man in demand. So when he arrived on Saturday he was whisked straight to a press conference, where the fawning was on an industrial scale. The nadir was Roz Kelly, who works for Australian TV, saying she and her crew were there ‘as fans’ and wanted a selfie with him. Bolt has posed for pictures with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, as well as with the mascot, Clyde. He is the one athlete with global reach. No wonder the organisers were so keen to take his side on Wednesday. However, this storm has not blown out. The journalist who broke the story, Katie Gibbons, is ready to confront Bolt about his denial. There is also outrage among Glaswegians, a few of whom proposed a campaign to get punters to turn their backs on Bolt in the stadium. Bolt is everywhere: The Jamaican sprinter is plastered on Virgin Media billboards across the city . Happy to please: Bolt poses with Clyde the mascot and children from Giffnock Athletics Club on Saturday . Incredulous: Bolt did not like it when a reporter questioned whether he would really run in Glasgow . Let's hear it for the girls: Bolt sends his best wishes to the team after their narrow Commonwealth defeat . A camera pointing the other way: Bolt gets some snaps of the Jamaican girls in action on Wednesday . I am not sure many, if any, will do that. The crowds here have been warm to competitors from all 71 nations. A cavorting, bow-and-arrow shooting Bolt up to his party tricks is unlikely to be a flop. One caveat: there remains some doubt about whether he will compete at all, especially if it is wet. He is overcoming injury and decided not to take part in the individual sprints. The cynics would say he is doing the bare minimum to honour his commitments to Virgin. Between massages on Wednesday, Bolt was training. However, for part of the relay handover session Kemar Bailey-Cole, the new Commonwealth 100m champion, was on the anchor leg that Bolt is supposedly due to run. The plot thickens. All smiles: Bolt jokes around in training despite the storm surrounding his comments about Glasgow . Are you lookin' at me? Bolt points at a photographer while wearing a camera round his neck in training . Speaking out: Kemar Bailey-Cole, who won 100m gold, has also criticised the Glasgow Games . If Bolt did criticise the Games, he would not be alone. Take Bailey-Cole, who said the food needed more seasoning and ‘wasn’t as good as London’. Jason Livermore, who was sixth in the 100m, was similarly underwhelmed, saying: ‘Usain’s somewhere in the village. I hope he’s having a better time than me. ‘The food? Oof. Back in Jamaica it’s not like this. I need to get me some clothes. It’s freezing.’ Actually, by Scottish standards, it has been positively balmy. It was 27 degrees at the triathlon last week. There is plenty to enjoy. The streets have a carnival feel. The competition is keen, some of it of outstanding quality. They have sold 1.2million tickets, a roaring trade.

They are night-and-day compared to Delhi’s chaotic staging of this jamboree four years ago, made memorable by dengue fever, collapsing buildings, stray dogs, spit-infested sinks and the chief medical officer going down with typhoid. Bolt missed those Games because they came too late in the year to fit in with his schedule. Take it from me, Mr Bolt, Glasgow 2014 is a doddle and a joy.","Bolt was reported as having called the Games 'a bit s***' in The Times .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Scotland's Marc Warren produced one of the best rounds of his career to surge into contention for the inaugural Made in Denmark event on Saturday. Warren, who won the last of his two European Tour titles in 2007, defied winds gusting over 30mph to card a superb 66 at Himmerland Golf Resort to set the clubhouse target on six under par. He was later joined on that mark by overnight leader Bradley Dredge, who had to wait until a medical emergency was dealt with on the 18th hole before being able to finish his round of 73. A male member of the television crew suffered a suspected heart attack and received treatment from on-site staff before being taken to hospital. Made in Denmark: Marc Warren produced one of the best rounds of his career to go six under par . 'The finish was difficult. Nobody likes to see that kind of thing,' said Dredge, who initially waited to play his second shot before being allowed to move to the driving range along with playing partners Simon Wakefield and Thorbjorn Olesen. 'No one likes to see an ambulance (on the course). Golf is very much secondary when anything like that happens. Andy McFee (European Tour chief referee) came over and was talking to us and tried to make the right decision for everyone. 'The gentleman needed some space for some treatment and we didn't want to be there while they were working on him. It's quite upsetting. The gentleman is okay and hopefully he will make a full recovery.' Success: Warren won the last of his two European Tour titles back in 2007 . Dredge had been four shots clear at the halfway stage but struggled in the conditions and was three over par for the day before holing from 20 feet for birdie on the 17th. That ensured he finished alongside Warren and three ahead of Wakefield and Northern Ireland's Gareth Maybin, with Olesen another shot back on two under with Welshman Stuart Manley and England's Phillip Archer. Warren, who carded eight birdies and three bogeys, said: 'Even driving here we could see the wind was a lot stronger than the first two days so we knew it was going to be a battle today. 'Obviously Bradley was well ahead of me and the rest of the field and to be honest I was hoping it was going to be tougher because if it was easier he could maybe have the chance to pull away. Test: Scotland's Mark Warren tests the wind, which reached 30mph at times . 'Overall I am absolutely delighted. I think 66 today, I probably couldn't have hoped for that before I started. I started off and felt a wee bit of out of synch the first couple of holes, then hit a really nice second shot into the third and from then on just played really solid golf. 'A lot of imagination was needed today and I enjoy that style of golf.' Warren flew to Denmark after finishing joint 15th in the US PGA Championship at Valhalla last week and admitted the jet-lag was having an effect. 'I was wide awake at half three last night,' the 33-year-old added. 'It's a whirlwind and you lose track of what's going on, catching three flights to get here. I've got the wife and son with me as well so whirlwind would be a good word to describe it.' Local favourite Thomas Bjorn is five off the pace after a 73 and was full of praise for Warren's score, telling Sky Sports: 'That's up there with one of the best rounds I've seen in a long long time. Impressed: Local favourite Thomas Bjorn was full of praise for Warren's performance . 'It was literally impossible on some of those exposed greens to putt, your putter went all over the place and it was a very very difficult day out there.' Earlier in the day, Northern Ireland's Michael Hoey had been forced to withdraw after being unable to make his third round tee time. Hoey thought he had missed the halfway cut after consecutive rounds of 73 left him four over par and set off for home, only to discover in Amsterdam airport that a bogey on his final hole from James Heath - who was in the last group out on Friday afternoon - had changed the cut from three over to four over. Airport: Bjorn headed home thinking he had missed the cut only to realise his fortunes had changed . The 35-year-old then tried to get back to the course only to discover that his golf clubs had been mislaid in transit and he could not get back in time for his 7:40am start on Saturday morning. The five-time European Tour winner wrote on Twitter: 'Home after a nightmare 24hrs, left Aalborg for Amsterdam, arrived, watched scores, made cut. KLM lost my clubs, missed flights back. 'Couldn't get private jet, train, car or any other way back so came home! At least I found my clubs this morning at Schiphol £silverlinings.'","Marc Warren carded 66 at first round of Made in Denmark .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . They may only be tiny, and live for just three months, but ants could be the key to solving climate change. Rough harvester ants have been found to ‘weather’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate, also known as limestone. When the ants make this limestone, the process traps carbon dioxide in the rock, ultimately removing it from the atmosphere. Researcher Ronald Dorn buried sand at six sites in Arizona, 25 years ago. Every five years, he measured how much the minerals olivine and plagioclase degraded and discovered the ants (rough harvester ant pictured) break down minerals up to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed . It is unsure how the minerals are converted, however, and theories range from ants licking the sand, to excreting the substance. The ants are believed to collect calcium and magnesium, and use these elements to make limestone. This process is similar to the process known as carbon sequestration. Natural carbon sequestration is the process on Earth that manages the carbon dioxide expelled by animals, plants and humans. Trees and the oceans help convert or trap this carbon dioxide. There are also artificial carbon sequestration schemes that involve manually trapping this carbon dioxide in the ground. One proposed method is ocean sequestration, in which carbon dioxide is placed deep in the ocean, forming lakes of the gas. These gases stay where they are due to the pressure and temperature of the surrounding water, gradually dissolving over time. Another method is geological sequestration where the carbon dioxide is pumped into underground chamber, or into areas full of magnesium and calcium. Carbon dioxide reacts with these elements to form limestone and magnesite. It is this latter method that Dorn discovered the ants perform naturally. The discovery was made by Professor Ronald Dorn from the University of Arizona Tempe. Professor Dorn buried sand at six sites in the Catalina Mountains in Arizona, and Palo Duro Canyon in Texas, 25 years ago. Every five years, he measured how much the minerals olivine and plagioclase degraded in the sand, and discovered the ants break down minerals up to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed. Professor Dorn believes the ants collect calcium and magnesium and use these elements to make the limestone. The conversion may occur when ants lick sand grains in order to stick them to the walls of their nests. Alternatively, the limestone could be created from bacteria in the insects gut before it is excreted. This process is similar to what's known as carbon sequestration.

Earlier this month, British scientists at the University of East Anglia said leafcutter ants could save lives thanks to a natural antibiotic they produce. The pioneering research by the School of Biological Studies centred on a particular type of fungus the ants eat, and how the ants’ natural resistance protects it.","Ants ‘weather’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate - or limestone .

"By . Gemma Mullin . The buyer of a castle built by a swashbuckling pirate might stumble across enough hidden treasure to make Captain Jack Sparrow go weak at the knees. Legend has it that its owner Captain Bell stashed his loot in the castle cellars. Now Grade II-listed Bell’s Castle, in the Cotswolds, is set to fill another treasure chest – and it could fetch over £2.5million. The 19th century castle nestled in the picturesque rolling hills of the Cotswolds was built by pirate Captain Bell 200 years ago . The Gothic castle could fetch £2.5million after it was put up for sale by the current owners - a fourth generation of the Holland-Martin family . The Grade II listed Bell's Castle has seven bedrooms and four bathrooms in its main building and also boasts a swimming pool and tennis court within its grounds . Complete with brooding battlements and turrets, it’s set in the Overbury Estate and links a row of early 17th century cottages to an 18th century lookout tower. A bold buccaneer of the Napoleonic Wars, Captain Bell was renowned for his daring raids on ships laden with gold and other treasure. The present owners, the Holland-Martins, are the fourth generation of the same family to have lived in the castle since the latter part of the 19th century. A spokesman for Savills’, which is marketing the property, said: ‘Bell’s Castle, besides its fascinating history and architecture, is first and foremost a wonderful family home.' One of the many cosy living areas inside the 200-year-old castle, which is based in large grounds within the Overbury Estate - known for its partridge and pheasant shoot . The picturesque scene starts from the minute the front door is opened and  is a short drive from the world-famous polo at Cirencester Park, often visited by the Royal Family . He built and owned the majestic Bell's Castle but how did Captain Bell manage to swag such a hefty plunder? The pirate was said to have 'spoiled merchant ships of cargoes of silks, wines and gold and had the loot conveyed from the Bristol Channel up the Severn and Avon rivers to Bredon Hill, and thence by pack horses to Bell’s Castle there to be hidden in cavernous cellars.'So long as the Napoleonic war lasted, the authorities treated Captain Bell as a national hero.But when he continued his piratical habits in peacetime, they could no longer turn a blind eye to his exploits, especially when he was said to have captured two beautiful French Countesses, locking them in the castle and holding them for ransom.Eventually he paid the penalty on the hangman’s scaffold. Captain Bell was treated as a national hero throughout the Napoleonic War, but when he continued his piratical habits in the peacetime, the authorities had him hanged . The castle passed into the ownership of the Overbury Estate and the Holland-Martin family in the 19th century, who have recently decided to put it up for sale . The Gothic . fortress boasts seven bedrooms and four bathrooms in the main castle . and a two-bed cottage, swimming pool, tennis court and large grounds.

Ben Holland-Martin is the fourth-generation of the family to own Bell's Castle - his father was Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin, Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in Malta . In the early 20th century Robert Holland-Martin’s six sons would often camp in the castle grounds.Once they managed to take a pony into the castle and manhandled it to the upper-most tower, and on another occasion one of the boys, Deric, was unceremoniously tied to a selection of umbrellas and pushed from the top tower to parachute to the ground many feet below.  Fortunately he survived, became Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin, serving as Lord Lieutenant of the county, and was Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in Malta, and with his wife Rosamund, who was chairman of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) for nearly two decades, lived at Bell’s Castle from the 1950s.One of his sons, Ben who followed in his mother's footsteps and works for the children's charity, is the fourth generation of the Holland-Martin family to own Bell’s Castle, which has now been put on the market.","Captain Bell is said to have taken his loot up the Bristol Channel and stashed it in the castle cellars .

At the time of her death, Blodgett was a student at the University of Wisconsin and acting in a production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' However, the two broke up, and both went on to study at the University of Wisconsin. Bartlet dropped out of the Steven's Point campus after just one semester, returning home depressed. The two were rekindling their friendship the following summer when Blodgett was killed. At the time, Huffington Post reported that Bartelt wanted to be more than just friends. Behind bars: Bartelt faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced on October 14 . The last time Blodgett was seen, she was leaving a cast party for a production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' around 1am on July 15, 2013. That afternoon, her mother went into her bedroom where she found her daughter strangled to death and made a frantic call to 911. An autopsy ruled Blodgett died from strangulation, since there were ligature marks on her neck and arm. During this week's trial, it was revealed that Bartelt used climbing rope to carry out the murder, and his fingerprints were found on a roll of tape discovered under Blodgett's bed. The 20-year-old's DNA was also found under Blodgett's fingernails and in her genital area, suggesting sexual assault. The rope, antiseptic wipes and bloody paper towels were found stuffed in a cereal box that was dumped in nearby Hartford Park after the murder, and the DNA was a match again. 'She's screaming at us and telling . us through her body and through her DNA what happened to her,' District Attorney Mark Benson said in his closing arguments on Tuesday. After the Tuesday decision, Bartelt was remanded to prison while Blodgett's father made a statement saying 'nobody won today'. 'Dan’s family is a beautiful family that provided a loving . environment. They’re great people. I feel horrible for them, today. It’s . a huge loss for everybody,” Buck Blodgett told reporters outside the court room, . The jury found Bartelt guilty of first-degree intentional homicide. He also faced charges of  first degree recklessly endangering safety and false imprisonment, for a separate assault. On good terms: Bartelt and Blodgett were allegedly rekindling their friendship at the time of her murder . After his arrest last summer, Bartelt also admitted to attacking another woman just three days before Blodgett's death. The assault happened in Richfield Park on July 12 when Bartelt attacked a . woman just hours after researching serial killers online. The victim said he tackled her to the ground and she believed she was 'going to die' when she luckily wrestled the knife away. Blodgett's father Buck (left) said he felt for Bartelt's parents. Her mother (right) tearfully took the stand this past week to testify about discovering her daughter's body . She held the knife at him and then escaped by driving off in her car. She needed 15 stitches after the incident. Bartelt told police that it was 'a spur of the moment decision...to scare her'. But . it appears Bartelt planned the attack since he made some disturbing . internet searches on serial killers just 30 minutes before. Sentencing is scheduled for October 14, and Bartelt faces a maximum of life in prison. His attorney says he was disappointed with Tuesday's decision and that they plan to appeal after sentencing.","Daniel Bartelt found guilty of first-degree murder on Tuesday .

The maverick MP once told the Rudd Government that Australia was not treating China with 'dignity' Upset potential Chinese partners by naming the wrong company and trumpeting a $60bn deal before it was signed . He set up the Gold Coast United football club with a view to improving his standing in Asia . By . Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . It's a love-hate relationship, years in the making. Clive Palmer, 60, has a long and successful history with China and, more particularly, CITIC Pacific. He was already a very wealthy individual on the back of real estate investments in 2006 when the Chinese company helped him land a $415 million deal in Western Australia's Pilbara region. Now, eight years on, that connection has gone full circle with the now MP for the federal seat of Fairfax locked in a bitter legal battle with the company. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer makes a point during his tirade against the Chinese government on ABC program Q&A . One of the matters concerns a bank account operated by Mr Palmer's company, Mineralogy, for which the billionaire was reportedly the only signatory at the time it all went pear-shaped. CITIC insists that account was to be used only for covering the operational costs of Port Preston, an iron ore port in Western Australia. The allegations centre on two cheques. One, which Chinese officials say, was drawn from this account in 2013 for $10 million which reportedly went to Mr Palmer's Cosmo Development and a $2.17 million amount which was received by PR firm Media Circus. In short, CITIC has accused Mr Palmer of using the $12 million to fund his Federal election campaign. That battle for the seat of Fairfax he won by a mere seven votes, necessitating a recount before his position in the House was ratified. Clive Palmer has been accused of using funds from an account for port operations for his election campaign . Before this fallout, it was, on paper at least, the perfect marriage. Clive Palmer the mining magnate seeking to shore up a long-term business connection with the biggest market in Asia and the Chinese happy to tap into his hold on Australia's natural resources. And such was his commitment to China, with Australia's footballing fraternity extending into the region, Mr Palmer saw opportunity there too when he bought the Gold Coast United soccer club to help improve his profile in China. Remarkably, in order to keep costs down and avoid attendance related fines from the A League, he ordered a cap on 5000 on home games for the club. Long before he labelled the Chinese 'mongrels and bastards', he was regaling the Federal Government about the benefits of working with China and, in fact accused Australian politicians, including then PM Kevin Rudd, of not treating them with dignity. The good old days. Clive Palmer and Junhua Wu of Metallurgical Corporation of China celebrate the China First mining venture in 2009 . That was in 2009 when he insisted the Labor government's trade policies made trade more difficult for Chinese investors than American investors. In an address to the Queensland Media Club he called the policies 'racist' and said there was 'a great cry in Australia about Reds under the bed'. Mr Palmer then argued that 'capital is now in China, it's not in the US' and that Australia had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with China 'if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve.' 'Why should the average American, regardless of his education or qualifications, have the right to invest $950 million in Australia but the ­average Chinese, regardless of how much money he has, is not allowed to invest without our Treasurer saying so?' That pronouncement landed as Mr Palmer's Waratah Coal and Metallurgical Corporation of China were granted major project status by the Commonwealth for the 'China First', a $7.5 billion thermal coal mine in Queensland. It hasn't been all plain sailing though, as evidenced when Clive Palmer saw the opportunity to parlay the WA success in his home state of Queensland, even further. One of the mining projects in the Pilbara region which helped build Clive Palmer's fortune . The billionaire has hopes of replicating his WA mining success back home in Queensland . But in early 2010, as he was trumpeting the success of a $60 billion 20-year deal with the help of the Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, no less, the wheels started to come off. Mr Palmer's gaffe in naming the wrong company was seen as a little more than a bump in the road but then doubts began to surface, first from the vice-president of China Power Holding International, suggesting it was far from a done deal. Doubts which turned to denials by the boss, Li Xiaolin, who also happened to be the daughter of China's then premier, Li Peng. But the larger than life entrepreneur turned politician would not be denied. Late last year he had cause for double celebration - winning a spot in parliament along with the final approval for the massive 'China First' project in the Galilee Basin - which could potentially produce up to 40 million tonnes a year. The ebb and flow of his business dealings took its next twist when CITIC Pacific launched its legal action over the Sino Iron Project. Palmer United Party Senator Dio Wang (left) says he wasn't concerned at or offended by Clive Palmer's comments, telling reporters 'I know he didn't mean that' One of Mr Palmer's companies, Queensland Nickel, put $12.7 million back into the account after media accounts of the incident first emerged. He has countered, claiming to be owed $500 million in royalties by 'the Communist Chinese government'. On Monday night, while pressed on the legal action, he launched into a tirade about Chinese business interests in Australia, accusing Chinese people of trying to take over Australia. 'I'm saying that because they're communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them do it.' Clive Palmer on Monday night . 'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said. He went on to add: 'I’m saying that because they’re communist, they shoot their own people, they haven’t got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we’re not going to let them do it.' 'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We’ve had three judgments in the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Western Australia and an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels. 'I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said. Clive Palmer softened his tone when he took to Twitter but ramped it up again later in a radio interview . That sparked a diplomatic firestorm and the maverick MP did soften his tone somewhat when he took to Twitter. 'My #qanda comments not . intended to refer to Chinese people but to Chinese company which is . taking Australian resources & not paying'. Maverick MP Clive Palmer says his looming court battle with Chinese company CITIC Pacific will reveal all . But in typical style he jumped back into the fry-pan again late yesterday when quizzed on radio whether he stood by the mongrel comment, repeating his 'shooting their own people' claims against the Chinese government. 'They’re a government-owned body that executes people in China, doesn’t give them the right of free speech, doesn’t allow them to talk on the radio like I am now … they have one day trials, they don’t have any democracy. 'I feel for the Chinese people that live under such tyranny. 'I think (they're mongrels) if they do that to people and kill them and shoot them, which they do do, and they don’t have elections. I don’t think that’s the sort of values that we have in Australia.' And today, in a statement, he has tried to close off the controversy by saying the comments he made were meant for 'one Chinese state-owned company that has failed to honour its agreements and announcements made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early 2006'. 'I have been an admirer of China and its people for many years,' he said. 'The Palmer United Party is very fortunate to have in its ranks Australia’s first mainland-born Chinese Senator Dio Wang. I have been a major supporter of the Chinese for a long time. 'What is unacceptable is a Chinese state-owned enterprise that abuses the legal system for commercial gain in a global strategic effort to control resources. 'I cannot support any deterioration of the living standards or the wage systems that any Australian or other person living in this country are entitled to under Australian law. No amount of money, no amount of lobbying should blind us from the duty to protect,' he added.","CITIC Pacific was responsible for one of his biggest wins back in 2006, now that same company threatens to bring him down .

"By . Candace Sutton . At the very moment Jodhi Meares's drink-driving case was being heard in court her fashion label was posting pictures spruiking her designs on Tuesday. Meares was a no-show at Waverley Local Court, where her lawyer asked for an adjournment and told registrar Paul West a crash investigator was examining her wrecked Range Rover, which ended up on its side after a crash in Bellevue Hill in June. Police allege she recorded a blood alcohol level of .181, almost four times over the legal limit, after the incident. She is yet to enter a plea. Scroll down for video . The image posted on Instagram on Tuesday (left) as Meares's drink-driving case was being heard in court. The former model has kept a low profile since the accident in June . While the matter was being heard, her fashion label posted a picture of a model with flowers in his beard and The Upside, the name of her company, on his T-Shirt. 'Spring is almost here, next stop summer,' the message read. Meares also posted a video, saying how she was in New York shooting her spring/summer collection. At court, her lawyer, prominent Sydney solicitor Chris Murphy, applied for an adjournment while an expert looks at the vehicle. 'We have engaged an accident investigation service to take a full analysis of the vehicle and the scene,' he said.'The car's only a Range Rover, four to five years old. The wreck is being examined.' Jodhi Meares's Range Rover lies on its side after she crashed it in Rose Bay in June, allegedly while she was over the drink-drive limit . Meares, 43, is charged with high range drink-driving, which Mr Murphy said would be 'short matter' when it was heard later this month. He said police had dropped two charges against her, including driving while her licence was suspended. Ms Meares, the ex-wife of billionaire Australian casino mogul James Packer and currently engaged to rocker Jon Stevens, was arrested in June after the accident in which she collided with parked cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Jon Stevens was seen running errands for his fiancee Meares in the days after the accident while the former model kept her head down . At around 9.45pm on Saturday, June 21, she turned off  New South Head Road into O'Sullivan St, Bellevue Hill. Witnesses said the vehicle then jack-knifed and flipped on to its side and she had to be pulled from the wreckage. The case was adjourned until August 20. Mr Murphy entered no plea on her behalf.

"By . Martin Robinson . and Mark Duell . Irish Daily Star Editor Michael O'Kane has resigned in the wake of his decision to publish topless photos of Kate . Ireland is set to introduce new privacy laws after the Kate Middleton topless photos scandal - as a newspaper editor who published the pictures was tonight suspended from his post. Irish Daily Star editor Michael O’Kane . was put on leave while an investigation is carried out into why the . paper published the photos. It came as Alan Shatter, the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, decided to revive abandoned legislation amid the continued fallout from the holiday images of the Royals. His comments that some of the country's print media place no value on a right to privacy come amid reports the Irish Daily Star could be shut down after its decision to publish the photos. ‘It is clear that some sections of the print media are either unable or unwilling in their reportage to distinguish between prurient interest and the public interest,’ Mr Shatter said. The Government will reopen privacy legislation first proposed several years ago. Mr Shatter said some print media place ‘perceived financial gain’ ahead of ‘any principled freedom of expression’. More than 100 jobs would go in Dublin if the Irish Daily Star shut. Its co-owner Richard Desmond reacted furiously to the decision to print the photos that have caused anger in Britain. Mr Desmond, whose Northern & Shell group also owns the Daily Express and Daily Star in the UK, . has said he will take 'immediate steps' to close the paper because . it splashed 13 pictures of the nude Royal across its pages. The decision to print was made by the Irish Daily Star's editor . Michael O’Kane, who did not inform Mr Desmond that they would use the images taken with a long lens in Provence earlier this month. 'I am very angry at the decision to publish these photographs and am . taking immediate steps to close down the joint venture,' Mr Desmond . said. Scroll down for video . Controversial: The front page of the Irish Daily Star printed the pictures, which put the future of the paper in jeopardy . New laws: Alan Shatter, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, has taken the dramatic decision to revive abandoned legislation amid the continued fallout from the holiday images of the Royals . 'The decision to publish these pictures has no justification whatever . and Northern & Shell condemns it in the strongest possible terms.' Even if the paper survives, as its other owner Independent News . & Media (INM) would like, Mr O'Kane's position looks very precarious . after the Palace said his decision was 'motivated by greed'. Angry: Media baron Richard Desmond last night announced he was taking immediate steps to terminate his involvement with the Irish Daily Star . If the paper is saved from the chopping block it will probably lose the right to use the Daily Star name. 'On behalf of INM, I wish to offer my deepest apologies,' INM chief executive Joe Webb said. 'We are launching an internal inquiry to ensure there will never be a repeat of this breach of decency.' The Irish Daily Star's newsroom is said to be gripped with 'fear, panic and dismay' today. The National Union of Journalists in Dublin criticised Mr Desmond's . threat to shut down the Irish operation and accused him of double . standards on the basis of some of his business interests, including the . adult Television X channel. Seamus . Dooley, the general secretary of the Irish NUJ, said the media mogul's . threats are just to 'ingratiate himself with the British establishment . in the post-Leveson environment.' The . Daily Express has been blasted for its coverage at times, particularly . some of its stories on the disappearance of Leicestershire child . Madeleine McCann. Independent . News and Media, which owns 50 per cent of the paper, has issued a . grovelling apology but may still support the title. Relaxed: Kate and William continued to enjoy their tour after they heard the news. Here, they are pictured on a boat ride to Tavanipupu in the Solomon Islands . Prince William and wife Kate wave to the crowds on a truck decorated as a canoe as they depart Honiara International Airport on the Solomon Islands . All smiles: Kate and William's Diamond Jubilee tour was a huge success despite the problems that dogged the couple . It believes full closure would be 'disproportionate'. All British papers have refrained from publishing the photographs, including the Sun, the only British title to run pictures of William's brother Harry cavorting naked in a Las Vegas hotel last month. Mr O’Kane, editor of the Irish Daily Star, sought to defend his decision as his future looked increasingly in doubt. ‘The Duchess would be no different to any other celeb pics we would get in, for example Rihanna or Lady Gaga,’ he said. ‘She’s not the future queen of Ireland . so the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the UK, and they . are very, very tasteful pictures.’ The Irish Daily Star did not refer in today's edition to the decision to re-run pages from French magazine Closer, the first to publish the images. But it did carry photographs and a story about the latest stage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's trip to the Solomon Islands. Fun: While the storm over the topless  photographs of Kate continued to rage elsewhere, they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree . In their stride: William and Kate stroll along a canopy bridge in the rainforest determined not to let the embarrassment derail their foreign tour . Ireland's Press Ombudsman said at the weekend that no complaints had been made to its office over the Irish Daily Star. The office does not normally discuss complaints before investigations have been completed. An investigation by the newspaper's Irish-based shareholder, Independent News and Media (INM), is being launched although it has already warned that it viewed publication as a 'poor editorial decision'. Labour MP Steve Rotheram, . a member of the Commons’ culture, media and sport committee, said: 'Publishing these pictures in Ireland was totally unacceptable. 'Newspaper . owners should act responsibly. Desmond may say he didn’t know about all . this but is it right for such a proprietor to continue to own a British . newspaper after this? I’m not convinced it is.'","Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter is reviving abandoned privacy legislation .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A young father-of-one who came down with a common cold in November has since lost three limbs and skin from his face after it developed into a horrific flesh-eating bug. Alex Lewis, 34, had to have both of his legs and his left arm amputated after his feet, fingertips, arms, lips, nose and part of his ears turned black. His major organs shut down and the keen golfer, who has a three-year-old boy called Sam, spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body. Warning: Graphic content . Alex Lewis, 34, initially thought he had a common cold but was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with a blood infection which developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. Doctors said he only had a three per cent chance of survival . The nightmare started only four months ago when Mr Lewis, from Stockbridge, Hampshire, started suffering from a common cold. However, as his symptoms worsened, medics at Royal County Hospital, in Winchester, Hampshire, soon diagnosed him with blood infection Group A streptococcus - a normally harmless bacteria the body should filter out. But devastatingly, in Mr Lewis's case it developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome with doctors warning he had only a three per cent chance of survival. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Lewis recalled how he went to bed early one night in November feeling unwell, only to wake at 2am, passing blood in his urine. His skin turned purple, his eyes dilated and he was rushed to hospital, where staff later told his partner Lucy Townsend, he wouldn't make it. But he survived and hopes one day to walk again on prosthetic 'blade runner' legs. Mr Lewis, from Stockbridge, Hampshire, said: ‘In a strange way it is the most amazing thing I have ever lived through. ‘I think nothing but good will come from it. I think you cope because you have to. If you don't, chances are you will probably die. ‘We have all got a resilience within us but it just doesn't get tested. As a family we have been tested in the last four months to the max. The father-of-one, from Stockbridge, Hampshire, underwent a serious of gruelling operations in December and January during which surgeons amputated both of his legs and his left arm . ‘But you have to make the best of the situation, realise what you have got, not what you haven't got.’ Miss Townsend, aged in her early 40s, who owns Michelin Pub of the Year The Greyhound on the Test, in their village, feared the worst after the doctor’s diagnosis. She said: ‘All his internal organs broke down so he was straight on dialysis. ‘His kidneys were the first to stop. Then his lungs, his kidneys, his heart followed. ‘Everything was shutting down so when we got to intensive care they said “go and say goodbye”, basically. ‘They took me to a room and told me there was a three per cent chance of his survival. Mr Lewis, who has a three-year-old boy, now hopes to learn to walk again on prosthetic 'blade runner' legs. He said: 'My life will never be the same again, our family life will never be the same again but I feel lucky to be alive' ‘They said if he makes it through the night he will be lucky. It was just so surreal. ‘Hours earlier he had been at home with Sam and now here he was fighting for his life.’ Gangrene set in while Mr Lewis was being treated at Royal County Hospital but against all odds he pulled through and was transferred to Salisbury District Hospital, Wiltshire, where he was told there was only one option to save his life - amputation. During December and January, he underwent a series of major operations where surgeons cut off his three limbs and even took muscle from his back to rebuild his dead right arm. Mr Lewis said his three-year-old son Sam's reaction when he lost his lips was worse than the excruciating pain and the 14inch scar on his back from the operation. Mr Lewis said his three-year-old son Sam's reaction when he lost his lips was worse than the excruciating pain and the 14inch scar on his back from the operation . He said: ‘He thought it was chocolate on my face and so when I lost my lips he refused to go near me. ‘He could get his head around the legs and the arm, but then last Saturday he came the closest he's come to me since it happened. ‘I put my arm stump out and touched him and I said, “Look at that” and he said, “No, get off”. Surgeons cut off his three limbs and even took muscle from his back to rebuild his dead right arm in a series of gruelling operations . ‘But then I flexed my bicep even though it was agony and he just fell about laughing, he absolutely loved it. Doctors now hope he may one day regain feeling in his right hand, after completing the work last month. He is soon to be transferred to a specialist unit to be fitted with prosthetic limbs and undergo rehabilitation. Mr Lewis said: ‘I've got no use of my fingers yet, but they hope in time the tendons and muscles will finally work their way through. ‘I may get the use of my thumb and forefinger but otherwise it may be another amputation. ‘The fact I have my hand is amazing. ‘I've learned along the way that all the quadruple amputees I've met through either war or illness say the one thing they'd kill for is a hand. ‘So I was very lucky that surgeons here could save it.’ The keen golfer is focusing on the future, including competing in amputee competitions and walking his labrador Holly again. He said said: ‘It's a huge game changer. ‘My life will never be the same again, our family life will never be the same again but I feel lucky. ‘I'm lucky to be alive today. Mr Lewis said: 'In a strange way it is the most amazing thing I have ever lived through. I think nothing but good will come from it. I think you cope because you have to. If you don't, chances are you will probably die' ‘To be able to have the chance to walk the dog with my son again in the countryside, something as simple as that, just like I used to. That’s amazing. ‘I think you realise how precious life is. It sounds corny but it's so true.’ Serious invasive strep A infections are rare, with only an estimated one in every 33,000 people developing it a year in England. It is usually treated with injections of antibiotics for seven to 10 days. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove or repair damaged tissue. Around one in four people who develop an invasive strep A infection will die from it. Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin . Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if entering parts of the body where not usually found such as the blood, muscles or the lungs. The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores. Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body’s defences,  is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs. Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are called Necrotising Fasciitis (infection of muscle and fat tissue) and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs). The early signs and symptoms of Necrotising Fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. The early symptoms of Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain.","Alex Lewis, 34, was forced to have both legs and his left arm amputated .

"By . Damien Gayle . Grubby: Cleopatra's Needle in Central Park, New York City, which is to be cleaned by laser to eradicate more than 130 years of accumulated grime . Conservationists will use lasers to clean more than a century's worth of New York City grime from Cleopatra's Needle. The project to restore the ancient Egyptian monument, which towers above the east side of Central Park, will also fix sections that have become weak with age. The hieroglyph-inscribed granite pillar, also known as the Obelisk, has stood in the city for more than 130 years. It hasn't been cleaned since its arrival from Egypt. The plan to restore the 3,500-year-old Cleopatra's Needle was announced yesterday by the Central Park Conservancy. The non-profit, which manages Central Park, said tests showed that cleaning with lasers proved to be the most environmentally friendly method, and also the most sensitive to the fragile stone. It is understood that the heat from the lasers will vaporise the filth that has accumulated on the Obelisk over the decades it has stood in the heart of the busy, polluted city. With 2,112 square-feet of surface area to clean, it is a considerable job. The project began this month and is expected to take several months to finish. Alongside the cleaning job, conservationists will also work to stabilise sections of the Obelisk that have become weakened over the ages. After conducting the first comprehensive survey of the monument's surface in its history, they will use glue to make sure that it will be able to weather the next couple of thousand years. Brought to New York in 1881, Cleopatra's Needle is without a doubt the city's most-ancient structure. Despite its name, the Cleopatra of renown had nothing to do with its creation and, in fact, it predates that legendary Egyptian queen by more than a thousand years. It is one of two obelisks carved by stonemasons out of single lumps of red granite about 3,500 years ago in the ancient Egyptian city of Heliopolis. Both New York's Obelisk, and its twin, which sits by the River Thames on London's Victoria Embankment, are inscribed with hieroglyphics praising the Pharoah Thutmose, who reigned from 1479 to 1425BC. It is believed that the pair were originally erected outside a temple, but were then toppled and burned by invading Persians rampaging through Egypt in 525BC. They lay buried in the sands of the Sahara for more than five centuries before Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus discovered them and transported them to Alexandria, where they were re-erected in a temple built in his honour by Cleopatra. Through the ages: The Obelisk is shown on the left in a photograph taken in 1881, just months after it was erected in New York's Central Park. It is without a doubt the young city's most-ancient structure . There they stood until the late-19th Century when, during a surge in interest in Egyptian antiquities, the country's government offered one to Britain and the second to the U.S. In a massive undertaking, a cargo vessel, the SS Denton, was built in an English shipyard especially for the job of transporting America's needle across the Atlantic, a journey of a month. Then, once it arrived at Staten Island's docks, a railway was built especially for the task of transporting it to its new position at the heart of the city. It was finally erected in Central Park on January 22, 1881, with a full Masonic ceremony that was watched by thousands of New Yorkers. Central Park: The restoration of Cleopatra's Needle was announced by the Central Park Conservancy . Twin: Cleopatra's Needle on the Victoria Embankment in Westminster, central London . The Conservancy has called the restoration of Cleopatra's Needle 'the most comprehensive conservation of the monument in nearly 130 years'. In a release, it said: 'The conservation project was developed by the Conservancy with assistance from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. 'Planning the project began in 2011 and included photographing and scanning the Obelisk to document its condition, as well as a comprehensive survey of the monument’s surface, the first in its history. 'Planning also included testing various methods of cleaning the Obelisk; cleaning with lasers proved to be the method most sensitive to the stone and most environmentally friendly. 'Egyptologists from the Metropolitan Museum of Art believe that fragile areas discovered on the monument’s surface are the likely result of environmental stresses that occurred more than one thousand years ago, as well as natural weathering. 'After they are cleaned, these areas will be treated with adhesive products typically used to conserve granite.' The conservation work is expected to be complete by autumn.","Monument has not been cleaned since it was put up in Central Park in 1881 .

"By . Rob Davies . Preventive measures: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is set to announce new rules designed to prevent a house price bubble . Measures to curb risky mortgages will be unveiled on Thursday by the Bank of England in an attempt to stop surging house prices hitting the economic recovery. Official figures show property costs soared 10 per cent in the year to April, fuelling fears that the property bubble could burst, triggering a new financial crash. Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney is set to respond on Thursday by announcing new rules designed to prevent a house price bubble that could burst, triggering a new financial crash. Economists expect the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, chaired by Mr Carney, to take steps aimed at the largest and most risky loans. These are expected to include a new affordability test to assess whether borrowers could afford to keep up mortgage repayments if interest rates rise. The FPC could also opt to put a cap on the size of loans relative to a borrower’ s salary, in response to a rise in the number of loans that are more than 3.5 times a borrower’s salary. The Bank has dropped heavy hints that it could increase the base interest rate from its record low of 0.5 per cent before the end of the year. Rock-bottom borrowing costs have encouraged people to rack up higher debts and the Bank fears that a rise in rates could spark a wave of loan defaults as people struggle to meet the increased cost of repayment. Mr Carney is expected to tell banks to test whether borrowers could still afford to pay back the mortgages if rates were to soar to seven per cent or more. Strict rules introduced by the Mortgage Market Review in April have already forced lenders to test how mortgage customers would cope with steep rate rises. But while the MMR already recommends applying the seven per cent test, Mr Carney is widely expected to make the use of this threshold mandatory, or impose an even higher one. Some analysts expect Mr Carney to go even further, by promising to impose a ceiling on the amount that people can borrow as a multiple of their annual income. This would echo measures taken by state-backed lenders Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, which have set a limit of four times a borrowers’ annual earnings on all loans above £500,000. New mortgage rules: The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee are expected to target the largest and most risky property loans . The FPC also has the power to recommend changes to the government’s controversial Help to Buy scheme, which has been the main factor driving a boost to first-time buyer lending. The intervention comes after Chancellor George Osborne gave the FPC new powers to force banks to rein in home loans. Both Mr Carney and Mr Osborne paved the way for action on the housing market in their annual Mansion House speeches earlier this month. ‘The Bank of England should not hesitate to use these new powers [to curb home loans] if they think it is necessary to protect financial stability’ said Mr Osborne. Efforts to cool the property market come despite evidence showing that the MMR has already put a dampener on home loans. Mortgage approvals for house purchases fell for a third month running in April to a nine-month low of 62,918, according to the Bank, having risen for 11 months in a row up to January. But many forecasters expect house prices to keep rising, with the fall in mortgage approvals put down to banks taking time to adjust to the new regime laid down by the MMR. Nationwide is due to release figures this week showing prices were up 11.2 per cent on last year during June, according to analysts at economic research group IHS Global Insight. ‘We expect house prices to increase by around 5 per cent over the second half of 2014 with gains spread across the country,’ they said. The FPC’s decision on what to do about rising house prices has already been taken at last week’s quarterly meeting but the Committee will not flesh out the detail of its plans until Thursday. The Committee was set up by George Osborne to prevent asset bubbles, such as a housing boom, posing a threat to Britain’s financial stability.","Bank of England set to announce attempt to prevent property bubble .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . It's a phrase you never stop hearing: the modern woman can have it all. But for one in four women aged 45 or over in Britain, one thing they will never have is a family of their own. Helen Burke, 39, from Basingtoke tried for a baby for 15 years: from the age of 22, all she wanted to do was have children. Fifteen years on and ten rounds of IVF later, she started going though the early menopause aged just 37, ending her dreams of ever becoming a mother. Scroll down for the video . Having family is one of most women's priorities, but soon one in four will reach 45 without having a baby (posed by model) Helen put off going to university in order to start a family straight after getting married, with her main aim in life being having a brood of children living under her roof. The thought of it never happening had never even occurred to her. She told MailOnline: 'I spent 15 years in a baby bubble, it was all I ever thought about. 'My whole life was focused on having a baby, when I wasn't having treatment I lived my life in four week cycles. 'I stayed in really dull jobs because of the maternity benefits they would offer, I lived extremely healthily. 'I tried various different fertility drugs, I also tried herbal Chinese teas, which were foul. 'I was told that cough medicine might help, so I took that even when I didn't have a cough. 'Anything somebody said, I would try.' Struggling to conceive can place serious strain on a couple's relationship (posed by model). Helen Burke believes the problems affected her first marriage, she said: 'Not being able to have children certainly wasn't the only reason that we broke up, but it definitely had an impact.' The strain of trying for a baby didn't just impact on Helen's own emotional health - she and her first husband divorced when was 30. She said: 'This is my second marriage. I was first married at 22 and we started trying for children immediately, but then we were divorced by 30. 'Not being able to have children certainly wasn't the only reason that we broke up, but it definitely had an impact, especially when all of our family and friends were having children. 'Then I started another relationship at 32, which was with is the man I am now married to. 'So we only went through five years of trying for a child together.' During the 15 years of trying, like most women who are struggling to conceive, Helen's situation was made more difficult by several other factors in her life, including her friends having babies, but also the comments and questions about her struggle that came from well-meaning individuals. She said: ""We're really lucky in that we've been really open with our friends, so they're great, but that's not to say it hasn't been hard at times. 'There were always conversations that would crop up with people who wanted to know why I didn't have children yet. 'We call them ""Bingos"" at Gateway Women - the community for childless women that she attends - Bingos are the same conversations that you have with lots of people. 'People try to be helpful and discuss the issue, but you just get the same questions over and over again. Even when women have overcome the upset of being unable to conceive, the stress and emotions can rise again when their friends and family members become grandmothers. 'They think that you haven't considered a whole load of things, when of course you have - it's all you think about. 'Things like, have you thought about adoption? Of course!' Then two years ago, Helen was given the news she had been dreading - that she would never be able to get pregnant. She said: 'I was 37, which although it is quite young compared to most people in my situation, wasn't really for me because I started trying when I was 22, so I had done a 15-year stint. 'I was told the only option was adoption or egg donation and I initially thought, ""Yes! Let's try that!"" 'But for various reasons, my husband and I have decided it wasn't right for us. 'So I had this moment of realisation - that this thing I had wanted for so long was never going to happen. 'I had a lot of grief and went through a very difficult time after that, there was a while when I couldn't see anyone with children anymore. 'It broke me. 'And of course, I do still sometimes look at my friends who have kids and think that could have been my life.' But after two difficult years, Helen and her husband have now come round to the idea of having life without children. She said: 'Being honest and open about it really helped me. 'We don't hear about women that pregnancy doesn't happen for, we only hear about the miracles cases - the ones where it works, . 'Going to Gateway Women has been a massive part of my recovery. 'I am now studying psychology at Open University - I am very interested in what makes people work.' And apart from that, she and her husband are just waiting to see what the future will bring them. She said: 'Sometimes when you're in my situation, people think you must do something really amazing with your life, but we decided we're happy as long as our life has meaning to us. 'Because you put so much pressure on yourself when you are trying for a child that it is nice to just calm down for a bit afterwards.' Helen is now sharing her story in an effort to help any other women who may be going through the same situation. Wanting a family of your own is one of the most natural things in the word, but more and more women are now reaching middle age without giving birth. She said: 'I spent about 15 years in this baby bubble and I never once heard anyone who had been in my situation talk about it. 'I think it's because it's just too scary, people don't always want to listen that things don't always work out, that life isn't fair. 'It's still a taboo. 'But what I'd like to get across is if you are in this situation, there are people who can help - it's not the end of the world. 'I don't want to belittle what I went though because it broke my heart not being able to have a baby, but you can come out the other side of it and things do get better.' Helen was talking out as part of a BBC Radio 4 programme called A Life Without A Child, which can now be listened to on BBC iPlayer, which talks to three women about what it means to be childless. The show addresses the taboo of being a woman with no kids and the trauma and stress of years women go through to try and make that happen.","Helen Burke, 39, had been trying for children since she was 22 .

Instead he became a local entertainer, organising what he described as Britain’s first disco in 1948. His work in the dance-halls was eventually spotted and he was asked to move on to radio where he rapidly acquired national fame, first with Radio Luxembourg and then BBC Radio 1. He later competed as a semi-professional sportsman, taking part in the 1951 Tour of Britain cycle race and a professional wrestler. He fought 107 bouts but won just seven, insisting it was never fixed. In 1964, Sir Jimmy presented the very first edition of Top Of The Pops. In the 70s, he started a 20-year run as host of Jim'll Fix It, working miracles for more than 1,500 children.

"By . Lucy Waterlow for MailOnline . A 20-year-old zoo keeper from Pembroke, Wales, has become the leader of a pride of lions. Rosie Badger will be responsible for the day-to-day upkeep of six African lions at Pembrokeshire Zoo, Folly Farm. At 250kg each, the big cats are four times petite Rosie's own weight and they can reach a height of over 8ft tall when they stand on their hind legs. Rosie, along with the rest of the team at Folly Farm, has undergone extensive training to prepare for the role and said she can't wait to get stuck in. Lion tamer: Rosie Badger gets to work feeding the 250kg animals . Dream job: The 20-year-old has always wanted to work at a zoo . She said: 'I've always dreamed of not only working at a zoo but working with big cats like lions but I never imagined it would become a reality.' 'I've really enjoyed all the training we have done and am totally ready to take on my new role. I literally can't wait to work with such amazing animals on a day-to-day basis. I feel extremely honoured to be given the role and trusted with looking after the pride.' Rosie has been taught about the strict safety procedures she must undertake when entering and leaving the enclosure to ensure the safety and well-being of both her and the lions at all times. She has also learned about the general behaviour of the lions, their diet and how to keep them stimulated. Zoo manager Tim Morphew said: 'I chose Rosie to be one of my lion keepers because when working with lions, trust is fundamental and I trust her explicitly. Not only is she very passionate about lions, she is meticulous and responsible and a proper stickler for routine which is extremely important when it comes to lions. New home: Folly Farm has a new two-acre enclosure for the wild animals . Be prepared: Rosie has an animal science degree and has had full training to ensure the safety of herself and the lions at all times . 'She is a highly capable zoo keeper and will make a brilliant keeper for our new lions.' After spending her childhood dreaming about working in a zoo, Rosie joined Folly Farm in Kigetty in 2012 after completing her Animal Science degree at Pembrokeshire College. Since then she has been working as a carnivore keeper with everything from giraffes to squirrel monkeys, enabling her to gain experience with a huge variety of animals and develop and enhance her zookeeper skills. Rosie will be responsible for feeding the lions as well as cleaning out their enclosure . Having now landed her dream job as a lion keeper at Folly Farm, Rosie will be responsible for feeding the lions as well as cleaning out their enclosure and looking out for their health and well-being. She will also need to ensure that the lions are constantly stimulated by hiding their food and making them hunt for it and providing them with toys to play with. The arrival of the lions at Folly Farm marks the completion of a £500,000 project to build a purpose-built, state-of-the-art two-acre enclosure for the lions at Folly Farm. It will also highlight the valuable work the attraction already does with UK charity Wildlife Vets International as part of its commitment to conservation, raising awareness and funds for in-situ big cat conservation projects. The lion's new enclosure will be made up of four dens and visitors will be able to see the lions clearly in the house due to large glass viewing windows. These 39mm thick, laminated, bullet proof windows also provide clear and unrestricted views of the lions from three vantage points within the perimeter fence surrounding the outside enclosure. Alongside the lion house is an education centre, themed as a fully-equipped ranger's hut, which will provide visitors with information on African lions and the work carried out by rangers in the wild to monitor and protect them.","Rosie Badger will be responsible for upkeep of six African lions .

The Manliest Man competition is encouraging men across Great Britain to 'Man Up and Check' for the early signs and symptoms of the disease. Rebecca Porta, chief executive of Orchid, said: 'Every day 6 men in the UK aged 15-45 will be diagnosed with testicular cancer. 'Despite these statistics over 70 per cent of men still don’t know how to examine themselves. 'Even more alarmingly, a further 20 per cent have never even thought about self-examining. 'We want to change this with the help of the Manliest Man competition.'","Fast and Furious actor, who dates Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, topped poll .

"By . Jane Asher . My friends have always called me a magpie. I'm drawn to all that glitters and working as a TV, film, and stage actress since the age of five, I've been lucky enough to come across my fair share of bling, some real, some very fake. Over the years though I've gradually learnt that less is often more and tried to temper my tastes, and budget, to match. So it was with great excitement that I heard about Poundland's new jewellery range. As a lover of costume jewellery, I know that dramatic and wildly glamorous necklaces can cost from almost nothing to thousands of pounds, but £1? Surely that doesn't even stretch to a decent clasp . To see how convincing cheap jewellery is - and whether it's ever worth forking out a fortune for - I put eight necklaces priced between £1 to £1,000 to the test. Feels expensive . Fooled: Jane thought this necklace was expensive . This must cost hundreds. The stones are beautifully iridescent with shimmering blues, purples and greens and, in places, layered upon one another. It looks as if it's been carefully put together. The distressed gold chain is glitzy but not too shiny and it feels weighty and substantial. A carefully considered neckline is essential as it's so wide it almost touches my shoulders. This would work will with a strapless gown or boat-neck top. GUESS PRICE: £500 . REAL PRICE: £29.99 . zara.com . Simply charming . Sweet but cheap: But costs more than a £1 . Sweet but uninspiring, the chain looks breakable and I worry this wouldn't last more than a couple of outings. The woven gold design is nothing terribly special and little thought has gone into its length which comes up an inch too short. It’s probably the cheapest of the lot and could cost £1 but it's perfectly acceptable to fill in a neckline and worn with the right thing could pass for gold if you didn’t look too closely. GUESS PRICE: £1 . REAL PRICE: £14 . accessorize.co.uk . Striking and elegant . Thumbs up: Jane didn't guess this was the cheapest . Clearly this comes from the lower end of the High Street. It looks simply put together and is so dainty it could blow away in a strong wind. Having said that, the asymmetric leaf design is striking and elegant and the gold metal reflects the light and sits beautifully. I'd happily buy and wear this during the day layered over a simple white T-shirt or with a plunge-neck evening gown. GUESS PRICE: £20 . REAL PRICE: £1 . poundland.co.uk . Pricey but garish . Too much: Doesn't look expensive . You have to be in the right mood for this. It's brash, over-the-top and luminous with an Aladdin's cave of colours and sparkling jewels. It looks the most expensive as a lot of work seems to have gone into crafting it, with so many intricate settings. The clasp is gold-plated and robust. There's no chance of this slipping off into the soup during supper but it's far too overwhelming for me to wear. Though probably expensive, oddly enough it makes me feel cheap. GUESS PRICE: £1,000 . REAL PRICE: £580 . Shourouk jewel and neon stone necklace, benna.co.uk . Gaudy glitter . Plastic looking: But it costs £70 . On stage this would be great as you'd assume it was real diamonds but up close it looks like cheap glitter, probably from Accessorize or somewhere similar. The design is pretty enough, but I shy away from silver and plain crystal as it washes out my fair complexion. I'd rather save up for a real diamond than buy this plastic looking piece of frippery. GUESS PRICE: £30 . REAL PRICE: £70 . Crystal necklace, stelladot.co.uk . Lovely but flimsy . Favourite: Jane loved the colours . From afar this looks like tacky fairground jewellery but once on, it's one of my favourites. Sitting comfortably around my neck, it doesn't twist or pucker. The deep greens, blues and turquoises are almost ethereal but the clasp is depressingly bulky yet flimsy. It looks like it might break easily. I would wear this, but reckon it's on the cheaper side... GUESS PRICE: £50 . REAL PRICE: £279 . Rada necklace, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161 . Style over substance . Flimsy: But this one costs £1,000 . This looks like a pretender. It's matte gold with sparkly jewels trying to look like diamonds and rubies. Some of the spiky edges dig into my neck and no matter how I adjust it it won't lie flat. I wrestled with the clasp, too. The design is faintly art deco and I can imagine Wallis Simpson gadding about in something similar, but there is no finesse to the finish. I wouldn't spend too much on it. GUESS PRICE: £100 . REAL PRICE: £1,000 . Andy Farrow 18ct gold plated necklace, wolfandbadger.co.uk . Egyptian chic . Wearable: Looks expensive . What a classy necklace. Rows of carefully set stones, shiny gold and threaded ribbon gives this a slightly Egyptian feel. I’m often intimidated by oversized, overly gaudy items - I find they look too young on an older person - but this is wearable and dramatic without being try-hard. I’d happily wear it with simple evening dresses. GUESS PRICE: £250 . REAL PRICE: £55 . Adele Marie black and gold necklace, grayandosbourn.co.uk .

"By . Louise Cheer . A decision to ban a same-sex couple from a school ball has been overturned after a 250-signature petition called for its reconsideration. James Fallon High School Year 11 student Sami Burgess wanted to take her girlfriend, Karlina Macartney, to a presentation ball at the school on September 19. But when the 17-year-old asked her principal at the Albury school - in rural New South Wales - for permission, Sami told The Sydney Morning Herald she was rebuffed and told it was 'socially unacceptable' for her to bring her 21-year-old partner. Sami Burgess (left) and her partner, Karlina Macartney (right) were initially refused permission to attend the school ball together . After telling her friends about what happened, it sparked a petition that garnered more than 250 signatures. When the decision was overturned, Ms Macartney took to Facebook to rejoice. 'Thanks...everyone for the support, Sami Burgess deserves happiness and so does the future same sex couples,' she wrote. A NSW Department of Education spokesman said the school's principal had denied using the words 'socially unacceptable' in her conversation with Sami. Sami is a Year 11 student at James Fallon High School in NSW's south in Albury . Sami Burgess (right with Ms Macartney) claims the principal told her it was 'socially unacceptable' to bring her girlfriend . 'The initial decision was not made because of the partner’s gender,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was based on the long-standing practice of encouraging students to select partners from within Year 11 or when that was not possible to avoid choosing someone with a significant age difference or a current boyfriend/girlfriend. 'The principal finalised the decision after reconsidering the strength of the student's commitment to the issue and discussion with the student's parents.' The spokesman also added: 'James Fallon High School strongly fosters the value of respect for all and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sexual preference, politics, age or disabilities.' Sami said the overturning of the decision was for all gay people, not just her. She revealed another of her classmates asked to take their same-sex partner to the ball but did ask because they thought they would be refused. 'I want this to be for everyone in every school,' Sami told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'Everyone should have the right in society to be able to go as a same-sex couple.' Despite this setback, Sami said the school's staff had been supportive of her in the past.","Sami Burgess wanted to take her girlfriend, Karlina Macartney, to the ball .

"By . Anna Edwards . Over two-thirds of people (69 per cent) believe litter and graffiti make . an area look rundown - but this doesn't stop us from littering . We may have a reputation as being a reserved lot, but the British are actually a nation of rule-breakers. A study has found that many people break 260 rules a year - but we can't really claim to be dare-devils as, for most of us, this brush with danger involves using a neighbour's bin or pinching stationary from the office. Research shows that the average Brit knowingly breaks five rules every week, which amounts to 16,250 acts of rebellion in the average adult lifetime. Dropping cigarette butts and sticking chewing gum to surfaces are among commonly flouted decencies, according to the report by cleaning specialists Karcher. Cycling on the pavement, using other people's Wi-Fi and ignoring 'do not walk on the grass' signs are also sins we regularly commit. But less than a fifth of us (18 per cent) actually feel guilty about these little misdemeanours. Other common acts of defiance include sneakily trimming a neighbour's hedge, not returning library books or sitting in a reserved train seat. Meanwhile, stealing sachets of sauce from cafes, parking on double yellow lines and pretending children are younger to pay cheaper entrance fees are shady acts Brits are frequently guilty of. Nearly half of us (41 per cent) blame 'being in a rush' for disregarding rules and laws, and many of us struggle to see the victim in many of our mini crimes. The study, of 2,000 adults, found two thirds (68 per cent) only feel guilty if the wounded party is obviously a small business or single person rather than a large corporation. But it seems we're utterly hypocritical, taking a very dim view of others' transgressions. Nearly half of us (41 per cent) blame 'being in a rush' for disregarding rules and laws, and many of us struggle to see the victim in many of our midsdemeanours . We are infuriated when we witness other . people neglecting the environment, with those who don't pick up dog mess . being the most annoying by far (75 per cent). Six in ten are wound up by those who throw litter from a car window (59 per cent), 57 per cent annoyed by dropping chewing gum on the floor and leaving litter on the train or bus riles 44 per cent. Over two-thirds of people (69 per cent) believe litter and graffiti make an area look rundown, with other bug-bears including unkempt gardens (59 per cent) and cigarette ends on the floor (49 per cent). Eighty per cent says it makes them feel proud when their area has been tidied up - and there's no graffiti in sight . How our street, local area or community area looks certainly affects our mood, with 80 per cent saying it makes them feel proud when their area has been tidied up. And it can also impact property values. Research shows external mess and signs of neglect can wipe 5 per cent off the price, equating to an 8,000pounds loss on the average UK property. Run in conjunction with charity Keep Britain Tidy, the 'Karcher Cleans Britain' campaign encourages people to clean up their streets and keep them tidy throughout 2013. Psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University, says we break rules we don't perceive as serious. Prof Cooper CBE said: 'Only certain groups of people will break these rules, and they do it because they don't really see it as serious. 'They might rationalise something like dropping litter to themselves as 'Well, I pay my taxes for someone to pick up after me'. 'Other very legalistic structured types will adhere to the rules no matter what. It's about priorities - rule breakers don't see the rules they flout as a priority. 'As for looking down on others who break rules, human beings are very idiosyncratic. 'We will adhere to certain rules ourselves and castigate others for not doing so, but hvae no qualms about brekaing other rules. 'Clearly, Brits see these minor municipal rules as insignificant but of course if everybody broke them there would be no books in the library and rubbish all over the place.' Prof Cooper said behaviour would change if authorities issued on the spot fines or if members of the public told offenders off. 1. Crossing a pedestrian crossing when man is red - 33 per cent . 2.

"By . Jennifer Smith . Glennis Brierley was stabbed four times by her schizophrenic son . A paranoid schizophrenic stabbed his mother to death after convincing himself his parents were part of a satanic paedophile ring. Matthew Brierley killed his 64-year-old mother the day after he moved back into her home in Littleborough, Rochdale. The 45-year-old called 999 from a phone box in the town centre after the attack, telling officers: 'I've just killed somebody.' He pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court. Glennis Brierley had been stabbed four times in the neck and chest by her 'delusional son', it was heard. On December 14, he attacked the grandmother-of-two before alerting emergency services to her address. The court heard how 'alarm bells starting ringing' when he discovered ornaments were missing from his mother's attic. An argument ensued in which his mother threatened to report him to social services. In interviews with detectives, Brierley said: 'I just went for her. I threw her down and got the knife and stabbed her. I was aware I’d just stabbed my mother and I didn’t have any response to it.' He said he had previously considered killing both of parents who he thought were part of a 'paedophile syndicate'. He went on to tell police about young girls who had gone missing in the Rochdale area. Matthew Brierley attacked his mother at herhome in Littleborough (pictured) before phoning police from a phone box in the town centre . Prosecuting Raymond Wigglesworth QC said: 'It’s clear from the psychiatric history that over the years (Matthew Brierley) has harboured a number of delusional beliefs and one of those was that his parents were members of Satanic paedophile conspiracy. 'He claimed to be in fear of them.' Recommending that he be sentenced to a hospital order, forensic psychiatrist Dr Andrew Haddock told the court Brierley’s ‘actions were driven by mental illness’. Brierley will be sentenced at 10am tomorrow.","Matthew Brierley stabbed his mother in the neck and chest four times .

"By . Stephen Wright . and Emine Sinmaz . Charged: 83-year-old Rolf Harris is the biggest name to face trial as a result of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree . Rolf Harris maintained his nine-month long silence over sex allegations yesterday as he was charged with indecently assaulting two under-age girls in the 1980s. The 83-year-old entertainer did not comment publicly after Operation Yewtree detectives also charged him with downloading four indecent images of children last year. The married father-of-one is the highest profile celebrity to be charged as a result of the Yewtree probe, which was set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal. But he has not issued a formal statement on the allegations since he was first quizzed by police last November. There was no sign of Harris – a favourite of the Queen – at his riverside home in Berkshire yesterday and no mention of the developments on his website. His lawyer and publicist did not return messages requesting a statement. Harris is charged with six counts of indecently assaulting a girl aged between 15 and 16, from 1980 to 1981. Each offence carries a maximum two-year sentence. He is further charged with three offences of indecently assaulting a girl aged 14, in 1986. As a result of a law change, which increased the punishment for offences committed after 1985, the maximum jail term is ten years. The TV presenter and acclaimed artist is also charged with four offences of making indecent images of a child between March and July 2012. The offence carries a maximum ten-year sentence. After spending nine months investigating the allegations against Harris, including making well-documented background inquiries in Australia, Scotland Yard passed a file on the case to the Crown Prosecution Service on August 12. Media interest: Press outside the home of Rolf Harris in Bray, Berkshire, today, after the CPS announced the charges against him . Alison Saunders, chief prosecutor for . CPS London, said: ‘Having completed our review [of the evidence], we . have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public . interest for Mr Harris to be charged with nine counts of indecent . assault and four of making indecent images of a child.’ Harris will . appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 23. In public: Harris was interviewed under caution on November 29 last year after his house was searched, and has been rarely seen since - shown here in January . The . entertainer was interviewed under caution by detectives on November 29 . last year, five days after a search warrant was executed at his home in . Bray near Maidenhead. He was formally arrested over the allegations on . March 28 but although he was widely named on Twitter as being a Yewtree . suspect, he was not identified by the mainstream media until April. Yewtree . has been run in three strands – claims involving Savile, those . involving Savile and others, and those involving others. Harris is being . dealt with under the ‘others’ strand, meaning the allegations have no . link to Savile. The . Australian, who painted a portrait of the Queen in 2005 and performed at . her Diamond Jubilee concert last year, has been a family favourite for . decades. He had his first musical hit Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport in . 1960, and continued to enjoy success in the industry, gaining cult . status in recent years and performing at Glastonbury festival several . times. He also proved . popular as a television presenter, getting his first big break in 1967 . when he began hosting his own BBC1 programme, The Rolf Harris Show, . before moving on to children’s television in the 1980s and then to . Animal Hospital, which he hosted from 1994 to 2004. At work: Rolf Harris, 83, was pictured performing earlier this month at the Wickham Festival in Hampshire . Honour: Rolf Harris painted the Queen to celebrate her 80th birthday in 2006, and is known to be well-liked by Her Majesty . Harris, . who has lived in Bray for more than 50 years, was awarded an MBE in . 1968, an OBE in 1977 and a CBE in 2006, and was made Officer of the . Order of Australia in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list last year. At . last summer’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris . famously led the crowd in an impromptu rendition of Two Little Boys, his . 1969 Christmas No 1 hit. Harris’s wife is the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes. They met while they were both art students, marrying in 1958. They have one daughter, Bindi, a painter, now aged 49. His . friends were in shock after he was charged yesterday. Veteran singer . Vince Hill, who has known the Australian celebrity for more than 50 . years, said: ‘I can’t find words to describe my shock and disbelief. This just isn’t the Rolf I know.’ Hill, . 82, admitted his biggest worry was for the star’s ailing wife Alwen. ‘She’s crippled with  arthritis, suffers problems with her hips and . knees and is in her 80s,’  he said.

"House of Horrors: The Elm Guest House in Barnes, London, the alleged base for an establishment paedophile ring . A victim of an alleged establishment paedophile ring told yesterday how  he was ordered to wear a fairy costume before being abused. The orphan was 13 when he and his 12-year-old brother were sent by staff at their  children’s home to the Elm Guest House for ‘a treat’, it  is claimed. He said boys were plied  with alcohol . before being told  to pose for pictures wearing  girls’ clothing. The . men at the guest house – said to include MPs and pop stars – would then . abuse the children after pretending to play hide-and-seek, the victim . said. More than a decade after leaving care, the victim’s brother, Peter, killed himself six days after his 28th birthday. A line in his suicide note which appeared to refer to his ordeal read: ‘I will get those b*******.’ The . former guest house in Barnes, south-west London, is now the centre of a . police investigation into an alleged child sex abuse ring in the late . 1970s and early 1980s. Police are examining claims that children from . the Grafton Close Children’s Home were taken to the guest house to have . sex with men. During a . police raid on a property in central London last month detectives seized . a list of names of high profile alleged visitors to the guest house. As . reported in Saturday’s Daily Mail, the list includes a number of senior . MPs, two pop stars, a high-ranking policeman, a leading tycoon, an . official from the Royal household and traitorous Soviet spy Anthony . Blunt. Cyril Smith, the late Liberal MP, has already been named as a regular at the guest house. Yesterday . the victim, known only as Dave, said: ‘The people responsible have . blood on their hands. I shouldn’t think my brother is the only one to . have taken his life because of this. I’m speaking out now because I want . justice done for me and for my brother. What went on was absolutely . disgusting. ‘When we told . the staff at the care home what was happening at Elm they used to say: . “They are friends, they are good people”. No one was listening to us. It’s taken 30 years for anyone to listen.’ Dave, . who now has young children of his own, told how he and his younger . brother were taken into care after their widowed mother killed herself . following years of depression. They were sent to Grafton Close . Children’s Home in Hanworth, west London, in 1978. Dave . was 13 when minibus outings to the Elm Guest House began. ‘We were told . we were going to the “good house” for a party,’ he told a newspaper. ‘It wouldn’t be more than a handful of us at a time. When we got there it was a huge house.’ Howe Saturday's Daily Mail reported the story . Sir Cyril Smith was known as a regular at the Elm Guest House . He said the children would be escorted through reception without signing the guest book and taken to a back room where parties were held. ‘There would be easy-listening music playing, sort of mellow stuff, and loads to drink,’ Dave said. ‘Sometimes there would be two adults there, other times more. They laid on tables with beer and cider. We would have races to see who could drink it first. ‘They used to make us dress up, make us put on outfits like fairy costumes meant for girls, then play games of hide-and-seek with the adults looking for the kids.’ When the children were ‘found’, they were forced to take part in appalling sex abuse. Dave added: ‘There would be flash bulbs going off when someone was taking pictures. ‘I can remember all the adults had posh accents. They used to say things like “He’s cute, he’s nice”. They would pick out the pretty boys, especially the ones who looked young for their age.’ Last week Dave was visited by two officers from Scotland Yard’s Operation Fernbridge, which is investigating the case. Dave’s testimony echoes that of former child protection worker Chris Fay, who says he was shown photos of children dressed up at ‘Kings and Queens parties’ at the guest house. One photograph is said to show a former Tory Cabinet minister in a sauna with a naked 14-year-old boy.","Boys were allegedly plied with alcohol before being told to wear girls' clothes .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Actor Bill Roache, 81, appeared at Preston Crown Court for a preliminary hearing to fix a trial date over alleged child sex offences, which he denies . Coronation Street star Bill Roache will face trial in January over allegations of historic sexual offences against five girls. The 81-year-old actor, who was charged in May with two counts of raping a teenage girl in 1967, appeared at Preston Crown Court today so a trial date could be set. The actor, who has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, last week faced fresh charges of five indecent assaults involving four girls aged between 11 or 12 and 16. He denies all the charges. Roache appeared today for a five-minute preliminary hearing and was bailed until his next court appearance on September 2 when he will enter formal pleas. His trial date was fixed for January 13. Last week, Roache’s lawyer said his client was looking forward to standing before a jury to 'vigorously protest his innocence' over 'deeply upsetting' child sex allegations. The world's longest-serving soap actor will not be appearing in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded. Today he entered the dock in Court 10 and spoke only to confirm his full name. Scroll down for video . He was granted conditional bail by the Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC. The latest claims arose from the publicity over his arrest at his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, on May 1, and his subsequent charging on the same day. The fresh charges, which relate to separate alleged victims, are said to have been committed in the Manchester area in 1965 and 1968. Roache is on bail with various conditions including residence, no direct unsupervised contact with anyone under 16 and not to approach named witnesses. Fellow Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity. He denies the charges, which are not linked to Roache. Roache appeared at Preston Crown Court this morning for a preliminary hearing that lasted just five minutes .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Death-defying robots that crawl over spacecraft are a familiar sight in science fiction films. But in reality, how would they stick to a surface travelling at thousands of kilometres per hour while remaining mobile? The European Space Agency (ESA) believes it has the answer: a hull-crawling ‘gecko robot’ that uses tiny microfibres to attach to almost anything. Scroll down for videos... A wall-crawling robot inspired by the gecko has taken a small but important step towards a future in space. The tiny legged prototype could be the forerunner of automatons which crawl along the hulls of spacecraft, cleaning and maintaining them . The space agency has now created a tiny legged prototype that could be the forerunner of automatons which crawl along the hulls of spacecraft, cleaning and maintaining them. Its footpads are covered with dry microfibres modelled on the toe hair of the gecko, which is celebrated for its ability to scuttle up windows and along walls yet not leave a trace. The lizard does the trick through millions of ultra-fine hairs called setae, which interact with the climbing surface to create a molecular attraction known as the van der Waals force. Pictured is a microscopic view of mushroom-shaped Gecko-inspired 'footpad terminators' used to stick climbing robots on vertical surfaces. The micrometre-scale terminators are sufficiently tiny that atomic interactions between them and the surface come into play . Abigaile-III’s footpads are covered with dry microfibres modelled on the toe hair of the gecko. A gecko’s feet are sticky due to a group of tiny hairs with ends just 100–200 nanometres across – around the scale of individual bacteria. This is sufficiently tiny that atomic interactions between the ends of the hairs and the surface to create a molecular attraction known as the van der Waals force, . Van der Waals forces are relatively weak electric forces that attract neutral molecules to one another in gases, in liquefied and solidified gases, and in almost all organic liquids and solids. The force comes from fluctuations in charge distributions between neighbouring molecules, which need not be polar; their charge fluctuations naturally fall into synch, creating an attractive force. Researchers at Canada's Simon Fraser University first built a 240-gram (eight-ounce) tank-like gecko-bot, using tracks with microfibre treads. They then developed this into a six-legged climbing robot, nicknamed Abigaille. ‘This approach is an example of biomimicry, taking engineering solutions from the natural world,"" said team leader Mike Henrey. The dry adhesive that helps Abigaille climb walls has now been put through its paces at a materials-testing lab at ESA's European Space and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Replicating the vacuum and temperatures of space, but not the zero gravity, the tests found that the adhesive 'worked like a charm', the agency said. ‘A depth-sensing indentation instrument was used inside a vacuum chamber to precisely assess the dry adhesive's sticking performance,’ said ESA specialist Laurent Pambaguian. ‘Experimental success means deployment in space might one day be possible.’ Abigaille's six legs each have four degrees of freedom, which enables the ‘gecko-bot’ to shift from horizontal to vertical environments. Dry adhesives in space are compelling because other options have to be ruled out for safety reasons. Sticky tape isn’t possible because it collects dust, becomes less sticky over time and in a vacuum gives off fumes. Magnets are out too as they cannot stick to composite surfaces and their magnetic field could affect instruments. The robot clings to surfaces using a gecko-inspired dry adhesive technology. ESA testing shows it is, in principle, workable in the vacuum conditions of space . And Velcro is also excluded, as it needs a mating surface of hooks - and these can break off and become a hazard. Gecko setae are microscopic: their ends are just 100-200 nanometres, or 100-200 billionths of a metre, across. By comparison, the human hair is around 100,000 nanometres in diameter. ‘We've borrowed techniques from the micro-electronics industry to make our footpad terminators,’ said Mr Henrey. ‘Technical limitations mean these are around 100 times larger than a gecko's hairs, but they are sufficient to support our robot's weight.’ One of the Abigaille wall-crawler robot's six feet, with six degrees of freedom for agile climbing and dry adhesives on its footpad to keep it stuck to surfaces .","A prototype, named Abigaille, has footpads covered with dry microfibres .

"By . Anna Edwards . The report found that victims often received little support if the abuse was discovered . Gangs of Asian men who groom and sexually exploit children have been targeting Muslims within their own communities as well as white girls, a damning report has revealed. The study shows that offenders will target vulnerable youngsters of the same ethnicity - but rely on the Asian and Muslim culture of honour and shame to mask their vile crimes. The Muslim Women's Network UK report focuses on Mulsim and Asian abused children, who they say have been sexually exploited but overlooked by authorities because they are too frightened to speak out. The worrying study follows a series of high profile cases about gangs of Asian men who have targeted white girls. But the report exposes how in the majority of cases offenders will groom members of their own community, feeding them drink and drugs and silencing them with promises of marriage to conceal the abuse. It also reveals that victims were already vulnerable to being sexually exploited by gangs, as they had a limited knowledge of sex, suffered from disabilities, or were seeking to escape a harsh background. The MWNUK claims there has been a 'deafening silence' surrounding this particular group of victims, pointing to the Asian and Muslim culture of honour and shame, which stops many victims speaking out about sexual abuse and seeking help. They also say that the culture of men holding the authority and women must be respectable means that the abused females will often stay silent about their experiences, for fear of not being believed by their community. The report found that victims often received little support when abuse was discovered. Asian and Muslim female victims are most vulnerable to offenders from their own communities as the overwhelming majority of the offenders were from the same background as the victims . It said: 'When the family became aware of . any abuse they re-victimised them, which meant not believing them, . blaming them, forcing them into a marriage, forcing them to leave the . family home and in one case forcing the victim to have hymen repair . surgery prior to a forced marriage. Consequently the report claims that this vulnerable portion of society are often overlooked by statutory services and not identified as victims as they have not spoken up either to authorities or their own communities, who could have helped them. The report identified how groups would target youngsters, typically using an older peer of the victim to play the role of 'older boyfriend'. Baroness Warsi said the problem has largely, and tragically, gone unnoticed in the past . The targeted girl would be presented with gifts by the 'boyfriend', given rides in expensive cars and promised love and marriage, before being introduced to older men and the campaign of abuse would begin. Sometimes she would be plied with drink and drugs, so she would not know the extent of her abuse or even how many men had violated her. The shocking report found the gangs would rape the victims, beat them, burn them with cigarettes and film them being exploited on webcam. Blackmail was a key way of controlling victims and ensuring their silence, the study discovered, as gangs threatened their victims with dishonour and shame should they speak up. Honorary president and MWNUK's co-founding member Baroness Haleh Afshar OBE said: 'These case studies indicate that, contrary to media studies that accuse Muslim men of grooming non-Muslim girls, the majority of the abusers were from the same ethnic /faith background as the victims and perpetrators targeted girls that were most vulnerable and accessible to them. 'Like their non-Muslim counterparts some of the victims were silenced by fear of violence against them or their family, others had an emotional attachment to their attackers and others feared that they would not be believed by their own family and others. 'In addition, the attackers relied on the deep sense of honour and shame in their family and community to silence and control their victims.' In June MPs said public officials must stop 'tip-toeing' around race when tackling child sex gangs and claimed that there is a trend of Asian gangs targeting youngsters. A dangerous trend of Pakistani men grooming young white girls does exist, according to a Commons home affairs committee report. Police, . prosecutors and social workers must be able to raise the issue without . fear of being accused of racism, the committee said. But . it warned against stereotyping offenders because there is no . straightforward link between race and child sexual exploitation. In . shocking conclusions to a year-long inquiry, MPs said there were still . areas where victims were being failed by the authorities. Rochdale . and Rotherham councils were accused of being 'inexcusably slow' to . realise sex abuse was taking place on their doorstep. And . they said both councils had a 'woeful lack of professional curiosity' and were responsible for the 'appalling consequences of their . indifference to the suffering of vulnerable children'. The report found that older men who targeted their own relatives would often intimidate their terrified youngsters into silence and, if necessary, use violence or arrange a forced marriage to mask their abuse. The analysis collected 35 cases of abuse over five months, and had to speak to those who knew the victims and may have helped them, as victims were reluctant to speak of the abuse personally. Key findings found that: 'Asian and Muslim female victims are also vulnerable to grooming and sexual exploitation and are also being targeted and sexually exploited and include children, young persons (16 to 18 years) and adults. 'Asian and Muslim female victims are most vulnerable to offenders from their own communities as the overwhelming majority of the offenders were from the same background as the victims. 'Asian and Muslim children, young persons and adults have specific vulnerabilities associated with their culture which are exploited and also constitute a barrier to disclosure and reporting.' Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Senior Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Minister for Faith and Communities, said: 'The case studies are finally shining much needed spotlight on a problem that has largely, and tragically, gone unnoticed in the past. 'The cases of Asian and Muslim female victims make for hard reading, but this report, and other research like it, is necessary if we are to take the action needed to stamp out these abhorrent crimes.' Nazir Afazl OBE, the Chief Crown Prosecutor of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'We know that women and victims from minorities are even more reluctant to report these crimes, in part because of honour and shame issues. 'It is the availability of victims coupled with their vulnerability that leads to them being targeted by these predators.' He urged communities and individuals to speak out about abuse if they knew it was happening. The report comes after a series of high-profile child sex gang cases - including five men who were jailed for life in June for 'crimes of the utmost gravity' in Oxford. Child sex gangs have also been caught in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, Cambridgeshire and Rotherham, South Yorkshire.","Older men target girls within their own Asian and Muslim communities .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 21:45 GMT, 30 November 2011 . A whistleblower broke down in tears today as he described the 'terrible' moment he witnessed a professor allegedly viewing child porn in first class on board a flight. Kurt Wade was sitting behind University of Utah professor Grant Smith on a Delta flight from Salt Lake City, Utah to Boston on Saturday. He says he was stunned when Smith began scrolling through images of naked girls as young as five - and immediately alerted a flight attendant. Scroll down for videos . 'Terrible stuff': Kurt Wade, pictured, speaks out about witnessing a fellow first-class passenger viewing child porn. He immediately alerted authorities . He even took a picture of the 47-year-old looking at his screen as proof. 'He kept scrolling through the pictures . and they became sexual and explicit,' he told Fox News. 'Little by little they were . semi-nude, then completely nude. Just terrible, terrible stuff. 'It was kind of sad. Tough stuff to see.' Smith, of Cottonwood Heights, Utah, was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport. The father of two appeared . in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty. He has been held on $75,000 cash bail. Emotional: Wade said he could not get the horrific images out his head . Mr Wade said the experience was extremely distressing. 'Even as I was trying to explain it [to an air steward], I broke down. I couldn't contain it. So disturbing what was going on.' He added: 'When I was in the interview room with forensic computer police down the . hall, they confirmed for me there were other images of sexual activity . with grown ups.' When asked if he considered himself a hero, he added: 'No. I think any common sense person would see this and understand what was going on.' Speaking to the Associated Press, Wade added: ‘I feel bad for a lot of people but mostly for these innocent girls. He’s got two young kids and these kids are innocent victims of their father’s behaviour.’ During the court appearance on Monday, the prosecutor described the events leading to Smith's arrest. In court: Grant Smith, 47, is pictured in court on Monday as he's arraigned. He allegedly watched child porn on his university issued laptop while flying first class . 'Disturbing': Professor Smith is the father of two children. He has been put on leave by the University of Utah, where he has worked for 14 years . He said a flight attendant confronted Smith and told him to shut off his laptop - bought by a . grant from the university. Smith then allegedly tried to delete the offending images from his computer. The images were mostly of girls between eight and 10 years old, naked or nearly naked, engaging in simulated sex acts. 'These . weren't photos of a child in the bath that a parent might keep,' Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said of the images. 'These were explicitly sexual and extremely disturbing.' Some of the pictures were of children as young as six, the prosecutor said. Accused: Smith was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport where police allegedly found images of naked girls as young as five on his laptop . State Police met Smith’s flight and . allegedly discovered 'disturbing images of child pornography' on the . laptop, according to State Police spokesman David Procopio. Attorney and victim's advocate Wendy . Murphy told WCVB: 'The notion that someone would be so bold as to view . it in public is extraordinary and I'm not sure what the explanation is. 'What we have is the equivalent . of a confession. Someone who not only sees it but is smart enough to . take a picture of it is very solid evidence. 'Reporting . it immediately to law enforcement, law enforcement then being able to . do their own immediate investigation - that's a very strong case - at . least at this point.' Investigators from Massachusetts State . Police told NewsCenter 5's Cheryl Fiandaca that Smith was travelling to Boston to attend a . conference for the Material Research Society. Smith, a materials . science and engineering professor, has two bachelor’s degrees and a doctorate, and has worked at the university for 14 years. Forced out: The University of Utah, where Smith has taught for 14 years, has put him on leave. If the allegations prove true, he will be dismissed . On his court appearance, he stared . into the distance and did not speak. His lawyer entered the not-guilty . plea before Judge Kenneth Desmond. The University of Utah has placed Smith on administrative leave pending the criminal investigation. 'Professor Smith deserves a full and fair investigation into this issue,' the statement said. 'The . University of Utah, however, has no tolerance for the viewing or . possessing of child pornography by any of its employees, regardless of . where it occurs.' If the allegations prove true, he will be immediately dismissed. Smith has a pretrial hearing set for December 27. See below for videos .

"By . Sophie Borland . and Claire Bates . Smoking cannabis is just like eating junk food and shouldn't be a criminal offence, a controversial report claims today. The UK Drug Policy Commission says drug-taking is simply another 'moderately selfish' or 'risky' behaviour, similar to gambling or a diet of burger and chips. It also says it should not be a criminal offence to grow cannabis for personal use. And rather than trying to ban drugs . completely, the Government should concentrate on ensuring that addicts . take substances 'responsibly', the report's authors say. Cannabis: A report by the UK Drug Policy Commission says drug-taking is simply another 'moderately selfish' or 'risky' behaviour . The commission's findings were condemned by campaign groups. Mary Brett, of Cannabis, Skunk, Sense, which aims to prevent the use of drugs, said: 'They just haven't thought it out. Drugs are illegal because they are dangerous. Cannabis is getting stronger each year. 'People haven't grasped how cannabis affects the brain. It contains chemicals within the plant that stick in the brain cells. This impairs the transmission of all the other chemicals that carry out functions in the brain.' According to the commission, a new approach is . needed because the rapid creation of new drugs was changing the market . too quickly for the traditional methods used to control it. It said the Government's efforts to ban drugs have not reduced their availability – and may have even worsened the situation. So rather than trying to prevent their use 'entirely', ministers should focus on limiting the damage with an overhaul of current drug laws. Professor Colin Blakemore, who helped write the report, said the Government needs to reform its drug policy . The report states: 'Just like with gambling or eating junk food, there are some moderately selfish or risky behaviours that free societies accept will occur and seek to limit to the least damaging manifestations, rather than to prevent entirely. 'Seeing all drug use as invariably problematic can reduce the cost-effectiveness of policy. 'Taking drugs does not always cause problems, but this is rarely acknowledged by policy makers. 'We . do not believe that pursuing the goal of encouraging responsible . behaviour requires the prevention of all drug use in every . circumstance.' Controversially, . it also recommends changing the law to allow people to grow small . amounts of cannabis in their homes. This would help 'undermine' the mass . production of the drug illegally. Professor Colin Blakemore, who helped . write the report, said: 'The overwhelming consensus now is that it is . unethical, inefficient and dangerous to use untested and unvalidated . methods of treatment and prevention. It is time that policy on illicit . drug use starts taking evidence seriously as well.' Although the commission called for Parliament 'to . revisit the level of penalties applied to all drug offences' it stopped . short of calling for the decriminalisation of most . drugs. The commission is an independent charity set up in 2007 to analyse drug policy in the UK. It is not funded by the Government and claims not to have any particular 'standpoint'. This is the final report from the charity, which will shut down in December. Although drug use in Britain has fallen in recent years, it is still higher than most other countries. About one in ten adults has taken an illegal substance in the past year compared to a global average of one in 20, the report states. Some 42,000 people in England and Wales are sentenced each year for the possession of drugs, with about 160,000 people given cannabis warnings, it added. No harm done? The controversial study likens smoking cannabis to eating junk food . A Home Office spokesman 'welcomed' the UKDPC's contribution to the drugs debate. However, they said: 'We remain confident that our ambitious approach to tackling drugs – outlined in our Drugs Strategy – is the right one. 'Drug usage is at its lowest level since records began.' Dame Ruth Runciman, the UKDPC chairwoman, said UK governments have done much to reduce the damage caused by drug problems, including needle exchanges and investment in treatment for addicts. But she added: 'Those programmes are supported by evidence, but much of the rest of drug policy does not have an adequate evidence base. 'We spend billions of pounds every year without being sure of what difference much of it makes.'","Government should focus on 'damage limitation' rather than wholesale banning of drugs, says UK Drug Policy Commission .

Then, this week, the second half of Rodriguez's remarkable 'dream' came true, as the papal conclave selected Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now known as Pope Francis. Since then the remarkable prediction has since become a media and viral sensation, and by Saturday morning, the message had been re-tweeted 83,000 times.

"By . Mario Ledwith . and Chris Parsons . Updated: . 17:32 GMT, 3 March 2012 . Murdered: Jill Dando was gunned down on the doorstep by a Serbian hitman, it was claimed last night . BBC presenter Jill Dando was one of two journalists ‘executed’ by a Serbian hitman in a revenge attack, it was claimed last night. The allegation was made by a Serbian widow whose husband was killed in similar circumstances just 15 days before Miss Dando’s murder in April 1999. Branka Prpa said she was convinced that her husband and the former Crimewatch presenter were targeted by the same killer after insulting Slobodan Milosevic’s brutal regime. Her husband Slavko Curuvija was also a TV presenter, and an outspoken critic of the dictator. He was shot in the head outside his Belgrade home on April 11. According to historian Miss Prpa, Miss Dando’s appearance in a BBC appeal on behalf of Kosovan-Albanian refugees made her a target for the hitman. She said: ‘I think there is a link between Dando and Curuvija. I think they were both executed. ‘There were a whole range of people defined by the regime as political enemies who were assassinated at the beginning of the war. ‘They would simply kill you and walk away. When you look at this timeline of killing it is quite clear that it is part of the same context.’ The widow pointed to a range of similarities between Miss Dando’s murder outside her West London home on April 26, 1999, and that of her husband. Both were high-profile journalists who were returning home when they were assaulted, then shot in the head. Rumours have flourished throughout the past decade that a contract killer, possibly hired due to Britain's role in the Serbian conflict, was behind the Crimewatch star's ruthless killing. But instead police focussed their investigation on Barry George, the loner who lived near Ms Dando's home in Fulham, west London, and who seemed obsessed with guns. He was convicted of her murder in 2001 and jailed for life – before being freed on appeal in 2008. At his first trial, Mr George’s barrister, Michael Mansfield, QC, contended that one possible motive for the killing was a Serbian death squad taking revenge for the bombing of a Belgrade television station. Mr Mansfield produced a National . Criminal Intelligence Service report which said that after the bombing, . the Serbian warlord Arkan put out a contract on Sir John Birt, then BBC . director-general. Haunting: A CCTV image of Jill Dando shopping just 40 minutes before she gunned down outside her home . Murder scene: Police officers cordon off Jill Dando's road in Fulham, south London, following the shooting in April 1999 . Branka Prpa said her husband Slavko Curuvija (both left) was killed two weeks before Ms Dando by the same Serbian hit man. Shortly after Ms Dando death an anonymous caller with a Serbian accent phoned the BBC and told then Head of News Tony Hall (right) he 'was next' Barry . George, now 51, also known as Barry Bulsara, was charged with Jill . Dando's murder in May 2000, 13 months after she was shot dead with a single bullet to the head. A . year after he was charged and after several delays to the beginning of . his trial, a jury convicted him of her murder at the Old Bailey in July . 2001. Four years after . George lost an appeal against his conviction, firearms experts cast . doubt over key evidence centring on gun residue which had helped secure . his original conviction. After winning the right to a second appeal, George changed his legal team and pressed ahead with the legal battle. His . barrister, William Clegg QC, said a microscopic speck of firearms . residue found in the pocket-lining of George's coat had been found . 'inconclusive' as evidence. George was sensationally acquitted of Ms Dando's murder after an Old Bailey retrial in 2008. He has since been refused a reported compensation claim of £1.4m. When Sir John’s security was stepped up, the target was supposedly changed to Miss Dando. Following Mr George’s acquittal, . police were investigating information that a British petty criminal of . Serbian descent boasted of the killing. His alleged confession is said to . have taken place during a drinking session in the Serbian capital in . September 2001. The petty criminal, thought to have been from the West Midlands but of Serbian descent, was said to have confessed to the killing in front of ten people at a bar in Belgrade. A British businessman who witnessed the apparent confession told a Sunday newspaper after the 2001 claim: 'He took a bow because he claimed he had something to do with it. 'He stood up and his friends applauded him strenuously. 'He claimed it was in retaliation over some Serbian TV star singer that was killed in the bombings.' Detectives investigated the apparent confession and interviewed witnesses present at the drinking session, but no one has since been charged with the murder. In 2009 it emerged that an anonymous caller had phoned the BBC after Ms Dando's killing claiming he had killed the presenter over Nato action in the former Yugoslavia. The caller was also said to have told the then BBC head of news that he was next on the hitman's list. The details emerged from a board of governors' meeting held days after the Crimewatch presenter's still-unsolved murder. Head of news Tony Hall told the . governors how he had been phoned with news of the attack while attending . a Broadcasting House meeting with then Director-General John Birt and . other BBC chiefs. He immediately rushed to Television Centre in White City, West London, where he called Mr Birt to say Ms Dando had died. At some point that day or later the mystery caller phoned Mr Hall claiming responsibility for the shooting.

"By . Michael Seamark . Identity revealed: The naming of Stuart Hall and subsequent publicity prompted other victims to come forward . The Stuart Hall case shows why suspects must be named when arrested or charged, open justice campaigners said yesterday. At the time of his arrest, the shamed presenter’s lawyers criticised the Press for identifying him, citing the Leveson report which called for a ban on naming suspects held by police. But Lancashire detectives confirmed that publicity surrounding Hall’s arrest led to further victims coming forward. The former BBC radio and TV star, who had initially denied the allegations, later admitted a string of sex offences against girls. Philip Davies, a Tory MP on the Commons culture committee, said: ‘This is a prime example and perfect reminder for people as to why an open system of justice where people are informed about who’s been arrested or charged is so important. ‘It can encourage other victims to come forward and make sure those people who are guilty of offences are brought to justice. ‘By maintaining any secrecy over arrests or charges, the only people who benefit from that are criminals who could use it to get away with crimes they have committed.’ There are fears that Lord Justice Leveson’s report on Press standards has encouraged police forces to restrict the public’s right to know who is being arrested and, in some cases, charged. Following his arrest in December, Hall was quick to use the media to protest his innocence – and invoke Leveson. His solicitor, Louise Straw, said: ‘Stuart Hall is innocent of these charges. He is unable to comment further at this stage. Publicity: Open justice campaigners said yesterday that the Stuart Hall case highlights why suspects should be named when arrested . Keeping quiet: There are fears that Lord Justice Leveson¿s report on Press standards has encouraged police forces to restrict the public¿s right to know who is being arrested and, in some cases, charged . ‘It is a matter of concern that in the week following publication of the Leveson Report there appears to have been systematic, measured leaks to the media which have given a misleading impression of what this case is about. ‘Stuart Hall was not afforded the opportunity to attend voluntarily at the police station. In due course the decision that he should be arrested will be the subject of some scrutiny.’ Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the fact that more of Hall’s victims came forward after he was named when arrested was a strong argument for more transparency. Philip Davies, a Tory MP on the Commons culture committee, left, said that the Hall case highlights why suspects in such cases should be named. Solicitor Louise Straw, right, cited Leveson when criticising the naming of Hall after he was initially arrested . He added: ‘There is a huge danger of secret justice replacing rights of the public, and indeed defendants, back to Magna Carta. ‘It is time someone put a stop to this frightening trend.’ The NSPCC said it was also against sex abuse suspects being given anonymity. Spokesman Peter Watt said: ‘When a suspect is named in the public interest – for example when there is a child protection issue – it gives more victims an opportunity to come forward, which helps police build a stronger criminal case.’","Lancashire Police say naming Stuart Hall saw more victims come forward .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Scientists may not have found extra-terrestrial life yet, but they now claim there are far more aliens out there than first believed. Researchers in Scotland believe that Earth-sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought. This means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface. Scottish academics claim cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface . Academics at the University of Aberdeen and University of St Andrews claim the definition of the ‘Goldilocks’ zone -  the area of space around a star, or sun, which can support life – is flawed. They argue this definition fails to take into account life that can exist beneath a planet’s surface. ‘As you get deeper below a planet’s surface, the temperature increases, and once you get down to a temperature where liquid water can exist – life can exist there too,’ said Aberdeen University PhD student Sean McMahon. In the study 'Superhabitable Worlds', Professor Heller proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable. Pictured is an artist's impression of an exoplanet . The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal . for liquid water to . pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry. For . example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain . amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out. How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes. Researchers in Scotland now claim that Earth-sized planets could support life at least 10 times further away from stars than first thought. In a galaxy of 200 billion stars of various types, scientists estimate there are 11 billion potentially habitable planets in the Goldilocks zone as it is currently defined. Factor smaller, dimmer red dwarf stars, and the number of planets with mild temperatures similar to Earth rises to 40 billion. Researchers in Aberdeen claim the figure is much higher. Mr McMahon told MailOnline the number was ‘probably several times’ larger but added that the is difficult to quantify. Mr McMahon's team created a computer model that estimates the temperature below the surface of a planet of a given size, at a given distance from its star. ‘The deepest known life on Earth is 5.3 km below the surface, but there may well be life even 10 km deep in places on Earth that haven't yet been drilled,' he said. ‘Using our computer model we discovered that the habitable zone for an Earth-like planet orbiting a sun-like star is about three times bigger if we include the top five kilometres below the planet surface.’ The model shows that liquid water could survive 5km below the Earth's surface even if the Earth was three times further away from the sun. ‘If we go deeper, and consider the top 10 km below the Earth’s surface, then the habitable zone for an Earth-like planet is 14 times wider,’ said Mr McMahon. The current habitable zone for our solar system extends out as far as Mars, but this re-drawn habitable zone would see the zone extend out further than Jupiter and Saturn. Goldilocks zone is a belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for water to pool on a planet's surface . The findings also suggest that many of the so-called ‘rogue’ planets drifting around in complete darkness could be harbouring life.. ‘Rocky planets a few times larger than the Earth could support liquid water at about 5 km below the surface even in interstellar space, even if they have no atmosphere because the larger the planet, the more heat they generate internally,’ said Mr McMahon. ‘It has been suggested that the planet Gliese 581 d, which is 20 light years away from Earth in the constellation Libra, may be too cold for liquid water at the surface. ‘However, our model suggests that it is very likely to be able to support liquid water less than 2 km below the surface, assuming it is Earth-like.’ So far, scientists have detected about a thousand planets orbiting other stars in something known as the Goldilocks zone. This is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface . Another paper published by the same team suggests there could be more life below the surface of the continents on Earth than there is below the seafloor. Mr McMahon hopes the studies will encourage other researchers to consider how life on other planets might be detected. ‘The surfaces of rocky planets and moons that we know of are nothing like Earth,’ he said. ‘They’re typically cold and barren with no atmosphere or a very thin or even corrosive atmosphere. ‘Going below the surface protects you from a whole host of unpleasant conditions on the surface. So the subsurface habitable zone may turn out to be very important. ‘Earth might even be unusual in having life on the surface.’","Planets thought uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface .
