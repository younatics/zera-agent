Celebrating your golden wedding anniversary and 50 years of happy marriage is a joyful occasion for any couple. More so if you're sharing that joy with four of your best friends who are raising a glass to exactly the same achievement... and even more so if you were coincidentally married on the same day and in the same church as the two other couples. And a trio of septuagenarians have done just that. Norman and Mary Dickinson and Harry and . Jean Winstanley, from Flookburgh, Cumbria, and Alan and Anne Akrigg, . from Cark, Cumbria, were all married at St John's Church in Flookburgh on the same day 50 . years ago in 1963. The couples (from left Mary and Norman Dickinson, Jean and Harry Winstanley and Alan and Anne Akrigg) return to St John's Church, Flookburgh, where they all married on the same day in 1963 . The couples, standing outside St John's Church in Flookburgh (from left, Mary and Norman Dickinson, Jean and Harry Winstanley and Alan and Anne Akrigg) have all remained the best of friends since their big day in 1963 . It was coincidence that all three couples ended up marrying on the same day, but since then they have all remained very close friends. Mr Dickinson, now 77, was proud to marry Mary, now 76, when they said their vows at 11am. The couple had a four-year courtship beginning with a first date to the 'pictures', and now have two sons, Andrew and John. Mr Dickinson said: 'When we had been out a few times, I knew it was love. She was definitely the girl for me.' The couple, who were closely followed down the aisle by Mr and Mrs Akrigg, believe the key to a healthy marriage is a 'good argument now and again'.

Mr and Mrs Akrigg, who met at a young farmers' dance in Ulpha, were next to say 'I do' at 1pm. Mr Akrigg, now 77, said: 'It was only 18 months after that when we got married, but I just knew. She worked at a sweet confectionery shop making chocolates - I knew they were good.' His wife Anne, 73, said: 'Alan was a very good dancer, that was the attraction. We have of course had our ups and downs but we love each other very much. 'I don't believe anyone who says they don't fall out, but you get over it. You have to give and take and you have to stand down even when you think you're right.' The couple have two sons, Richard and Martin, and three grandchildren.

Unlike the other 71-year-olds they said they didn't argue much at all. Mrs Winstanley said: 'My sister married his brother when we were 15. We were the last couple to get married, but it was a surprise to hear about the other weddings as we all went to school together. 'It was a big surprise, we have been really close ever since, and friends for all these years. We both agree to have no secrets and not to fall out over money.'

The upscale Manhattan penthouse that legendary crooner Frank Sinatra had once called home finally has a new owner nine months after it was put up for sale. The sleek 3,200-square-foot, four-bedroom duplex at 530 East 72nd Street, which Andy Warhol dubbed the 'glittering grotto in the sky,' was reportedly sold for $5.49million to the daughter a Chinese tech titan. The name of the home's new owner has not been disclosed. The original asking price had been set at $7.7million when the co-op was first put on the market back in August by Rubicon Property founder Jason Haber and real estate broker Gregory Spock. Star-studded: The old penthouse of Frank Sinatra, pictured, is up for sale . Until recently, the former Rat Pack . pad belonged to Penny Hart, president of Tri-State Consumer Insurance, . who purchased it for 'only' $2.3million in 2010. The swanky pad features many appealing features, including two wrap-around terraces overlooking the East River and FDR Drive, 18-foot ceilings, solar panels and a putting green. During a massive renovation in 2008, a few modern touches were added to the place, including the same futuristic glass staircase as the one in the Apple stores, according to the New York Observer. The duplex was the setting for many a swinging party, even attracting the likes of President John F Kennedy and Hollywood sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. Ol' Blue Eyes: The duplex apartment at 530 East 72nd Street, pictured, is on the market for a cool $7.7 million . Design: Frank Sinatra helped to design the place, pictured, and lived there from 1961 to 1972, but these days it looks quite a bit different . Historic: The sprawling unit, pictured, was once called the 'glittering grotto in the sky' by Andy Warhol . After . divorcing second wife Ava Gardner in 1957, Sinatra snapped up the . duplex, which occupies the 22nd and 23rd floors, and the space was . transformed into a four-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment worthy of Ol' Blue Eyes himself. Sinatra helped design his luxurious duplex and construction was completed in 1961. The singer called it home until 1972. Sinatra met, married and then divorced Mia Farrow while living there. The jewel in the penthouse's crown was a glassed-in, rooftop party room . where guests would mingle under 18-foot ceilings and enjoy sweeping . views of the river.

His star-studded guest-list often included fellow Rat Packers Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. It is even claimed that Davis used to enjoy throwing empty champagne glasses from the terrace onto the street. One party included appearances from President Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and avant garde artist Andy Warhol.

The singer sold the apartment in 1972 to his personal physician, celebrity doctor Denton Cox, whose other clients included Judy Garland and Warhol. When Cox died his estate was sold to insurance magnate Penny Hart in 2008 for $4.5million. Because Cox had done very little to maintain the penthouse, Hart made many renovations and turned a section of Sinatra's legendary party space into the master bedroom.","New York apartment was the setting for many a Rat Pack party .

The camera goers flying after the elephant takes offence to its presence . Hope they were waterproof: Mr Souders went through a number of cameras getting the shots . But the costly lesson did not deter the American as he went through several expensive cameras, ranging between £395 to £3,945. He said: 'Elephants are intelligent and curious creatures so I wasn't surprised that he inspected the camera with his trunk, sniffing at it delicately. 'But the utter contempt and disdain when he picked it up and gave it a toss, that hurt my feelings a little.' He added: 'If I had to guess, he was merely annoyed that there was this silly, clicky thing in the way of where he wanted to drink.' Camera-shy: A camera gets a soaking from the bemused beast . Success: Despite the numerous setbacks the tenacious photographer got the up close and personal pictures he wanted . Mr Souders also placed cameras in Nxai Pan National Park and along the Botete River in Makgadigadi Pans National Park. He planted them at the edge of watering holes, using his past experience to guess where the elephants would wander. The 52-year-old then operated the camera by remote from a truck 30-50m away.

'So I put the cameras out there and let them take the risks. It's all off-the-shelf gear that anyone could buy. You just have to be willing to watch it get destroyed. 'It's sort of a Buddhist thing I've unintentionally cultivated of late, avoiding attachments to material things.'

In a surprise jailhouse interview just hours after a jury began deliberating her fate, Jodi Arias spoke out about her murder trial, her many fights with her legal team and her belief that she 'deserves a second chance at freedom someday'. Arias repeated many of her claims from previous interviews, testimony on the witness stand and her statements to the jury earlier on Tuesday as she pleaded for mercy. Her further stints of self-promotion came as the jury were unable to reach a decision on Wednesday on whether Arias should be sentenced to death. The judge sent the jury back out to deliberate until 4.30pm (MST). If jurors are unable to agree, then the judge will declare a mistrial for death penalty phase only and a new jury will be brought in. Scroll down for video . Delusional: Convicted killer Jodi Arias speaks during an interview from jail in Arizona on Tuesday where she said that she had not received a fair trial and deserves freedom one day . She also provided some new information . about her case and how she believed her lawyers let her down by not . calling more witnesses who could have bolstered her claims that she was a . victim of domestic violence at the hands of Travis Alexander. Arias was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the June 2008 stabbing and shooting death of her one-time lover in what prosecutors described as a cold, calculated killing carried out in a jealous rage. Arias has maintained all along it was self-defense. he jury began deliberating Tuesday as they worked to determine whether she should live or die for her crime. If the jury opts for a life sentence, the judge will have the option of determining whether she spends the rest of her days behind bars or is eligible for release after 25 years. Arias acknowledged it was unlikely she would ever be released, but believed she deserves a second chance. Following her conviction last week, she told a local TV station that she preferred the death penalty. She said on Tuesday night that she changed her mind after a tearful meeting with family members that same day, realizing that her death would only cause them more pain. 'I felt like by asking for death, it's like asking for assisted suicide and I didn't want to do that to my family,' she said. Jailhouse talk: Arias gesticulates as she talks to the media in a series of interviews she gave on Tuesday . Dramatics: Arias applied full make-up and carried a comb to fix her hair between interview slots . Arias said she fought from the beginning to keep cameras out of the courtroom to limit the media spectacle, and believes that the jury should have been sequestered. She stated flatly that she did not receive a fair trial. 'The prosecutor has accused me of wanting to be famous, which is not true,' she said. If Jodi Arias receives the death penalty, she will become only the fifth woman sentenced to death in Arizona since 1973. As of January this year, there were 63 women on death row in the U.S. - accounting for 2 per cent of the death row population of 3,125 people. In the last century, more than 40 women have been executed, including 12 since 1976. The last woman who received the death penalty was Teresa Lewis of Virginia on September 23, 2010. She received the lethal injection for murdering her husband and stepson in 2002 in order to claim life insurance. Although Arias's trial has drawn global attention for the brutal killing of boyfriend Travis Alexander, twisted lies and sordid details of sex, there is much gruesome competition among previous death row inmates. Serial killer Aileen Wournos of Florida was executed by the state of Florida in 2002 after being sentenced to death a decade earlier.She admitted to murdering seven men all of whom she said had raped her while she worked as a prostitute. Her story was turned into a 2003 Oscar-winning movie, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as her lesbian lover. However, Arias has sought the spotlight at every turn, providing TV interviews and even using a third-party to tweet throughout the trial. Arias repeated her claims that she never wanted to go to trial in the first place but instead wanted to reach a deal with prosecutors on a second-degree murder count that would have carried a maximum of 22 years in prison. However, she said, 'no deal was offered'. She gave the interviews on Tuesday after the judge lifted an order barring jail officials from arranging any media requests. The judge did not elaborate on the . reason for the ruling, but Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office . quickly began making the media arrangements that lasted late into the . night. A shackled Arias wore makeup for the . interviews and showed up in a jail classroom with a comb in hand as she . fixed her hair for the cameras. When pressed for details on some of her . conflicting stories, she was mostly evasive, citing advice from her . attorneys and possible pending appeals. She was also asked about the conflicts she had had with her two court-appointed lawyers, Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott. Arias said she wanted at least three . people called as witnesses who could have testified to having seen . bruises on her neck 'when I was choked out' by Alexander but she said . she was rebuffed by her lawyers. The prosecutor insisted her claims of self-defense were an exaggerated attempt to avoid being convicted. She . said her lawyers 'felt a little betrayed' and blindsided by her . post-conviction interview but that they gave their blessings for Tuesday . night's interviews, warning her to be cautious. Arias . said she sometimes wishes she'd never met Alexander, 'just because of . how ultimately everything ended and I say that for his sake and mine - . not just a selfish thing'. Fashion statement: The murderer accessorized her Maricopa County uniform with a wool sweater and open-toe sandals... and shackles . She said if the attack never occurred and she never crossed paths with the victim, she would likely now be a happily married 32-year-old with children, good finances and a successful wedding photography business. Earlier on Tuesday, Arias told jurors she planned to use her time in prison to bring about positive changes, including donating her hair to be made into wigs for cancer victims, helping establish prison recycling programs and designing T-shirts to raise money for domestic abuse victims. Arias became emotional as she . displayed for jurors photos of her friends, boyfriends and family . members, including newborn relatives she has met only from behind bars. She asked jurors to reject the death penalty for the sake of her family. 'I'm . asking you to please, please don't do that to them. I've already hurt . them so badly, along with so many other people,' she said. 'I want . everyone's healing to begin, and I want everyone's pain to stop.' Ranting: Convicted killer Jodi Arias tearfully pleaded with jurors to spare her from a death sentence on Tuesday during a bizarre 25-minute testimony . Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, shot in him in the forehead and slit his throat, nearly decapitating him, before leaving his body in his shower to be found by friends about five days later. 'To this day, I can hardly believe I was capable of such violence. But I know that I was,' Arias told jurors. 'And for that, I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life.' Her speech to jurors came a day after her attorneys asked to be removed from the case, saying the five-month trial had become a witch hunt that prompted death threats against a key witness in the penalty phase. They also argued for a mistrial. The judge denied both requests. Alexander's family showed little emotion as Arias' mother, father and sister looked on from the other side of the gallery and cried. Murdered: Jodi Arias killed her on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander (left) in June 2008, stabbing him 27 times and shooting him in the head at his Mesa home . After Arias finished speaking, Judge Sherry Stephens explained to jurors that their finding would be final . The jury heard closing arguments later on Tuesday, with Willmott citing Arias' mental health problems and lack of a criminal record among the reasons to spare her life. 'The question now before you is: Do you kill her? Do you kill her for the one act that she did, the one horrible act, or can you see that there is a reason to let her live? Can you see that there is value in her life?' she said. Prosecutor Juan Martinez said that despite Arias' claims, there were no factors in the case that would warrant a sentence other than death. He implored jurors to look at the 'whole panorama' of the case, not just Arias' statement on Tuesday, and explained how Alexander's family will live with the pain of their loss for the rest of their lives. 'They can't forget that what happened on that afternoon, Travis Victor Alexander suffered immense physical pain,' Martinez said. 'They can't forget that.'","Jury unable to make a decision on Wednesday, sent back for further deliberations .

Now, with growing numbers of rival current account deals on offers, banks are going to have to sit up and raise their game.’ A recent survey by Which? consumer magazine found that more than a quarter of bank customers had had a problem with their current account – and a fifth who had made a complaint said that it had not been dealt with to their satisfaction. A current account war is raging on the high street to try to break the banks’ stranglehold and new rivals are already emerging. For the first time since the demise of Girobank in the 1980s, the Post Office is offering customers current accounts, in a trial expected to go nationwide next year, while Tesco and Virgin Money are poised to launch their own current account deals this year. Last year, M&S launched a £20-a-month bank account designed to appeal to its regular shoppers, with money-off vouchers and discounts. In September, new rules will be introduced which are designed to make it easier for people to move their account to another bank, a move backed by Chancellor George Osborne . Only three in every 100 bank customers a year bother to switch their accounts because many fear that the transfer will go wrong. A recent Office of Fair Trading report found three-quarters of people had never switched banks, and that the vast majority had never even considered it. In September, new rules will be introduced which are designed to make it easier for people to move their account to another bank. It will only take seven days to switch over – instead of the current 18 days  – and money that is wrongly sent to the old account will be automatically swept into the new one. This change is set to be backed by a multi-million pound advertising campaign, and is supported by Chancellor George Osborne. Hilary McVitty, of the Building Societies Association, said: ‘Nationwide and others are taking on the banks at their own game. 'There has been a noticeable rise in the number of customers moving to building societies, with some reporting increases of nearly 60 per cent.’","Nationwide is paying 5% interest on balances up to £2,500 to lure customers .

The Dorsets and the Derbyshires were deployed to try to rush the ridge but each lost between 40 and 50 men. They were pinned alongside the Gurkhas for some five hours in total. Next up was the Gordon Highlanders and the Sikhs to try to retake the initiative on the battlefield. After a concentrated artillery barrage, the Gordons dashed up the slope with pipes playing and guns blazing.

An 80-year-old Japanese extreme skier and an 81-year-old Nepalese former Gurkha are in a race to become the oldest climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Yuichiro Miura climbed Mount Everest five years ago, but just missed out on the record when Min Bahadur Sherchan nipped in to claim it. And the pair are set to do battle again as they are both aiming to conquer the mountain in the next few weeks. Bold timer: 80-year-old Japanese adventurer Yuichiro Miura, right, is greeted by his friend climber Kenji Kondo while resting at his camp at 6,500 meters . Record breaker: Min Bahadur Sherchan, center, became the oldest person to climb Mount Everest on May 25, 2008 . Miura on Wednesday was already in the . 'death zone,' the steep, icy, oxygen-deficient area close to the . 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit. His rival, Min Bahadur Sherchan, from . Nepal, was at the base camp preparing for his own attempt on the summit . next week. On his expedition's website, Miura . explained his attempt to scale Everest at such an advanced age: 'It is . to challenge (my) own ultimate limit. It is to honor the great Mother . Nature.' He said a successful climb would raise the bar for what is possible. 'And if the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt. Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never be happier,' he said. Miura reached the South Col, the . jumping-off point for most final ascents, on Tuesday, according to his . website, which also posted pictures of him eating hand-rolled sushi . inside a tent. 'Miura is reported to be in good . health and he and his team are aiming to reach the summit on Thursday . morning,' said Gyanendra Shrestha, a Nepalese mountaineering official at . the base camp. Close to the top: According to his management office, Miura plans to reach the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) peak on Thursday . Yuichiro Miura rests as he goes through the South Col pass, left, and  right, with his son, Gota, on their way to a camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet) during his attempt to scale the summit of Mount Everest . Not his first time: Miura, right, takes a break with his son, Gota, on their way to a camp at 6,500 metres. He says the feat, while difficult for a man of any age, will add 70 years to his physical body age - making him feel more like 150 years old . On his way: Miura says the feat, while difficult for a man of any age, will add 70 years to his physical body age - making him feel more like 150 years old . If Miura makes it to the top, he would capture the record. But it would only last a few days if Sherchan is able to follow him. Still competitive: Min Bahadur Sherchan has announced he plans to start climbing Everest next week after hearing his record could be broken . Miura's daughter, Emili Miura, said . he 'doesn't really care' about the rivalry. 'He's doing it for his own . challenge,' she said. The situation was not too different . five years ago, when, at the age of 75, Miura sought to recapture the . title of oldest man to summit the mountain. He had set the record in . 2003 at age 70, but it was later broken twice by slightly older Japanese . climbers. He reached the summit on May 26, . 2008, at the age of 75 years and 227 days, according to Guinness World . Records. But the record eluded him because Sherchan had scaled the . summit the day before, at the age of 76 years and 340 days. Sherchan, a former Gurkha soldier in . the British army, first began mountaineering in 1960 when he climbed . Mount Dhaulagiri, the 8,167-meter (26,790-foot) high peak in Nepal, . according to his grandson, Manoj Guachan. Always an adventurer, and unbowed by age, he walked the length of Nepal in 2003. Sherchan and his team said Wednesday . that they were prepared for their new climb, despite digestive problems . he suffered several days ago. 'Our team leader has just arrived . back at base camp and we are holding a team meeting on when exactly I . will head up to the summit,' Sherchan, who uses a hearing aid, said by . telephone from the base camp. 'I am fine and in good health. I am ready to take up the challenge. Our plan is to reach the summit within one week.' It takes three to four days for climbers to reach Camp 4 on South Col from base camp, and another day to reach the summit. There are only a few windows of good . weather during the climbing season in May for people to attempt the . summit. That could favour Miura. Conditions should be favorable . Wednesday and Thursday, but they were expected to deteriorate after . Friday, said Shrestha, the mountaineering official at base camp. Father and son: Miura has had three heart operations in recent years and suffered a broken pelvis and fractured thigh in a 2009 ski accident . Sherchan's team is also facing . financial difficulties. It hasn't received the financial help that the . Nepal government announced it would provide them. Purna Chandra . Bhattarai, chief of Nepal's mountaineering department, said the aid . proposal was still under consideration. Miura faced difficulties of his own. He fractured his pelvis and left . thigh bone in a 2009 skiing accident, and had an operation in January . for an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, his fourth heart surgery . since 2007, according to Emili Miura. His daughter said Miura decided to go . ahead with the expedition despite the surgery because he felt that at . age 80, he was running out of time. 'If he was in his 60s, he probably . would have waited for another year or two, but at the age of 80 he's not . getting any younger. He has a strong determination that now is the . time,' she said in a phone interview. On his ascent, Miura made a stop at . the rarely used Camp 5 to take a break between the South Col and the . summit. Almost all the climbers these days walk straight from Camp 4 to . the summit. Miura was well-known long before his late-in-life mountaineering pursuits. He was a daredevil speed skier who . skied down Everest's South Col in 1970, using a parachute to brake his . descent. The feat was captured in the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, . ""The Man Who Skied Down Everest."" In 1964, he briefly set a world speed . skiing record in the Italian Alps, reaching 172 kilometers per hour . (107 mph). He also skied down Mt. Fuji using parachutes. It wasn't until Miura was 70, . however, that he first climbed all the way to the summit of Everest. When he summited again at 75, he claimed to be the only man to . accomplish the feat twice in his 70s. After that, he said he was . determined to climb again at age 80. Miura is accompanied on the . expedition by his son Gota, a two-time Olympian skier. Gota Miura, 43, . summited Everest in 2003 with his father, but had to turn back short of . the summit in 2008 due to symptoms of high altitude cerebral edema.","Juichiro Miura  plans to reach the summit of Mount Everest by Thursday .

A former jockey has won £58,000 in compensation after winning a legal fight against  racecourse managers following a fall which left him with a head injury and fractured pelvis. The Court of Appeal upheld Philip Hide's claim against managers of Cheltenham Racecourse. Mr Hide - who is now a trainer - had fallen from his horse Hatch a Plan at the first hurdle at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in November 2006 and hit a post supporting a guard rail running around the perimeter of the steeplechase course, judges heard. He had claimed damages and argued the hurdle was too close to the perimeter fence and insufficiently padded. Mr Hide suggested that regulations governing work equipment had been breached. Course bosses contested his claim and a judge ruled against him following a trial at Oxford County Court in June 2012 concluding that the hurdle and guard rail were 'suitable equipment'. But three appeal judges have allowed an appeal by Mr Hide following a hearing in London. Judges said liability had been disputed but damages had been agreed at £58,000. And they said Mr Hide had made a full recovery. Lord Justice Davis, who heard Mr Hide's appeal with Lord Justice Longmore and Lord Justice McFarlane, said jump racing was 'dangerous' and Cheltenham Racecourse prided itself on its 'attention to safety considerations'. The judge said the accident had occurred in a 'most unusual way', when the horse skidded sharply after falling at the outer end of a hurdle. But he said what mattered was the 'reasonable foreseeability of a collision between horse or rider with the railings' upright at this place'. Lord Justice Davis said the judge at the county court trial had been concerned about the 'implications of a conclusion in favour of Mr Hide'. 'He was concerned about ""the relentless logic of the personal injury lawyer"", as he put it,' said Lord Justice Davis. Mr Hide fell from his horse Hatch a Plan at the first hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse . 'Were jump races to be required to be made so undemanding that all horses could be expected to negotiate them without mishap? 'How were the requirements of the regulations to apply, for example, to Beecher's Brook at Aintree? 'These are understandable concerns.' But Lord Justice Davis added: 'Of course the hazards of jump and hurdle racing may lawfully remain: jumps and hurdles may properly and lawfully continue to pose challenges of varying difficulty.' He said adjustments to the layout or construction of hurdles and railings mooted in the Hide case did not affect the ""integrity and ethos"" of jump racing. 'What was fundamentally at issue here was not the suitability of this hurdle, taken on its own, or the suitability of the railings' upright, taken on its own,"" added Lord Justice Davis. 'It was a combination of matters: the location of this particular hurdle so close to this railings' upright (with its particular construction) that gave rise to the problem.'","Philip Hide fell from his horse Hatch a Plan at the first hurdle in 2006 .

One-eyed police killer Dale Cregan today admitted murdering a father and son in a gun and grenade attack. Cregan, 29, had 'bizarrely' pleaded not guilty to killing David and Mark Short despite apparently confessing to the attacks numerous times. But today he changed his plea at Preston Crown Court a t the last minute after the prosecution had delivered their closing speech to the jury. Cregan also admitted causing an explosion with a hand-grenade at an address in Droylsden but denies attempting to murder the householder. He has previously admitted murdering Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, but had continued to deny killing the father and son, aged 46 and 23. He lured the unarmed policewomen with a bogus 999 call before using a Glock handgun and a military grenade to murder them in Hattersley, Greater Manchester on September 18 last year. Today his barrister, Simon Csoka QC, began the day by asking six of the seven remaining counts to be put to his client. Cregan then stood up and calmly pleaded guilty to the murders of David and Mark Short. In his closing speech, Mr Csoka said that Cregan now accepted he had killed four people. 'Members of the jury, your task is now so much more simple,' he said. 'You knew within a few days of this trial starting that Dale Cregan had killed those two policewomen. 'You now know for sure that he has murdered four people and that he has attempted to murder others inside the Cotton Tree pub. 'Ordinarily in a closing speech the defence barrister will tell you how important your task is, how it makes so much difference, how the liberty of the defendant hangs in the balance. 'All of those words mean nothing now, absolutely nothing. 'You may think after what has just happened, in a calm and almost clerical way...you may think ""what does it matter now?"", ""what difference does it make?"", ""why does Dale Cregan care?"". Murder victims: Father and son David and Mark Short who Cregan today admitted killing . Murdered: Policewomen Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes who were lured to an address in Hattersley by Cregan and killed while unarmed . Victim: Nicola Hughes who was killed by Dale Cregan while responding to a 999 call . 'He is going to be sentenced for four . murders and three attempted murders. He is not going anywhere. He is . going to die in prison.' Mr Csoka also told the jury that Cregan said he was not guilty of the remaining attempted murder charge. He added: 'We are dealing with someone who when he sets out to kill, he kills. 'When he set out to kill Mark Short, he killed him. 'When he set out to kill David Short, he killed him. 'When he set out to kill the police officers, he did. 'There was never any danger of him failing to carry out those murderous objectives. 'It is completely different with Luke Road. 'As hard as it may seem, as absurd as it may seem, the only reasonable verdict on the evidence is that you cannot be sure he attempted to murder anyone at Luke Road. So therefore your verdict should be not guilty.' Prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC had earlier said . that Cregan used the same gun and the same type of grenade to murder . David Short as he had used in the killings of the police officers. 'Essentially it was the same way,' he . explained. 'The surprise ambush, the hail of gunfire and the gratuitous . throwing of his calling card (the grenade).' CCTV . footage of him attempting to fire a Glock handgun and throwing a . grenade at the home of another intended victim shortly after the killing . of Mr Short was 'the most obvious evidence against him', he said. He . said it had been 'an odd murder trial' in that the main defendant - who . chose not to give evidence to the jury - had not challenged through his . barrister any of the evidence in which several witnesses said Cregan . had told them he killed the Shorts. Mr Clarke reminded the jury that he told a psychiatrist and psychologist in prison before the trial that he had killed David and Mark Short - and had even made the same confession to his mother. Murder scene: Police outside the Cotton Tree Inn, Droylsden, Manchester, where Mark Short was shot dead by Dale Cregan . Probe: Forensic officers enter the home where David Short was murdered in Clayton, Manchester, last year. Dale Cregan has today changed his plea to guilty . He 'talked openly' with some of his co-accused while in custody at Strangeways in Manchester about taking the life of David Short, he said. 'The fact that he has murdered David Short is the worst kept secret in Strangeways,' said Mr Clarke. Cregan also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of John Collins, Ryan Pridding and Michael Belcher, who were all in the Cotton Tree on May 25 last year. He also admitted causing an explosion at a property in Luke Road, Droylsden, on August 10, shortly after the murder of David Short. The jury foreman was then invited by trial judge Mr Justice Holroyde to formally return guilty verdicts on those counts. The judge then told the jurors that the defendant remained on trial for the single allegation remaining against him - that he attempted to murder Sharon Hark at her home in Luke Road.

She said: 'He was a cheeky, loving boy and . was so popular at school and among his friends. 'He was such a kind boy as well - if . he saw anybody getting hurt he would go over and do all he could to help . - he was that sort of kid. 'It's hard for everyone.

My heart goes out to his family especially his little brother who witnessed it.' Hours before the accident one Facebook user said she had to suddenly brake near the scene of the crash because three children were weaving in and out of traffic on bikes. Mandy McGill said: 'I drove along there earlier. There were three young boys on their bikes, aged between six and eight. 'They were dodging in and out of the traffic beside the roadworks.

A heroin addict father smokes the deadly drug contentedly as his two innocent children sit watching him adoringly. The oblivious man is part of a growing epidemic in the war-torn country of Afghanistan, which has seen the number of opium and heroin addicts tripling to 150,000, according to latest United Nations Figures, while 225,000 used the drug in 2012. In a country with a population 35million, there are now more than 1m addicts of one drug or another. Deadly addiction: Abdul Rahman, 44, exhales after smoking opium as his children watch him at his home in Laghman province in Afghanistan. Heroin addicts in the country have tripled, according to the UN . Sordid scene: The father services his addiction as his little children look on, oblivious to the harm he is doing . It represents a major problem for the country, which produces 90 per cent of all opiates in the world. Until recently, though, it was not a major consumer, but this has changed over the past decade. The reasons why so many Afghans are turning to drugs are complex but it is thought decades of violence have had a serious effect on the nation's psyche. Many of those who fled during the fighting of the last 30 years took refuge in Iran and Pakistan, where addiction rates have long been high. They're now returning and bringing their drug problems with them, officials say. Unemployment - which currently stands at nearly 40% - is also taking its toll. To buy heroin in Kabul is 'as easy as buying yourself something to eat', addicts say. One gram costs about $6 (£3.91), and it's available in every corner of the city. Recovering: Afghan drug addicts sit on their beds at a drug treatment centre, one of 95 such establishments in the country . Help: There are now more than one million drug users in Afghanistan and many are seeking solace at treatment centres . Temptation: Addicts say heroin in the country is so cheap that it is hard to resist . The health ministry runs 95 addiction treatment centres around the country, with enough bed space for 2,305 people. Exacerbating the problem is a recent rise in opium production levels. It has tripled in Helmand has tripled since British troops arrived in the Afghan province in 2006, according to the UN. Its report says more than 75,000 hectares of Helmand were given over to opium cultivation last year, up from just 25,500 hectares in 2005. 'The prices are still quite high. That is a very clear economic incentive,' Martin Raithelhuber of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) told Reuters. A British soldier patrols a poppy field in Helmand. Production has apparently tripled since troops arrived in 2006 . 'We can't deny the fact that the level of cultivation now is much higher than it has ever been under the Taliban.' With foreign combat forces leaving in less than two years, and with much of their cash and air power expected to go with them, the Afghan government will need more help fighting poppy cultivation, experts say. The UNODC in 2011 estimated the opium trade may have earned the Taliban $700million (£460million), up from $200million (£130million) a year in the previous decade, with traffickers earning billions more.","United Nations warns of epidemic as opium production soars .

David Cameron warned restive Tory MPs he will not change policy on an EU  referendum yesterday – but promised there would be no more divisive issues such as gay marriage. Seeking to draw a line under a turbulent fortnight, the Prime Minister said his party could now rally behind his pledge to give voters an in/out choice on British membership of the EU by 2017, following an attempt to claw back key powers. He warned Eurosceptics who may seek further concessions: ‘It’s a very clear, very decisive policy.‘[It] doesn’t matter the pressure I come under from outside the Conservative Party or in Europe or inside the Conservative Party – this policy is not going to change. Scroll down for video . Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron has told Tory rebels he will not bring the proposed referendum on Europe forward . ‘The question is not going  to change. The number of referenda isn’t going to change. The date by which we hold this referendum isn’t going to change. It’s the right policy for the country.’ Mr Cameron insisted there was ‘unity’ on the Tory benches over the need to hold an in/out referendum and there had simply been ‘a disagreement over the last couple of weeks about an issue we actually agree about’. He said the referendum pledge was the ‘boldest, clearest, most straightforward policy on Europe that any party leader has had for 30 or 40 years’. Divisive issue: The vote over gay marriage has split the Tory party . ‘It’s that sort of leadership, that sort of clarity, that is required.’ But following splits in his party over same-sex marriage, approved by MPs earlier this week, the Prime Minister attempted to reassure backbenchers that it would not be the ‘first of many other issues like that’. He insisted the Government would focus on the economy, welfare reforms and education in the run-up to the 2015 general election. Mr Cameron admitted that the gay marriage issue ‘divides’ his party but added: ‘There will be young boys in schools today who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest Parliament in the land has said that their love is worth the same as anyone else’s love and that we believe in equality. ‘And I think they’ll stand that bit taller today and I’m proud of the fact that has happened. ‘But if you’re saying to me, “Is the first now of many other issues like that?” No, it isn’t. The Government now is going to be absolutely focused on the big picture, which is fixing our economy, reforming welfare, making sure there are good schools for our children to go to.’ As rows over Europe and gay marriage raged, the Prime Minister cancelled two political Cabinet meetings in a row and failed to meet any member of the backbench 1922 Committee executive. One Number 10 source admitted that their operation had been ‘arrogant and incompetent’, while a Cabinet minister said that Mr Cameron’s handling of the past few weeks ‘has more than a hint of the John Majors’. Some of Mr Cameron’s allies are angry with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who has fanned the flames of revolts over Europe and gay marriage, with some suspecting he is trying to position himself as a successor to the Prime Minister. Sir Christopher Meyer, who served as Sir John Major’s spokesman between 1994 and 1996, said Mr Cameron was being harried by  ‘latter-day bastards’ in the Tory party. That was a reference to Sir John’s unguarded remark about the ‘bastards’ causing trouble over Europe in his own Cabinet.

He said: ‘Anyone who is spending time war-gaming about what may or may not happen to me is wasting their time.

Locked up: Family doctor Davinder Jeet Bains has been jailed for filming intimate examinations of his patients on a hidden spy camera . A family doctor who used a secret . camera inside his James Bond-style wristwatch to record himself abusing . female patients was jailed for 12 years today. Dr Davinder Jeet Bains, 46, used his . position as a GP at a medical practice in Royal Wootton Bassett, near . Swindon, Wiltshire, to assault dozens of his female patients. Bains filmed the attacks on his Tieex 4GB Waterproof Spy Watch, which has been likened to something out of a 007 film. It has a built-in camera on the face - . with simple on and off buttons to record - and can be bought on the . internet for less than £60. When detectives arrested Bains at the . Tinkers Lane Surgery they discovered his . hi-tech wristwatch and later recovered 361 high-quality video clips from the watch and home computer. At Swindon Crown Court today, Bains was jailed for 12 years after he admitted dozens of charges against him for attacks against 27 women. Around 3,000 potential victims were . contacted by police officers but the exact number is thought to be . 'close to 300' – aged between 14 and 51. Passing sentence, Judge Field told Bains he had breached the trust patients put in their doctor. 'When you committed these offences you breached this duty of trust in the most grievous way,' he said. 'You are a disgrace to the medical profession.' The police investigation began in . June last year when a 19-year-old woman told officers she thought Bains . filmed her as she showered and said she had been sexually assaulted by . him in Swindon. One of the watches containing a tiny camera, which can be seen at the bottom of the clock face, which Davinder Jeet Bains, used to film his patients . After arresting Bains and discovering the watch, detectives found it had a tiny lens in the place of the . number six. Some of the graphic clips are up to 45 minutes long and had . at some point been downloaded onto his laptop. Investigating . officers were left staggered that Bains managed to get away with his sexual . abuse for so long. Until police were tipped off . about his secret filming by a female lodger at his home, nobody . complained about him. Those he targeted overlooked moments of . strangeness for fear of upsetting the delicate doctor-patient . relationship. During the sentencing today, Judge Field told Bains that, regarding one of the victims in particular - a teenage girl - he was in a 'high position of trust' when he covertly filmed her. Disturbing: The disgraced doctor also had this watch containing a small camera . Many victims of the doctor thought his behaviour was strange but feared upsetting the delicate doctor-patient . relationship. One 21-year-old victim told the Daily Mail of her horrific experience. She went to see Bains in May last year . after experiencing vaginal bleeding following sex with her partner. She . was offered an appointment with Bains. The surgery had no female . doctors and, because of the intimate nature of the problem, she decided . to take her mother with her. ‘He asked me why I was there and I . explained briefly. He started asking very strange questions. My mum and I . were looking at each other, a bit taken aback.’ Bains told Kate - not her real name - that he would need to . examine her. ‘I had expected that,’ she said, ‘so I’d prepared myself. He asked if I wanted my mum to leave, and I said yes.’ Bains disappeared for a couple of minutes, telling Kate not to get undressed until he returned. She . says: ‘I assumed it was normal procedure before a patient undressed — . that maybe he was closing blinds somewhere, or locking a connecting door . in case someone came in.’ When he came back, locking the door . behind him, Bains told Kate to undress. He did not pull the examination . bed curtain around her, close the blinds or offer her any privacy. ‘He . watched me getting undressed,’ says Kate. ‘He was very quiet. I felt . very uncomfortable. I was trying to pull my top down so he wouldn’t see. But I didn’t know what was normal. ‘He . put some gloves on and asked me to get up onto the bed. He said he was . going to do a visual examination and that if there was anything he . didn’t like the look of, he’d take a sample.’ Police found 361 high-quality images of Dr Bains abusing female patients at Tinkers Lane Surgery in Royal Wootton Bassett near Swindon, Wiltshire . For . the next 20 minutes, Bains ‘examined’ Kate, filming himself all the . time. ‘It was a long, long time,’ she says. ‘but I just thought he was . being thorough.’ Her mother assumed that they were talking and had not realised how long he had been intimately examining her daughter. Kate . remembers that he was shaking and seemed very nervous. At the end of . the consultation, Bains gave Kate the all-clear and told her to get . dressed. Her mother said: . ‘When she came out of the room, I commented on how long it had taken and . she said she’d never felt so degraded in her life. I remember saying . “Welcome to our world”, because all women have to endure that kind of . thing at some point. I feel so stupid now.’ 'In serious breach of that trust you . engaged in entirely inappropriate sexualised behaviour with her, . including plying her with alcohol and showing her a sexually explicit . film,' the judge said. 'You then sexually abused her. Fortunately she reported her concerns to a friend and thus supported, . she reported matters to the police. 'Once the police had commenced their . investigations they discovered your computer and found these videos . which showed you had been conducting intimate examinations of a large . number of female patients from July 2009 to June 2012 and had covertly . videoed them while doing so. 'You of all people will be aware that . the relationship between a doctor and his patient is of fundamental . importance in the practice of medicine. 'In this relationship the doctor is . placed in a very high position of trust and the patient is entitled to . expect the doctor to discharge that duty with the highest standard. 'This is particularly so when a female patient consults a male doctor on intimate matters.' Bains, from Swindon, committed offences against 27 women - aged from 14 to 51 - between July 2010 and May 2012. Detective Inspector Mark Garrett, of Wiltshire Police, holds up the hi-tech wristwatch used by the disgraced GP . He admitted a total of 39 charges: . 13 of assault by penetration, 13 of voyeurism, 11 of sexual assault and . two of sexual activity with a child. He also asked for a further 65 . offences - 10 of sexual assault by penetration, eight of sexual assault . and 47 of voyeurism - to be taken into account when Judge Douglas Field . passed sentence. His not guilty pleas to three charges . of sexual assault and a single count of administering a noxious drug . with intent to commit a sexual offence were accepted by the Crown and . will lie on file. Bains left Malaysia at the age of 21 to study medicine at university in India, which is where his Sikh family was originally from, and graduated from Kasturba Medical College, an affiliate of Mangalore University. He is still registered with the Indian equivalent of the UK’s General Medical Council, the Medical Council of India, which oversees doctors. According to the MCI’s Code of Medical Ethics, ‘A physician should be an upright man. He shall keep himself pure in character and be diligent in caring for the sick; he should be modest, sober, patient.’ As well as working as a locum GP, Bains worked in three different surgeries in Wiltshire after completing his three-year training as a GP registrar in February 2007. He worked at New Court surgery in Wootton Bassett between 2007 and 2008, at Rowden Surgery in Chippenham in 2008, and moved to Tinkers Lane in June 2008. Police swooped on Bains at Tinkers Lane Surgery in June last year, bursting into his consulting room so that he had no time to get rid of the camera watch he was wearing.","Dr Davinder Jeet Bains, 46, worked as a GP in Royal Wootton Bassett .

A wave of military-style schools that instil ‘confidence, self-discipline and self-esteem’ in pupils is being proposed by Michael Gove. The Education Secretary wants groups founding free schools and academies to use former servicemen in lessons. Cadet Force units – which hold a range of activities with an Armed Forces ethos – could also be opened on school grounds. He sees it as a solution to the endemic violence in classes and playgrounds, and the rise in expulsions. Details emerged the day after a secondary school staffed by ex-servicemen and women was unveiled as one of more than 100 free schools due to open next year. Phoenix Free School of Oldham, whose head of studies was a Tornado pilot before taking charge of the science department at an independent school, will have a zero-tolerance approach to bad behaviour. A research paper, released by the Department for Education, said: ‘The Government is interested in exploring how academies and free schools can use their freedoms to foster a military ethos and raise standards.’ The department says it would help ‘foster confidence, self-discipline and self-esteem whilst developing teamwork and leadership skills’. Free schools can be set up by groups including parents, teachers, businesses or faith organisations and are government-funded but independent of local authorities. This gives them a greater say in areas such as curriculum, teachers’ pay and the length of terms or days. A total of 102 were approved this week by Mr Gove, taking the overall number to nearly 300. The latest additions will create 50,000 places, according to the DfE – addressing some of the 250,000 shortfall next year identified by the National Audit Office. However, the vast majority of the places needed are in primary schools, while only 33 of the new free schools are primaries and 11 ‘all through’ schools, which teach pupils aged four to 19. Discipline: Drills and teamwork could become a common sight in military-style free schools after the first of its kind was given the go ahead . The Troops to Teachers programme re-trains ex-servicemen and women to enable them to take lessons in schools. Just over 250 applied to the scheme between March 2011 and October 2012. Phoenix Free School denies that it will be ‘like a boot camp’. Its website says teachers will ‘embody the Army’s core values of moral courage, self-discipline, respect for others, integrity and loyalty’. Critics say free schools are damaging the state system by taking money and pupils from other schools and being allowed to open in areas where places are already available. But Mr Gove said: ‘Free schools are extremely popular with parents and are delivering strong discipline and teaching excellence.’","Ex-soldiers and airmen to launch school in Oldham in September 2014 .

The parents of a baby boy are pleading for thieves to return the silver box they stole, which contains his ashes. The Georgia couple are distraught at the theft of the box containing their last link to the stillborn son. Jody and Haley Hughey's only child, Caleb, was stillborn in 2008. Since his death, the couple have struggled to become pregnant again. Treasured memories: Jody and Haley Hughey kept the ashes of their baby son in a small silver box . 'We spent some time with him before we let him go, and then had him cremated,' Mr Hughey told ABC News. 'I realize there are people in Oklahoma going through more than us right now, but for us, it's a personal hell.' Since his death, the couple have kept their son's ashes in a silver box, engraved with an angel and 'Caleb Ean Hughey, October 16, 2008'. But when Mrs Hughey returned from work on Monday, she found a second-floor window had been smashed - and the box had been stolen. 'He is only our only son,' Mr Hughey said. 'It's . devastating for both of us. But for my wife, this is everything. She . can't have the future she wants, and now she doesn't have a way to hold . on to the past.' The box was kept on a dresser in their bedroom, until thieves broke into the couple's home in Cobb County while they were at work on Monday and stole it. 'They were looking for small, . valuable stuff,' Mr Hughey said. As well as the box, an iPod, handgun and jewellery were taken. 'What they took from us has absolutely . no value whatsoever to them,' he added. 'I would ask that they just simply call the police and turn it in. And if the person who actually stole it wants to give it back, they can . drive by my house at 3am and throw it in a garbage bag in my front . yard. Whatever it takes for them to feel comfortable giving us our son . back.' Appeal: Jody Hughey is desperate for the box containing his baby son's ashes to be returned . The 4in by 4in silver box may have been mistaken as a jewellery box, the couple say. 'They may not have even realized what was in there. And they may have simply thought, ""that's a nice looking box, there's probably some expensive jewelry in there"",' Mr Hughey added. Joanne Cacciatore, a grief counselor and . founder of Phoenix-based Miss Foundation for grieving families, said . parents mourn stillborn babies as they would any child. 'When a baby dies during or shortly after . birth, you have very few tangible mementos. So while, of course, this . would be horrid for anyone, for this family, this is one of the very few . things they have that belongs to their baby,' Ms Cacciatore, who lost her daughter Cheyenne before she was born, said. For a developed country, the U.S. has a relatively high rate of stillbirths. About one in every 160 pregnancies in the U.S. ends in a stillbirth, which is about 26,000 each year nationwide. The tragic end to a pregnancy is 'really a very emotional event,' for health professionals as well as the baby's family, Jay Iams, a professor of maternal and fetal medicine at The Ohio State University Medical Center, told Scientific American. When a couple loses a baby this way, hospitals will encourage them to spend time with their baby and to take pictures to help them remember their lost child. Caleb was the Hughey's only child. 'We've struggled with infertility for about four or five years now, and we've not been able to have children, other than the one. And he was born prematurely. We lost him at birth.' Mr Hughey told 11 Alive. As he choked back tears, Mr Hughey added: 'So he is, to us, he is our only son. And it's very important we get him back.' Break in: Jody Hughey stands by the window thieves broke to get into the couple's Georgia home . The couple say the box brought them a comfort that cannot be replaced. 'My wife said, ""I wanted to be . buried with him so I could be with him forever"",' Mr Hughey said. 'I just hope . that somehow word gets out and that someone is willing to do something . about it.' It is a sentiment echoed by other grieving parents who have ashes stolen from their homes. In January, a mother from Bakersfield, California, pleaded for the return of a pink urn containing the ashes of her stillborn daughter. Paula Lopez had been pregnant with twins when one of the babies, Marie, died. The other twin survived and is now eight years old. 'I already lost her one time. This is like losing her a second time,' Ms Lopez told Bakersfield Now. Anyone with information about the theft should call (770) 499-4184 and quote case number 13-052156.","Georgia couple's last link to stillborn baby is engraved box of ashes .

Elected police commissioners have sparked a cronyism row by packing their offices with taxpayer-funded political appointees. A string of them have appointed former campaign aides, party colleagues and local councillors to highly-paid deputy posts in their expanding offices, a report revealed. MPs found that the commissioners, who are paid up to £100,000 a year to supervise local police forces, were hiring dozens of officials to work with them, on salaries of up to £70,000. Former MP Tony Lloyd, who heads the Greater Manchester force, has appointed 45 members of staff, including two communications officers and a head of 'scrutiny and engagement' Once the cost of their offices are totalled up, 14 PCCs – or one in three of the total – are already costing more than the Police Authorities they replaced, the Commons home affairs committee said. One Police and Crime Commissioner, former MP Tony Lloyd who heads the Greater Manchester force, has appointed 45 members of staff, including two communications officers and a head of ‘scrutiny and engagement’. Critics said the PCCs were guilty of ‘building cosy little empires’. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Police and Crime Commissioners were elected to keep a watchful eye on police spending, not to build their own cosy little empires. ‘Taxpayers elected their PCCs – and not all of their political friends – precisely because they wanted to see someone crack down on wasteful spending and unnecessary bureaucracy in the police.’ PCCs are barred from appointing party political office holders and ‘active party members’ to their staff, with the exception of the position of deputy PCC. All other roles should be ‘appointed on merit’, the rules say. However, the report notes that ‘the position of deputy is not a politically restricted post. Some PCCs have consequently recruited political or personal contacts’. They include Northamptonshire PCC Adam Simmonds, who appointed three interim assistant commissioners on £65,000, including two from his campaign team. West Midlands PCC Bob Jones hired three Labour councillors as assistant commissioners on £22,500 and a deputy commissioner, Yvonne Mosquito, on £65,000. Kent PCC Ann Barnes hired her Lib Dem former campaign manager Peter Carroll as an adviser on £70,000, while Surrey PCC Kevin Hurley, a former Metropolitan Police officer, hired a former  colleague, Jeff Harris, as his deputy on £50,000. A separate BBC survey revealed PCCs had created nearly 450 posts in their offices since the November elections. Behind Manchester, the West Yorkshire PCC has hired 27 staff, Merseyside 26 and West Midlands 23. The committee called for a national register of PCCs’ interests and for ‘stronger scrutiny’ of the commissioners to prevent ‘maverick decision making’. They found that only one in four has published their full spending information online – such as expenses and contacts – despite the law requiring them to do so. Chief Executive of the GMP PCC's office Russell Bernstein said: 'The staff in Tony’s office were transferred over from the police authority. 'As highlighted in the Home Affairs Select Committee report, the cost of running Tony’s office is significantly less than other police and crime commissioners. 'This represents a saving of 8.5% on the costs of the former police authority and the Commissioner is looking to identify further savings.'

A Texas girl who was just 11 when she was raped by 20 men over a three-month period in 2010 has revealed that she is now seven months pregnant at the age of 14. Them teenager says the baby's father is her 15-year-old boyfriend and that they plan to keep the child. The shocking crime gained national attention when police began investigating in December 2010, after the girl's classmate told a teacher he had seen cellphone video of men having sex with . her. Expecting: The Cleveland, Texas gang rape victim is now 7 -months pregnant at age 14. The father is her 15-year-old boyfriend . Prosecutors say the girl was . sexually assaulted on at least five occasions by 20 men and boys in the . Southeast Texas town of Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston. The girl was 11 during the assaults from mid-September through early December 2010. Police began investigating that December, when cell phone video emerged of one assault. After investigators learned of the horrific assault, the girl was moved to foster care but ran away from her group home in Beaumont, Texas in December 2011 and was the victim of another sexual assault while she was living on the streets. In August 2012, she returned to Houston to be with her family. She now lives with her mother, brother and sisters. Her mother, Maria, told KHOU-TV that she was upset when she learned the girl was pregnant. 'Well, when she came with the pregnancy test, I was like, ""Go away, get away from me, I was upset,""' she said. The mother says that she now realizes that this may just be part of her daughter's healing. 'I think it's pretty common that sometimes girls, when that happens to them, they try to find the comfort in someone else, like they want to feel loved.' The victim, who has not been identified, said she feels nervous about the upcoming arrival of her child. She also said she hopes that people won't judge her for having a child out of wedlock.

All six juveniles and six of the 14 adults charged pleaded guilty. Others opted for trials. The . girl described the series of horrendous attacks that took . place in the small Texas community of Cleveland during the trial for Eric McGowen. She testified that McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks.

The computer game Tetris could spell the end of the eye patch for people with lazy eye. Researchers have found a way of using the game to treat adult amblyopia by training both eyes to work together. The breakthrough provides direct evidence that forcing both eyes to co-operate increases the level of plasticity in the brain and allows the amblyopic brain to relearn. Amblyopia is the most common cause of visual impairment in childhood, affecting up to three in 100 people. It occurs when the vision in one eye does not develop properly. This means the person can see less clearly from the underdeveloped eye meaning they rely heavily on their other eye. If untreated, it can lead to permanent loss of vision in the affected eye. Previous treatments for the disorder, which have focused largely on covering the stronger eye in order to force the weaker eye to work, have proved only partially successful in children and have been ineffective in adults. Study leader Doctor Robert Hess, Director of the Research Department of Ophthalmology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, said: ‘The key to improving vision for adults, who currently have no other treatment options, was to set up conditions that would enable the two eyes to cooperate for the first time in a given task.’ The researchers examined the potential of treating amblyopic adults using Tetris, which involves connecting different shaped blocks as they fall to the ground. Dr Hess said: ‘Using head-mounted video goggles we were able to display the game dichoptically, where one eye was allowed to see only the falling objects, and the other eye was allowed to see only the ground plane objects. ‘Forcing the eyes to work together, we believed, would improve vision in the lazy eye.’ The researchers tested a sample of 18 adults with amblyopia. Amblyopia is the most common cause of visual impairment in childhood, affecting up to three in 100 people . Nine participants played the game with the weaker eye, while the stronger eye was patched. The other nine played the same game dichoptically, where each eye was allowed to view a separate part of the game. After two weeks, the group playing the dichoptic game showed a ‘dramatic’ improvement in the vision of the weaker eye as well as in 3D depth perception. When the patching-wearing group, who had shown only a moderate improvement, was switched to the new dichoptic training, the vision of this group also improved dramatically. Now the suitability of the treatment in children will be assessed later this year in a clinical trial. The research was published in the journal Current Biology.","Tetris can be used to train both eyes to work together .

A top novelist has asked her fans to redesign classic novels as if they were being marketed at women in protest at the  'girly' imagery publishers use on book covers for women authors. American writer Maureen Johnson claims publishers use fluffy imagery to market novels by women, so she asked her Twitter fans to 'coverflip' classics such as Jack Kerouac's On The Road and Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange as if they had female authors. She was amazed at the number designs sent in from readers sympathetic to her gripe. Coverflip: The disturbing A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess (left) is re-imagined as a book written by and intended for a woman (right) Horror classic Carrie by Stephen King, which traditionally has disturbing images of the female protagonist on the cover, was reimagined with a smiling blonde in lipstick and soft pastel shades. The female version of fantasy masterwork A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, or Georgette R. Martin in this case, boasted a young adult-orientated pink and purple cover with a pretty Daenerys Stormborn and a cute child wielding a sword. Dennis/Denise Lehane's Shutter Island, a stark psychological drama, now has a beautiful ocean view on the cover and is subtitled: 'A novel of self-discovery'. Not quite as scary: Stephen King's horror masterpiece is wildly different in its new female-friendly incarnation . Many women writers feel their work is lumbered with patronising covers by publishers . Ms Johnson, the author of the Shades of London and the Suite Scarlett series, said: 'I do wish I had a dime for every email I get that says: ""Please put a non-girly cover on your book so I can read it – signed, A Guy"".' She even used one of her own covers as an example. The cover of Key to the Golden Firebird shows a neon pink background, an image of a beautiful teenage girl displaying her midriff, and features the words 'a novel' in a dark pink heart. She told The Guardian: 'It's about three sisters who are dealing with the sudden death of their father. May, the middle sister, is trying to hold her family together and learn how to drive. This is the cover.' Gender reassignment: Even Maureen Johnson's own young adult novel 13 Little Blue Envelopes is changed into how it may look as written by a man . From sinister to silly: Crime writer Harlan Coben becomes Helen Coben . She added: 'The simple fact of the matter is, if you are a female author, you are much more likely to get the package that suggests the book is of a lower perceived quality because it's ""girly"", which is somehow inherently different and easier on the palate. 'A man and a woman can write books about the same subject matter, at the same level of quality, and that woman is simply more likely to get the soft-sell cover with the warm glow and the feeling of smooth jazz blowing off of it.' It's Kind of a Funny Story (left) deals with controversial themes like teenage depression and suicide, but you wouldn't know it from the new female version . Amanda Hocking, the million-selling self-published novelist, blogged about the 'gender cover-up'. She said: 'More women read books than men, more women write books then men, but only a small fraction of books that win literary awards are written by women. 'Women are the publishing industry's bread and butter, we are the backbone of the damn entertainment industry, but we are constantly demoted to ""fluffy"" to ""light"" to ""meaningless"".'

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent In Brussels and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 11:40 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:37 EST, 23 May 2013 . David Cameron today hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax. The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax . evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses. It is thought Austria and Luxembourg - the only opponents of tax . transparency - have agreed to back the plan if Switzerland will also do so. David Cameron is in Brussels today for talks on tax avoidance, where he spoke to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, right, Croatia's Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, second left, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte . Mr Cameron wants to see companies reporting where they pay tax country-by-country, across the EU and the G8. However there is a risk that some EU countries will want to set up their own, separate, system. Large-scale tax avoidance schemes are estimated to cost the European Union alone £850 billion a year. Speaking at a summit in Brussels . today, Mr Cameron said EU leaders had achieved 'a proper agreement, here . in the EU to start with, that all countries should exchange tax . information, that all countries should act on beneficial ownership, so . we know who owns what. I think this is a big step forward.' The Prime Minister said the EU had persuaded Austria and Luxembourg to drop their complete opposition to tax transparency. 'Today we've agreed to push for a new international standard of automatic information exchange between tax authorities and to help those authorities fight tax evasion with new standards to give them info on who really owns and controls each and every company,' he said. 'Tax evasion is illegal and should be cracked down on as rapidly as possible. Of course governments should more to turn aggressive tax avoidance schemes into tax evasion by making them illegal. 'But no government in the world can move fast enough to catch up with some of practices put in place by some businesses and individuals. 'There is a moral issue - companies have to make decisions about themselves. My decision to put this on top of the G8 agenda has unlocked some really important international action.' Finance . ministers from 17 EU countries including Britain and Ireland have . already signed a declaration backing the global system, but 11 have not . and long-standing opposition has been driven by Luxembourg and Austria, . where banking secrecy is traditionally sacred. Iceland's new coalition government has shelved plans to join the European Union. The centre-right Progressive and Independence parties halted accession talks and promised a referendum before continuing the application. New Premier Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson said: 'The government intends to halt negotiations between Iceland and the European Union. We will not hold further negotiations with the European Union without prior referendum.' Mr Cameron was also at pains to claim that he raised tax avoidance 'very directly' with Google boss Eric Schmidt at a meeting this week. Downing Street made clear on Monday that the Prime Minister would not refer to reports the search engine firm paid only £10 million in corporation tax in the UK between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9 billion. However, this morning Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed that he did raise public anger with firms which are not seen to be paying their 'fair share' of tax' with the Google chairman. He said 'companies, as Google are finding out, are coming under pressure to act'. Labour leader Ed Miliband today used a speech at a Google event to criticise the 'extraordinary events' the firm goes to in order to avoid paying tax in the UK. Tonight Mr Cameron insisted he did discuss the broader issue of tax avoidance with Mr Schmidt during the meeting of the Business Advisory Group, but not the particular concerns about Google's tax bill. The Prime Minister said: 'I raised the issue very directly as he is on my business advisory panel and we discussed the G8 agenda, the tax multinationals are paying and I made sure there were proper contributions from people around the table, including him, on that issue. 'Aside from talking about it what is much more important is taking action, what putting this at the front of the G8 agenda has achieved is a proper agreement, here in the EU to start with, that all countries should exchange tax information, that all countries should act on beneficial ownership, so we know who owns what. I think this is a big step forward.' He went on: 'I explained my G8 agenda, how important I think it is, I explained I think it is important to tackle not just tax evasion but aggressive tax avoidance. 'I asked Eric Schmidt to comment on that and he did in the meeting. I don’t think we’re going to solve this if we simply take one company or another company that is registered in Europe, this one in Ireland. We are going to solve this we are going to have proper concrete action.' Before traveling to the EU summit, Mr Cameron warned other countries the losses from tax avoidance were 'staggering' Algirdas Semeta, European Commissioner for tax, said countries were on course to agree  full automatic exchange of information on income from January 2015. Reports . about global firms cutting their tax bills by taking advantage of . differences between national tax systems 'clearly demonstrate that there . are weaknesses in our corporate taxation system both at EU level and . also internationally', he told BBC Radio 4. A . package of measures has been put forward by the Commission, including . general anti-abuse rules in member states, renegotiation of . double-taxation treaties and a blacklist for tax havens. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny defended his country's tax regime from criticism that it is used by firms to cut their tax bills . 'This package, if implemented thoroughly by member states will make significant change in this area', said Mr Semeta. Earlier Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny brushed off attacks on Ireland's tax regime for helping multinationals avoid billions in tax - insisting he was backing plans for global tax transparency and an end to tax havens. Ireland's low corporate tax rates have been identified in inquiries into how companies such as Google and Apple arrange their tax affairs to reduce liabilities to a minimum. But, heading into EU summit talks in Brussels on cracking down on corporate tax avoidance and tax evasion, Mr Kenny insisted: 'I'd like to repeat that Ireland's corporation tax rate is statute-based, is very clear, very transparent - we do not do special deals with individual companies in relation to that rate.' The Taoiseach said Ireland was one of the first countries to agree a scheme on sharing of tax information with the US. 'Multinationals, in their aggressive tax planning, operate in many jurisdictions,' he said. 'For that reason, Ireland has been very much to the forefront in having and building more international consensus as far as transparency in tax regimes is concerned.'","Cameron hails Brussels summit in tackling 'moral issue' of tax avoidance .

A martial arts fighter was left horrified and embarrassed after the tattoo he had inked on his forearm to honor his grandmother was written backwards. Quinten Wyland, from Oregon, had to pay nearly $400 to correct the mistake. 'It wouldn't be so bad if it was . something else,' Mr Wyland said. 'It'd still be really bad, but . for my grandma's name, that's the worst.' Mistake: Quinten Wyland says it was impossible to read his grandmother's name on the original tattoo . He told KATU that his grandmother, . Grace, had given him strength and support. After her death, Mr Wyland . decided that a tattoo of her name would be a fitting tribute. He had the . tattoo put on his forearm so opponents in martial arts contests would . be able to see it clearly. One . the day Mr Wyland went to Oregon City to get his tattoo he ran into a . family friend who had recently received his tattoo license. James . Langholz offered to do the tribute tattoo for only $40 - a huge . discount for Mr Wyland who had expected to pay more than $100. At first everything seemed to be fine. Mr Wyland approved the sketch that Mr Langholz had drawn, telling KATU: 'It said my grandma's name, ""Grace"", in cursive.' He says that the tattoo was in an awkward place on his arm so when the sketch was put on he couldn't see what it said. But it wasn't until Mr Wyland was proudly showing off the tattoo to a friend later that night, that the problem was spotted. 'I was just completely embarrassed,' he said. The . tattoo artist says that he followed the design his customer had . requested, adding that Mr Wyland had approved the sketch on his arm . before he started work on it. Error: Quinten Wyland's plans for a tribute tattoo to his dead grandmother, Grace, went wrong . 'It says G-r-a-c-e, you can't deny . that,' he said, adding that the letters were correct and blaming the . complaint on buyer's remorse. 'If he wants it that way then that's the way he gets it, because that's the way he likes it,' Mr Langholz said. Mr . Wyland, who has lodged a complaint with the Oregon Health Licensing . Agency, was forced initially to wear long sleeves to cover up the . mistake, and has since had a cover up tattoo to remove it. 'When it's, like, my grandma's name, it brings up a lot of memories and stuff. Not the way I wanted it to be,' Mr Wyland said. Mr Wyland is not the first person to be horrified at the results of a tribute tattoo. Last . year a Canadian tattoo parlor in Halifax was ordered to pay $9,000 in . damages for a spelling error in a tattoo it had created for a grieving . woman. Marie Huckle had asked Newcombe's Ink to do a tattoo  in memory of her friend, that read: 'See You at the Crossroads'. But a spelling error resulted in the tattoo reading: 'See you at the cossroads', CBC News said. The . owner of the tattoo parlor refunded her money and offered to fix the . mistake, but Ms Huckle decided to remove the tattoo with laser . treatment. She needed more than 20 sessions, which were painful and expensive, to fix the error. Cover up: Quinten Wyland has had to pay for a new tattoo to cover over the previous mistake on his forearm . Removing a tattoo is not easy and even with advances in laser treatment, the process will be costly and time consuming. 'Laser removal is the standard of care,' Dr Paul Jarrod Frank, the director of a New York laser center, told CNN, but he added: 'There is no great treatment.' The success of laser treatment also depends of the colors in the tattoo and the skin tone of the patient. Many people chose the option Mr Wyland took however, which is to get a second tattoo put over the mistake. The Oregon Health Licensing Agency, which is responsible for tattoo artists, says that complaints about designs has risen in the past few years, as more people opt to get a tattoo. A license is no indicator of the quality of a tattoo artist's work, the agency warned. It suggests that customers examine the artist's past work, look closely at the stencil, and bring a friend along for a second opinion. However, in Oregon the licensing agency does ask trainee artists to complete 360 hours of training, and to complete 50 tattoos under supervision before being eligible to apply for a license. The state charges $50 for a license, and the tattoo artists must prove they have first aid knowledge and blood borne pathogen training.","Oregon man only notices error after showing tattoo to friend .

The animal had wandered into a field in the Palestinian village of Immaten when it was attacked by a local boy. Fur on its back and abdomen had been almost totally burned off and its skin was raw and blistered. The donkey was rescued days later after villagers called the charity Safe Haven For Donkeys In The Holy Land. Burnie the donkey suffered third-degree burns to its back and abdomen after being set on fire . And after months of treatment he is almost completely recovered and has made friends with a dog who lives at the donkey sanctuary. Safe Haven named him Burnie to remind staff and volunteers what he has been through. The charity's founder and field director Lucy Fensom said when she went to collect him she was 'horrified' at the scale of his injuries. She said Burnie was so traumatised by his ordeal that he was 'visibly shaking' and it took some time to coax him into a horse box. A charity spokeswoman said: 'When the poor little donkey arrived at the sanctuary, the extent of his injuries soon became clear, his whole back and abdomen had 3rd degree burns.' Burnie was put into a separate enclosure so the other donkeys did not accidentally knock his skin as it healed. Safe Haven For Donkeys In The Holy Land spent months nursing the animal with antibiotics and honey . The donkey is now recovering and has made friends with a dog that lives at the sanctuary . For several months, Burnie's bandages were removed and his wounds were treated with fluid antibiotic and 100 per cent pure honey. The charity said honey was used as it kills antibiotic-resistant organisms and helps skin heal. He was also fitted with a special head collar made from a bucket to stop him biting himself as his itchy skin healed. A charity spokeswoman said: 'These days Burnie is like a different donkey. 'Tufts of fur have grown back and although he still lives in an enclosure of his own to protect him from the boisterous members of the donkey herd, he enjoys being near the entrance to the sanctuary, greeting visitors with a bray and a nuzzle. 'He is also taken for a daily walk alongside Lucy’s dog Cadbury and seems to think he is a very large dog himself.' Ms Fensom founded the charity, which is supported by Animal Friends Insurance, in 2001 and since then it has treated more than 10,000 horses, mules and donkeys in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It also runs an education programme and free mobile vet clinics to teach people how to care for the working animals. Elaine Fairfax, managing director of Animal Friends Pet Insurance, said: 'It was heartbreaking to hear about Burnies’ horrific injuries, but seeing him on the road to recovery is simply wonderful and something we’re proud to have been able to support, as well as the other donkeys at Safe haven.'","The animal was attacked when it walked through a field in Palestine .

John Casey, 51, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, had a £20,000 Crown Court trial over claims he concealed a stolen £12 joint of beef because it reminded him of his dead grandmother . A shoplifter had an 'unnecessary' £20,000 Crown Court trial over claims he stole a £12 joint of beef because it reminded him of his dead grandmother. John Casey was caught on camera hiding the roasting joint in a bag at the Asda Washington Galleries store last October and arrested for theft. But the 51-year-old denied he was being dishonest and said he was simply moving the meat out of sight as it was giving him 'flashbacks' about his grandmother, who died of a blood clot when he was a child. The petty crime would usually have only been heard in the lower courts, in front of magistrates. But Casey, of Oxclose, Washington, elected to be tried at a crown court. He was tried over two days by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. The unemployed father-of-eight denied the theft charge throughout. The estimated cost per day of a trial is £10,000 and the case was heard before John Milford QC, one of the north’s top judges. After just over an hour of deliberation Casey, who has never shoplifted in the past but has other convictions, was found guilty. At the end of the case Judge Milford said: 'Ordinarily this is a case that would be dealt with in the lower court but he has elected trial. 'He has the right to be tried by a jury and he has been.' The judge sentenced Casey to a conditional discharge for two years and told him: 'You have caused a huge amount of unnecessary expense to be incurred by electing trial and you have got no means from which you can cover the costs of this expensive trial. 'If you come in front of me again I will be a lot less sympathetic.' The trial started before a jury of three women and nine men mid Tuesday morning. It concluded on Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court at the start of the case: 'The defendant accepts placing the joint of beef in his bag deliberately. 'He says he did so because he was experiencing a flashback to his grandmother’s traumatic death, which had been triggered by the sight of the joint of beef. Casey was caught on camera hiding the roasting joint in a bag at the Asda Washington Galleries store (pictured) last October and arrested for theft . 'He says it was necessary to conceal the beef in order to control the effects of the flashback. 'Such flashbacks are very disturbing says the defendant, who takes medication for depression and anxiety. 'His grandmother passed away when the defendant was a child.' Mr Hodson told jurors: 'It will be up to you to judge how the meat effected his state of mind. 'He was interviewed by the police twice. 'At no time in those interviews did he ever mention anything about his grandmother, flashbacks or having to hide the meat because it was such a horrific sight for him.' Jurors were shown the CCTV footage of Casey putting grocery items, including bread and soup, on to the top of a rucksack which was lying down flat in his trolley. After a few seconds out of sight of the camera he appeared again, this time with the rucksack propped up, the shopping in the trolley and no meat in sight. It was at this point he was stopped by store security, who alerted the police. Casey told jurors during his evidence he had been only seven or eight when he witnessed his grandmother’s death. He said: 'After I picked the meat up and was walking around the shop it was the blood in the bag that was bringing it on. Casey, of Lumley Close, Oxclose, Washington, was tried over two days by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. The unemployed dad-of-eight denied the theft charge throughout . 'Every day my grandmother is with me, I remember her, but this was not like any other. 'I was re-living it, it was like I was there with her again. The blood in the bag was bringing it on, it was like I was there, like I was living it. 'The more I was looking at the blood, the more it was real, surreal.' Casey said he was not trying to steal the meat and told jurors: 'I would never have walked out without paying for it, that’s a dead cert.' During his evidence Casey said he could not remember actually putting the beef in his bag. Eleanor McGrath, Campaign Manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It’s ridiculous that that this case was allowed go as far as the Crown Court and leave taxpayers footing such a massive bill for the trial. 'People will be staggered that the judicial system permitted Casey to be tried in this way rather than in the lower court. 'While the authorities have a duty to ensure that justice is delivered fairly, they must also ensure that it is done in a reasonable way which doesn’t lead to exorbitant costs.'","John Casey hid the roasting joint in a bag at Asda, Washington .

A British rugby player has been killed following a hit and run accident, Italian police have confirmed.

Mr Lynch had moved to Rome recently and played for Capitolina, the city's main rugby club and he also worked for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation which is based in the Italian capital. Fatal injuries: Talented rugby player Brendan Lynch, 26, pictured centre with the ball, was knocked from his scooter by a vehicle which then fled the scene, police said . He was considered to be one of the best tighthead props in Italian rugby and was a regular first team player for Capitolina - whose facilities have been used by England for practice ahead of the Six Nations match against Italy. Police said that Mr Lynch's scooter was hit by another car as he travelled on the Rome ring road near Settebagni just to the north of the capital and the vehicle had then sped off leaving him fatally injured by the side of the road. Passing motorists alerted emergency services but he was declared dead at the scene. Traffic police spokesman Roberto Ferilli said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the accident and are appealing for any witnesses to contact us. 'We are also using cctv footage from the motorway to identify the vehicle. It appears the scooter he was travelling on was hit by another vehicle which failed to stop.'

Despite being born in Rotherham and having British citizenship Mr Lynch had also played for Ireland's Under 19 thanks to his Irish ancestors. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said: 'I can confirm the death of a British national in a road traffic accident - other than that there is nothing else we can say.' A friend of Mr Lynch's, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to him and said: 'He was a really nice guy, really friendly and always had a smile.

She took her first dance steps when she was just two-years-old and packed her first punch at martial art classes aged four. She packs a punch: Ballet dancer and Taekwondo black belt Ava May Llewellyn who has been offered a place at the Royal Ballet School . Ava May was one of the youngest fighters at her club to pick up the esteemed belt when she was awarded the accolade two months ago. She has now beaten 1,000 applicants across the world who were vying for just 24 sought-after places at the Royal Ballet School in London. Ava May, of Downend, Bristol, will begin boarding at the elite Royal Ballet Lower School at White Lodge in the capital's Richmond Park in September.

As many of his poverty-stricken countrymen struggle to eke a living, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe,  blew out the candles on one of five massive cakes at a £650,000 party for 20,000 supporters. In addition to the crocodile – representing the 88-year-old president’s tribe, the Gushungo, there was a matching silver version, an 88kg (195lb) cake in the shape of local mountains, another representing Victoria Falls, and a giant ice cream cake. Cake fit for a tyrant: Mugabe, 88, takes a look at the huge edible crocodile which was created for his birthday celebrations . Crowds from his Zanu-PF political party were treated to concerts, a football competition and beauty parade. But the lavish bash in the eastern city of Mutare infuriated many Zimbabweans, with the independent Standard newspaper carrying the headline ‘Eating cake while the nation starves’. The newspaper reported: 'Impoverished . North Koreans two weeks ago celebrated the birthday of their late leader . Kim Jong-il in style.

Apple Inc's global gadget rollouts are typically high-energy affairs drawing droves of buyers who stand in line for hours. But a proliferation of comparable rival devices may have sapped some interest. Apple staff in Glasgow celebrate the launch of the £269 iPad mini, which went on sale around the world today . The Apple Store Ginza in Tokyo saw the biggest number of fans, with many dressing up for the occasion . Tokyo, Japan where many Apple fans queued up to buy the new iPad mini . About . 50 people waited for the Apple store in Sydney, Australia, to open, . where in the past the line had stretched for several blocks when the . company debuted new iPhones. At the head of Friday's line was Patrick Li, who had been waiting since 4:30 am and was keen to get his hands on the 7.9-inch slate. 'It's light, easy to handle, and I'll use it to read books. It's better than the original iPad,' Li said. There were queues of 100 or more outside Apple stores in Tokyo and Seoul when the device went on sale, but when the company's flagship Hong Kong store opened staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line. The queue for the iPad Mini at The Covent Garden Apple store. Craig Jobbins was first in line to get his iPad Mini. He queued from 3.30am. The iPad mini marks Apple's first foray into the smaller-tablet segment, and the latest salvo in a global mobile-device war that has engulfed combatants from Internet search leader Google Inc to Web retailer Amazon.com Inc and software giant Microsoft Corp. Microsoft's 10-inch Surface tablet, powered by the just-launched Windows 8 software, went on sale in October, while Google and Amazon now dominate sales of smaller, 7-inch multimedia tablets. Unveiled last week, the iPad mini has won mostly positive reviews, with criticism centring on a screen considered inferior to rivals' and a lofty price tag. The new tablet essentially replicates most of the features of its full-sized sibling, but in a smaller package. 'Well, first of all it's so thin and light and very cute - so cute!"" said iPad mini customer Ten Ebihara at the Apple store in Tokyo's upscale Ginza district. Also on Friday, Apple rolled out its fourth-generation iPad, with the same 9.7-inch display as the previous version but with a faster A6X processor and better Wi-Fi. Both devices were going on sale in more than 30 countries. Apple will likely sell between 1 million and 1.5 million iPad minis in the first weekend, far short of the 3 million third-generation iPads sold last March in their first weekend, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.'The reason we expect fewer iPad minis compared to the 3rd Gen is because of the lack of the wireless option and newness of the smaller form factor for consumers,' Munster said in a note to clients. 'We believe that over time that will change.' Reviewers have applauded Apple for squeezing most of the iPad's features into a smaller package that can be comfortably manipulated with one hand. James Vohradsky, a 20 year-old student who previously queued for 17 hours at the Sydney store to buy the iPhone 5, only stood in line for an hour and a half this time. 'I had an iPad 1 before, I kind of miss it because I sold it about a year ago. 'It's just more practical to have the mini because I found it a bit too big. The image is really good and it's got the fast A5 chip too,' Vohradsky said. The iPad was launched in 2010 by late Apple boss Steve Jobs and since then it has taken a big chunk out of PC sales, upending the industry and reinventing mobile computing with its apps-based ecosystem. A smaller tablet is the first device to be added to Apple's compact portfolio under Cook, who took over from Jobs just before his death a year ago. Analysts credit Google and Amazon for influencing the decision. Some investors worry that Apple might have lost its chief visionary with Jobs, and that new management might not be able to stay ahead of the pack as rivals innovate and encroach on its market share. There were queues of 100 or more outside Apple stores in Tokyo and Seoul when the device went on sale, but when the company's flagship Hong Kong store opened staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line.","New gadget sold out online in hours - but failed to attract the massive queues of previous Apple launches .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:58 EST, 27 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 27 September 2012 . After stirring up controversy at the United Nations after unveiling his vision for a 'new world order', Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad decided to spend some time socking up the Manhattan high-life. But as the dictator made himself at home at the luxurious Warwick hotel, his hired underlings were rushing around town to snap up bargains and products they can't get back home at discount stores. Meanwhile, his fellow Iranian delegates were visiting American chains including the Payless shoe store, Costco, Walgreens and Duane Reade to stock up on shampoo, soap, vitamins and cheap clothing. Making an exit: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves from the back of his chauffeur driven car as he leaves the Warwick Hotel . Luxury: Police barricades surround the Warwick hotel, in New York, where the Iranian president is staying during the U.N. meet . Five star home: The President has two whole floors at the Warwick Hotel where suites alone go for $1,600 a night . High alert: Security guards on one of the numerous Warwick Hotel balconies during the president's visit . A man assigned to work with the Iranians told the Daily News: 'Since they are under sanctions, they can’t get this stuff. Their money is weak compared to the dollar.' Tough sanctions have been imposed on Iran as punishment for its failure to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to prove the peaceful nature of its drive to enrich uranium to levels that could be used to build a nuclear weapon. This has made it difficult for Iranians to get hold of any foreign goods or imported products. The source added that one Iranian bought a $40 pair of children's shoes at the Payless store on Fifth Avenue but the purchase nearly wiped out his spending money for the trip. At a Harlem Costco, they bought an assortment of wholesale shampoos before heading to a drugstore where they purchased more than a dozen bottles of vitamins and Tylenol. Controversial: Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gives a 'V' peace sign before addressing the United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York City, New York . Opposition: A protestor in a President Ahmadinejad head demonstrates outside the Warwick Hotel . Undercover: A white tent has been erected around the entrance of the Warwick Hotel to protect dignitaries as the enter and leave . Unpopular: Demonstrators participate in a rally against the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad near the Warwick New York Hotel where the controversial leader is staying at while in New York for the United Nations General Assembly . While his staff hunted for bargains, the President booked two full floors at the posh hotel where suites cost up to $1,600 a night and had three personal chefs at his beck and call. The cooks brought in their own food to cook for Ahmadinejad and his staff - who dine separately on the second floor. At least a dozen federal officers have been assigned to protect visiting dignitaries at the hotel commissioned by William Randolph Hearst in 1924. Ahmadinejad has entered and departed the hotel through a security entrance covered by a white tent so that no one can  see the Iranian dictator. During his stay in the U.S., Ahmadinejad has continued to taunt the West, calling for America to stop bullying and encroaching on his nation's sovereignty, in his trademark inflammatory style. He spoke at length at the United Nations about his vision for a 'new world order', telling the delegates: 'God willing, a new order will come together and we'll do away with everything that distances us. A world away: While the president enjoyed five star luxury, his staff were bargain hunting at Costco . Bargain hunt: The delegate bought items difficult to find in Iran because of U.N. sanctions . 'I do believe the system of empires has reached the end of the road. The world can no longer see an emperor commanding it.' He then accused the West of nuclear 'intimidation and claimed Iran is under threat of military action from 'uncivilized Zionists' - in a reference to Israel - saying that such threats are designed to force nations into submission. 'Continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality,' he said. As he spoke, protesters swarmed the streets outside the UN building, many of them Iranian-Americans, demanding that Iran's UN seat be taken away. An Iranian diplomat had to be escorted from a Manhattan street by police after he was surrounded and threatened by an angry mob of protesters near the United Nations building. Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast was walking near the United Nations when he was noticed and confronted by the angry mob on Second Avenue near East 48th Street, said NYPD spokesman Paul Browne. Addressing the nations: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks at the U.N. HQ in New York . Empty seats: Many chairs were left empty as Ahmadinejad, President of Iran, addressed the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday . He flagged down police officers, who helped him get to a safe spot. Ahmadinejad's speech on Wednesday happened to fall on Yom Kippur, the most sacred day on the Jewish calendar, devoted to fasting, prayer and introspection. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement condemning the speech soon after the fast ended. 'On the day when we pray to be inscribed in the book of life a platform was given to a dictatorial regime that strives, at every opportunity, to sentence us to death,' Netanyahu said. ‘In my remarks to the UN General Assembly, they will hear my response. History has proven that those who have wanted to wipe us off the map have failed, as the Jewish People have overcome all obstacles,' Netanyahu concluded. He will be speaking to the U.N. later today about what Israel perceives as the Iranian threat. Israel and many in the West suspect that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and cite its failure to cooperate fully with nuclear inspectors. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.

It had been hoped that the return of acerbic judge Jason Gardiner this year would boost ratings, but even the inclusion of Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts on the judging panel did little to entice viewers to tune in.

Nancy Dell'Olio has revealed she has faked orgasms in the past, but only to make her man feel better. Speaking live on today's This Morning, the Italian-American lawyer and ex-girlfriend of former England manager Sven-Goran Erikkson said faking orgasms was an act of generosity, kindness and love, and frequently done by women who are much more 'complicated' to pleasure than men and find it tricky to reach, . Nancy also said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for a man to pretend to climax, despite appearing on the ITV talk show alongside former Loaded editor Martin Daubney, who said he has faked it in the past. Scroll down for video . Nancy Dell'Ollio appeared live on ITV this morning to talk about faking orgasms . The pair were speaking with presenters Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield, and sex and relationships expert Susan Quilliam, in light of a new book, Why Men Fake It: The Totally Unexpected Truth About Men And Sex by Abraham Morgentaler, which says that increasing numbers of both women and men are faking their orgasms during sex. Morgentaler's research shows that 74 per cent of women and 22 per cent of men fake orgasms to make their partners feel better. Dell'Olio said: 'I can't remember the circumstances of faking it but he was trying and to make him feel better I faked it. Of course. Women are more complicated than men and it is more difficult for us to achieve orgasm. But it is surely more difficult for men to get away with.' Dell'Olio appeared alongside writer Martin Daubney, who said that he had also faked orgasms in the past with ex-lovers . Daubney said he used to fake orgasms with an ex-partner because she was unreliable about taking her contraceptive pill and he wasn't ready to have children, so to avoid arguments about using condoms he would lie. He added: 'People think that sex is all about orgasms for men. In actual fact we're much more sensitive souls than you'd believe. 'There's an expectation on men, so they get anxious, and if you're anxious it's more difficult to reach an endgame.' Holly wondered how men could . physically fake orgasms, pointing out that there are 'telltale signs'. Daubney said that the book reveals that two-thirds of men get away with . it... but one third don't. Quilliam . explained that if everyone fakes it, nobody will ever learn what . they're doing wrong. She said: 'It's about generosity and love. We do it . for the best reasons, but it's not the best way to love. 'The best way . is to have conversation. If you're faking it, either the conversation or . stimulation is wrong.' Nancy Dell'Ollio, Martin Daubney and Susan Quilliam appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss whether or not people ought to fake orgasms with partners . Holly Willoughby wondered how men could fake orgasm, asking: 'Aren't there telltale signs?' She . added that the best way to stop having to fake it is to talk about sex . with your partner, stressing that during such an intimate conversation . you must be careful not to issue blame; to highlight that you want to . make the relationship even better, and to make it a calm, measured . conversation rather than one fraught with emotion.

Incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney has given the clearest signal yet he is willing to see higher inflation for longer to support economic growth. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Carney indicated he was prepared to see inflation, which is currently running at 2.7 per cent, remain higher than the government's two per cent goal for longer if it means output can be increased faster. He said: 'If you are coming from above [the inflation target] and you have a fiscal consolidation you might take a little longer to get back given the issues with output.' Hope for Britain: Sparky Mark Carney expressed support for radical policy and self-sustainability . Mr Carney was unveiled in November as the surprise choice to succeed Sir Mervyn King but has rarely spoken about monetary policy ahead of his taking over in July. While interest rates have remained at a record low of 0.5 per cent for almost four years, the Bank has pumped £375billion into the economy via quantitative easing – printing money. Economists are looking to the Canadian to lift the economy out of the doldrums, where it languishes 3.3 per cent below its peak before the 2008 recession. A report from the Office for National Statistics last week fuelled fears that Britain is sliding towards a triple-dip recession. Two thirds of smaller firms who trade online and export goods overseas are confident of growing sales this year, according to a study. A survey of more than 330 companies by the Royal Mail found that markets in the United States and Europe were top targets, followed by Canada, Asia and Russia. Nick Landon, Managing Director of Royal Mail Parcels, said: 'Royal Mail's study shows UK online retailers will be actively seeking new international markets in 2013 to help them achieve their growth plans.' Mr Carney's comments were met with some surprise in the City last night. David Buik, of Cantor Index, said: 'I . was surprised to see Mr Carney so vociferous, considering his feet are . not under Sir Mervyn's table yet. '[But his] thinking is not wholly different to that of the existing BoE management.'The . new Bank of England governor today insisted that ideas on monetary . policy were not yet 'maxed out', in a radical speech at Davos. Mark Carney, who will remain head of Canada's central . bank until July, said the world's major economies needed to achieve . 'escape velocity' - in which growth becomes self-sustaining. His . speech advocated a dramatically looser system to that supported by Sir . Melvyn, who had implied there was little more he could do to boost . growth. Mr Carney said central banks do not have the powers to 'to take all of these risks out to get a sustainable recovery'. It will come as good news to George Osborne, boosting the Tories' deficit cutting programme. 'Don't relax': International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde told banking chiefs to keep up momentum . 'You internalise the fiscal stance in . the monetary policy mix,' said Mr Carney. 'Monetary policy is more . nimble than fiscal policy.' His call to arms came as International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde urged a closing panel: 'Do not relax.' She said the IMF outlook for a 'fragile . and timid' recovery depended on officials in the powerhouse economies of . Europe, the U.S. and Japan making 'the right decisions.' And . it seems that Mr Carney will not shy away from difficult subjects, as . he confronted those who suggested that monetary policy was impotent. Made the cut: Chancellor George Osborne will be pleased Mr Carney supports domestic deficit reduction . In . a direct rejection of a comment from Angel Gurría, secretary-general of . the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said: 'I . would take issue with Angel in saying that monetary policy is maxed out. 'There continue to be . monetary policy options in all major economies and they have to be . framed in the context of the [monetary policy] mandate.' The fiery banking chief emphasised . 'flexible inflation targeting' for developed countries, using . 'communication' and 'other unconventional instruments' to allow achieve . price stability and sustainable growth over time. He underlined his activist approach by adding: 'The role of central bank is to determine the optimal path to return inflation to target taking into account all the broader impacts on the economy and the impact on financial vulnerability, including the global financial situation.' The meeting of 2,500 business, financial and political leaders took place in a more upbeat atmosphere than last year. Fears over the breakup the euro currency . union have eased, while the U.S. has avoided the 'fiscal . cliff' of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that threatened to . push the world's largest economy back into recession. The IMF estimates that the world economy . will grow about 3.5 per cent this year, modestly better than last year's . 3.2 per cent. Yet the improvement is uneven, with the eurozone and Japan in recession, although the U.S. is growing, and emerging economies such as . China are expanding much more quickly. Lagarde said the eurozone was still in 'a . very fragile situation' that was made more risky through a slow . decision-making process and occasional backtracking on initiatives. 'Good decisions have been made,' she . said. 'Sometimes at the last minute, as in the United States, sometimes . laborious and confusingly as in the eurozone. In 2013 they . have to keep up the momentum'","Incoming governor is prepared for inflation to stay higher for longer .

Rare and beautiful shots of alien-looking moon jellyfish have been captured by an Israeli photographer in the Red Sea. Photographer Yuzuru Masuda, 37, captured these stunning images of the moon jellyfish as he snorkelled during an excursion off the coast of Saudi Arabia. Masuda watched and swam with the jellyfish for two hours and because they don't sting he could let them swim right up to him and even brush against his arm. Photographer Yuzuru Masuda captures a stunning image taken while snorkelling underneath a moon jellyfish while in the Red Sea. The fascinating creatures look like UFOs. This image shows a fish swimming beneath it. Moon jellyfish don't sting meaning photographer Yuzuru Masuda could swim right up to the creatures in order to capture shots such as this one, while snorkelling in the Red Sea . The official name of the moon jellyfish is aurelia aurita. It is also known as the moon jelly, common jellyfish, or saucer jelly. All the species in the aurealia genus look and swim so similarly that it's difficult to identify related, and it is difficult to identify which is which with taking gene samples. The moon jellyfish grows to about 40cm in diameter. It eats plankton and molluscs with its tentacles and brings them into their bodies to be digested. It can only make small, limited movements so usually drifts with the current, even when swimming. It can't sting and is often attacked by sea birds, sea turtles and the Ocean Sunfish. Mr Masuda, from Eliat, Israel, said: 'I was snorkelling on my own near the border to Egypt when countless jellyfish drifted in. I knew this species didn't sting so I was not scared but mesmerised by their slow and graceful pulsating movement. 'To the naked eye underwater, the jellyfish appear a little more pink . and the very soft and diffused transparent colour really makes them look . like fairies.' The jellyfish, which measured 20 - 25 centimetres in diameter, can swim . by pulsating their tentacles but were also carried along by the current. Mr Masuda added: 'The jellyfish look like they are individual cells with . their own subconscious intelligence to guide through drifting life . style. 'I also learned they provide shelter for juvenile fish that also got drifted by the current, which I thought was sweet. 'I was very close and swam among many of the jellyfish and they would contact my arms or legs even without trying. 'As long as I found individuals with beautiful shapes I continued to . shoot, because I did not have a time limit I would have had if I had . been scuba diving. 'I surfaced when my body could not stop shivering underwater from staying in cold water without proper wetsuit. 'The many jellyfish drifted off but also many new jellyfish kept coming.' Mr Masuda also saw many colourful fish, blue spotted stingrays, Moray eels, octopuses, squid, lionfish, barracudas and turtles. The moon jellyfish is translucent and grows to about 40 cm in diameter. It can be identified by its four horseshoe-shaped gonads (pictured), seen through the top of the bell. This image was captured by photographer Yuzuru Masuda in the Red Sea . The moon jellyfish doesn't sting. This means it is often attacked by sea birds and sea turtles. It is part of the aurelia genus of jellyfish that lives along the eastern Atlantic coast of Northern Europe and the western Atlantic coast of North America in New England and Eastern Canada. It is usually found in estuaries and harbours .","Rare photos show the moon jellyfish floating and being carried by the current in the Red Sea .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 17:50 EST, 20 February 2012 . U.S. politicians are rapidly losing faith in the dollar, with more than a dozen states proposing legislation to legalise gold and silver as a currency. Politicians in Colorado concerned about the nation's financial stability are the latest to push a bill to legalise gold and silver coins as usable currency. But from a consumer angle the conservative bill would not lead to people carrying gold nuggets in their purses and would have little practical effect. Varying values: Five coins on the left were minted over 100 years ago and are worth thousands of dollars. The five on the right were minted in the last few years and are worth their face values of $1 to $25 . The GOP proposal reflects anxieties about the domestic consequences of the European debt crisis and chronic deficit spending in Washington D.C. Backup: Republican Senator Kent Lambert's bill in Colorado is designed to provide consumers with alternatives in case the dollar falls badly . ‘There are lots of concerns about the U.S. monetary system,’ said the bill's sponsor, Republican Senator Kent Lambert of Colorado Springs. ‘There's no way to maintain the value of anything if countries start a race to the bottom by inflating their currency to get out of debt.’ GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul believes the U.S. should return to the gold standard, so paper currency is guaranteed by precious metal. ‘I am not a Ron Paul kind of guy,’ Senator Lambert said. ‘But that's something I think is very legitimate that he brought up.’ Utah legalised gold and silver as a . currency option last year. Politicians in more than 12 other states have . proposed similar legislation on currency. Rich Danker of Washington-based conservative think tank the American Principles Project favours a return to the gold standard. ‘These bills offer a sound monetary . alternative to the U.S. dollar,’ he said. ‘They allow people to store . their wealth in coins that will not decrease in value.’ Support: GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul believes the U.S. should return to the gold standard, so paper currency is guaranteed by precious metal . Minted U.S. gold and silver coins retain their face value, even if the value of the coins' precious metals rises. So a $20 gold coin minted in the 1800s is still legally worth $20, even though its real value may be thousands of dollars in today's market. Gold was trading at above $1,700 an ounce last Friday. The U.S. largely abandoned gold-backed money during World War One to pay for the war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt basically banned gold and silver as legal currency to prevent hoarding during the Great Depression. President Richard Nixon formally abandoned the gold standard in 1971. The Colorado proposal faces long odds. People who want to spend gold and silver coins currently have to convert . them to paper dollars first. Gold and silver coins made by the U.S. Mint are mostly used for investment portfolios. People can trade them, with capital gains taxes on profits. Senator Lambert's bill is designed to provide consumers alternatives in case the dollar falls badly. It would not make merchants accept nuggets of gold and silver as payment. Colorado has a rich mining history, and its gold and silver caches helped finance construction of the state Capitol in the 19th century. The state no longer keeps reserves of gold nor silver, although gold and silver bullion are kept at the U.S. Mint in Denver, near to the Capitol. The bill cleared a Senate committee and awaits a vote in the full chamber.","Bill to legalise gold & silver coins as usable currency .

Cartographers at the open-source . company then sifted through the images to remove the clouds and haze . caused by the atmosphere to get a clear shot of the ground. Traditionally, these images would . then be sewn together but this method can leave visible seams in the map . and images next to each might come from different days, so the images . would tie up exactly. To solve this problem, MapBox took all the images of an area and put them one on top of the other. The columns of pixels are then reordered based on how cloudy each one showed that area to be. The team did this for every pixel in the world. MapBox starts with the data captured by Nasa MODIS system, which can image the entire Earth every one to two days. According to Chris Herwig, a MapBox data analyst: 'One . of the first sorting processes we had is that we came up with a plan to . obtain images from the summer in the northern and southern hemispheres. 'We only downloaded images from certain dates and from certain locations.' The MODIS system is attached to a pair of satellites called Terra and Aqua which were launched into orbit in 1999 and 2002 respectively. The satellites and the MODIS system images can collect data using the visual field wavelength. Once MapBox selected the data it wanted, the relevant images were moved from Nasa's servers to MapBox's. Speaking before the launch, MapBox . cartographer Charlie Lloyd said: 'For the new release we’re processing . two years of imagery, captured from January 1, 2011 through December 31, . 2012.

Mr Pickens Sr, who made a $1.4bn fortune buying and selling oil companies, is said to have launched legal proceedings after what began as a blog about Mr Pickens Jr's health problems became more personal and offensive.

The father, along with three of his children, is said to be suing Mr Pickens Jr over alleged defamation, invasion of privacy, libel, harmful access by computer and extortion. Court documents are said to show Mr Pickens Sr, universally known as T. Boone Pickens, is concerned about damage to his family's reputation, and accuses his son of lying in a bid to extort $20m out of him. In the blog, which he began in October last year, Mr Pickens Jr portrays himself as the victim of years of emotional abuse, writing about poor parenting, petty fighting, and drug and alcohol abuse. Its author writes: 'I was clinically depressed at age 10. 'I began drinking beer and whiskey when I was 12 - by the time I was 17 I was a drug addict and an alcoholic smoking pot every day before and after school, eating my mother's valium and darvon and snorting cocaine and tripping on LSD. 'I drank until drunk five nights of every week of my life. I lived this way for 40 years - by the time my life imploded I had been physically addicted to Benzodiazepines and Opiates for 10 years.

Some posts describe Mr Pickens Jr's own drug and alcohol use, but others attack his family, accusing his siblings of drug dependence and stealing from their own mother, and accusing his father of being uncaring and unkind. The family, which is based in Dallas, accuses Mr Pickens Jr of lying in a bid to extort money from his family. A written testimony from Mr Pickens Sr quoted in the Daily Telegraph says: 'I am suffering physical manifestations of distress, including elevated blood pressure, which is very unusual for me. 'I am deeply embarrassed by Mike’s statements and actions.' Meanwhile Mr Pickens Jr's son, also called Michael Pickens, who is not involved in the court battle, told Forbes: 'I love my father dearly, and I know he loves me. 'But this blog stuff is out of control, it’s not accurate in the least.' Michael Pickens Jr has a long history of substance abuse, and in 2007 he was given probation for fraud.  His father paid $1.2m restitution to his victims, and paid for his son to go to rehab.","Medical examiner finds Thomas 'Ty' Pickens, 21, died of acute heroin intoxication .

Rick and Mary Todd, the parents of an American software engineer Shane Todd - who was found hanged in his apartment in Singapore in June 2012, said on Wednesday they were withdrawing for the country's inquest into their son's death. The Todds do not believe their son committed suicide and want a thorough investigation into the circumstances of Shane's death but say they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process. They believe he may have been murdered over . his research into material used to make heat-resistant . semiconductors, a technology with both civilian and military . applications. Enough: Rick and Mary Todd believe their son was murdered last year in Singapore. They withdrew from the inquest on Wednesday, saying they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process . Tragic: Shane Todd, a high-tech researcher, was found hanged in his apartment in Singapore in June 2012. His parents believe he was murdered due to the sensitive research he was involved in . The body of 31-year-old Shane Truman Todd's was found in . his Singapore apartment by his girlfriend Shirly Sarmiento, a Filipino nurse, on June 24, 2012. Police have . said he killed himself. The engineer was found hanging after he had reportedly been unhappy at work and had written suicide . notes before he died, authorities have said. Police found no signs of forced entry into the apartment and he had no visible signs of injury on his body except redness on his forearms and legs. But police did find links to suicide websites on his laptop and suicide letters written to Todd's family members and loved ones. Close: Mary and Rick Todd, center, are mourning the death of their son Shane (back right, pictured with brothers John, back left, Dylan, front right, Chet and his wife Corynne , front left) Shirly Sarmiento had earlier told the inquest that he suffered from depression and that . he had mounting unhappiness with the 'dishonest environment' in his . workplace. She also mentioned he feared 'heavy hands coming after him.' His parents Rick and Mary Todd have said they consider the evidence presented by police to be fake. Rick Todd said his son in early 2012 . had expressed concerns to his parents that he was being asked to . compromise U.S. security. But he said Shane Todd wasn't specific. Mary Todd also said the alleged . suicide note was obviously fake because it thanked the Institute of . Microelectronics, the former employer he had grown to hate, and had . other false details. Family: Shane Todd's brothers John (left), Dylan (second from left), Chet (second from right) and his sister-in-law Corynne (right) had traveled to Singapore this May to attend the inquest . Witness: Shane's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento (center on May 14 with the Todd family) testified at the inquest into the 31-year-old death . On Tuesday, a key witness in the ongoing inquest withdrew his initial claims that Todd was strangled. The state, meanwhile, introduced a witness who contradicts the parents' claim that their son was killed before June 23. The parents, who traveled to Singapore from their home in Montana, issued a statement Wednesday saying they will no longer participate in the inquest and will return to the U.S. 'We have been told that the coroner's inquiry is not adversarial, rather it is a fact-finding mission with the sole purpose of getting to the truth,' the statement said. 'This has not been our experience. We no longer have confidence in the transparency in the findings of the system. It appears to us that the outcome has already been predetermined.' The parents, who had been expected to testify at the inquest, also have said the crime scene at their son's apartment was compromised, with key computer evidence mishandled. The FBI, however, has supported Singapore police claims that a hard drive found at Todd's apartment was handled by Singapore authorities who were checking for evidence, and not by an unknown person. 'We were looking forward to an honest and transparent court proceeding,' the parents' statement said. 'Sadly, this has not been the case. Therefore, we have decided that our presence in Singapore will have no bearing on the outcome of this case.' Brothers: Shane Todd was one of four boys and is grieving family want to know the truth about his death . Warning: Shane Todd's father Rick said his son had become fearful for his safety due to the sensitive technological research he was engaged in . Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said the government regrets the family's decision to leave the inquiry. 'For . reasons best known to them, they walked out and it's unfortunate that . they decided to leave,' Shanmugam told a news conference. 'The . family had said previously that they had found the hard drive . themselves, and they asserted that this hard drive had been processed by . a third party,' he said. 'It would have been useful to hear the family's side as to how they had come to a different view of the facts.' Gloria . James-Civetta, a lawyer for the Todds, said the family would leave . Singapore this week, but she would not comment on what their intentions . were.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 05:58 EST, 20 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:28 EST, 20 May 2013 . Stephen Onley had hip surgery in December 2010 and doctors ignored his request that an epidural was not used. He is pictured with wife, Caroline . A social worker who cared for people with spinal injuries has sued the NHS after he underwent a hip operation that left him permanently paralysed. Stephen Onley, 52, went under the knife for a routine procedure but doctors ignored his request that an epidural was not used. The grandfather, who had spent years working with disabled people, asked staff not to use an epidural to numb the area because he was aware of the risk of spinal injury. However, staff said it was necessary and administered it while he was under general anaesthetic. They then failed to monitor him properly after surgery and his blood pressure fell so low that his spinal cord was deprived of blood - leading to paralysis from the waist down. As a result, he is now bedridden. The irreparable damage wasn’t spotted until nearly two days after surgery when an MRI scan confirmed he would never be able to walk again. Mr Onley, from Bromsgrove, Worcester, is now wheelchair-bound and completely reliant on around-the-clock care from his wife Caroline, 55. He underwent the procedure in 2010 at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham - which has now admitted responsibility. He said: 'I had spent more than 35 years caring for people with spinal injuries and so I was only too aware that epidurals carry a small risk of paralysis. 'I had made up my mind not to have an epidural under any circumstances but was told that it was recommended. 'As a result of the mistakes the hospital made through not monitoring my blood pressure, I will never walk again. 'My lack of mobility has also meant I have now developed painful pressure sores and for the past year I have been virtually bedridden. 'I am now completely reliant upon my wife who has to care for me round the clock. Caroline has been fantastic and I don’t know how I would have coped without her.' The NHS Trust admitted full responsibility for both the irreversible spinal damage as well as a perforated bowel which he suffered due to further inadequate care. Following the surgery staff at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham failed to monitor Mr Onley's blood pressure and it fell so low that his spinal cord was deprived of blood causing him to be permanently paralysed . A future settlement, which medical law experts Irwin Mitchell are thrashing out with the Trust, will provide the lifetime of care and equipment Mr Onley needs. The problems began in December 2010 when he underwent routine resurfacing surgery on his right hip and doctors inserted an epidural to help control post-operative pain. In the hours that followed the surgery routine blood pressure checks were missed and by the next day Mr Onley’s blood pressure had fallen dangerously low. But it was not until two days later that night-staff suspected there was a problem when he appeared to have no feeling or movement from the waist down. An MRI scan later that day confirmed that he was permanently paralysed. Mr Onley spent two months in hospital and a further six months in a rehabilitation unit. He is now virtually bedridden and his wife, Caroline, has to care for him 24 hours a day . As a result, Mr Onley had to spend more than two months in hospital and a further six months in a specialist spinal injuries unit, before finally being allowed home in August 2011. Graham Bragg, Active Chief Executive at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, apologised to Mr Onley for the blunder. He said: 'We are sorry for the complications Mr Onley experienced. A number of allegations have been made regarding his treatment. 'We have admitted liability regarding some aspects of the management of the complications Mr Onley experienced and apologised to him. 'We are committed to providing an excellent service and continually recognise the need to learn from our failings to improve the service we provide to all patients.' The NHS Trust admitted full responsibility for both the irreversible spinal damage as well as a perforated bowel which he suffered due to further inadequate care . Lawyer Tim Deeming, from Irwin Mitchell solicitors, who is representing him, said: 'Stephen and Caroline have been devastated by what has happened. 'Apart from suffering hip pain, Stephen was a fit and active individual and believed that within a few weeks he would be recovered and back at work. 'To be told the news that you will spend the rest of your life reliant upon a wheelchair is unimaginable and to discover that this life long injury is as a result of a mistake which was entirely avoidable, has been incredibly hard for them both to come to terms with. 'Sadly this is not the first time that I have dealt with catastrophic injuries resulting from epidurals. 'Although no amount of money will ever turn back the clock for Stephen, we will now work with the Trust to provide Stephen with the financial support he requires.'","Stephen Onley had surgery at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham .

Some High Street pharmacies are giving customers poor quality and even dangerous advice about their medicines, claims a new survey. Almost three-quarters of pharmacists did not warn about the hazards of mixing prescription drugs with a heartburn remedy. The survey showed pharmacies in big chains and supermarkets give a better service than High Street independents. Almost three-quarters of pharmacists did not warn about the hazards of mixing prescription drugs with a heartburn remedy . Which? sent trained undercover mystery shoppers into 122 pharmacies across the UK and an expert panel of three experienced pharmacists rated the advice they received. It found some pharmacies are giving out advice without asking the right questions, with potentially serious consequences for their customers’ health. Advice from pharmacies was given an unsatisfactory rating in around four in ten (43 per cent) visits overall, almost 10 per cent higher than a previous survey in 2008. Which? sent mystery shoppers into 122 pharmacies . There was a marked difference in the quality of advice given from different types of pharmacies.Independent pharmacies gave unsatisfactory advice more than half of the time compared to a third of the time for the leading chains and supermarkets – with no change on the last survey. In one scenario, a customer taking the drug warfarin to prevent blood clots requested a heartburn remedy called Pantoloc Control . Pharmacies should have asked basic but important questions about existing prescription medication because it can interfere with warfarin levels in the blood, leading to bleeding problems and even hospitalisation. But the advice was rated unsatisfactory in 71 per cent of the visits – the worst finding. On visits where counter assistants dealt with mystery shoppers without consulting a pharmacist, two thirds gave poor advice compared with one in four when involving a pharmacist. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said ‘Too many pharmacies are still failing their customers, with some potentially serious consequences. ‘We’re pleased that the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the General Pharmaceutical Council recognise our concerns and are taking steps to tackle these issues. ‘Consumers should be able to trust the advice they receive from any pharmacy they visit.’ In a separate snapshot study, Which? also discovered that two-thirds of pharmacies did not follow the professional guidance by failing to explain there is no scientific evidence that homeopathy works. Martin Astbury, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said ‘The pharmacists I know won’t recognise their own practice in the results Which? have shared with us. Which? said that chains and supermarkets performed better in their study . ‘The RPS wants to understand the underlying reasons for the differences highlighted by this report and how to improve consistency of the advice the public receive when they purchase medicines from a pharmacy. There are some areas which require improvement. ‘We have commissioned the University of Nottingham to look internationally for best practice on the sale of medicines through pharmacy.  We will use the outcomes of this to make recommendations as to how pharmacists’ skills can be used most effectively in Great Britain to ensure the public get the best possible advice.’","Which? sent undercover mystery shoppers into 122 pharmacies .

The chief information security officer from online payment service, PayPal, has predicted that the end of passwords is nigh. Speaking at the IT conference Interop in Las Vegas on Monday, Michael Barrett said he wants to see a mixture of online passwords with hardware-based identification such as finger print scanning becoming more common. Barrett also said he thinks the technology won't become popular until large companies adopt it, but believes Apple will lead the way if the technology is added to the iPhone 6. PayPal's chief information security officer Michael Barrett believes that the end of passwords is nigh. Speaking at the Interop conference in Las Vegas, Barrett said that too many people are using the same passwords across accounts and wants to see a mix of online and physical passwords introduced to increase security . The Worst Passwords of 2012, including their current ranking and any changes from the 2011 list: . 1. password (Unchanged) 2. 123456 (Unchanged) 3. 12345678 (Unchanged) 4. abc123 (Up 1) 5. qwerty (Down 1) 6. monkey (Unchanged) 7. letmein (Up 1) 8. dragon (Up 2) 9. 111111 (Up 3) 10. baseball (Up 1) Source: Splashdata . During the keynote speech, Barrett said: 'Passwords, when used ubiquitously everywhere at Internetscale are starting to fail us. 'Users will pick poor passwords and then they'll reuse them everywhere. 'That has the effect of reducing the security of their most secure account to the security of the least secure place they visit on the internet.' Barrett wants to see an increase in the amount of physical ID systems being used, such as eye-tracking technology and fingerprint scanners. And believes that if Apple launches the iPhone 6 with a built-in fingerprint scanner, as is rumoured, the company will lead the way for the technology to become more widespread. Michael Barrett, the chief information security officer from PayPal, believes passwords are dead and wants to see a mixture of physical technology, such as fingerprint scanners, combined with online passwords. He believes that Apple will launch the iPhone 6 with fingerprint technology last this year . Barrett said: 'It's widely rumored that a large technology provider in Cupertino will come out with a phone later this year that has a fingerprint reader on it.' 'There is going to be a fingerprint enabled phone on the market later this year. Not just one, multiple.' One organisation that already provides this mix of software and hardware authenticators is Barrett's own Fast IdentityOnline (FIDO). A FIDO user will have a FIDO Authenticator or token that they chose or was given to them by a vendor such as Apple. This includes fingerprint scanners or a USB memory drive with a password. FIDO Authenticators come in two forms: Identification tokens are unique identifiers that can be connected to your internet accounts. Once they are connected to your account, they will automatically identify you and log you in. The other form of authenticator is Authentication tokens. These ask you to complete an action such as entering a password, PIN, of finger swipe each time you want to access your account. This is known as a two-factor authentication that combines 'something you have', such as the token, with 'something you know', such as a password, or 'something you are', such as your fingerprints. The system also comes with a browser plug-in that can recognise connected tokens. Fast IdentityOnline (FIDO) is an authentication company that uses a mix of security software and physical authenticator tokens to make accessing online accounts more secure.

A panoramic view of Llano de Chajnantors spacious grounds where the 66 antennas of the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) will be switched on today . To be switched on today, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, . or ALMA, is the world’s most powerful telescope.

To keep altitude sickness at bay, as much work as possible . is done at a control centre on lower ground. Visits to the telescope site . are kept as short as possible and workers carry oxygen tanks. A member of the media takes pictures of the series of parabolic antennas of the ALMA project at the El Llano de Chajnantor in the Atacama desert, some 1074 miles north of Santiago and 5000 metres above sea level . The Chilean desert was chosen because it is one of the few places in the world where it is still possible to find a high, dry location unaffected by pollution from artificial light . Rather than one single telescope, it is made up of 66 giant . antennae which gather faint radio waves from space for processing by a . supercomputer. Costing £950million to build, including around £65million . from the UK, and billed as being ‘in search of our cosmic origins’, it is hoped . it will provide answers as to where the stars, the planets, and, ultimately where we came from. By collecting radio waves rather than optical light, ALMA . can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space. This will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just . after the Big Bang. It can also look at how individual stars and planets are . formed. This could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements . spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun, the planets and, . eventually, humans. It will also tell us more about where life came from by . finding traces of compounds from water to chemicals similar those in DNA. Brian Ellison, of the Science and Technology Facilities .

Radio telescope antennas of the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) project, in the Atacama desert, some 1500 km north of Santiago, on March 12,2013 . The secret to the £1 billion facility's incredible resolution comes from two factors: height and distance. ALMA's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level. This is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapor, which obscures observations. Astronomers working in ALMA's facility at 9,500 feet (2,900 meters) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays. The system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas. When the array is finished, there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 9.9 miles (16 kilometers) apart. The . antennas capture astronomical signals from the sky individually, then . combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information . about where the signals come from. Researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us, but on a universe-size scale. This . high resolution not only lets ALMA observe young planetary systems, but . also pin down hydrogen and other life-building blocks in gas clouds. The array can also track the evolution of galaxies.","ALMA is situated in the Chile desert at 16,400ft – roughly half the .

Now, an innovative medical product called frozenpeaz – sealed packs containing tiny balls of solidified corn syrup, dyed pea-green – looks just like the vegetables and offers the same benefits, without wasting food. Traditional ice packs – usually plastic bags containing silicone gel – and cold compresses reduce swelling by constricting blood vessels and can numb pain. They are widely used to treat injuries and tackle acute and chronic pain. New remedy: Researchers have created a new medical product called Frozenpeaz, pictured, which can be repeatedly frozen and re-used to sooth aches and pains . But the NHS recommends a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel as a good ice pack for joint pain, sprains, strains and bruises. They are useful and convenient because ice packs often need to thaw, lessening the chilling effect, while peas conform to the shape of the knee or other joint. But once they are thawed, they form into clumps when refrozen. The new product replicates the benefits of placing a bag of frozen peas on a strain or ache . Now researchers have developed a perfect ‘bag of peas’ that can be refrozen without losing its shape. Frozenpeaz conform to the shape of the joint no matter how many times they are frozen. The corn syrup ‘peas’ – the same size and colour as the edible type – come in bags that can be put into wraps shaped for knees, shoulders and faces. They cost £20 to £50. Frozenpeaz need to be in a freezer for four hours to freeze completely, but will provide some relief after two hours. Twenty minutes is the recommended maximum time for a session of cold therapy. The same device can be used to provide heat therapy, also effective in treating chronic joint pain. Instead of putting the ‘peas’ in a freezer, pop them into a microwave. They can help relax sore muscles or increase the range of motion in a painful joint. ‘Ice packs and hot and cold treatments are a proven way of easing the pain of arthritis in the short term, and some might find this product useful,’ says Jane Tadman of Arthritis Research UK. ‘But they are much more expensive than a pack of peas.’","New sealed packs of Frozenpeaz contain .

It is one of the most highly-discussed and tested Renaissance pictures - and now it will go under the hammer for at least £1,000,000. The De Brécy Tondo painting of the Madonna and Child, which is considered to be one of Raphael's masterpieces and believed to be a prototype for the Sistine Madonna, will be sold in the first online auction of its kind. It has been the subject of 30 years of scrutiny and research by experts keen to discover the artist behind the intricate work and whether it was the model for the Sistine Madonna. The 'de Brecy Tondo' painting, which depicts the central figures of the Renaissance master's famed Sistine Madonna . It began to attract attention after an art collector snapped it up in a house sale where it had hung over a fireplace. Mrs Violet Fairbairn Wynne-Eyton of Leeswood Hall, Mold, North Wales, hung the Tondo above the open fireplace in her bedroom. The painting was known to have existed in the Wynne-Eyton family art collection for generations. After her death in 1981, collector George Lester Winward bought the masterpiece at auction in the December of that year, the official De Brecy Tondo website said. The history behind it is rich and involves royalty and debt. An infra-red examination of the . painting's reverse flap of canvas revealed a monogram similar to the . personal monogram of Queen Henrietta Maria. Sir . Richard Wynn was Treasurer and Receiver General to Henrietta Maria from . 1629 to 1649 and responsible for settling her art collection accounts, . many of which were given to her by the Vatican to bolster her Catholic . faith. It is understood . that the queen owed money to Sir Richard after he made her a substantial . loan and the Tondo was given to pay off the outstanding debt - or it . was presented to him as a gift to him from the Vatican for his services. The two figures are practically identical and the original has undergone intensive research and tests . It is believed that it was passed down until it reached his distant relative, Mrs Wynne-Eaton. Since then it has undergone countless tests to try and substantiate the theory that it was painted by Raphael. Professor Howell Edwards from the . University of Bradford, who carried out an extensive examination on the . materials used in the painting. He . said: 'In September 2004 I undertook Raman spectroscopic analysis of . paint samples from the de Brécy Trust's tondo painting of the Madonna . and Child. 'The analysis . found clear evidence of the use of the yellow (lead monoxide, PbO ) pigment massicot. This pigment is considered to be in pre-17th century . usage by artists. 'The presence of lead white was also registered in the analysis. 'The . analysis also indicated that the medium was not an oil or resin nor . made from gum, animal glue or egg white. It is therefore most likely to . be of a vegetable-derived, starch based glue (considered to be typical . of Renaissance practice). 'From . these analytical findings, I am entirely confident that the Tondo . painting is consistent with an early, pre-1700, Renaissance work.' The complete Sistine Madonna is recognised throughout the world - and now a painting believed to be its prototype is up for auction . Further tests show that the drawing has been made with similar techniques to Raphael. The website said: 'X-ray analysis shows pounce-marks exclusively across the knuckles and around the fingers of the Madonna's right hand and around the upper bicep of the Child. 'This indicates use of an auxiliary cartoon – a technique peculiar to Raphael.' The pentimenti - underdrawing - and details of both the de Brécy and the Sistine Madonna are practically identical, adding weight to the the theory that it was a blueprint for the latter picture. Potential buyers have until June 21 at 5pm to put in their bid - with offers opening at £1,000,000.","De Brecy Tondo subjected to extreme scrutiny and 30 years of research .

More than 90,000 children go missing in India each year; more than 34,000 are never found. Some parents say they lost crucial time because police wrongly dismissed their missing children as runaways, refused to file reports or treated the cases as nuisances. Campaigners say ineffective policing and useless laws are blamed for the high number of missing children in India. Activists say some children are trafficked and forced to beg on the streets. Some work on farms or factories as forced labor and others have their organs harvested and sold. The activists say young girls are pushed into the sex trade or sold for marriage. Delays let traffickers move children to neighboring states, where the police don't have jurisdiction, activists say. There is no national database of missing children that state police can reference. Police have insisted that most of missing children are runways fleeing grinding poverty. After just a few minutes he is seen scooping up Salman in his arms and walking away.

Health officials are braced for the first death in the south Wales measles epidemic, as it is revealed more than 60 children have been hospitalised with the illness . No part of the country is safe from the threat of measles, a top doctor has warned. As officials in Swansea battle to stem Britain’s biggest outbreak of the disease for more than a decade, Meirion Evans, of Public Health Wales, said: 'Nowhere in Wales is safe from measles and I think that is true of the UK as a whole.' Dozens of children were in hospital and the epidemic was showing no sign of abating, he said, adding there was 'very real concern we might get a death’. Almost 700 cases of measles have been confirmed in the Swansea area and it is feared numbers will soar when children return to school after the Easter holiday. There is particular concern that the disease, which is spread through coughing and sneezing, is hitting teenagers who were not given the MMR triple jab against measles, mumps and rubella as babies. This will include those whose parents feared for the safety of the jab, following research by Andrew Wakefield linking it to bowel problems and autism. This work has since been discredited. Thousands of children were vaccinated in Swansea at the weekend and clinics are being set up in surrounding areas in an attempt to stop the infection’s spread. Dr Evans, an expert in the spread of disease, said the threat extended beyond Wales, with vaccination rates in many other parts of Britain also low. He said: 'Across Wales as a whole there are many, many children who have not had their MMR – we estimate over 40,000 children – so there is a real possibility that it could seed from Swansea to other parts of Wales and potentially take a grip there. 'Nowhere in Wales is safe from measles and I think that is true of the UK as a whole.' Kieran Elford, aged 13, is given an MMR injection. Around 40,000 children are believed to be unvaccinated, with around 13,000 in the Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan area . The consultant epidemiologist forecast that the outbreak could last until the summer holidays and added: 'We have had over 60 children who have been in hospital with measles. Thankfully none have died but there is a real concern that might happen.' An outbreak in Dublin in 2000 resulted in three deaths. Dr Evans said: 'We are urging parents to get their children protected as soon as possible because you just cannot take the chance with measles.' Those who catch measles can feel like they have a bad cold, with a fever, dry cough and red or sore eyes. A few days later, a red-brown spotty rash appears. It usually starts behind the ears, then spreads around the head and neck before covering the body. Potentially lethal complications include pneumonia, hepatitis and swelling of the brain. About one in five people who catch the bug spend time in hospital. Health officials are braced for the first death in the measles epidemic, as it is revealed more than 60 children have been hospitalised with the illness. MMR controversy: Dr Andrew Wakefield has blamed the Government for the measles outbreak . More than 2,700 people were vaccinated at drop in clinics across the region yesterday. Around 40,000 children are believed to be unvaccinated, with around 13,000 in the Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan area. In Swansea, where the outbreak is centred, at least 6,000 children remain unvaccinated in the south west Wales county. Fears: Dr Wakefield linked the MMR vaccine to bowel problems and autism . At some clinics patients queued for 90 minutes as they waited for vaccinations to start. The Government has dismissed claims by Dr Wakefield that officials were responsible for the recent outbreak affecting south Wales, the north east of England and in Gloucestershire. Dr Wakefield, who was struck off over the MMR controversy, said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the MMR programme than they were about protecting children when they withdrew the option of single measles vaccine. 'These government officials put price before children's health and have been seeking to cover up this shameful fact ever since,' he added. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Dr Andrew Wakefield's claims are completely incorrect. 'Immunisation advice from the department has always kept the interests of patients paramount. Measles is a highly infectious and harmful disease. 'If your child has not had two doses of MMR, whatever their age, we urge you to contact your GP surgery and make an appointment.' Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said the problems in Wales were 'historic'. 'Our immunisation coverage rates, currently, are extremely high, 95% of children are being vaccinated in this country,' he told BBC Breakfast. Asked about the situation in Wales, he said: 'That is a historic problem, the legacy of bizarre suggestions about vaccines and autism from 15 years ago, that's not the situation currently.' Although the outbreak is centred on Swansea, cases have continued to be reported across the principality. Most are in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Heath Board area. The board's director of public health, Dr Sara Hayes, said: 'We are very pleased so many people turned up today and I'd like to thank everyone for their patience whilst they waited to be seen. Outbreak: Dr Meirion Evans believes the measles outbreak could last until the summer holidays . 'I cannot stress enough how important it is for people to have their MMR. The number of cases and people being hospitalised with measles is continuing to rise and we can only stop it by protecting those we can against it. 'Measles is a horrible disease and can have long term effects such as deafness and blindness. 'This is why we are offering first vaccinations early to babies aged six months to one year. 'It's also very important for older children and adults born after 1970 to make sure they have had two MMRs.' Cases have also been found in Powys and in the Hywel Dda Health Board area - which covers Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire. Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common even in healthy people, and about 20 per cent of reported measles cases experience one or more complications. These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders. Before the introduction of the MMR jab in 1988, about half a million children caught measles each year in the UK. Approximately 100 of those died.","Expert says threat extends beyond Wales due to low MMR vaccination rates .

Research shows they live longer. A study has found that pear-shaped women, typified by the small waists and shapely bottom of the likes of Kate Winslet and Christina Hendricks, have a longer life expectancy than the apple shapes who store fat around their middle. What is more, the figures are far from trivial. A 30-year-old woman who is a perfect pear is expected to live up to nine-and-a-half years longer than one whose waistline wobbles. Pear shaped women such as Christina Hendricks, left, and Kate Winslet, right, have a higher life expectancy than people who store fat around their middle . The projections for men are even more stark, with a 30-year-old with a huge beer belly forecast to die almost 17 years before a chap with a washboard stomach, the European Congress on Obesity in Liverpool heard. Margaret Ashwell, the former government adviser who carried out the analysis, said the real killer is not just fat but the flab found around the middle. Although a lot of it is hidden from sight, it is wrapped around the organs and produces hormones and other substances that tamper with blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. As a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes. For this reason, Dr Ashwell, who worked with mathematicians from London’s City University, says it is crucial it is factored in when working out how bad a person’s weight is for their health. Doctors generally use body mass index, . or BMI, a mathematical formula based on a person’s weight and height to . work out whether they are in good shape. However, BMI doesn’t distinguish between muscle and fat, meaning some athletes are classified as obese. Dr Ashwell advocates looking at waist measurement in comparison to height. As a rule of thumb, she says, we should aim to keep our waist circumference measurement to under half that of our height – or have a waist to height ratio of 0.5 or less. So, a woman who is 5ft 4in should try to keep her waist at 32in or smaller and a man who is 5ft 10in shouldn’t let his waistband exceed 35in. Any bigger than this and their shape starts to turn from pear-like to apple-like. By analysing 20 years of data on around 3,000 men and women from across the UK, Dr Ashwell has shown that waist-to-height ratio is a better predictor of life expectancy than BMI. She said: ‘By using waist-to-height . ratio, you are measuring the central fat and that’s the bad fat, so . therefore you are getting a handle on how bad things are.’ And, . by mapping age of death alongside waist and height measurements, she . has been able to work out how many years a bulging belly takes off a . person’s life. A pear-shape is typified by the small waists and shapely bottom of the likes of Beyonce, pictured . Dr Ashwell, who runs  an independent scientific consultancy, said: ‘This study supports the simple message “Keep your waist circumference to less than half your height”. 'The use of weight-to-height ratio in public health screening, with appropriate action, could help add years to life. ‘If health professionals included this simple measurement in screening procedures, many years of productive life could be saved.’ She added that apple-shaped men and women should not despair, however, because fat around the waist is usually the first to melt away when we diet. Professor Jason Halford, of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, said: ‘I think we are beginning to realise BMI is not the only measure we should be concentrating on.’ However, he warned it takes time to prove the worth of new weight measurement techniques.","People who store fat around their middle have a shorter life expectancy .

Soaring numbers of city dwellers are suffering from hay fever, with urban areas accounting for every one of the UK's hay fever 'hotspots'. Pharmacists are reporting a sharp rise in the number of people living in towns and cities requesting treatment for the condition. After a delayed start to the hay fever season due to the very cold April, following the sunny weather over the Mayday Bank Holiday weekend, demand for nose sprays, antihistamines and eye drops has increased by more than 50 per cent this month. Pharmacists are reporting a sharp rise in the number of people living in towns and cities requesting treatment for hay fever . Experts at Chemist Direct analysed thousands of sales of hay fever products across the UK so far this month, and found that for the first time, London came out on top, followed by Birmingham and Manchester. In previous years, demand has been scattered across the UK in both rural and urban areas. 1. London . 2. Birmingham . 3. Manchester . 4. Cambridge . 5. Leicester . 6. Leeds . 7. Reading . 8. Liverpool . 9. Edinburgh . 10. Brighton . 'This year we’ve been seeing a lot more people living in towns and cities asking us for advice,' said Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist for Chemist Direct. 'There is some evidence to suggest that pollution, such as cigarette smoke or car exhaust fumes,can make the symptoms of hay fever worse, which could explain why more city dwellers are now suffering from hay fever.' One of the most common causes of hay fever in early May is oak or plane tree pollen - a particular problem in London and big cities where large plane trees line the streets and squares. However, the delayed Spring has meant pollen is also being released from other trees – such as the willow – which normally reaches a peak in March and April. Experts at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit said last month that because everything has been held back so long, delayed tree pollen could be in the air at the same time as grass pollen. This creates a perfect storm for sufferers triggering sneezing, itchy, red and watery eyes, and a runny nose. Research by the Surrey Allergy Clinic in London has also shown that in urban areas, pollens attach to the diesel exhaust particles from cars, which are adept at carrying pollen deeper into the airways or attaching to nasal membranes. And with the mixed weather continuing, pharmacists are also having to explain the difference between hay fever and colds . 'The cold spring has delayed pollen release meaning pollen levels will be at their peak in late spring and early summer which is earlier than normal,' added El-Gohary. With the increase in patients experiencing hay fever symptoms, pharmacists are also having to explain the difference between hay fever and colds. Mr El-Gohary explains: 'A cold is usually distinguished by a runny nose accompanied by a sore throat, cough or mild headache with an initially clear discharge which becomes thick and cloudy, whereas with hay fever, sufferers may have itchy and watery eyes, a sudden onset of sneezing and a runny nose with clear discharge.' Pharmacists at Chemist Direct advise sufferers to take an antihistamine once symptoms start, shower and change clothes at the end of the day, and to wear wraparound sunglasses to help prevent pollen getting into eyes. THE COMMON COLD . Caused by a minor viral infection, the symptoms are your body dealing with an attack to its immune system. Symptoms include: . • Runny nose accompanied with a sore throat, cough, tiredness or mild headache. • Discharge from nose will tend to start off clear and . watery but will soon turn thick and quite colourful . (green/yellow/brown). • Symptoms may last between 3 days to a week but many people . feel some nasal congestion for up to 3 weeks after the onset of . symptoms. HAY FEVER . Caused by pollen from grass and trees, or pollution. Your body is . reacting to something in the environment that is not actually a threat. Symptoms include: . • Itchy and watery eyes. • Runny nose. Discharge from your nose will tend to be watery and clear. • It’s unlikely that you will also have a sore throat, headache or fever. • If your symptoms of a runny nose last longer than 3 weeks . there is a chance you may have hayfever rather than a cold.","Sharp rise in sales of hay fever products in urban areas this month .

Mr Han told Denver Channel: 'Most days I remember it like it was yesterday. Why not make it a better day?' The couple want to reclaim the anniversary of the shooting with a positive memory so decided to hold their wedding on July 20. 'We were talking about that word ""anniversary"".

A 16-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer who was bitten on her arm and shoulder is unable to tell her parents who is responsible for the brutal attack because she cannot speak. When Ariel Alexander's parents reported the bite marks on their disabled daughter to her special needs school in Philadelphia, the school tried to blame the attack on Ariel's sister. Her parents have rejected claims that the attack happened in their own home, questioning how Ariel's attack went unnoticed in the special needs classroom of Martin Luther King High School. Victim: Cerebral palsy sufferer Ariel Alexander is covered in bite marks but she cannot name her attacker . Brutal attack: Human bite marks can be clearly seen on the disabled teenager's back and shoulder . 'They gonna try and pass the buck, say it happened here. No way, impossible,' her father, Randell Alexander, said. Ariel's family believe the attack happened in school on May 1, telling MyFoxPhilly.com they first noticed the marks two days later. The teenager, who has been confined to a wheelchair for most of her life and is unable to communicate clearly, had four human bite marks and other marks along her shoulder and back. 'It's brutal! It is brutal,' Mr Alexander said. 'There's no way possible that no one's seen the incident occur.' He claims that after reporting the attack to her school, a male teacher told them that one of Ariel's classmates was responsible. Mr Alexander added that the teacher suggested one of the other pupils who has special needs had been attacking other students. Silenced: Randell Alexander with his daughter Ariel, who is unable to communicate and name her attacker . The school rejects this claim however, saying that when the teachers were interviewed they denied seeing the attack. Fernando Gallard, a spokesman for the school district, said: 'It could not have happened at school, . and if it could have -- if for some reason something happened-- someone . would have seen it.' Ariel, whose suffers from a neurological disorder that affects muscle movements, shares a special needs classroom with six other children and seven adult supervisors. While many toddlers go through a . phase of biting, it is also often seen in older children who have . development problems or disabilities. The school reported the injuries to Philadelphia's Department of Human Services, which . is investigating the case as possible child abuse. Blame game: Ariel's parents say the attack happened at Martin Luther King High School, but teachers deny this . Mr Alexander said the department interviewed him and his wife about the possibility that Ariel's 17-year-old sister had bitten her. Cerebral palsy is one of the most common disabilities affecting muscle movement in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in every 303 American eight-year-olds are affected by it. After research in 2006, the center concluded that families and sufferers were in need of improved health, education and intervention services. Cerebral palsy sufferers can be affected to differing degrees. While some, like Ariel, are confined to wheelchairs and lack the ability to speak clearly, others may be only slightly affected and will need little assistance over their lives. And while there is no cure, researchers say that with early intervention for physical and occupational therapy, many sufferers are able to lead regular lives. But in Ariel's case, with no clear way to tell her parents or teachers who caused her wounds, her attacker remains unnamed. Investigators from the Department of Human Services are due to return to the family's home next week to check on the welfare of the Alexander children.","Cerebral palsy sufferer's family say fellow student is to blame for attack .

'All of these (rape) cases happened between those who know each other. 'They are either friends, close friends or they just met a few hours ago,' Lai said on Tuesday. 'Some of these cases also involved the victims being raped after drinking quite a lot of alcohol. 'So I would appeal that young ladies should not drink too much', he added. But the comment resulted in people taking to social networking sites including Facebook and Twitter to express their anger. Campaigners for women's rights called for Lai to retract his statement and instead concentrate on arresting attackers. Linda Wong, executive director of Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women, said the remarks were a step backwards. She told AFP: 'The under-reporting of rape in Hong Kong is already very high and some of the reason is women feel that people will put all the blame on them'.

An animal rescue center is appealing for help to find the person responsible for beating a pug so badly that it has gone blind. The 10-month-old pug-chihuahua mix was taken to an emergency pet hospital in San Francisco last night, with an injured spinal cord. The extend of the injuries to the puppy, who has been named Queenie, shocked staff at the city's Animal Care and Control. Savage: Queenie's spinal cord was injured in the brutal beating which left the pug mix puppy blind . 'I've seen a lot of horrific cases, and this is one right up there,' Vicky Guldbech, who works at the center, told KTVU. By the time Queenie was taken to the pet hospital, she was in a state of shock and the savagery of the beating had blinded her and likely caused brain damage. Realizing her injuries could not have been caused by an accident, the veterinarians treating Queenie contacted Animal Care and Control. 'She couldn’t stand up on her own, nor . could she urinate on her own,' the center's director, Rebecca Katz, said. The pug had been beaten so badly that she wasn't even whimpering. 'She just shut down.' The agency is appealing for help to find a man linked to Queenie. It wants anyone who knows the whereabouts of Raymond Gilliam, 40, from San Francisco. to call Animal Care and Control’s . emergency line at (415) 554-9400. The injuries inflicted on Queenie are the fourth attack on a dog in the city this month. Safe house: A new home will be found for the puppy after she has recovered from her ordeal . Protective: Vicky Guldbech, of San Francisco Animal Care and Control, comforts Queenie at the shelter . A pack of dogs was found living in such squalid conditions, and without food or water, that they killed and ate another dog. In another case, a pit bull fractured its back leg after being thrown from a second-floor window. And Scrappy, an 18-month-old Tibetan terrier, suffered injuries after being thrown to the ground. The agency was also called in to rescue a starving dog that was found abandoned in its crate by some trash. Wanted: Animal Care and Control wants to speak to Raymond Gillam about the pug attack . The agency first noticed a rise in abuse cases when the economic downturn began. 'We usually see a rise in crime, usually . domestic violence, when times are challenging,' Ms Katz told SF Gate. 'When people . are stressed out, they tend to act out.' An arrest has been made in connection with the above cases, and charges are being brought against the owners of the pack of dogs, the pit bull owner and the person responsible for Scrappy's injuries. 'Violence against animals is often a precursor to and an indicator of violence against people and children,' Ms Katz said. There are also 'people who are just sick' she added, as in Queenie's case. The American Humane Association said that 71 per cent of domestic violence victims in women's shelters reported that the person abusing them had also injured, killed, or threatened to kill the family's pet. A further 32 per cent of the women questioned, said their children had also hurt or killed animals. People who are convicted of animal abuse can face up to three years in prison and fines of up to $20,000. Queenie is expected to make a slow recovery, but she is expected to suffer permanent brain damage and may not regain her sight. A Pug Puppy Fund has been set up to help pay for Queenie's treatment.","Savage beating injures 10-month-old dog's spinal cord .

Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the North fired three missiles today and that its intent was unclear. In March, North Korea tested two short-range missiles off its east coast. South Korea has accused North Korea of firing three short-range guided missiles into its eastern waters . U.S. officials say North Korea recently withdrew two mid-range missiles believed to be capable of reaching Guam after moving them to the east coast earlier this year. Meanwhile, North Korea is still trying to import and export nuclear and ballistic missile-related items but financial and trade sanctions are slowing progress on development of their prohibited weapons, UN experts say in a new report. Key parts of the expert panel's report provide further information on North Korea's attempts to evade four rounds of increasingly tough UN sanctions aimed at reining in its development of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver them. While the imposition of sanctions has not halted these programmes, the panel said, 'it has in all likelihood considerably delayed the (North's) timetable, and through the imposition of financial sanctions and the bans on the trade in weapons, has choked off significant funding which would have been channelled into prohibited activities'. Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the North fired three missiles today . North Korean soldiers take part in a shooting drill in an unknown location in April . The report to the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea recommended imposing sanctions on four additional North Korean companies and 11 individuals. The council discussed the experts' report on Thursday and it will be up to members to decide whether they are added to the sanctions blacklist. To increase pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime, the United States and the European Union have gone beyond UN sanctions and imposed even tougher financial measures against North Korea. China, which is Pyongyang's closest ally and economic lifeline, supported the UN sanctions. In a sign of growing discontent with the North, the state-run Bank of China, one of the country's largest, halted business earlier this month with a North Korean bank accused by the US of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs. To increase pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime, the United States and the European Union have gone beyond UN sanctions and imposed even tougher financial measures against North Korea . The panel said North Korea 'has continued to defy the international community in a series of actions which has heightened concerns about its intentions'. It cited the North's ballistic missile launch on December 12, its third nuclear test on February 12, and its declaration that it would reactivate nuclear facilities at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. 'The DPRK has continued its efforts to import and export items relevant to missile and nuclear programs and arms,' the panel said, using the initials of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The report listed North Korean sanctions violations over a five-year period including the seizure of aluminum alloys suspected to be nuclear related in August 2012, and the seizure of missile-related items bound for Syria in May 2012. Given the North's 'consistent sanctions evasion,' the panel recommended that the country's newly created Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry and its minister, who has not yet been named, be added to the sanctions list.","Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the North fired three missiles today .

One of the men on trial for the fatal gang rape of a student on a bus in India has been beaten and poisoned by prison inmates and is unconscious in hospital, his lawyer has said. Prison authorities denied any mistreatment of Vinya Sharma, who has been at New Delhi's Tihar Jail since he was arrested on suspicion of attacking the woman in December that stunned India and brought thousands of protesters onto the streets. One of Sharma's co-accused, Ram Singh, the alleged ringleader, was found hanged from a ceiling grille inside his cell in March. Indian policemen stand guard as an ambulance leaves the main entrance of Tihar Jail in New Delhi, India, where one of the men on trial for the gang rape of a student has been allegedly beaten and poisoned . Police described his death as suicide although a judicial inquiry is pending. Sharma's lawyer, A.P. Singh, accused inmates of 'beating him on the chest' and poisoning his food, and said he was admitted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital on Tuesday after being treated at another city hospital since Sunday. 'Vinay was beaten by four or five fellow inmates inside the jail premises,' he told Reuters, adding he was in an unconscious state. Sunil Gupta, a spokesman for Tihar Jail, said Sharma was being treated in a city hospital for a fever. A demonstrator holds a placard during a protest outside a court in New Delhi January after the student was raped and murdered by a gang . 'There was no such beating of Vinay to my knowledge. All the allegations are false,' he said. Police arrested Sharma and Singh, along with three other adult men and a teenage boy, on charges of raping the 23-year-old physiotherapy student on a moving bus and fiercely beating her and her male friend on December 16. The woman died of her injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks after the assault, which enraged the Indian population, who protested in their thousands for days to demand better law enforcement to fight gender crimes. The city court where Sharma has stood trial since early this year asked jail authorities and doctors on Wednesday to file reports on his health today. Sharma was falsely implicated in the case, his lawyer said at the start of the trial.","Prison authorities have denied any mistreatment at New Delhi's Tihar Jail .

The cavern of former shops and stables were uncovered under the Royal Arcade - a two-storey complex of stores and flats in Keighley, West Yorkshire. Last used in the 1890s, it was found after builders smashed their way through while converting the arcade in 2002 - but has not yet been redeveloped.

Underground and above: Various items (left) were found in the subterranean Victorian street, which lies below a modern-day shopping area (right) Much of the Victorian building work on the cellars of seven shops was still intact, while wooden shop-fronts and stable pens were in place.

Jim Davidson was questioned yesterday over claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s - before joking to reporters: ‘They will be coming to me talking of murder next.’ Officers on Operation Yewtree - the inquiry launched after the Jimmy Savile scandal - are probing claims the comedian committed a sex offence during a concert tour after the Falklands War. Davidson, 59, of Stockbridge, Hampshire - who allegedly committed a sex offence while he was entertaining British troops - was originally arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK. Questioning: Jim Davidson, pictured with his wife Michelle Cotton in central London, denies any wrongdoing . The former Generation Game host told the Daily Mirror yesterday: ‘I have spoken to police over the allegations regarding the Falklands. I have told them everything I know. I have not been re-arrested. ‘They just wanted me to have a chat with them. To this day I have not been charged with anything. I really am - in the old-fashioned sense of the phrase - helping police with their enquiries.’ When asked whether he was shocked by the latest questioning, Davidson told the newspaper: ‘Nothing comes as a shock any more. They'll be coming to me talking of murder next.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: ‘The man was interviewed under caution - not arrested - in connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree.’ Davidson's lawyer Henri Brandman told MailOnline today: 'I would confirm that Jim was interviewed by the police in respect of the Operation Yewtree inquiry yesterday. 'He continues to vigorously deny the allegations that have been put to him and is helping the police as fully as possible in their enquiries. 'He has not been charged with any offence. No further statement will be made at the present time.' Comedian: Mr Davidson, who allegedly committed a sex offence in the Falklands in the 1980s, is seen in 1985 . The revelation last week that the . tentacles of Yewtree have now spread to the other side of the world is . likely to prompt renewed claims that the force is conducting a celebrity . witch-hunt.

Critics claim the inquiry has become a . runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, gather evidence later’ policy . ruining the lives of celebrities. Yard chiefs insist it is ‘fair and . proportionate’. The Metropolitan Police probe is being carried . out on behalf of the Royal Falkland Islands Police, which has only 16 . full-time officers.

The supermarket giant unveiled its plans to turn a pub on the sandy peninsula in Poole Harbour, Dorset, into a store last year, which sparked uproar from horrified locals. Aghast residents said the store would look 'like a filling in a set of teeth' and thought a Waitrose or Marks and Spencer would be more suited to the affluent area. Change: The supermarket chain is able to convert the Sandacres pub into a shop without planning permission . A petition was started in a bid to stop the convenience shop opening in Sandbanks, which is the fourth most expensive area in the world to live. But Tesco have now revealed that they are continuing with the controversial plans, and the store is expected to open in July. Under development rights regulations, the supermarket chain is able to convert the Sandacres pub into a shop without planning permission. It did submit four applications for minor changes, which include a cash point, shop frontage, cycle stands, 6ft fencing, new windows and air conditioning units. Luxury area: Sandbanks in Poole Harbour, Dorset, is known for its multi-million pound harbour-front mansions . Around 425 people have signed the . campaign against the shop, which states that residents are 'far from . happy to be next to and/or looking out on to a Tesco Express’. Millionaire's row: The area's high profile residents include Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp, pictured on Sandbanks in 2007 . Some of the well-heeled residents think . the blue and red logo will be too garish for the upmarket location and . others are concerned about additional noise and traffic. Peter Oliver, the manager of the Cafe .

A Marks and Spencer would have been much better suited to . the area and would have blended in well. ‘I don't drive so the store would be useful but I'd rather have something that looked nice instead of a logo that stands out from a mile away. ‘Everyone is saying the same thing and I don't think many people will be happy about it.’ Ross Stallion, a 36-year-old sales . director from neighbouring Canford Cliffs, said: ‘The area could do with . a convenience store but a Waitrose or Marks and Spencer would be better . suited.’ The petition was started by Karen Denham who owns nearby newsagent Sandbanks Stores and believes resident's views have been 'totally ignored'.

Mr Oliver’s own campaign against junk food being served in school lunch halls has been held back since he clashed with Education Secretary Michael Gove following his appointment in 2010. ‘I had enough of presenting to the Government because I was not getting anywhere,’ he said, adding that the coalition’s politicians should have understood that ‘everything Labour did was not wrong’.

A financier and chart-topping music producer were yesterday named as secret donors to the campaign Hacked Off. A hedge fund manager who is worth £145million was one of those unveiled. Arpad Busson, 50, who is the partner of actress Uma Thurman and had two children with model Elle Macpherson, donated £20,000 to the pressure group lobbying for new press laws. Producer Guy Chambers, 50, who worked with singer Robbie Williams, and science writer Simon Singh, 48, were also revealed by The Observer as contributing to the celebrity-led organisation. It comes after it was revealed last week that heiress Jemima Khan helped bankroll Hacked Off with a £5,000 donation. The writer and socialite is one of the wealthy backers of the group fronted by her ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant - and a separate four-figure sum reportedly came from her mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith. The group has come under increasing pressure to disclosure its income sources. Two months ago it refused to tell MPs which rich individuals are financing it - and academic Brian Cathcart, a co-founder, was heckled at a literary festival when he declined to unmask donors. Professor Cathcart told the Commons committee in March that Mr Grant had donated 'quite substantial' damages he received from News International over phone-hacking. But he would not name other individuals, leading one MP to tweet: 'The champions of openness that is Hacked Off refuse to name large private donors in non-answers to my questions.'

Mr Busson, a French-born financier who is thought to have been a supporter of the group for some time, could not be contacted for comment. But Mr Singh said he was backing Hacked Off because he wanted to support free speech, and told The Observer: ‘It is about getting the balance right between free speech and a responsible press.’ Mr Chambers has not commented.

Excited Doctor Who fans who couldn't wait to book tickets to this year's BBC Proms 2013 were left bitterly disappointed after the website crashed. This year's event will feature two special performances of music from the popular sci-fi drama in a nod to its 50th anniversary. A stampede of Doctor Who enthusiasts were blamed for the crash which eventually saw 114,000 tickets being sold since booking opened on Saturday - an increase of 17 per cent on last year. Even touts had a look in, with some now craftily charging more than ten times their value as fans eagerly try to snap up tickets. Some touts were selling them for more than £1,000 each, the Daily Telegraph reported. Some visitors to the booking website were given error messages or their purchases simply terminated. Others who tried buying tickets on the phone reported to being kept on the line for hours. The BBC has said that its Prom's director Roger Wright described the record-breaking sales as a 'thrill.' ‘We are asking . fans who may have the discs not to divulge plot details so that fellow . fans who have yet to see the episodes do not have their viewing pleasure . ruined.’ The .

British space scientists are gearing up to launch the world's first satellite run entirely using a mobile phone. The unique STRaND-1 satellite, developed by researchers from the University of Surrey, will be fully controlled by a Google Nexus phone during part of its six-month space mission. It will launch into a 785km sun-synchronous orbit on the Indian Space Research Organisation's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from Sriharikota, India, on February 25. You'd expect to see an Android in space... A UK team is set to launch the first satellite controlled by a smartphone. The STRaND-1 satellite will be controlled by a Google Nexus during part of its space mission . The satellite's launch will be an interesting test of the oft-repeated claim that the mobile phone in your pocket has more computing power than was used to send a man to the Moon. At the heart of STRaND-1 is an unmodified Nexus One smartphone running an Android operating system, according to Dr Chris Bridges, the Surrey Space Centre's lead engineer on the venture. 'We haven't gutted the Nexus. We've done lots and lots of tests on it; we've put our own software on it. But we've essentially got a regular phone, connected up the USB to it and put it in the satellite,' he told the BBC. The smartphone is pressed up against a side panel of the 30cm-long, 4.3kg cubesat, so that it's 5MP camera can look out and take pictures of the Earth and the Moon. World first: The STRaND-1 cubesat during final assembly and test phase December 2012.  The camera on its Google Nexus 'heart' is visible through the porthole at the top of the stack . The STRaND-1 (which stands for Surrey Training Research and Nanosatellite Demonstration) is a joint project between Surrey Space Centre and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, a world leader in small commercial spacecraft. Modern smartphones contain advanced technologies and incorporate several key features that are essential to satellites like cameras, radio links, accelerometers and high performance computer processors. Add in solar panels and propulsion systems and that's almost everything a spacecraft needs to fly. During the first phase of the mission, STRaND-1 will use a number of experimental 'Apps' to collect data whilst a new high-speed linux-based CubeSat computer developed by SSC takes care of the satellite. In phase two, the STRaND-1 team plan to switch the satellite's in-orbit operations to the smartphone, thereby testing the capabilities of a number of standard smartphone components for a space environment.

The Scream in Space app will make full use of the smartphone's speakers.  Testing the theory 'in space no-one can hear you scream, made popular in the 1979 film 'Alien', the app will allow the public to upload videos of themselves screaming in a creative way to an allocated website.  The most popular videos will be played on the phone while in orbit and the scream recorded using the smartphone's microphone. Dr Bridges added: 'A smartphone on a satellite like this has never been launched before but our tests have been pretty thorough, subjecting the phone to oven and freezer temperatures, to a vacuum and blasting it with radiation. 'It has a good chance of working as it should, but you can never make true design evolutions or foster innovation without taking a few risks. STRaND is cool because it allows us to do just that.' The satellite will be commissioned and operated from the Surrey Space Centre's ground station at the University of Surrey. Being the first smartphone satellite in orbit is just one of many 'firsts' that STRaND-1 is hoping to achieve. Another important mission is the testing of two new propulsion technologies. The first, known as the Water Alcohol Resisto-jet Propulsion De-orbit Re-entry Velocity Experiment (which benefits from the grand acronym Warp Drive), will use the ejection of a water alcohol mixture to provide thrust. The second is its Pulsed Plasma Thrusters that use an electric current to heat and ablate a material to produce a charged gas which can then be accelerated by a magnetic field to push the cubesat along.

A new study has found that most desks, designed for traditional 'desktop' computers, have meant we have created a range of new ways to sit. They range from 'the cocoon', where people hunch up on their chair to be close to their phone, to 'the smart lean', used to  check emails during a meeting. The nine new workplace postures: These new ways of sitting and slouching to fit ourselves around new mobile computing technology have been identified by research from office furniture company Steelcase . Smartphones and tablet computers, small and light enough to be grasped in the hands, have liberated workers from postural slavery to our digital overseers. Now new research has shown that the change in the ways we deal with technology in the workplace is indeed changing the way that we sit and slouch while we're earning our keep. A survey of 2,000 office workers in 11 countries undertaken by office furniture maker Steelcase has identified nine new postures which have emerged in response to the new technologies we interact with. They are: . Contorting to fit: Office workers have hitherto been kept in postural bondage to the immobile machines they interact with to earn their keep . The new postures identified were a result of using small, mobile technology such as smartphones, tablets and laptops and new workplace behaviours. However, with furniture poorly adapted to these new ways of sitting and slouching, Steelcase notes, they frequently cause pain and long-term injuries, disrupting concentration and creativity. James Ludwig, vice president of global design for Steelcase, said: 'We love our technology – it’s become a ubiquitous extension of ourselves. 'But the way technology impacts our bodies as we work has been largely ignored.' Based on this research, Steelcase has designed a new chair – Gesture – that moves with the body and supports the user throughout the different postures.  It will be available in the UK later this year.","Mobile devices have changed the way that office workers sit at their desks, study shows .
Office furniture maker Steelcase surveyed more than 2,000 people in countries to identify nine new postures .
The Draw – Technology (small and mobile) allows people to pull back from their desks while they use it. They recline, signaling they’re contemplating or absorbing information and draw the device closer to their body to maintain an optimal focal length.
The Multi-Device - This posture is representative of how people adapt to multitasking on multiple-devices. One hand holding a phone to the ear, the other tasking on a laptop. The result is a forward lean that is a symbol of concentration and an orientation to the smaller screen of a laptop.
The Text - Smartphones are small compared to other forms of technology and, therefore, require unique postures. Workers bring arms in close as keying and gesturing are performed.
The Cocoon - People recline, bring up their feet onto the seat, and draw their smartphone or tablet close, resting on their thighs. The result is a cocoon - small mobile technology allows people to remain productive in this posture.
The Swipe - This posture results when the device is used on a work surface in 'surfing mode', in which people operate the device with one hand, typically with swiping gestures. Because it’s on a work surface, a person must keep their head a certain distance above the tablet in order to see it, and position their head to look down at it.
The Smart Lean - This posture is the result of mobile devices that create the desire for people to temporarily 'pull away' from others without leaving a meeting or collaborative environment. This is typically a temporary posture and used for glancing at incoming texts or e-mails.
The Trance - This posture was observed when people were focused on the screen and either mousing or using a touchpad to navigate on the screen for extended periods of time. This is a long duration posture.
The Take It In - In this posture, people recline to view content on the large display and/or sit back to contemplate. This posture is about 'taking in' information rather than generating it.
The Strunch .
- The 'strunch' (stretched-out hunch) is a very common posture with .
laptops. As people become fatigued, they gradually push their laptop .
further from the edge of the worksurface, resting their weight on the .
surface.  This causes them to reach forward to work. Since the back and .
neck cannot sustain the reach and hunch posture for a long time, the .
person begins to prop themselves up with their non- tasking arm."

The 27-year-old is on the intensive two-month programme which will pave the way for him to return to Afghanistan. The rigorous course is reserved for the British Army's Air Corp's top flying talent and Harry has ‘surpassed all expectations, including his own’, senior sources told the Mail. ‘It is true to say that he is doing very, very well – although Harry would never claim to be the best the military has ever seen. That’s just not his style,’ they said. Star pilot: Prince Harry, standing in front of an Apache helicopter, is said to have amazed instructors in the U.S. with his flying skills .

Semi-Armour Piercing (HEISAP) ‘But the fact that he is even training as an Apache pilot is testament to his skills as they only skim off the best. ‘He is working very hard out in the U.S. and is proving to be a real natural. ‘It’s all rather unexpected and slightly serendipitous as the only . reason Harry chose to train as a helicopter pilot was because his . chances of being deployed on the frontline had hit a wall with the army. ‘Fortunately he has found a career he . absolutely loves and excels at. He is the most relaxed and happy in his . professional life than anyone has ever seen him. It’s great to see. ‘He certainly isn’t getting any special treatment in California, it’s not the way he wants it. ‘And he is absolutely loving being in . the States. The course is testing his full range of flying skills, . everything he has learnt so far.’ Another source added: ‘Prince Harry has matured immensely in recent years. His career means everything to him.’ The Prince is learning to fly the £46million Apache gunship alongside 19 other servicemen at the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, California, where the hit film Top Gun was filmed. The course focuses on honing aviation environmental skills and live firing and includes techniques such as ground skimming and night flying. Lt Col Peter Bullen, the exercise . director, promised that Harry would be treated in the same way as any . other army captain when he flew out to the U.S. 10 days ago. The training is carried out in California because the hot and dusty conditions are similar to Afghanistan. Harry will move to Gila Bend in rural Arizona in the coming weeks to practice firing missiles and rockets. Assuming he passes the course, the Royal will be one of a select number of pilots . to have expertise in the two-person helicopters of which . Britain has a fleet of 67. He will be categorised as Limited . Combat Ready and will have at least four months of further training . before he is available to return to the field as an Apache pilot. Touchdown: Prince Harry is shown arriving at El Centro two weeks ago. The training is carried out in California because the hot and dusty conditions are similar to Afghanistan .

It . has long been known the Prince is keen to return to combat after his . first deployment in 2007 was cut short after ten weeks, much to his . disappointment, because of security fears.

A 72-year-old father of three strangled his churchwarden wife with a piece of rope after becoming ‘fixated’ that their farmhouse would be flooded by heavy rain, a court heard today. Farmer Peter Thurgarland, of Maplebeck, near Newark, Nottinghamshire, killed his wife of four decades, Julia, 70, and was today ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric hospital. The farmer had dug ditches and built a . ‘fortress’ of sandbags around his £250,000 farmhouse, as well as . stacking up furniture in anticipation of floods. In addition to becoming . concerned about flooding, Mr Thurgarland also wrongly feared . that he had lost the title to some of his land. A jury at Nottingham Crown Court took less than 15 minutes to reach a formal finding that the farmer killed his wife, who was found dead by their daughter last December. Mr Thurgarland was not required to attend a two-day ‘finding-of-fact’ trial after being judged unfit to plead. The trial heard that the popular and respected farmer was suffering from a ‘severe mental disturbance’ at the time of the killing and confessed to detectives during police interviews. During the interviews, extracts of which were read to the jury today, Mr Thurgarland claimed to have ‘flipped’ on the spur-of-the-moment and strangled his wife with a blue piece of cord. Mr Thurgarland, who was found ‘comatose’ at the scene of the killing, told officers: ‘I don't know why I did it. I don't know what came over me. I don't know why it happened, but it happened.’ The court heard yesterday that Mr Thurgarland was found slumped in a chair with cable ties around his neck, having apparently trying to take his own life. Asked by police if he had tried to take his own life, Mr Thurgarland replied: ‘Yes. Because of what I had done to Julia.’ Investigation: Police at the farmhouse in Maplebeck, Nottinghamshire, last December, where the couple lived . Jurors heard that the Thurgarlands' farm flooded in 2007, forcing the couple to live in a caravan for 18 months. Although the ‘much-admired’ couple had been happily married for more than 45 years, it is thought that Mr Thurgarland tried to smother his wife with a pillow two weeks before the fatal incident. The court heard that in September last year, Mr Thurgarland's family became concerned over his mental health and he was due to see a psychiatrist on the day he killed his wife. Prosecutor Michael Auty QC said: ‘It was getting to the point of complete fixation about the risk of flooding and the possibility the family might be somehow rendered homeless.’ Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon, who led the inquiry, told the trial that the couple were regarded as pillars of the local community. There was no evidence to suggest that anyone harboured any ‘ill-will’ towards the Thurgarlands, the officer said, and nothing had been found to cast doubt on the truth of Mr Thurgarland's confession. 'I don't know why I did it. I don't know what came over me. I don't know why it happened, but it happened' What Peter Thurgarland told police . Members of the couple's family attended the court hearing but did not comment afterwards. In a statement issued following the verdict, Mr Heydon, of the East Midlands major crime unit, said: ‘The death of Julia Thurgarland at the hands of her husband Peter was a tragic family event. ‘Their three children - Annie, Jane and David - have not only lost their mother but their father remains in hospital receiving treatment for his illness. The family have behaved with immense dignity in the face of this terrible tragedy and continue to fully support their father. ‘Nobody could have predicted this sad event but some time after November last year his mental health deteriorated and he took his wife's life and attempted to take his own. ‘I would like to thank the community of Maplebeck for their support and co-operation throughout this inquiry as well as the officers, who performed their duty with sensitivity and professionalism.’ Judge Gregory Dickinson said Mr Thurgarland would now stay in the secure hospital until his health improved - when he would then be tried normally.","Peter Thurgarland, of Maplebeck, Nottinghamshire, killed wife Julia .

They are a bit down in the mouth about their desperate economy, which may be why people in Greece are  having more facelifts than in any other country in Europe. In 2011, 142,394 cosmetic procedures were performed in the country of  11million people – meaning one in 79 Greeks has had procedures such as liposuction, eyelid corrections and Botox injections. Worldwide, the Greeks ranked second only to the South Koreans in terms of the number of procedures performed. In the economic giant of Germany, only one in 200 had work done in 2011. Plastic surgeon Athanasios Athanasiou, 42, said: ‘I believe that when people are not doing well, it is especially important to hear others say: “Wow, you look great”. ‘I always saw the economic crisis as an opportunity.’ Rise: In 2011, 142,394 cosmetic procedures were performed in the country of 11 million people . One reason why so many are opting for the beauty treatments is a fall in costs. Surgeons are charging an average of 40 percent less for their procedures while the cost of an operating theatre has fallen from £1,800 to £600. Botox: Jennifer Aniston is half Greek and the actress has admitted using Botox in the past . Dr Athanasiou said 80 percent of his patients are Greeks. 'People are working,' he added. 'Maybe they’re earning less money, but they are working. We . adjust ourselves to the market.' Greece has cut costs drastically in other areas of medicine. In 2009, the Greek government spent . £12 billion on its health care system, while in 2012 government health . care spending declined to only £8 billion. Many hospitals have reduced their emergency room hours to only four days a week, resulting in longer waits for patients. Owing . to wage payment cuts to doctors, many now expect patients to pay their . bills in cash. Likewise, experts estimate that about 35 percent of . Greeks have no health insurance. The . grotesqueness of beauty treatments in a land where essential drugs are . running short and hospital staff scavenge in waste bins for food scraps . grates on many people. Dr. Giorgos Vichas, a cardiologist who devotes much of his time to a clinic . where the poor come when they have been turned away by the state, said: . 'I know cancer patients who were refused treatment because they were . unable to pay for medication, and of pregnant women who don’t know how . they’ll pay the costs of delivery. Contradiction: A woman walks past a shut down store in Athens. They might be down in the mouth about their desperate economy, but more people are having facelifts in Greece than in any other country in Europe . 'We Greeks were not always saints before the crisis. To a certain extent, many of us played a role in what has happened here. Those who can afford these cosmetic procedures now are among those who exploited the old system in the first place.' Psychiatrist Matthew Josafat, 76, said he doesn’t find the boom in cosmetic surgery surprising and that people do feel better after a facelift. 'In England, the men on my couch usually talked about their jobs,' he said, but in Greece 'the patients on my couch are more likely to talk about romance, love and Eros. 'In antiquity, women were second-class citizens. Their appearance was their currency,' says Josafat. 'The notion of the emancipated companions that women have become in the modern age hasn’t taken hold in Greece as quickly as it has in northern Europe.I fear the crisis and the lack of jobs could force women back into their old role: being attractive and getting married.” Worldwide, the Greeks ranked second only to the South Koreans in terms of the number of procedures performed. However, the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) estimates that with the declining costs of procedures, the Greeks will overtake the rest of the world when 2012 figures are published later this year. Italy is presently third and the U.S. second. Britain is not in the top ten. Jennifer Aniston, whose . father is Greek, said in 2009: 'I tried Botox once . and it was not good.

Nearly 120,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have already moved to Britain despite not yet being allowed to work freely in this country, official figures showed yesterday. The data from the 2011 census showed that migration to Britain – at a rate equivalent to 30,000 a year – began as soon as the two countries joined the EU. The disclosure is fresh evidence that a major movement of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens is likely when restrictions are lifted at the end of the year. Findings: The census found that in some parts of the country almost one in 10 of the population are citizens of Eastern European countries . The 119,101 Romanians and Bulgarians are among just under 1 million Eastern European citizens now living in Britain, almost all of whom arrived under open-border rules after their countries joined the EU in 2004 and 2007, the census showed. It found that in some parts of the country almost one in 10 of the population are citizens of Eastern European countries. In Boston, Lincolnshire – the town that sparked a fierce argument over the impact of immigration on BBC TV’s Question Time – 10.7 per cent of the population are Eastern European passport-holders. The figures were released at a time of increased political tension over immigration, amid fears of a large-scale influx of Bulgarians and Romanians next year. Plans: Prime Minister David Cameron promised to make it harder for migrants from outside Europe to get NHS treatment and social housing, and for those from inside the EU to claim state benefits . Earlier this week David Cameron tried to reassure voters with promises to make it harder for migrants from outside Europe to get NHS treatment and social housing, and for those from inside the EU to claim state benefits. Detailed breakdowns published yesterday showed numbers of foreign citizens living in Britain, counted by those who gave their passport nationality on census forms, and of those who declared on the census form the country of their birth. The real totals may be higher because some – in particular immigrants – have in the past proved reluctant to fill in census forms or provide the full details they demand. Yesterday’s figures showed there were 73,208 Romanian passport holders in England and Wales on the day the census was taken – 27 March 2011. No details of Bulgarian passport holders were made public, but the figures showed there were 45,893 who said they were born in Bulgaria. The census was taken just over four years after the two countries joined the EU, under an agreement that while their citizens would be allowed to travel to and live in Britain, they would not be able to work here as employees. Those rules have now been lifted and Romanians and Bulgarians get free access to the labour market from 1 January next year. Sir Andrew Green, of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘These figures validate our projection that 50,000 people a year will come when citizens of the two countries get free access to the labour market in the New Year.’ The figure does not include 22,000 workers who come as seasonal fruit pickers under a summer work-permit scheme, and then return home. Census figures gave an official figure of 988,123 Eastern European citizens present in the country in March 2011 – including 588,082 Poles, 104,676 Lithuanians, and 73,208 Romanians. Around one and a half million people from the eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 are thought to have lived and worked in Britain at some stage. The census showed the highest concentration of Eastern European citizens in any town in Britain was in Boston, with 10.7 per cent of the population. The town was at the centre of controversy in January after Cambridge academic Mary Beard told BBC Question Time that local fears over immigration were a ‘myth’ and that ‘public services can cope’. She was rebuked by businesswoman Rachel Bull, who said services were at ‘breaking point’.","Fears of major influx when travel restrictions lifted at the end of the year .

The number of people living till 90 has trebled in the last 30 years (File photo) Nearly half a million people in England and Wales have lived to see their 90th birthday. The explosion in the population of elderly people means that numbers of nonagenarians have trebled in 30 years, official estimates said. The fast-rising ranks of those surviving into great old age come from a 'golden generation' that has reaped the benefits of modern health care and affluence, the Office for National Statistics said. Details of the expansion of the population of the very oldest people follow a series of recent warnings that the rules governing retirement, pensions and hospital and home care of the elderly need to be rewritten to cope. A House of Lords report earlier this month said older people must be ready to work longer into what would once have been retirement years to be able to pay the costs of living longer. The new estimates say there were 440,290 people aged 90 and over living in England and Wales in 2011, just less than one in 100 of the whole population. Nonagenarian numbers have gone up by 26 per cent in only nine years since 2002. The rate of increase means that there are likely to be more than 500,000 90-somethings by 2015. A growing number of the very old are making it to their 100th birthday, the figures show. There were an estimated 11,700 centenarians in 2011 , with men aged over 100 outnumbered six to one by women. Centenarians have doubled in number since 1998 and there were more than four times as many people over 100 in 2011 as in 1983. Before the First World War there were . only 100 centenarians in the country. In 1917, when King George V sent . out the first 100th birthday congratulatory telegrams, Buckingham Palace . despatched just 24. By 1980 numbers of centenarians had grown to more . than 2,000. Some 570 people are now thought to be aged over 105. The . ONS said that among the very old was one particular group, now aged . between their late seventies and their late eighties, who are the . greatest beneficiaries of greater health and wealth. Golden cohort: Those born between 1926 and 1935 have seen improvements in mortality in recent years (File photo) 'People born between 1926 and 1935 are often referred to as the 'golden cohort'. In particular those born around 1930 have experienced improvements in mortality in recent years than no cohort has experienced previously or since,' the ONS report said. 'The effect of their greater rates of improvement in mortality contributes to the overall improvements in mortality at older ages.' The report added that the latest increase in numbers of those over 90 was a result of the baby boom that followed the First World War. 'There is a steady decline in the proportion of 90-year-olds over the period 2004 to 2008. These people would have been born during the First World War years 1914 to 1918, so this reflects the steady decline in births in England and Wales during the war. 'The low point in births in 1918 was followed by a large increase in births post war.' England and Wales now rank seventh in the international league table of the very old, the ONS said. Japan has the greatest proportion of over-90s, with 1,131 90-somethings for every 100,000 people. Sweden, Italy, France, Spain and Norway follow, and England and Wales have 765 over-90s for every 100,000.","Come from a 'golden cohort' that have reaped the benefits of health care .

On trial: Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman over a 13 year period . A woman dubbed the 'Nazi moll' is standing trial accused of killing ten people after a 13 year reign of terror. Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in Germany. She gave herself to police last year and is said to have told them 'I'm the one you have been looking for,' but has remained tightlipped ever since. Prosecutors say she helped found the National Socialist Underground (NSU) and faces life imprisonment if convicted. She is believed to have been locked in a macabre love triangle with two of her alleged accomplices who were found dead last November. 'Everyone in Germany knows her name but no one knows who she is,' wrote the German daily Die Welt. German police and intelligence . agencies are braced for public fury when their collective failings are . exposed at the country's most scandalous neo-Nazi trial which starts on . Wednesday in Munich. Revelations that a string of unsolved . killings may have been a cold-blooded neo-Nazi campaign against ethnic . Turks have shaken the nation, forcing Germans to confront painful truths . about racism and the broader treatment of immigrants in society. The NSU had allegedly been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police. The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide. The case is shaping up as an indictment against the entire German law enforcement establishment, its attitudes to dangerous neo-Nazism and the failings which led authorities to believe that a single racist maniac - dubbed 'The Doner Kebab Killer' because so many victims ran fast-food outlets - was responsible for the assassinations. Her trial will be held in the most heavily guarded courtroom since the cases against the Baader-Meinhof terrorists of the 1970's were heard. Gang: The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide last year . Love triangle: From left Uwe Mundlos, Beate Zschaepe and Uwe Boehnhardt who were all believed to be a macabre love triangle . Charged with participation in all 10 executions, 15 robberies, setting up a terrorist organisation and numerous arsons, Zschaepe could expect, under normal German law, to be out after 15 years if convicted. But prosecutors are seeking to implement the special clause in the national law called 'particularly grievous guilt' which allows the state to incarcerate particularly heinous criminals forever. She is in the dock along with four supporters. It is the biggest terrorism trials ever held in Germany of extreme right-wingers since the post-WW2 republic was formed and security in Munich will be unparalleled. Blown up: The NSU had been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police . Sewers have been sealed to prevent bombs being placed near the court, snipers will be on rooftops and police leave throughout Bavaria has been cancelled. Zschaepe, idolised by Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread 'right-wing propagnada,' is branded by Germany's federal prosecutor Harald Range as being at the heart of planning and carrying out the murders. But the trial is about so much more than her - it is about the deep national sense of shame in police failings to stop the NSU, which was composed of Zschaepe and two male sidekicks who were also her lovers. No link was ever made between the group and the killings, despite a vast covert intelligence network. Victims: Enver Simsek, Abdurrahim Ozudogru, Suleyman Taskopru, Habil Kilic and police woman  Michele Kiesewetter and bottom from left : Mehmet Turgut, Ismail Yasar, Theodorus Boulgarides, Mehmet Kubasik und Halit Yozgat . It has led to charges that certain police and intelligence chiefs wanted to protect the NSU because they admired them, although claims of a conspiracy have been fiercely rejected. The group was supported by a loose network of crazed neo-Nazis who dreamed of a Fourth Reich. During the killings no claim of responsibility was ever made; the group hoped that the randomness of the murders would strike fear into Germany's immigrant population who would begin leaving en-masse. They went underground in 1998 and lived from the proceeds of bank robberies across the country. The cell imploded on November 4 2011 when her male accomplices Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt botched a bank raid. Grief: Ismail Yozgat , right, and Ayse Yozgat left, pray at a memorial event on the seventh anniversary of the murder of their son Halit, who was killed by the NSU terror group, in Kassel, Germany (file photo) Remembrance: A monument to commemorate the victims of the NSU terror group is pictured in Nuremberg . In a pre-arranged plan to avoid capture, Mundlos shot his accomplice before turning the gun on himself. Zschaepe, as instructed, blew up their hideout in the east German city of Zwickau. But the blast and subsequent fire failed to destroy a mountain of evidence, including videotapes in which the trio allegedly boasted of their crimes. Days later, as a massive manhunt stretched across the country, she turned herself in. Prosecutor Range, 64, said collating the evidence against her was a 'Herculean task. We collected 6,800 pieces of evidence, mostly from the wreckage of the burned-out house in Zwickau, and questioned about 1,200 witnesses. On our side, 10 public prosecutors ran the investigations, and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation. 'Their central motive was to unsettle our fellow citizens of foreign origin -- the goal being that they would leave Germany, out of fear for their own safety.' Idolised: Zschaepe, pictured right after her arrest, is idolised by Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread 'right-wing propagnada' He said it was likely that the murderers were looking to create a 'monument' for themselves with the killings. He said that Zschaepe was involved deeply in the murders. He went on; 'To visualize it, one could say that two people did the killing while the third person stood guard. Not directly at the scene of the crime, but by handling the cover and the logistics. 'By securing the apartment as an indispensable headquarters for the NSU, by cultivating the stories and by handling the group's financial affairs. This is why we see Beate Zschäpe as a full co-perpetrator. She collaborated in all the murders and attacks. 'There are a few clues that are already known. They include her fingerprints on newspaper articles about NSU attacks that were found in the wreckage at the site of the fire in Zwickau. Besides, the police also found many surveillance notes there. To me, this means that she knew what was going on. And there is also witness testimony that places Zschaepe very close to the scene of a crime in Nuremberg. 'She was an active participant in the discussions related to the group's armed conflict, and she was involved in illegal activities with her accomplices for almost 14 years. For that reason, I am convinced that she wasn't just an accessory or merely a companion, but was in fact acting on the same level as the others.' Other controversies than the police bungling are swirling around the trial before the first opening statements. Munich authorities have failed to reserve a single seat for a member of the Turkish media, despite the nationality of most of the victims. This has led to renewed charges of German racism at worst, and indifference at best, to foreigners in the country. The trial will open just days after police discovered a neo-Nazi information service operating in the country's jails seeking to contact NSU members. The network sent coded messages between prisons hidden in letters and the classified ads sections of magazines. Again, the news seems to have failed to reach any outrage gene among Germans, who still break out in a cold sweat about left-wing violence.","Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine people over 13 years .

A 65-year-old lawyer managed to carry a loaded hand-gun onto a plane at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport - after security spotted it but failed to stop her. Judith Kenney boarded the American Airlines jet to Houston which was only stopped after it pulled away from the gate and prepared for take off. The security scare came after screeners at a security checkpoint had detected the gun in her carry-on computer bag. But before they could seize the bag and notify police, Kenney had 'picked up the bag and left the checkpoint before the screening process was over,' said a spokesman for Transportation Security Administration, which operates the checkpoints. Kenney, who was arrested after the incident on Wednesday, carries a handgun for protection but had forgotten that it was in the bag she took on board, her attorney Dallas lawyer David Finn said. Once security realised their mistake, a massive search was launched and a terminal was shut down in a desperate bid to track down the then unidentified armed passenger. A photo of Kenney from a closed-circuit video system was taken and distributed to airport employees. She was eventually found and taken into custody by DFW Airport police about an hour and 40 minutes later, TSA said. Security breach: The gun was spotted by screeners at a check-point but they failed to stop Judith Kenny who went on to board her plane . Failed: Security were supposed to seize the bag once they detected the 38 caliber handgun, shown here in a mock-up sketch . An airline spokesman said Wednesday that the plane was headed for the runway when it returned to the gate and was met by airport police. Kenney, who specializes in business and corporate law,  was removed from Flight 2385, scheduled to fly to Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport. The flight, with 128 passengers, was delayed for over an hour and passengers were screened again before the plane took off. Kenney will be charged with carrying a gun into a place where weapons are prohibited, a third-degree felony in Texas and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Loaded: Kenney managed to take a 38 caliber handgun, similar to the one pictured, onto the flight after going through security checks . Delayed: The American Airlines plane, similar to this one taking off at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, was stopped as it prepared to take-off . Kenney is 'absolutely mortified, . embarrassed,' Finn said. 'She feels terrible for putting the pilot and . passengers through all that.' More than 10 flights were also delayed in the security scare after TSA closed DFW's Terminal D. The terminal, one of five at the airport, is used for both domestic and international flights. The incident comes amid heightened criticism of TSA. A soldier arrested on December 31 at the Midland, Texas, airport with C4 explosives in his bag said he probably carried the bomb material on a flight from North Carolina to Texas. Screeners delayed him after finding and confiscating a smoke grenade but let him on that first flight.","Judith Kenney 'forgot the hand gun' was in her carry-on and is said to be 'mortified' by her mistake .

Doctors were stunned after an 11-year-old schoolgirl was admitted to a hospital in China with a third arm sprouting out of her back. The large mass was revealed to be part of an identical twin that had failed to develop and had been enveloped into the body of its sister. Further investigation found it consisted of a breast and an arm which included a shoulder blade and two fingers. The case came to the attention of the medical world after it was highlighted by Professor Baogan Peng, of the General Hospital of Armed Police Force in Beijing. The 11-year-old Chinese girl was found to have a malformed parasitic twin on her back . Writing in the journal BMJ Case Reports, Prof Peng said: 'Based on physical examination and imaging findings, a diagnosis of fetus in fetu was made preoperatively.' Fetus in fetu in an incredibly rare condition that affects only one in five million live births. It is a condition where the malformed foetus is found in the body of its twin. The foetus is found in the abdomen in 80 per cent of cases, although there have been reports of it occurring in the skull. However, this is the first time that is has been reported in the back. The young patient also suffered from diastematomyelia, which is a congenital disorder in which the spinal cord is split.

A Kansas home fruitlessly searched for marijuana during a two-state drug sweep turned out to belong to two ex-CIA employees . Two former CIA employees whose Kansas home was fruitlessly searched for marijuana during a two-state drug sweep claim they were illegally targeted, possibly because they had bought indoor growing supplies to raise vegetables. Adlynn and Robert Harte sued this week to get more information about why sheriff's deputies searched their home in the upscale Kanas City suburb of Leawood last April 20 as part of Operation Constant Gardener - a sweep conducted by agencies in Kansas and Missouri that netted marijuana plants, processed marijuana, guns, growing paraphernalia and cash from several other locations. The Hartes' attorney, Cheryl . Pilate, said she suspects the couple's 1,825-square-foot split level was . targeted because they had bought hydroponic equipment to grow a small . number of tomatoes and squash plants in their basement. 'With . little or no other evidence of any illegal activity, law enforcement . officers make the assumption that shoppers at the store are potential . marijuana growers, even though the stores are most commonly frequented . by backyard gardeners who grow organically or start seedlings indoors,' the couple's lawsuit says. The couple filed the suit this week under the Kansas Open Records Act after Johnson County and Leawood denied their initial records requests, with Leawood saying it had no relevant records. The Hartes say the public has an interest in knowing whether the sheriff's department's participation in the raids was 'based on a well-founded belief of marijuana use and cultivation at the targeted addresses, or whether the raids primarily served a publicity purpose.' The couple's attorney says she suspects their home was targeted because they had bought hydroponic equipment to grow a small number of tomatoes and squash plants in their basement . The suit filed in Johnson County District Court said the couple and their two children - a 7-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son - were 'shocked and frightened' when deputies armed with assault rifles and wearing bullet proof vests pounded on the door of their home around 7:30 a.m. last April 20. During the sweep, the court filing said, the Hartes were told they had been under surveillance for months, but the couple 'know of no basis for conducting such surveillance, nor do they believe such surveillance would have produced any facts supporting the issuance of a search warrant.' The suit also said deputies 'made rude comments' and implied their son was using marijuana. A drug sniffing dog was brought in to help, but deputies ultimately left after providing a receipt stating, 'No items taken.' Pilate said no one in the Harte family uses illegal drugs and no charges were filed. As well as growing vegetables, hydroponic equipment can be used to grow cannabis plants . The lawsuit noted Adlynn Harte, who works for a financial planning firm, and Robert Harte, who cares for the couple's children, each were required to pass rigorous background checks for their previous jobs working for the CIA in Washington, D.C. Pilate said she couldn't provide any other details about their CIA employment. Pilate said any details gleaned from the open records suit could be used in a future federal civil rights lawsuit. 'You can't go into people's homes and conduct searches without probable cause,' Pilate said. Leawood City Administrator Scott Lambers said Friday that he couldn't comment on pending litigation. The sheriff's office also had no comment. 'Obviously with an ongoing lawsuit we are not able to talk about any details of it until it's been played out in court,' said Johnson County Deputy Tom Erickson.","Adlynn and Robert Harte claim they were illegally targeted by local police .

William Plotnikov, 23, converted to Islam and joined an Islamic militia fighting against Russian security forces . A new figure has emerged in the story of a Boston bomber's conversion to violent extremist Islam - a 23-year-old boxer from Canada who Tamerlan Tsarnaev met online and may have visited during his trip to Russia last year. William Plotnikov, a Muslim convert from Toronto, could have spurred Tsarnaev to direct his against the United States, new reports reveal. The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reports that Tamerlan went to Dagestan - a Russia republic torn by jihadist terrorism - to join an Islamic militia and fight against Russian forces in July 2012. One day after Plotnikov was killed by Russian security forces, Tamerlan fled to Moscow. The next day he was back to the United States. Another contact Tamerlan had in Dagestan - Makhmud Mansur Nidal, 19 - was also killed by Russian forces during his six-month visit to to the war-torn region. Tamerlan's family blames a red-haired Armenian convert known only as 'Misha' for turning the 26-year-old to extremist Islam. However, Novaya Gazeta suggests Plotnikov may have turned Tamerlan against the United States. 'It seems that Tamerlan Tsarnaev came to Dagestan with the aim of joining the insurgents. It didn't work out..,' a security source told the newspaper. Similarities: Plotnikov (left) and Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) met online through a website associated with the World Assembly of Muslim Youth. Both suddenly adopted radical Islam in 2009, both were boxers and both were interested in fighting Russian forces in the Russian republic of Dagestan . 'After Nidal and Plotnikov were destroyed and he lost his contacts, Tsarnaev got frightened and fled.' Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper first reported Novaya Gazeta's claims. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's parents moved them to the United States from the troubled Dagestan region years ago. The brothers are believed to be the lone perpetrators behind the April 15 attacks on the Boston Marathon that killed three people and wounded 270. Tamerlan, the mastermind behind the attack, was killed April 19 after a shootout with police. Dzhokhar, 19, was captured by federal agents later that day in a boat in suburban Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar told interviewers that Tamerlan planned the attacks to 'defend Islam' against the United States and was motivated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fighter: Tamerlan gave up boxing after he adopted radical Islam in 2009. Before that, he was a promising amateur fighter . The similarities between William Plotnikov - who was called 'The Canadian' by the other militiamen - and Tamerlan are uncanny. Both men were competitive boxers as teenagers. Both seemed to have suddenly turned to radical Islam in 2009 and quickly became interested in violent jihad being waged in Dagestan - where Islamic militias are targeting the moderate Sufi Muslims and fighting Russian security forces who control the region. Both were born in Russian republics and later moved to the West, where they struggled to fit in. It is unknown whether Tamerlan and Plotnikov ever met in person. At one point, Tamerlan visited an aunt in Toronto - the same city where Plotnikov lived with his parents. Leader: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, (left) was the mastermind behind the April 15 Boston Marathon bomb attacks. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, (right) told police he was following his brother's orders . Plotnikov seized and interviewed by Russian authorities in 2010. At that time told them that Tamerlan was one of the people he communicated with online. Novaya Gazeta reports that the two communicated via a site associated with the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, a non-governmental organization. Plotnikov was then released by the Russians and went on to join an Islamic militia and take up arms against Russian security forces in Dagestan. In February 2012, Tamerlan traveled to Dagestan. Novaya Gazeta reports that he was seen 'more than once' by Russian intelligence units with Makhmud Mansur Nidal, 19, a half-Palestinian Dagestani who is believed responsible for a twin bomb attack in the capital Makhachkala that killed 13 people. While Tamerlan was in Russian, Nidal was killed.","William Plotnikov - nicknamed 'The Canadian' - was a 23-year-old boxer from Toronto who fought against Russian security forces in Dagestan .

Tycoon: Matthew Riley heads Daisy Surgery Line which has made big profits from phone lines used by UK surgeries . Calls from mobile phones to NHS surgeries using 0844 or 0855 numbers are costing patients a fortune, it emerged today. An investigation has found patients trying to book an appointment with their GP can be left on hold for 30 minutes and charged as much as £12. Callers are not warned that they are spending up to 41p a minute from a mobile, while phoning a normal landline number is as little as 2p a minute. An estimated six million patients across the UK are affected by the scheme which is making huge profits for companies who provide the numbers. Britain's biggest, Daisy Surgery Line which has contracts with about 1,000 GP practices, made £5.8 million last year on sales of £14 million. Tycoon Matthew Riley, 39, launched the firm from a garage in 2001. The Sunday Times rich list claims he is worth £85 million. The probe by the Sunday Mirror tested how long it took for 80 surgeries to answer.The longest was the Dun Cow surgery in south London at 28 minutes and 50 seconds. This worked out at £11.82 from a mobile charging 41p a minute. A BT landline charging 5p a minute would have cost £1.43. A wait of 13 minutes and five seconds was recorded for Crawcrook surgery in Gateshead with a cost of £5.36 from a mobile and 65p on a BT landline. Put on hold: A call to the Dun Cow surgery in South London took almost 29 minutes and cost almost £12 . A call to the Padiham Medical Centre in Burnley, Lancs, was kept on hold for eight minutes and 20 seconds. The bill was £3.41 for a 40p a minute BT landline. There was no warning to patients calling . the 0844 and 0845 numbers of the high cost of the calls if they were . using mobile phones. The investigation recorded that the average wait was one minute and 54 seconds . A spokesman for the Patients' Association told the Sunday Mirror: 'It is morally wrong for GPs to charge patients these rates – many will have no clue. This needs to be stopped.' Waiting: Patients can pay a big price for using a mobile to contact their surgeries and the logo for the biggest medical phone firm Daisy Surgery Line which has contracts with around 1,000 GP practices . Former Labour Minister John Healey, who . won a fight with GPs in his Yorkshire constituency to drop the lines, . added: 'No one should be forced to use these rip-off numbers. 'Guidelines created by Labour ruled out this practice. The Government needs to enforce the rules.' In . 2010, the Health Department urged GPs to phase out the premium lines, . but many of the medical centres are legally-bound by long-term deals . with the telecom providers. When questioned about the 28-minute wait, the Dun Cow told the paper that the delay was 'definitely not typical.' A . spokesman for Crawcrook blamed the delay on a 'major problem' with its . system. It claimed the surgery had installed the 0844 number because . patients often found their landline busy. Waiting time: A call to the Padiham Medical Centre in Burnley was put on hold for eight minutes and 20 seconds costing up to £3.41 . A statement from Daisy Surgery Line said: 'It is important to note 084 numbers are not premium rate numbers. 'NHS regulations permit their use provided our GP customers are satisfied that, having regard to the arrangement as a whole, their patients will not be paying more than a local rate call.

Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin lashed out at D.C. journalists and politicos on Saturday, calling them all 'a**clowns' for partying at the annual White House Correspondents' dinner. 'That #WHCD was pathetic,' Palin, the former governor of Alaska, tweeted at 10:15 p.m. 'The rest of America is out there working our a**es off while these DC a**clowns throw themselves a #nerdprom.' Palin, who likely watched coverage of the dinner on television, may have just upset that she didn't get any invitations to this year's events. She certainly had no harsh words for the dinner two years ago, when she attended two star-studded after-parties - one hosted by Bloomberg and Vanity Fair and the other hosted by MSNBC. She was also spotted the morning of the dinner at multimillionaire Mark Ein's Georgetown abode for an exclusive brunch. Not impressed: Sarah Palin lashed out at D.C. journalists and politicos on Saturday, calling them all 'a**clowns' for partying at the annual White House Correspondents' dinner . Her daughter, Bristol, attended the after-parties with her mother and Bristol was also spotted at a pre-party thrown by Time, CNN, People magazine and Fortune that year. Palin's Twitter remark was retweeted 2,407 times and it was 'favorited' nearly 1,000 times. In a Facebook post, she expanded on her criticism of the dinner, saying, 'Yuk it up media and pols. While America is buried in taxes and a fight for our rights, the permanent political class in DC dresses up and has a prom to make fun of themselves. No need for that, we get the real joke.' Palin's remark was retweeted more than 2,000 times and it was 'favorited' nearly 1,000 times . The post garnered more than 44,000 'likes.' The dinner has become a target of criticism over the years as media companies compete for the most high-profile guests, many of them celebrities. In that vein, many say the dinner - which has been a tradition since the 1920s - is now less a celebration of the work that reporters do in covering the administration, and more of an opportunity for media and politicians to schmooze with Hollywood's biggest stars. Some journalists, such as Tom Brokaw, have refused to attend the dinner as its list of attendees from Hollywood expands. 'Somewhere along the line, it began to freewheel out of control,' Brokaw told Politico of the dinner. The 'breaking point' for him, he said, was Lindsay Lohan's attendance last year as a guest of Fox News' Greta Van Susteran.

Prince Harry proved he is an excellent uncle-to-be when he hand-delivered a teddy bear bought for his unborn niece or nephew. The young Royal promised a little girl he met in Nottingham that he would to pass on the gift. And he stayed true to his word this weekend as he was pictured clutching the bear as he arrived home. True to his word: Prince Harry pictured holding the blue bear he promised to give to his unborn niece or nephew . Baby's first present: The bear was a gift from a girl the Prince met during a visit to Nottingham . He met the girl during the visit to open the headquarters of Headway, in Bradbury House, Nottingham - a brain injury charity that was also supported by his mother, Princess Diana. After . the trip, Prince Harry flew back to Kensington Palace - the home he . shares with his brother and sister-in-law - by helicopter . He . was seen strolling across the palace lawns still holding the blue bear, . thought to be a 'Tatty Teddy', and a CD that may have been another . gift. William and Kate live in Nottingham . Cottage, in the north of the palace grounds, while Princess Margaret's . old apartments are being renovated and Prince Harry lives in a . one-bedroom former staff apartment nearby. It comes as Prince Harry's romance . with girlfriend Cressida Bonas is reportedly 'on the rocks' because she . is not ready to marry. The fun-loving Prince, 28, apparently wants to settle down and start a family. But 24-year-old Cressida wants an acting career, and hates the idea of being a 'trophy wife', friends have said. Home sweet home: Harry held on to the bear as he arrived at Kensington Palace, the home he shares with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Keepsake: The little teddy is believed to be from the From Me To You range and a gift for the unborn baby . The Sunday People has reported that the relationship is not 'firing on all cylinders'. A friend told the paper that Harry wants to get married and settle down with Cressida. They . added: 'Sadly for Harry, she thinks she is too young to do that. She . likes to go out and enjoy herself and is a long, long way off being . anyone’s wife let alone a royal wife.' The friend said there are problems with the relationship which are 'irreconcilable'. The paper said that Cressida has told friends she is far too young to settle down and is scared of Harry's talk of marriage. Prince William and Kate are also believed to be unhappy about his choice of girlfriend. William was once linked with Cressida’s half-sister Lady Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, 33, during a temporary split with Kate. 'On the rocks': Prince Harry's romance with girlfriend Cressida Bonas is reportedly in trouble . She is now married to Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson’s son Sam, 27. Harry and Cressida began dating last June and have been regularly seen at  public events and clubs together. They . were introduced by the Prince’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, 23, at a time . when Harry had been single for 18 months following his split from . former girlfriend Chelsy Davey, 27. Cressida's father is Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas, and her mother is Sixties cover girl Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, 66. Friends said despite Cressida having the credentials of a royal bride Harry is not getting what he had hoped from the relationship and is said to be growing 'tired with her dishing out ultimatums.' The source told the paper: 'If it keeps happening it will be Harry who calls off this relationship. Harry is also said to miss former girlfriend, Zimbabwean born Chelsy. They dated for four years but split up for good in 2010.","Prince was pictured holding the bear as he landed at Kensington Palace .

Danish scientists believe they are on the brink of finding a cure for HIV which could be used to treat millions of people with the Aids virus. Clinical tests are currently being conducted on a new technique which involves removing the virus from human DNA and then allowing it to be destroyed naturally by the body's immune system. The scientists, based at Aarhus .

Fifteen patients are currently taking . part in the trials, and if they are found to have successfully been . cured of HIV, the new technique will be tested on a wider scale. Dr Ole Søgaard, a senior researcher on the project, told The Sunday Telegraph, he was 'almost certain' scientists would be successful in releasing reservoirs of HIV to the surface of DNA cells. He said: 'The challenge will be getting the patients’ immune system to recognise the virus and destroy it. 'This depends on the strength and sensitivity of individual immune systems.' The news comes just two days after the U.S government stopped  trials of another experimental HIV vaccine . after an independent review found it did not prevent HIV infection or . reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. The study, called HVTN 505, had enrolled 2,504 volunteers in 19 U.S. cities. The vaccine was based on a common cold virus that was used to sneak HIV genes into the body and grab the attention of the immune system. With modern HIV treatment, a patient can expect to live an almost normal life, even into old age, with limited side effects. However, if medication is stopped, HIV reservoirs become active and start to produce more of the virus, meaning that symptoms can reappear within two weeks. A senior researcher has said he is 'almost certain' scientists would be successful in releasing reservoirs of HIV to the surface of DNA cells . Finding a cure would free a patient . from the need to take continuous HIV medication, and save health . services across the world billions of pounds.

The Duchess of Cambridge is considering giving birth at a hospital near her family home, friends have said . The Duchess of Cambridge is considering giving birth at a hospital near her family home, it has been reported. It had been expected that the Royal baby would be born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington. It is where Princess Diana gave birth to the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry. But friends of Kate Middleton have said she and her family want the baby to be born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where she and her sister Pippa were born. A source told the Telegraph: 'Their thinking is that she will be based at her parents’ house during the later stages of her pregnancy and they do not want her to have to travel miles to Paddington when she goes into labour.' The Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading has recently opened a  £3 million, assisted by Marcus Setchell. It has been reported that Kate intends to . live at her parents house in Bucklebury for the first six weeks . after the birth. The baby is due in July. Kate was treated for severe morning sickness at the private King Edward VII Hospital, in Marylebone. During her stay two radio presenters called the hospital pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put through the call through, killed herself days later. It is not thought the tragedy has formed part of Kate's decision making process. Asbestos has been discovered at the couple's Kensington Palace apartment and is currently being cleared from the property. The Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where Kate and her sister Pippa were born . It has been reported that Kate intends to live at her parents house in Bucklebury for the first six weeks after the birth. The baby is due in July . Kate – who is six months pregnant – told guests at a recent reception that she had chosen a buggy by designer label Bugaboo, which has celebrity fans including actress Sienna Miller and television presenter Peaches Geldof. The buggies, which cost from £500 to £1,000 and can operate as either a pushchair or pram, come in a variety of colours and parents who do not know the sex of their baby usually prefer neutral hues such as beige, off-white or black. The Duke and Duchess have insisted that they do not know if they are having a boy or a girl. But although it is possible to swap some of the buggy’s accessories for those in different colours, including pink, Kate’s choice of blue will be seen as a  clear hint as to her feelings about the gender. She has said she would prefer a son while William wants a daughter. Yesterday, Bugaboo said it had not presented the buggy to the Royal couple after being advised by officials not to send gifts. So it appears that Kate, who was seen shopping for a Moses basket in South Kensington last week with her mother, bought the pram herself. The Duchess, 31, revealed the Bugaboo colour when she chatted to a group of Army wives at a drinks reception in Aldershot on St Patrick’s Day.","Was expected baby would be born in St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington .

The return of opaque tights and boots can only mean one thing - the sniffles season is upon us. The rows of shelf space once devoted to sun cream are now being replaced by tissues, decongestants and emergency dosages of vitamin C. We're always being told a healthy diet helps to support our immune systems, but with the relentless bombardment of so many apparently conflicting health messages, it can be difficult to know where to begin. The key to a strong immune system, according to Dr Fuhrman, lies in micronutrients present in abundance in certain vegetables and fruit . But eminent doctor and nutritionist Dr Joel Fuhrman believes he has come up with a definitive two-week immunity-boosting diet that supports the body's natural defences. He claims it also makes you feel so good that you’ll want to incorporate it into your daily life. Not only will such a plan turbo-charge your chances of staying cold-free but, according to the doctor, will boost your defences against far more sinister health conditions - even cancer - and could also help you lose weight. The key, according to Dr Fuhrman, lies in micronutrients present in abundance in certain vegetables and fruit. It is these micronutrients (the catch-all term for the vitamins and minerals that are vital to the body but only needed in small quantities) that, when eaten in specific combinations, play a crucial role in strengthening and supporting our immunity. Foods such as berries and mushrooms are an important part of Dr Fuhrman's immune-boosting diet . He believes the nutritional inadequacies of the modern diet have left our bodies struggling to fight off viruses and infections, resulting in frequent colds - which don't shift - and an ever-increasing risk of disease, such as cancer. If you don't have a well-functioning immune system, mild infections hang on for weeks, and can evolve into bronchitis or sinusitis. But with a strong immune system, Dr Fuhrman insists you should be almost totally resistant to colds and flu, your body fighting off the virus before it takes hold. Even if you do notice mild symptoms, you should be back to normal again within 24 hours. Dr Fuhram suggests half your daily vegetables are eaten raw, to maximise the impact of their micronutrients, some of which may be lost in the cooking process . He blames processed foods - those rich in fat, sugar and refined carbohydrates - together with our meagre fruit and vegetable intake (only 12 per cent of us manage to reach the Government's recommended minimum of five a day), for leaving our natural immunity levels woefully compromised. 'The modern diet is grossly deficient in hundreds of important plant-derived immunity-building compounds,' he explains, 'which makes us highly vulnerable to viruses, infections and disease.' It is the micronutrients in certain foods that he says have the most profound effects on immunity, and which most of us are sorely lacking. 'A combination of these compounds is far more effective than any single agent,' he says. In other words, although a fresh red . pepper may be rich in vitamin C, it's the other smaller compounds it . contains that work with vitamin C and increase its health-giving . properties. This explains why fresh fruit and vegetables are more effective than a simple high-dose vitamin C tablet. Dr Fuhrnan's new food pyramid . 'These micronutrients are not optional. You cannot have a lifetime of good health without them,' he says. After treating more than 10,000 patients over the past 20 years using this micronutrient-dense diet, Dr Fuhrman is convinced his diet plan is enough to achieve what he calls 'super immunity'. 'The human immune system can be supercharged to protect our bodies against disease,' he says. 'It radically reduces the risk of annoying minor infections, serious major infections and even cancers.' The key lies in cleverly combining the most nutritious foods in such a way as to maximise their impact.To this end, Dr Fuhrman has calculated a nutritional value for the most micronutrient-dense foods available, and has created a unique but simple diet plan. HOW THE DIET WORKS . The standard-issue British 'food pyramid' recommends that the bulk of our diet is made up of carbohydrates. We comply with gusto, happily filling ourselves up on pasta, rice, potatoes and bread. Yet, with 22 per cent of Britons now deemed obese, and battling through three colds per year on average, it could be said that these guidelines are flawed. Superfoods . In contrast, the super immunity diet pyramid is founded on vegetables - at least eight servings a day. Dr Fuhrman recommends that two of these eight servings should be made up of green vegetables. He also suggests that half of these are eaten raw as salads to maximise their impact, some of which may be lost in the cooking process. Once you've got your vegetable intake organised, the next most important food groups are fruit (six pieces per day), and protein-rich nuts, seeds and beans/pulses (such as lentils and chickpeas). Studies show that the compounds found in nuts and seeds, berries and pomegranates are potently protective. Dr Fuhrman believes when they are combined with green vegetables, mushrooms and onions, they come together to fuel our body's self-healing and self-protective properties. The ideal combination in any meal is greens, onions, mushrooms, beans and seeds, with berries to follow. On this diet, hunger isn't a problem - you are encouraged to eat three large meals a day. Carbohydrates play a smaller role than vegetables, and should be eaten as slow-burn wholegrains, beans, peas, corn, barley, oats, quinoa and pumpkin. If you follow the diet to the letter, meat, fish, eggs and dairy products should be eaten only in moderation. Although he says the ideal diet is vegetarian, even vegan, Dr Fuhrman is accepting of what he calls a 'flexitarian' approach, as long as you choose the best quality animal products (grass-fed meats, wild fish and organic or free-range poultry and eggs). He regards sweets, cakes, biscuits and processed or fast food as 'nutrient-depleting', because the refined ingredients work against the action of the diet, suppressing your delicate immune function. Every day, try to eat the following items: . Super seed porridge (Serves 2) 90g (3oz) rolled oats . 360ml vanilla soya milk . 1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped . 190g (7oz) mixed berries . 40g (1 ½ oz) raisins . 1 tbsp sunflower seeds . 1 tbsp ground flax seeds . 1 tbsp ground hemp seeds . ½ tsp ground cinnamon .

Mrs Taylor said she appreciated Baroness Thatcher's years in power had been divisive but she believed she was a wonderful prime minister. 'I think people forget the way Britain was before she came to power,' she said. 'They forget the winter of discontent.' Earlier, a pink rose was unveiled at South Kesteven District Council headquarters in the town to mark the funeral. The flower, from County Gardens Roses in Shropshire, was named Grantham’s Thatcher Rose by the council. It will be replanted in Wyndham Park in the town at a later date. There were no mass protests in the town and a statement from Lincolnshire Police said they had continued to “review intelligence' ahead of the funeral, but had not received any suggestion of any action. The statement added: 'Appropriate contingency plans are in place and extra officers are available to be deployed, should this be necessary.' Outside the home where Baroness Thatcher grew up above her father’s grocer’s shop, which is now a chiropractic clinic and holistic retreat, dozens of floral tributes had been left in her memory. One card, signed by Johnny Ferry, read: “The Iron Lady. Thanks for everything.' Another said: 'Margaret Thatcher, thank you and god bless for your life and service.

THE big freeze will tighten its grip on the country today and last well into the New Year, according to forecasters. After swathes of Britain woke up to inches of snow yesterday, the Met Office said the cold spell will continue for the next four weeks at least, unleashing sub-zero temperatures, snow, freezing fog and icy 30mph winds.

People with diabetes are almost 50 per cent more likely to have a heart attack than those who do not have the condition, new research has shown. Almost 14,500 diabetics suffered a heart attack in England and Wales between 2010 and 2011 - 4,700 more cases than expected. The National Diabetes Audit also revealed sufferers are at greater risk of heart failure and other potentially fatal conditions including angina and strokes. Risk: Diabetes sufferers are almost 50 per cent more likely to have a heart attack than people without the condition, a new study has shown . The report - which shows the extent to which people with diabetes are dying earlier and developing more health problems than the rest of the population - suggests diabetics are 48 per cent more likely to have a heart attack, and 65 per cent more likely to have heart failure. Between 2010 and 2011, 17,900 diabetics suffered from a stroke, 9,800 needed a kidney transplant or dialysis and 1,700 needed a 'major amputation', figures indicate. Diabetics were also at a higher risk of death than people without the condition, according to the report. The excess risk is much higher among people with rarer Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 10 per cent of all cases of the disorder. People with the more common Type 2 diabetes have a 36 per cent excess risk. Charity Diabetes UK has urged the NHS to take urgent action to prevent diabetes-related heart disease on the back of the findings. Chief executive Barbara Young said: 'The finding that people with diabetes are almost 50 per cent more likely to have a heart attack is shocking and this is one of the main reasons many thousands of people with the condition are dying before their time. 'Unacceptable variation': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said diabetics should be able to expect excellent care from the NHS . 'It is a tragedy that a large proportion of these thousands of extra heart attacks could have been prevented simply through better education, treatment and care. 'We hope this report spurs the NHS into action to improve the current situation where fewer than half of people with diabetes meet the recommended cholesterol levels and a significant minority are not even having it measured. 'We want everyone with diabetes to get their cholesterol, blood pressure and blood glucose checked once a year, and for this to be the start of a process of supporting the person to achieve healthy levels of these,' she said. 'Unless this happens, people with diabetes will continue to be at much greater risk of heart attacks.' Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said the figures showed the biggest problem with diabetes was the condition's 'devastating' effect on the heart and circulation. He said it was necessary to tackle increasing levels of obesity in British society in order to help prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'People with diabetes should be able to expect excellent care from the NHS and they will get it more consistently in future. 'I know there has been progress, but there is still unacceptable variation and we are determined to put that right. 'We want to make sure that people living with diabetes are given the care and support they need, and this audit will help us do this,' he added. In the UK, there are 3.7 million people with diabetes, including an estimated 850,000 people who have Type 2 diabetes but do not know it.","Condition increases the risk of heart attack by 48 per cent, according to the National Diabetes Audit .

They said the former 2Day FM presenter will answer 'any questions' the family or the coroner have. The statement added: 'She is determined to address any questions surrounding her role in these tragic events as part of the inquest'. William and Kate pictured leaving the King Edward VII hospital shortly after she received treatment for morning sickness . Yesterday, it emerged that Ms Saldanha, 46, directly blamed the radio presenters in a suicide letter found by her hanged body. The note said: 'I hold the Radio Australians Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible for this act. 'Please make them pay for my mortgage.' The nurse exonerated the hospital from any responsibility in the handwritten letter and pointed the finger of blame at the 2Day FM presenters. The mother-of-two addressed the message to her managers at the exclusive London hospital. She said: 'Please accept my apologies. I am truly sorry. Thank you for all your support.' An . inquest into Mrs Saldanha's death was due to begin this week but has . been delayed. Mrs Saldanha was found dead in nurses accommodation close to the hospital just a few days after the call was broadcast. She shared a home in Bristol with her husband Benedict Barboza, 49 and their two children, Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14. Ms Greig has not returned to work , while co-host Michael Christian has taken a lower profile role . The two Australian DJs were sent death threats after the nurse's death was reported across the world . Mrs Saldanha, from Valencia in south-west India, married Mr Barboza, from the nearby village of Shirva, in 1993. She had been working in England for ten years but was said to be having problems working at King Edward VII. When she was working in London she lived in nurse’s quarters behind the hospital, returning to the family home on her days off. It has been revealed that the nurse had been taking anti-depressants for nine months after attempting suicide twice in 2011. She was closely monitored as a high-suicide risk but her employers were unaware of this. Questions: Mrs Saldanha's husband and children at her memorial last December. Mel Greig said she will answer any questions Jacintha Saldanha's family have . Ms Greig made the call with co-host Michael Christian, who has since taken a lower profile job at a Melbourne station.

Resembling a full-sized hula hoop with one of the label's classic 2.55 bags stitched awkwardly across the bottom of it, the bags first appeared slung over models' shoulders on the spring/summer 2013 catwalk during fashion week. They were instantly dismissed by fashion editors as a stunt by the publicity-hungry house (famous for freezing a giant iceberg in the middle of the catwalk and staging a threesome between models in previous years) which would never go into production.

So who on earth would want something so cumbersome, ridiculous and expensive (the bags start at £1,500 for a 24cm across version) - other than, of course, the fashion pack or egomaniacal reality stars looking to attract some column inches? Luckily, Chanel head designer Karl Lagerfeld provides an answer as to where this bag might be appropriate: 'It's for the beach,' he explained after his show in the Grand Palais in Paris, to rapturous crowds. 'You need space for the beach towel. And then you can put it into the sand and hang things on it.' Yes, this bag is nothing less than a designer drying rack and towel holder.

A top AEG executive referred to Michael Jackson as 'the freak' hours before their company signed the pop icon to a huge concert deal. Another exec called him 'creepy'. The revelation meant an audible gasp could be heard in the Los Angeles courtroom at the wrongful death trial. Some fans even left crying. Scroll down for video... Emails: Michael Jackson was referred to as 'freak' in AEG email . Michael Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live claiming the company was negligent in hiring the personal physician who was later convicted of killing the pop superstar. It also says AEG pushed Jackson too hard despite signs that he was in poor health. Katherine Jackson watched from the front row as her lawyer questioned AEG Live Senior Vice President and General Counsel Shawn Trell about an e-mail exchange with his boss at parent company AEG. 'Is it the policy of AEG to talk in derogatory terms about the artist you're going to do business with?' Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked. 'No,' Trell answered. Lawsuit: The email was disclosed at the trial in the wrongful-death suit filed against AEG by Jackson's mother and his children . Panish then showed jurors an e-mail Trell sent on January 28, 2009, to Ted Fikre, AEG's chief legal officer, explaining  he was about to go to Jackson's home for the signing of the contract for his 'This Is It' concert tour. 'Does that mean you get to meet the freak?' Fikre replied. Trell responded: 'Apparently. Not sure how I feel about that. Interesting for sure, but kind of creepy.' The e-mail exchange occurred less than four hours before Trell and other AEG executives visited Jackson's Los Angeles home. 'This is a man you hoped to make millions and millions of dollars from?' Panish asked Trell. 'Didn't your mom ever say if you don't have anything good to to say about someone, don't say anything?' Trell earlier testified that he was excited to meet Jackson for the first time and was impressed with his 'good, firm handshake.' Courtroom drama: Email was shown to the jury during the third day of testimony by Shawn Trell, general counsel and senior vice president for AEG Live . 'I may not have necessarily agreed with some of the life choices Michael Jackson made, but I certainly had enormous respect for him as an entertainer.' AEG say that Jackson chose, hired and supervised Doctor Conrad Murray. 'That email just exemplifies that AEG had no respect for Mr. Jackson.,' Panish said outside of court. 'All he was was a vehicle to make money and to promote their concert business to catch up to Live Nation.' Live Nation is the chief rival of AEG Live. Jessica Stebbins Bina, a trial defense lawyer for AEG, said the emails were shown merely to embarrass AEG. 'We are four weeks into trial and we have yet to hear one piece of substantive evidence,' said Marvin S. Putnam, an attorney who is leading AEG's defense. Murray signed his contract the day before Jackson's June 25, 2009, death, but AEG executives and Jackson never put their signatures on it. Jackson lawyers argue he had been already working for two months based on an oral contract. The Jackson lawsuit says that AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have warned them that Jackson was in danger from Murray's treatment. Earlier in the day, Trell testified that he had been told that Jackson passed a medical exam for an insurance policy a few months before his death 'with flying colors.' Trial: The Jacksons are suing AEG, contending the company negligently hired and supervised Conrad Murray, the doctor who administered the fatal dose of propofol to Jackson in June 2009. A second insurance exam had been scheduled for July 6, 2009 — about two weeks after Jackson died. The exams were necessary so AEG could buy cancellation insurance for Jackson's 'This Is It' concerts. The coroner ruled that Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Murray told police he was using to treat the singer's insomnia. Jurors were shown an e-mail sent to AEG Live President Randy Phillips and Co-CEO Paul Gongaware by 'This Is It' stage manager John 'Bugzee' Houghdahl on June 19, 2009 less than a week before Jackson died. 'I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks,' Houghdahl wrote. 'He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now.'","Lawyer for AEG called Michael Jackson 'a freak' on the day he signed a multimillion contract for his comeback tour .

Police say the two suspects - who are believed to be responsible for the Boston bombings - discharged several explosives at police from the vehicle during the pursuit. According to eyewitness reports, two men believed to be in their early twenties engaged in a furious gun fight with dozens of police on a backstreet of Watertown. The exchange left one of the Boston bombing suspects dead - dubbed 'Suspect One' by the FBI and the second - the 'White Cap Suspect Two' is still on the loose. Police said Richard H. Donahue, a transit officer was injured in the gunfight. Authorities said he was in surgery at Mount Auburn Hospital. Boston Police Chief Ed Davis tweeted: ‘One suspect dead. One at large. Armed and dangerous. White hat suspect at large.’ The drama unfolded hours after the FBI released images of two men named as suspects in the deadly Boston marathon attacks and the Boston Globe has said the two men involved in this evenings shoot-out are those same men. The images show them walking in single file toward the finishing line of the race around 13 minutes before the twin detonations. Hours after the initial photos were made public, investigators released close-up shots this morning of the two suspects that more clearly show the men's faces. University officials said MIT is heartbroken by the news that an MIT Police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty on Thursday night on campus' Massachusetts State Police spokesperson Dave Procopio said that they believe multiple possible explosive devices were used against police tonight during this incident at Watertown . Suspect Number One was wearing a black baseball hat, a dark hooded jacket and khaki pants. Suspect Number Two was wearing a white basketball cap on backwards and a dark hooded sweatshirt. The FBI made no mention of the men's height, weight or age range and would not discuss the men's ethnicity. 'It would be inappropriate to comment on the ethnicity of the men because it could lead people down the wrong path potentially,' said FBI agent Greg Comcowich, a spokesman for the Boston FBI office . The information on the first suspect was developed within a day or so before its release, DesLauriers said. Agent Daniel Curtin said the FBI did not issue the photos earlier because authorities wanted to be meticulous: 'It's important to get it right.' And according to FBI sources who have spoken to CNN, still unreleased footage reveals that the suspects stayed at the scene to watch the devastation the two blasts created. 'When the bombs blow up, when most people are running away and victims were lying on the ground, the two suspects walk away pretty casually,' said the official to CNN, who has seen the unreleased video. 'They acted differently than everyone else,' he added. Following last night's killing MIT has cancelled it classes today. A letter from Israel Ruiz, the school's executive vice president and treasurer, and school Chancellor Eric Grimson. 'MIT suffered a tragedy last night: an MIT Police officer was shot and killed on our campus in the line of duty,' says the letter, addressed to the MIT community. 'While the circumstances around the officer's death remain the subject of an active investigation, what is certain is that the officer gave his life to defend the peace of our campus. His sacrifice will never be forgotten by the Institute. We are thinking now of his family, and our hearts are heavy.'","Gunned down at Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus last night .

Afghan President Hamid Karzai confirmed today that his national security team had been receiving payments from the U.S. government for the past 10 years. Karzai revealed the payments when he was asked about a story published in The New York Times. The article said the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases, backpacks and plastic shopping bags in return for access to his inner circle. The cash payments are the first known to be given directly to President Karzai. Barack Obama pictured with President Karzai. it has been revealed that tens of millions of dollars has been given to Afghan officials by C.I.A . The cash payments have been made during the last ten years, straddling both George W Bush and Barack Obama's presidencies . During a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, where he was on an official visit, Karzai said the welcome monthly payments were not a 'big amount' but were a 'small amount', although he did not disclose the sums. He said they were used to give assistance to the wounded and sick, to pay rent for housing and for other 'operational' purposes. He said the aid has been 'very useful, and we are grateful for it.' The newspaper quotes Khalil Roman, who served as Mr. Karzai's deputy chief of staff from 2002 until 2005, as calling the vast CIA payments 'ghost money' that 'came in secret, and it left in secret.' It also quotes unidentified American officials as saying that 'the cash has fueled corruption and empowered warlords, undermining Washington's exit strategy from Afghanistan.' In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment on the report, referring questions to the CIA, which also declined comment. In 2010, Iran acknowledged that it had been sending funds to neighboring Afghanistan for years, but said the money was intended to aid reconstruction, not to buy influence in Karzai's office. Karzai admitted in 2010 that once or twice a year Iran gave his office between £445,000 . and £620,000 for official presidential expenses - and that Washington provided 'bags of money' because his office lacks funds. Hamid Karzai confirmed his government received payments from U.S in 2010. The latest information reveals much larger figures than were suspected .

A U.S source said 'the biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan was the United States' When Iran's payments to the Afghan government were revealed three years ago, U.S. officials condemned the behaviour. The Afghan president confirmed that Washington was giving him 'bags of money', too, because his office lacked funds. Some of the CIA's money is believed to be used to pay off warlords and politicians who may have links to the Taliban. At the time, President Barack Obama's . press secretary, Robert Gibbs, denied that the U.S. government was in . 'the big bags of cash business', but former U.S. State Department . spokesman P.J. Crowley had said earlier that some of the American aid to . Afghanistan was in cash.

Teacher: Catherine Rayne messaged the 15-year-old pupil dozens of times and made clear that she wanted to be 'romantically involved' A teacher who spent two years trying to seduce a male pupil less than half her age has been banned from every school in the country. Catherine Rayne, 35, pursued the boy from when he was 15, sending him gifts, texts, Facebook messages and a letter inviting him to start a 'romantic relationship'. She was friends with the boy's parents, but at one point Miss Rayne visited the family home when the pupil was there by himself. A professional conduct panel heard that the boy tried to telephone his father three times, saying he felt uncomfortable and compromised being alone with the teacher. She later texted the pupil to say 'the offer is still open', and the boy's father made an official complaint to the school. Miss Rayne, a geography and history teacher at the independent Michael Hall Steiner Waldorf School in East Sussex, admitted engaging in 'inappropriate behaviour' beginning in September 2009, when the pupil was 15. She gave him private tuition at her house, and during the summer holiday of 2010 she sent him a letter and a gift. In September of that year she visited the boy's bedroom and asked him whether he wanted to be 'just friends'. The same month his father complained to the school, and Miss Rayne received a formal warning. But in March 2011 she sent the boy a handwritten letter asking him to begin a 'romantic relationship'. She resigned after the boy's father sent the letter to the school – although she still sent the pupil one further gift. The National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel found Miss Rayne guilty of unacceptable professional conduct, and recommended she should be banned from teaching. It found that she had ignored an informal warning in September 2009 that her contact with pupils was inappropriate, as well as the formal warning the following year. Its report said: 'It is a well-accepted and understood principle, teachers must not establish or seek to establish social contact with pupils, children or young people for the purpose of securing a friendship or to pursue or strengthen a relationship. Uncomfortable: The Department of Education's report said that Ms Rayne (pictured) should have known that the pupil was not comfortable with her advances . The teacher had joined Michael Hall School in September 2009, and soon embarked on pursuing the pupil . 'However, from September 2009, Ms . Rayne sent text and Facebook messages to the pupil, gave him gifts, . visited him at his home and gave him tuition at her home. 'Her conduct was compounded by the . fact that it ought to have been apparent to her, at least from September . 2010, that the pupil found her attentions “uncomfortable” and that his . relationships with his peers were affected because of them.' The panel added: 'By acting as she . did, Ms Rayne demonstrated a serious lack of professional judgment that . had the very real potential not only to damage her own professional . reputation but also the reputation of the school and the profession as a . whole.' The Education Secretary Michael Gove . backed the panel's call for a ban. He said: 'The conduct and behaviour . of Ms Rayne falls significantly short of that expected of a teacher.' The decision means Miss Rayne is . banned from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth . accommodation or children's home in England. She may apply for the ban to be set aside, but not until May 2018. She has a right of appeal.","Catherine Rayne joined the Michael Hall School, Sussex, in September 2009 .

Anzor Tsarnaev told The Associated Press on Sunday that he is 'really sick' and his blood pressure had spiked. Tsarnaev said last week that he planned to travel from Russia to the U.S. with the hope of seeing his younger son, who is under arrest, and burying his elder son, who was killed in a clash with police. The news comes days after it was revealed that the suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, was placed on a CIA watchlist 18 months before the marathon attack. Scroll down for video . Ailing: Anzor Tsarnaev, the father of Boston Marathon bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, says that he is 'really sick' and his blood pressure had spiked, forcing him to cancel a trip to the U.S. Staying put: Anzor Tsarnaev says he is postponing a trip to the United States because of poor health . Defiant: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the two Boston bombing suspects, speaks at a news conference as the suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev listens in Makhachkala . Tsarnaev confirmed that he is staying . in Chechnya, a province in southern Russia, but did not specify whether . he had been hospitalized. Until Friday, he and the suspects' mother had been living in the neighboring province of Dagestan. The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva claimed she had to call an ambulance for him on Thursday but did not elaborate on what happened. It was revealed last week that both parents have left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia. She was never planning to accompany her husband to the U.S. because she faces felony shoplifting charges here. On April 25, the parents held a bizarre press conference in which . they claimed that the gruesome carnage of the Boston attacks, which killed . three people and injured more than 250, were staged by the U.S. government. Enraged: Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife Zubeidat gesture at the gathered journalists at the press conference alongside the bombing suspects' aunt Patimat Suleymanova . 'America took my kids away from me,' she cried. 'I’m sure my kids were not involved in anything.' The mother of the suspected bombers, . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, went so far as to . claim that the blood covering the streets after the blasts was in fact . paint. The couple's eldest son, Tamerlan, was killed . in a police shootout last Friday and Dzhokhar was taken into custody - alive, but badly injured - less than 24 hours later in Watertown, Massachusetts following a massive manhunt. After spending nearly a week in a Boston . hospital recovering from gunshot wounds sustained during a firefight . with police, Dzhokhar was transferred . to the Federal Medical Center Devens on Friday. He has been charged in the marathon attacks and is facing a maximum sentence of the death penalty or life in prison. Hysteria: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the two Boston bombing suspects, speaks at a news conference as her sister-in-law, Mayam, looks on . The Tsarnaev family emigrated to the U.S. a decade ago, but both parents returned to Russia last year. The father said Thursday that he was planning to travel to the U.S. as soon as Friday, but hadn't yet bought a plane ticket. Banging the table in front of him, . Anzor said: 'I am going to the United States. I want to say that I am . going there to see my son, to bury the older one. 'I don't have any bad intentions. I don't plan to blow up anything. I am not angry at anyone. I want to go find out the truth.' Zubeidat also described a figure known only as 'Misha' - who has been pinpointed as a source of radicalization for her son Tamerlan. She said that he was a 'very nice man,' of Armenian origin and living in Boston. 'Misha' is also apparently a convert to the Islamic faith. Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs at the historic race on April 15 . Anzor . has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities - and . would face further interviews if he ever gets to the U.S. Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaev launched into a bizarre rant in . which she claimed she would not care if she or her youngest son were killed . by U.S. authorities. 'If they are going to kill him, I don't . care,' she told CNN of Dzhokhar. 'My oldest one is killed, so I don't care. I don't care is my . youngest one is going to be killed today. I want the world to hear this. And I don't care if I am going to get killed too. And I will say . Allahu akbar!' Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store . She said that . the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, . adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.' U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings. ABC News reported last week that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest. If she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she . could be arrested on an outstanding warrant. Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store. She was charged with two . counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after . allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, . Mass. location in June 2012. She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up. The Lord & Taylor location is . not the same as the one on Boylston Street in Boston, where a . surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son . dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack. The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen . pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to . speaking with anyone. Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus . 'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.' The images and video she is referring to were taken by a resident of Watertown, Mass. and posted on his blog. They appear to show two men taking shelter behind a vehicle and taking aim at police . officers. The men are then . seen hauling out a pressure cooker bomb from a car and detonating it, filling the . street with smoke. The photographs, taken on the . eyewitness's phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the . scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that . left one man dead. Authorities say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ended the firefight when he jumped in the car . - which the suspects had allegedly stolen earlier - and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he also ran over his brother Tamerlan. Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother,' she said. She added to CNN that she had spoken . to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved . her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat. Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, . Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying . that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes. The statement read: 'Our heart goes . out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many . innocent people hurt after such a callous act. Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . 'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused. 'We . don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation . and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during . this difficult time.' The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya.

A benefits cheat caught hula dancing on holiday after claiming to be wheelchair bound must pay more than £300,000 or face a longer prison sentence. Abdul Esfandmozd, 52, will have  at least five years added to his four-year sentence if he does not pay  the money. He claimed to be disabled for ten years, pocketing nearly £100,000 in benefits, but was caught out when council  officers noticed fake names on records he was meant to keep of money he  spent on carers. 'Living a lie': Abdul Esfandmozd, 52, pocketed public money meant for carers and spent it on exotic holiday and building a property empire . Scam: A raid on his home uncovered pictures of him on holiday hula dancing, diving into a pool and lifting a woman up, as well as home videos of him walking long distances . In August, Esfandmozd was found guilty of fraud, obtaining money by deception and entering into a money laundering arrangement. He had to reappear before Portsmouth Crown Court to hear a judge’s verdict on how the money  he made with his scam should be recouped. Despite being exposed as a cheat, Esfandmozd still insisted on using his wheelchair to attend the hearing. Judge Sarah Munro QC  ruled that his total gain  through crime was £318,593.21 and gave him nine months to pay up. She repeatedly had to ask him to be quiet as he shouted ‘I still trust British justice’ from the back of the court. The sum includes £140,000 from the Department for Work and Pensions that he was not prosecuted for and the profits for two properties that he bought with his ill-gotten money. Out for a stroll: He was found guilty of two counts of fraud, two of obtaining money by deception and three of entering into a money laundering arrangement . Whale of a time: Despite being outed as a liar, Esfandmozd still insisted on using his wheelchair to attend the hearing at Portsmouth Crown Court . Michael Lawther, solicitor  for Portsmouth City Council, said: ‘Esfandmozd stole a  substantial amount of money from taxpayers. We’re pleased we’ll be able to recover it.’ A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said that Esfandmozd’s property could be seized to pay the order. Between 2000 and 2010, Esfandmozd claimed £93,730  in disability payments from  the council. He said he was incapable of standing or walking without crutches and used an electric wheelchair to get around. He was supposed to spend the money on carers and neighbours were fooled by his supposedly modest lifestyle. But instead he took regular holidays to America, Cyprus and Malta and invested in property. The scam came to light  when council officers noticed paperwork for the care work he was supposed to be buying was not in order. Good times: Neighbours were fooled by his supposedly modest lifestyle, but meanwhile the conman was enjoying a luxury lifestyle . Forms on which he was meant to list carers’ names included former England goalkeeper P Shilton, athlete D Thompson and even a Mr D Duck. A raid of his flat in Somers Town, Hampshire, uncovered home videos of him on holiday,  dancing, swimming and even lifting a woman up. There were also six hours of home videos of him filmed on holiday in which he was shown walking long distances. Sentencing him, Judge Munro said: ‘You are in my view  one of the most dishonest  and manipulative individuals ever to have come before  this court.’","Abdul Esfandmozd exposed after holiday photos showed him in grass skirt .

Most children could look forward to a slice of birthday cake on their third birthdays, but when Zeq Caalim celebrates in July, he'll have to settle for ice chips. The toddler from Virginia Beach, Virginia has a rare condition that has left him allergic to all food and reliant on a feeding tube for nourishment. After breaking out in severe rashes, he was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis, also known as EOE, a rare condition where white blood cells attack food as a foreign object. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Two-year-old Zeq Caalim, pictured, is allergic to all food thanks to a rare condition and gets his nutrition through a feeding tube which he carries in a back pack, seen right . When he started drinking formula as a baby, he began breaking into the rashes and frantically itching his body, leaving him with dry, broken skin, his mother Kristine told Fox Baltimore. 'When I walked into the room when he was . sleeping, the room smelled like blood,' Kristine said, becoming emotional. 'Every single time I walked into . the room it just smelled like blood.' As they began introducing other foods into his diet, he would vomit and have trouble swallowing. The family was eventually sent to Johns Hopkins . in Baltimore where Zeq was diagnosed with the condition and fitted with a backpack carrying the feeding tube. Battling through: Zeq, pictured right with his sister, breaks out into a painful rash when he eats food . Support: Little Zeq, who is from Virginia, is pictured with his parents and his big sister Mia . Little Zeq has been diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE), an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. The condition is caused when a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens. They attack the foods, rather than allowing them to be ingested. As they build up, the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue, causing swallowing problems. It can be treated with modifying the diet to exclude certain foods, by taking steroid medications to reduce the swelling or by mechanically dilating the esophagus. EOE was only discovered in recent years so little is known about its exact cause. But he's not going through the ordeal alone; as well as the swarms of doctors, nurses, relatives and neighbors offering their support, he also has 'Tubey', a toy bear who has a matching feeding tube. He is now able to eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables, but he still gets rashes that make him . scratch all day and leave him with dry skin. But for other nutritional needs, he uses the feeding tube, which costs the family $2,400 after insurance. 'It's a little troubling, but we are making it through,' his mother told WAVY, adding that a recent fundraiser at the Confetti Cafe in Virginia Beach raised $2,663. The family, which includes Zeq's big sister Mia, said they hoped that the event would raise awareness of the disease. 'A . lot of those people had told me that they know somebody who might have . the same disease, or may have had the same disease and outgrew it,' Kristine said.

Rodney Wold, from Louisville, shouted from his porch: 'If you want to hunt something, hunt men', according to police. The dispute on Thursday started when Wold's neighbor was using an air rifle to scare rabbits away from his back garden.

Jacob Dismont, a baseball player at Nevada's Sierra Vista High School, changed his tires, added fake license plates as well as stickers to his SUV in the hours after killing 15-year-old Marcos Arenas on Thursday, according to police. Dismont allegedly dragged the boy to his  2002 Ford Explorer when he refused to let go of the Apple device on the side of the road. The boy was consequently dragged by the vehicle when it took off until he fell and became crushed by the tires. Behind bars: (from left) Jacob Dismont, 18, and Michael Solid, 21, have been arrested on charges of open murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery after a 15-year-old boy was killed while robbed of his iPad . Tragic end: Marcos Arenas was killed after he refused to release his new iPad from the thieves and was consequently pulled up to the speeding get-away vehicle and run over . Michael Solid, 21, who was a 2009 Sierra Vista dropout, is said to have been behind the wheel during the crime. He was also arrested on Saturday on charges of open murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. The Las Vegas Review Journal reports Dismont sent a text message to a friend identified as Brian Goodwin, declaring that his vehicle was 'hot' and the right side needed to be wiped down and painted. According to their alleged conversation, Goodwin and Dismont then decided that the vehicle should no longer be driven with it being the focus of a state-wide search. Dismont was pulled over by police while driving home on Saturday after police saw the Ford SUV masked with license plates belonging to a Mitsubishi. He has denied having seen Solid for at least a month before his arrest as well as having any part in the robbery. Solid was questioned by detectives after an anonymous tip to police. He admitted having been at the gas station Arenas was seen at but denied having been with Dismont. Birthday present: Arenas' father said that his family can't afford much so his son's birthday present of an iPad two months ago was a big deal which the young teen fought until the very end to not lose . Police say Solid's girlfriend told them he was with a guy named 'Jake' at the time of the boy's death. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie has called Arenas' death particularly tragic with the boy said to have received the iPad for his 15th birthday two months ago. His father, Ivan Arenas, said that his family has never had a lot so his son valued everything he had. 'From everything we know, his dad had to go deep inside his pockets to buy this thing for this kid, and this kid knew it,' Gillespie told the Journal. 'So he was going to hang onto that thing for dear life.' The iPad has not been recovered. According to investigators, Solid has an arrest record of possession of a stolen vehicle, petty larceny, robbery and assault. Dismont does not have any prior adult arrests. Arenas family spokeswoman Tabitha Guertler said family members are relieved by the arrests and grateful for the quick response by police and the public. She said: 'We're traumatized. Marcos' loss is something that will be with us forever. He was such an incredible person.' The oldest of 10 children in the family, the teen was a student at Bonanza High School. The attack occurred in the late afternoon about half a mile from the school.","Marcos Arenas, 15, was killed when he fell under SUV on Thursday .

The three young men who were last seen with a 20-year-old girl who disappeared after a late night of partying are now going on the offensive, saying that the girl's parents are harassing them for information about their daughter's whereabouts. Lauren Spierer, 20, vanished on June 3, 2011, following a night out with friends in downtown Bloomington, Indiana. There has been no sign of the young blonde woman for two years as her family have struggled with false leads and what they allege is a pact of silence among her friends. Now one of the young men who is seen carrying her out of a restaurant towards his house is saying that the Spierers are harassing him by repeatedly calling him demanding information that he claims he does not have. Missing: Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, 19, disappeared from Bloomington, Indiana, in June 2011. Police have few clues about her whereabouts . 'We’ve done nothing wrong. If we’d done something wrong, we would have been arrested already. All they’re doing is hurting my career,' said one of those men, Corey Rossman. 'It’s inappropriate the way they’re harassing people that are also victims in this case,' he told The Indianapolis Star. Rossman told the paper that he has had . to field phone calls from reporters, the Spierer's lawyers, and the . Spierers themselves, though the parents deny that they ever called the . young men themselves. Questions: The three young men last seen with Lauren refuse to cooperate with authorities . 'Rob and I have never spoken to Corey Rossman,' Lauren's mother Charlene said to the paper. 'The private investigators have never spoken to Corey. So I don’t know how it is we’re harassing him other than asking him to talk to the Bloomington police department. All of them.' Rossman is involved in the case is . because he accompanied Lauren to a bar, and then back to her apartment . at a building called Smallwood Plaza. While there, he was punched in the . face by another student. His . lawyer has previously said that Rossman does not remember anything . after the punch, but the building's surveillance footage shows Rossman . helping Spierer out of the building in the direction of his own . apartment. Rossman, his roommate Mike Beth, and their neighbor Jay Rosenbaum are the final three people to see her alive. The . article in the Indianapolis Star paints Rossman as defensive, as he . said the following when a reporter called him at work: 'What do you . think, I’m doing drugs now? No, I’m at work. Don’t ever call again. If . you contact me again, you’re going to hear from my lawyer. Either way, . you’re going to hear from my lawyer.' Her parents spoke out last spring, when their daughter was meant to be graduating. 'We’re experiencing a terrible strain.We miss Lauren terribly and the not . knowing makes it all the worse for us.,' her father Robert said at the time. Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating . Desperate search: Charlene Spierer, left, has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter Lauren . 'We think about her every day and . we talk about her every day. It’s not any easier today than it was two . years ago.' No arrests have been made in relation to the young woman's disappearance. Human . remains were recently found in a remote area of Indiana causing the . Spierer family further fears. Autopsy results are expected next week. The . search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When . the investigation began, five of her male friends, who police believed . could have offered insight into the final moments before her . disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully . cooperating with police. Speaking on Couric’s daytime talk show in December, Lauren’s parents said that their daughter’s friends are impeding the search for her. They hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence. ‘Despite their claims of doing whatever they could do, the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us…they refuse to take a police polygraph, which we feel is important for a number of reasons,’ Mr Spierer said. The television host also asked Lauren’s still-devastated mother if, more than a year after her daughter’s disappearance, she had any theories as to who might have taken her. ‘Our biggest dilemma is not knowing if it was a random abduction or if it was someone that Lauren knew,’ Charlene Spierer told Couric. Stonewalled: Lauren Spierer's parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer spoke with Katie Couric about their daughter's disappearance . She added that she now believes it to be someone who knew her daughter, based in part because of the lack of cooperation she and her husband have received from Lauren’s university friends. In Bloomington, a quiet college town that is known as one of the safest cities in America, the scars of Lauren's disappearance are visible even a year and a half later. Her smiling face is visible on posters plastered on street corners, hung around the campus and posted in nearly every bar, restaurant and shop downtown. Mr Spierer added that while he and his wife now think their daughter is dead, they still cling to hope. ‘I understand that Lauren may no longer be with us,’ he said. 'We ache for her. We want to bring her home.’",The 20-year-old should be graduating from Indiana University next month .

A couple have spoken of their disbelief after just one of their disabled identical twin sons, who both have Downs Syndrome, was granted vital disability benefits while the other was refused. Little Arthur and Alfie, both 10 months old, share the exact same medical conditions and need the same round-the-clock care. But a government ruling has found that only Arthur was entitled to Disability Living Allowance of £76 per week. Mum Emma Banks-Lowe, 33, said the decision had left her 'gobsmacked' because the boys, born just one minute apart, share exactly the same medical issues and require round-the-clock care. Twins Arthur (left) and Alfie (right), both 10 months old, who share the exact same medical conditions with mother Emma Banks-Lowe . Spot the difference: Emma Banks-Lowe with identical twins Arthur (left) who has qualified for disability benefits and and Alfie (right) who has been refused despite having exactly the same medical condition . Emma and her mechanic husband David, 45, of Kirkham, Lancs, said the benefits are vital for both of the boys who need daily physiotherapy, and require frequent hospital visits. They have identical heart, lung and eye complications and they are expected to have problems walking as they grow older. After making individual applications for DLA on behalf of the twins Emma and David said they were amazed to find that Arthur had been accepted for support and Alfie had been refused. Emma, a sports centre supervisor, who has three other children from a previous relationship, said at first she was so shocked she thought there must be a mistake. She said the only explanation the . family has received so far is that the officer who assessed Alfie felt . the tot did not need any more support than a normal 10-month-old. She . said: 'A specialist midwife told me about the help you can apply for, . so I sent off two applications for them six weeks ago. The applications . were identical, just like them, they had the exact same information on . them, I may as well have photocopied the first. Peas in a pod: Both boys have Downs Syndrome and need the same round-the-clock care, but a government ruling has found that only Arthur was entitled to Disability Living Allowance of £76 per week . Confusion: Emma's letters advising her that Arthur will get DLA (left) and Alfie wont (right) 'I now wish I had put them in the same envelope, but I needed to apply for them separately as individuals. 'I explained that they each needed 24-hour care, we have at least one hospital appointment each week, physio practice every day with the special equipment needed. They already have specialised chairs and tables at home because I need to carry out the physio on them every day. 'We also have sensory items and a SATs machine which monitors their breathing during the night. I attached all the proof of this. 'As they grow, they will obviously . need even more care and attention, so the £76 a week would help towards . the cost of all that. 'Two . weeks ago I received a letter back regarding Arthur which said he had . been accepted to receive the £76 a month towards his care. I . was so adamant that Alfie would get the same result that I actually . went into work and told them I could now work part-time because I was . then able, with the extra help, take care of my children at home myself, . since I know the specialist care and attention they need. Condition: The twins have identical heart, lung and eye complications and they are expected to have problems walking as they grow older . Treatment: Both of the boys need daily physiotherapy and require frequent hospital visits . A government ruling has found that only Arthur was entitled to Disability Living Allowance of £76 per week . 'But then I got a letter through a couple of days later and I was shocked to read that Alfie had been declined. I was absolutely flabbergasted. 'How could my two sons, who are . identical in every way, not receive the same help? Being accepted for . DLA and being registered disabled is essential to ensure you can then . continue being supported as they grow up, receiving extra carers and . equipment. 'When . they are three-years-old, they won’t be able to walk properly, as they . have problems with muscle deficiency, so we may need a disabled blue . parking badge to park closer to the shops - it’s these little things . that will make a massive difference to our lives. 'At first Dave laughed it off . thinking they must have got confused thinking we were claiming for the . same child, since the initials are the same. 'But . when I rang up about Alfie they said he wouldn’t need any more help . than any other child his age. What 10-month-old baby needs to have . physio every day? We have appointments every week - that is not normal . for children of their age. Bump: Mrs Banks-Lowe poses while pregnant with the twins . 'I then told the woman that bizarrely they had accepted my son’s identical twin for the allowance, who had the exact same issues. 'Her answer was that somebody would call back - within 14 days. She made me feel like I was someone who was ripping off the benefits system or something - we’ve worked every day since we could. 'It’s not good enough. What worries me is that if it was two children from two separate families, one could be accepted and the other not. It’s a lottery game - the staff are being inconsistent and I want to highlight that issue. They obviously do not go by the same criteria, which is wrong. 'Alfie actually has more problems than his brother - he has bad eyes and will probably need to wear glasses at a young age. 'We need a bigger house because there is five kids in here including them. We’re looking for somewhere with a garden so they can play outside. 'I just want my boys to have the best possible start in life and the same chance to do so. If they don’t develop properly now, then it could really have an effect on their future. The money would even help towards them going to special nursery classes before they head to school. I’m just so angry about the situation. They are identical twins, born a minute apart. 'I need to be with them every minute of the day, it’s not easy and it’s just going to get more demanding when they are older. I do find it an absolute pleasure to look after them, but to know the extra help is there would be a relief. 'I would give anything for my boys. I was told they will always need a carer throughout their entire lives, they will never be able to even cross the road without someone by their side. 'We only have a three up two down terrace at the moment, but we’ve had an offer. They have affected all aspects of our lives. I’ve had to give up my horse Jess in the last few months because I just don’t have the time anymore to ride her.' A Department of Work and Pensions spokesperson said that, while it was not possible to comment on specific cases, the claims would be checked to see if they had been assessed correctly. The spokesman said: 'Disability Living Allowance isn’t generally paid on the condition someone has, but because they have specific care and mobility needs. All young children have care and mobility needs, but parents can claim DLA for children who need a lot more help or supervision than other children of the same age. 'Anyone who disagrees with a decision can ask the Department to look at the case again, presenting any new evidence, or appeal.' Father David Banks-Lowe with his two sons . Disability charity Scope said the case highlights a 'shocking' flaw in the application process. A spokesman said: 'It certainly suggests it is a bit of a lottery when you put an application in. If these twins live in the same situation and their care needs are exactly the same then the outcome should have been the same for both boys. 'The fact that it wasn’t means there was either a blunder here, or different assessors are judging cases differently.' Disability living allowance is the main benefit for disabled people to help with the extra costs they face as a result of their disabilities. It was replaced last month for adults with the new Personal Independence Payment, but continues for under-16s.","Arthur and Alfie, both 10 months, share the exact same medical conditions .

The 48-year-old, who plays garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 series, stood in the dock before a packed courtroom. Appearing under his real name, Michael Turner, the soap star arrived for an eight-minute hearing at Manchester City Magistrates’ Court, just a few hundred yards from the Granada Studios where he has filmed for the past 30 years. Le Vell is charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity. The alleged sex offences all relate to one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told. Le Vell arrived flanked by minders and stood in the glass-panelled dock. The father-of-two, who wore a light grey suit, white shirt and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth. District Judge Khalid Qureshi asked Richard Gowthorpe, defending, if there was any indication of plea, to which Mr Gowthorpe replied: ‘No indication of plea other than the fact that the charges are contested, and will be fully contested in the crown court.’ Le Vell was bailed on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact witnesses and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 14. He left court looking tearful and distressed as members of the public looked on. The actor was first arrested at his £750,000 home in Hale, Cheshire, in September 2011 after a teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her. Scroll down for video .

A judge has been charged with stealing cocaine from evidence in cases he presided over in the US. Paul Pozonsky, 57, allegedly kept the confiscated drugs after asking police to bring them into the courtroom to be entered as evidence. In May 2012, state . police investigators looked at the evidence envelopes and discovered . cocaine was missing or had been tampered with. Some of the packets had been filled with baking soda and contained the Washington County judge's DNA. Mr Pozonsky - who established a drug treatment court designed to help people avoid jail for drug offences - resigned last year. He is facing a list of charges including theft, possession and misappropriation of entrusted property and was arraigned yesterday. His lawyer Bob Del Greco said: 'This is troubling. This is humbling as . you might expect. And it’s a serious matter and he’s . taking it as such.' On one occasion Mr Pozonsky allegedly called a police officer . handling a case and asked him to bring a haul that totalled more than 200 grams of cocaine to his chambers. Police officers testified that Mr Pozonsky often held onto drug evidence after he requested it for pretrial hearings, suggesting he would have amassed hundreds of grams of cocaine in addition to marijuana and tablets of Suboxone, a narcotic used to treat opioid addiction, in a filing cabinet in his chambers on the first floor of the Washington County Courthouse. On one occasion, he requested all evidence for a particular case but then returned items that were not drugs - including cash and a sword. The story attracted a flurry of comments on Facebook, including one by Michele Pozonsky who said:  'I married into the Pozonsky family 18 years ago, Paul's parents are the best people on the planet and he was raised in a good Christian family. 'I am not making excuses for him, if he did what they say, then I hope he does the time. But please don't judge the rest of us by him, every family has one ours just happens to be in the public eye.'

Friendly lip-smacks made by a large African monkey show striking similarities with human speech, say scientists. Geladas, close cousins of the baboon that only live in the remote mountains of Ethiopia, produce 'unnerving' sounds that can easily be mistaken for human voices. Researchers who analysed recordings of the vocalisations uncovered a structural rhythm that closely matched that of humans speaking. Scroll down for video . Researchers found that Geladas, close cousins of the baboon that only live in the remote mountains of Ethiopia, produce 'unnerving' sounds that can easily be mistaken for human voices . The gelada (Theropithecus gelada), sometimes called the gelada baboon, is found only in the Ethiopian Highlands, with large populations in the Semien Mountains. It spends much of its time foraging in grasslands. The species is also often referred to as the 'broken heart' because of distinctive red markings on its chest. They believe the evidence points to lip-smacking - a friendly behaviour displayed by many primates - being an evolutionary step towards speech. 'Our finding provides support for the lip-smacking origins of speech because it shows that this evolutionary pathway is plausible,' said lead scientist Prof Thore Bergman, from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, US. 'It demonstrates that non-human primates can vocalise while lip-smacking to produce speech-like sounds.' Prof Bergman became fascinated by the geladas' sounds while observing the monkeys in 2006. 'I would find myself frequently looking over my shoulder to see who was talking to me, but it was just the geladas,' he said. 'It was unnerving to have primate vocalisations sound so much like human voices.' Geladas are a highly gregarious species with a large vocal repertoire, expressed using complex facial movements. The . new research, reported in the journal Current Biology, showed that the . rhythm of gelada lip-smacking closely mirrored the gaps between . syllables in many human languages. The Gelada, or 'bleeding heart baboons are unique to the Ethiopian highlands, the so called Roof of Africa . In both, the rhythm corresponded to the opening and closing of parts of the mouth. Lip-smacking displayed by other primates does not have the same speech-like quality. Calls of other monkeys and apes typically consist of just one or two syllables and lack the geladas' rapid fluctuations in pitch and volume. Gelada lip-smacks are thought to . serve a similar purpose to 'small talk' between friends by helping to . bond individuals together. 'Many verbal exchanges appear to serve a function similar to lip-smacking,' said Prof Bergman. Vocal lip smacking might make sense as a precursor to language, Bergman says. Language is not just a great tool for exchanging information,' he said. 'It has a social function (small talk) and many verbal exchanges appear to serve a function similar to lip smacking.' Researchers tracked geladas in the Simien Mountains National Park in Ethiopia where they recorded the unusual sounds of this species . When geladas 'speak,' there aren't discernible English words, Bergman says. 'However, if you are with geladas, you sometimes get the impression that people are talking around you—something I hadn't noticed in years of working with other monkeys,' he said. Some other primates such as apes and monkeys produce complex sounds, but Bergman says they don't have the speech-like rhythm that geladas have.","Researchers found Geladas, close cousins of the baboon that only live in the remote mountains of Ethiopia, were often mistaken for humans .

The likelihood of adults developing obesity and many other health problems might be determined in the womb . The likelihood of adults developing obesity and many other health problems might be determined in the womb, according to a report published today. Women need to know that their weight and health during pregnancy, and before they conceive, plays a key part in securing a healthy long-term future for their children, the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) said. A BNF taskforce has been looking at aspects of nutrition and early life development, including the impact of a mother's health and eating habits on her baby even before conception. They concluded that obesity, asthma, allergies, cardiovascular disease and many more conditions might be handed on from the mother. Taskforce chairman Professor Tom Sanders said: ‘Evidence suggests that poor foetal growth, especially followed by accelerated growth in infancy, may be associated with long-term adverse consequences for health. ‘Poor foetal growth may also affect kidney development, making offspring more sensitive to the blood pressure raising effect of salt and, therefore, increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease.’ The report looks at the causes of obesity and concludes that the increased appetite some people have in adulthood compared with others might have also been programmed in the womb as a result of their mother's diet and weight. Almost half of women of child-bearing age in England are overweight or obese and this can be the cause of a biological cycle of maternal obesity leading to health issues for children in later life. Sara Stanner, science programme manager at BNF, said: ‘There is now unequivocal evidence to show the biological link between obesity and weight-related health issues in women and their children. ‘This is a very important message in the fight against obesity. Women need to know that their weight and health, during pregnancy and even before they conceive, plays a key part in securing a healthy long-term future for their children. ‘Once a baby is conceived, the biological framework for its future health is already set, so, where possible, women should look to improve their health status before they conceive. A major challenge the UK faces in addressing the obesity epidemic is the fact that around half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned.’ A mother's health could have far-reaching consequences, with a poor lifestyle contributing to obesity in childhood . Commenting on the publication of the report, Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said: ‘We look forward to this report with great interest. We know that good nutrition is incredibly important to the health of the pregnant woman and her developing baby. ‘Good nutrition in pregnancy can also have a significant impact on the health of the baby well into its adult life, and midwives are perfectly placed to stress the importance of a good diet before and during pregnancy. ‘Obesity is without doubt a problem and can have detrimental effects in pregnancy. It is an issue we need to tackle and midwives have a key role to play in helping obese women in their care, to promote better health in their pregnancy and beyond. This is a public health role of the midwife that is often overlooked and under-recognised. ‘We are desperately short of midwives in England and investment is needed in midwifery so that they can carry out this part of their work much more effectively, to the benefit of the public health of the nation. ‘These findings also show the value of preconception care and midwives can provide this as part of their care after birth in readiness for later pregnancies.’","British Nutrition Foundation says women need to know impact of health in pregnancy and before conception .

Cancer patients are to be provided with genetic tests to see whether their family members are also at risk of developing the disease. The ‘revolutionary’ test will be offered to sufferers to check if they - and in some cases, members of their family - are carrying mutated genes which make them genetically prone to certain forms of cancer. The significance of genetic testing was highlighted last week when Angelina Jolie revealed that she had a double mastectomy after discovering that she was carrying a rogue gene. Gene monitoring: Results will be used to assess the risk of inherited cancers and pick targeted drugs for the most effective personal treatment . The actress was told that had an 87 per cent of developing breast cancer due to the presence of the BRCA1 gene. The new test, being trialled on patients within the Royal Marsden Foundation Trust, will check for mutations linked to cancer in 97 genes, half of which are not currently tested by the NHS. Patients can then be given personalised treatment plans based on the results of the test. Doctors hope that in time the tests could become routine, helping identify those at highest risk of developing cancers due to the ‘predisposition genes’. Women could then be monitored and potentially given drugs to stop the disease from developing. The Institute of Cancer Research, which has developed the test alongside American genetics company Illumina, hope that it will eventually become available to all NHS patients after its trial next year. The institute’s head of genetics, Professor Nazneen Rahman, said that the NHS and Department of Health are ‘very supportive’ of the programme. Professor Rahman said: ‘It is very important to know if a mutation in a person’s genetic blueprint has caused their cancer. ‘It allows more personalised treatment, so for example such people are often at risk of getting another cancer and may choose to have more comprehensive surgery, or may need different medicines, or extra monitoring.’ She added: ‘It also improves the information available for relatives about their own cancer risks. Sometimes a relative is found to also have an increased risk of cancer, and screening or preventative measures can be employed. ‘Just as frequently, testing provides the reassuring news that a relative is not at increased risk of cancer and does not need interventions.’ Preventative: Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing cancer . Following Miss Jolie’s revelation, television presenter Kirstie Allsopp and her sister Sofie also described being told by a geneticist that they faced a one in three risk of developing breast cancer after their mother’s 26-year battle with the disease. Sofie, 32, underwent a preventative double mastectomy to remove both her breasts in 2010, followed by reconstructive surgery, while Kirstie, 41, has yet to decide whether to undergo the operation. Referring to the increased attention on genetic testing following the high-profile cases, Professor Rahman said: ‘We’re trying to develop processes that will allow comprehensive, systematic use of genetic information in cancer medicine, so the types of situations and families we were hearing about last week we hope will be able to benefit.’ Describing current NHS genetic testing as ‘limited’, Professor Rahman said that she hoped any patient who could benefit from the test will eventually have access to it. The test, which costs several hundred pounds to carry out, is currently being trialled on women with ovarian and breast cancer as part of a three-year programme. Risk: Kirsty Allsop was told by a geneticist that she faced a one in three chance of developing breast cancer . Professor Martin Gore, medical director of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said that cancer patients are increasingly demanding genetic information. He said: ‘Patients want to know. I am asked several times a day, particularly by women with ovarian cancer, is this hereditary? ‘There is no point in pretending that . patients do not want to know and be hidden from what we might find out. The whole thing can be done in a much more systematised, efficient and . kinder way for the patient.’ Professor . Gore added: ‘This programme has been set up to work out the systems and . the processes that we need in clinics to give patients and families . this information – to start the ball rolling and talk about family . risk.’ Breakthrough . Breast Cancer’s Dr Caitlin Palframan said: ‘This programme has a lot of . potential as this type of testing may help lay the ground for more . personalised treatment for people with breast cancer. ‘In . order to match the right treatment to the right woman, we will need to . be able to test women quickly to find out the individual characteristics . of their specific cancer. ‘We . know that targeted treatment is the way forward for breast cancer, and . this is something that Breakthrough Breast Cancer is working towards, so . we are looking forward to seeing the results of the programme. ‘It . is vital however that appropriate genetic counselling is offered if . this testing is likely to identify any genetic risks within the person’s . family and we hope that this is being considered.’","Revolutionary test will be able to check for mutations linked to cancer .

Extremist: Anjem Choudary warned today there could be more 'lone wolf' attacks as he blamed British troops in Afghanistan for the slaughter of a soldier . Hate preacher Anjem Choudary today blamed the continuing presence of British troops in Afghanistan for the slaughter of a soldier in Woolwich. The extremist claimed he attended the same mosque as terror suspect Michael Adebolajo, 28, who was reportedly one of the two men arrested in connection with the brutal killing. Choudary, who in the past has planned to . disrupt the minute's silence on Remembrance Sunday, said there could be . more 'lone wolf' attacks. The off-duty serviceman was hacked to death in broad daylight in south-east London yesterday just 200 yards from the Royal Military Barracks. Clutching a bloodied meat cleaver, the . man suspected of executing the soldier declared: 'you . and your kids will be next'. Hate preacher Choudary today blamed the war in Afghanistan for the brutal killing. He said: 'We must concentrate on why this incident took place. 'That is the presence of British . forces in Muslim countries and the atrocities they’ve committed, and how . the Muslim community in this country are under pressure due to . draconian laws which have tried to silence them.' However, Choudary today described Adebolajo as a man of 'impeccable character'. The suspect and his unnamed accomplice are believed to have run down the soldier with a Vauxhall Tigra as he walked back to the Woolwich Barracks at 2.20pm yesterday, crushing his body against a road sign. Witnesses said the terror suspects then 'hacked and chopped' at his body like 'crazed animals', before dragging his corpse into the middle of the road leaving a trail of blood. Listen to the interview below . Murder scene: With blood on his hands, suspect Michael Adebolajo, 28, declares 'your children will be next' in a clip filmed just after the soldier had been killed . Changed man: Suspect Michael Adebolajo is said to have been radicalised in 2003 as a schoolboy and his parents became so concerned they moved him away . As they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting 'Allah Akbar!’ – an Islamic phrase meaning ‘God is great’ - and yelling 'this is what God would have wanted'. A blood-soaked man identified as Adebolajo, who was still holding a number of weapons in his red-stained hands, then ranted on camera in a clear London accent saying: 'You people will never be safe' before telling a passer-by they had not fled because they were waiting to 'shoot the police'. Within 20 minutes armed officers arrived and the fundamentalists charged at them wielding firearms, knives and a machete. Police opened fire, shooting six bullets, leaving one seriously injured. The pair remain under armed guard in two separate London hospitals. Choudary claimed to have known the suspect from Mulgrave Primary school, which is located next to the scene of the massacre. Murder scene: Two bouquets of flowers are left near the scene in Woolwich, south-east London, today following the brutal killing . Speaking to Channel 4 News, he said the man he knew as Mujahid had converted to Islam in 2003. 'I can see from the clip yesterday . that one of them is brother Mujahid. He's a revert to Islam... He used . to attend a few years ago some of the activities that we had - . demonstrations, processions and some of the lectures,' he said. Mr Choudary said he did not think . Mujahid was a member of any political organisations, and that he mainly . attended activities that were open to the public. 'As far as I'm aware he was a normal, . practising Muslim, concerned about the Muslim affairs worldwide and he . believed that there's a covenant of security in fact: that in return for . our life and wealth being protected, we're not allowed to target the . life and wealth of those with whom we live,' the former Al Muhajiroun . leader added. 'He's a very nice man - I believe . he's a family man. He's a very calm and non-violent man. As you can see . from the clip yesterday he was concerned and apologising to any women . and children who were there.' He said: 'I saw the pictures of him last night, his name is Michael Adebolajo. Community in grief: A group of women lay flowers outside the barracks today after the horrific murder . 'I went to the same primary school as him in Woolwich, Mulgrave, and grew up in the same area and he came to the local mosque - it was a peaceful community with lots of Muslim people from Somalia and Pakistan. I didn’t know him that well so I can’t say where his family was from.' Choudary led Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun, the banned forerunner to Islam 4 UK, where Adebolajo often appeared alongside other radical protesters. Mr Choudary continued: 'He converted around 2003 to Islam, before I met him and I knew him as his convert name ""Mujaheed"" when he used to attend our demonstrations and lectures. 'I last saw him in 2011, he was a very nice man with impeccable character and nothing unusual about him.' Killing: The other suspect, who appears to be holding a knife, is confronted by cub scout leader Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48, after the soldier was murdered . Probe: Police forensic officers arrive at the scene of the brutal murder in south-east London yesterday where a British army soldier was stabbed to death . Forensics: A scenes of crime officer photographs evidence near the scene in Woolwich yesterday following the murder . Choudary claims that he was 'making his voice heard' with his rant after the attack. He said: 'What he did was unusual and it’s not the kind of view that I propagate and I do not condone the use of violence, but those views are out there. 'Some members of the Muslim community struggle to express themselves and he is making his voice heard in blood.' Choudary suggested that it was possible the attack was motivated by the Government's foreign policy in the Muslim world, and that this may not have been an isolated incident. He said: 'We are a very politicised community. Some people are angered by draconian measures such as ‘stop and search’ and restrictions on free speech. Murder scene: The wrecked Vauxhall Tigra car which hit the soldier as he walked along the pavement and crushed him against the road sign (left) Army base: The brutal killing happened just 200 yards from the Woolwich Royal Artillery Barracks in south-east London . 'There is a chance of more lone wolf attacks happening again due to these draconian measures. 'If you want to condemn anyone it’s the British Government, this is one death but if you add up the number of people killed and tortured by the British Government it is in the millions.' The two men are thought to be British citizens with Nigerian connections who had converted to a radical form of Islam. Prime Minister David Cameron said today that the attack 'sickens us all' and was a 'betrayal of Islam'. Speaking outside Downing Street, he said the attack would bring the UK together and 'make us stronger'. 'The people who did this were trying to divide us. They should know something like this will only bring us together and make us stronger,' he said. Condemnation: David Cameron, pictured in Woolwich with local MP Nick Raynsford, today said the attack would bring the UK together and 'make us stronger' 'This country will be absolutely resolute in its stand against violent extremism and terror. We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms. 'This view is shared by every community in our country. This was not just an attack on Britain and on the British way of life; it was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country. 'There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act.' He said the best response was for everyone to 'go about our normal lives'. The Muslim Council of Britain described the attack as 'a truly barbaric act'. They said in a statement: 'This is a truly barbaric act that has . no basis in Islam and we condemn this unreservedly. Our thoughts are . with the victim and his family. 'We . understand the victim is a serving member of the Armed Forces. Muslims . have long served in this country’s Armed Forces, proudly and with . honour. 'This attack on a member of the Armed Forces is dishonourable, and no cause justifies this murder.' A growing pile of flowers and cards have been left outside Woolwich army barracks, just yards from where the soldier was killed. One military family who left flowers wrote: 'To a hero taken from us too soon, may you rest in peace. Always in our hearts, Martin, Faye and Hope, fellow soldier family.' Another wrote: 'Much love and respect to a true hero so savagely taken from us. RIP Dan, Kellie, JJ and Clark, a fellow soldier.' Among the growing pile of floral tributes are two small wooden Remembrance Day wooden crosses with a single red poppy attached. One read: 'In remembrance of the soldier killed in Woolwich, God Bless.'","Anjem Choudary claims he knows suspect Michael Adebolajo, 28 .

Bob is the most expensive sheepdog ever sold . A sheepdog has bounded into the record books after being sold for nearly £10,000 at auction. Border collie Bob became the most expensive working sheepdog in the world when a bidder agreed to hand over £9,240 for him. The staggering price smashed the previous record for an official sale, set at £8,400 in October last year. Retired farmer and champion dog trainer John Bell, 82, bought Bob as a 13-week-old pup, for £315. Now, at 15 months, he has become Mr Bell's third record-breaking sale in three years. Mr Bell, of Howden, East Yorkshire, said: 'He has been working since he was nine months old. He is a natural and I was expecting a lot of him. 'He has a brilliant character but it wasn't his character he was bought for, it's his ability. 'His ability made him stand out. He is a very good dog. Everybody who saw him thought the same.' The farmer described Bob as 'one of the best I've seen', adding: 'One of the biggest skills is spotting the potential in a young dog. 'Young dogs are like children, some learn quicker than others, but the aim is to produce an outstanding one.' Mr Bell started training sheepdogs as a teenager, selling them to local farmers for between £15 and £20. 'I realised I had a bit of knack for it, but gave up when I started farming on my own in Lancashire,' he said. 'When I retired 15 years ago I started training sheepdogs again as a hobby, and it has turned into a passion.' Bob went under the hammer at auction for £9,240 to a mystery buyer . He did not seem surprised by the high . price, saying: 'All this fuss for an expensive dog, but what do people . spend on their hobbies, like golf? People spend tens of thousands on . their hobbies.' The name of the winning bidder at . Skipton Auction Mart is not known, but it is thought Bob is destined for . life in the United States.

The Queen said last night that she was ‘humbled’ by the reaction to her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, as more than a million cheering wellwishers surged into The Mall to pay their respects. Indeed, so moved was the monarch by the unbridled public euphoria surrounding four remarkable days of national festivities, that she chose, almost on the spur of the moment, to make a rare public address. Filmed just before the start of Monday night’s Diamond Jubilee concert and broadcast around the globe yesterday evening, the Queen said she was ‘deeply touched’ at the way the celebrations  had brought communities around the country together.

The Queen's speech in full: . The events that I have attended to mark my Diamond Jubilee have been a humbling experience. It has touched me deeply to see so many thousands of families, neighbours and friends celebrating together in such a happy atmosphere. But Prince Philip and I want to take this opportunity to offer our special thanks and appreciation to all those who have had a hand in organising these Jubilee celebrations. It has been a massive challenge, and I am sure that everyone who has enjoyed these festive occasions realises how much work has been involved. I hope that memories of all this year’s happy events will brighten our lives for many years to come. I will continue to treasure and draw inspiration from the countless kindnesses shown to me in this country and throughout the Commonwealth. Thank you all. She also expressed her gratitude to all those who had helped to organise events, including Sunday’s River Pageant, and concluded: ‘I hope that memories of all this year’s happy events will brighten our lives for many years to come. ‘I will continue to treasure and draw inspiration from the countless kindnesses shown to me in this country and throughout the Commonwealth. Thank you all.’ The last time the Queen addressed the nation outside her annual Christmas speech was following the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Filming took place in the private Presence Room at Buckingham Palace, with one of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s official engagement portraits behind her. The Queen wore a pale blue day dress by Karl Ludwig Couture and her stunning Cartier aquamarine and diamond clips, which were an 18th birthday present from her parents in 1944. Aides said she made the decision to film her address only last Wednesday after witnessing the groundswell of public support in the run-up to the Jubilee weekend. She also stoically chose to go ahead hours after her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, was taken to hospital with a bladder infection. The couple have been married for 64 years and the Queen openly credits him as being her ‘strength and stay’ for the six decades of her reign. Her husband was clearly on her mind throughout yesterday’s Jubilee Ceremonial Day which saw her attend a National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral before a carriage procession through the streets of London and a fly-past over Buckingham Palace. As she stepped on to the balcony at the palace to a deafening roar of applause, she turned to her grandson Prince William and said wistfully: ‘I wish Philip were here.’ 'Countless kindnesses': The Queen is joined by Prince Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, one of several events held today to end the celebrations .

Grand finale: The Red Arrows perform a flypast for the Queen over Buckingham Palace watched by a thrilled crowd below . Then, as the National Anthem echoed out, the normally restrained sovereign appeared to blink back tears. Yesterday’s balcony scene was a tight-knit affair with just the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry present. It was markedly different from the Queen’s Golden and Silver Jubilees, when more than 30 royals appeared with her at the palace. Sources suggested it was a conscious effort by the sovereign to focus attention on her immediate successors. Prime Minister David Cameron summed up the mood of the nation when he said the celebrations had shown the ‘best of Britain’. He hailed the Queen as ‘a real . inspiration’, and, in a reference to the Duke of Edinburgh’s illness and . the wet weather, praised the ‘great resilience’ of both the sovereign . and her subjects. He said: . ‘I think what we’ve seen, frankly, is the best of Britain. We’ve seen . people coming together in tremendous unity and spirit to celebrate the . Queen’s jubilee, but we’ve also seen a great resilience; people wanting . to celebrate, even though the weather’s been pretty bad, and an . extraordinary resilience on behalf of Her Majesty, who in spite of all . the problems and difficulties has kept going, and with such incredible . spirit. She’s a real inspiration.’ US . President Barack Obama, with whom the Queen has developed a warm . relationship, sent a video message from the White House, saying: ‘While . many presidents and prime ministers have come and gone, Your Majesty’s . reign has endured.’ The .

A cancer patient has had her jaw put back together with a bike chain-like implant after the bone was eaten away by a tumour. Liese Healing, 49, a mother-of-two from Rugby, Warwickshire, lost half her jaw to the disease after being diagnosed last July. She was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw after her teeth started to fall out and she suffered from jaw pain. Ms Healing, who also beat ovarian cancer in 2005, had to undergo a 12-hour operation to repair her jaw at University Hospital in Coventry. A titanium metal less likely to be rejected by the body was used for the ‘chain’ which is attached to her bone using screws. Following the surgery, Ms Healing spent a month in hospital recovering from the operation and learning to use her new jaw. She had to learn how to eat and speak again while she underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She finally finished her cancer treatment on December 28. Ms Healing, who is mother to Jonno, 28, and Katie, 20, said: ‘Doctors told me I could die in the operation but I had survived one cancer when my children were little and I wasn’t going to let this one beat me. ‘At times it was really difficult to keep positive but I wanted to show my kids their mum was going to be ok. ‘I am so grateful to all of the hospital staff who have helped me so much.’ World-leading head and neck surgeons Dr Gary Walton and Dr Raj Sandhu used a titanium chain - which looks like a bike chain –to hold the reconstructed jaw together after the diseased tissue was removed. This tissue was replaced with skin grafts from the school science technician’s arm and another graft was also used from her stomach to replace tissue taken from the arm, the Coventry Telegraph reports. Doctors used a 'bike chain' implant to reconstruct her jaw during a 12-hour operation at University Hospital, Coventry . Following surgery she spent a month in hospital learning to eat and speak again. She also had to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy . She said: ‘The jaw’s still sore. But considering what the doctors have done, it’s good. ‘I wasn’t sure at first, when the doctors asked me, but I just wanted to get rid of the cancer obviously, and so just let them get on with it really.’ Dr Walton said: ‘Unfortunately, Liese’s story is not an unusual one. The diseased tissue in Ms Healing's jaw was removed and replaced with a graft from her arm, the wound in her arm was then repaired using a graft from her stomach . Ms Healing says she is extremely grateful to Dr Gary Walton and Dr Raj Sandhu who carried out the operation which saved her life . ‘We are seeing an increase in the number of patients with jaw cancer because they don’t know the symptoms and they think it only affects older people. ‘Liese is living proof that anyone can be affected and was very lucky that her dentist referred her to see a specialist when he did. ‘Anyone who has a persistent mouth ulcer or mouth wound that won’t heal should go to see their GP to be on the safe side.’","Liese Healing, 49, was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw in July 2012 .

The friends and family of a wealthy socialite, found murdered in his £2million home, have described him as 'too trusting' as they reveal fears that many were 'after his money.' Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered with a gash to his head in a pool of blood by his maid in the kitchen of his luxury rented Mayfair flat. A post-mortem examination confirmed he died of head injuries and police are now investigating. His mother, Marie, 83, has described her son as 'one in a million' but said there had been a 'terrible change in circumstances' after the death of his late partner, architect and interior designer Anthony Feldman - whose clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken. Trusting: Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much' Murder probe launched: The body of Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered at his luxury flat in this apartment block in Mount Street, Mayfair . The couple were the first to become civil partners, and the ceremony was held just a month before Mr Feldman’s death at 52. Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much'. Sean . McGuigan, who had known Mr Troyan since 2006, told the Evening Standard he thought . many who were around the socialite were after his money and that his . home contained many expensive antiques, including a £100,000 vase. He said he was 'too trusting', and added: 'He would lavish gifts on people and was quite carefree with his money.' Mrs Troyan told the paper that Mr Feldman had been the love of her son's life. She said: 'When you are in love with someone they can become your world and that was how it was with Robert. He lost his support network.' Before Mr Feldman’s death, the couple . were famed for their lavish Mayfair dinner parties where guests said the . champagne was ‘always chilled and ready to open’. The Met Police said it was still appealing for witnesses and said that officers could not confirm whether anything had been taken from the flat at this point in the investigation. Mr Troyan is believed to have spoken . to his maid by phone only two hours before his body was found last . Friday afternoon. After making the grim discovery when she arrived at . the mansion block at 4pm, she collapsed on her knees in hysterical . screams. The building's caretaker said retired American Mr Troyan's regular cleaner was 'uncontrollable' after finding his body on Friday afternoon . A source at the block said: ‘It was a head wound, there was blood pouring on the floor. ‘Workmen working above – they are . doing a new kitchen – heard her screaming and shouting. The workmen said . they didn’t touch his body, but could tell that he wasn’t breathing.’ ‘His cleaner was inconsolable. The . police had to take her to the police station, and she was on her hands . and knees crying her eyes out.’ The source said Mr Troyan was always . friendly but ‘would often be visited by strange men, at all times of the . day and night’, at the flat, which he rented. Black bags removed from the flat every . morning could be heard ‘rattling with bottles’. He added: ‘One guy who . visited was staggering a lot. This was in the afternoon.

An academic who claims to have fathered 49 children as a sperm donor has been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting women he promised to help become pregnant. Professor Gennadij Raivich was accused by two women in their twenties, one of whom is believed to be pregnant with his child. Detectives have since identified a third alleged victim. Gennadij Raivich . The neuroscientist, an expert on . maternal and foetal medicine, is believed to have advertised as a sperm . donor online. Raivich, 50, who leads a research group for University . College, London, is also thought to have three children with a partner . in Germany. Interviewed in January under a pseudonym, he told a newspaper that he had fathered 49 children by private sperm donations. To reduce the risk of . biologically-related offspring meeting and reproducing, donors can only . provide sperm to ten families under British law. But it is not known whether all the children Raivich claims to have fathered were conceived in this country. Raivich, using a pseudonym, reportedly . said: ‘I think this is just based on moral horror, not that there is . much risk offspring will accidentally meet and set up homes with . half-siblings. The risks of this are very low. In America there is no . restraint on the number of children a donor can father and in the . Netherlands it’s 25 per donor. ‘The recipients I’ve helped are aware of the number of women I’ve helped.’ Sperm donors in Britain can provide for a maximum of ten families, according to regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Donors need permission from the HFEA to exceed the limit, but there is no cap on the number of children who can be born to a family using the sperm. Many women go to clinics where each donation can cost thousands of pounds and it may take more than one attempt to get pregnant. There are no reliable figures on how many turn to private donors instead. Not all clinics let those seeking donors select sperm on the basis of looks, personality and academic ability. This is another reason why recipients may choose a private donor.In 2005, sperm donors lost the right to remain anonymous. Some fear this deters them or encourages them to only agree to private donations, rather than through official channels. Raivich met women in London and . Norfolk through unlicensed donor websites, going by the name of Frank . Qalman and advertising his services as an artificial insemination donor. In his online profile he writes: ‘I am mid-40s... Jewish (Ashkenasi) and married with 3 children of my own, based in London, UK. ‘Lookwise I have black hair and green . eyes, but am heterozygote for child blonde hair and blue eyes – approx . half the children look that way. I do think children are fun, and enrich . life, and so would be happy to donate to a lesbian couple, hetero . couple or someone single. ‘I am 165cm/70kg, with black hair and green/brown eyes. I enjoy travel.’ Raivich, who grew up in New Zealand . and came to London in 2001, said he offered his services both as a donor . and as a doctor as he wanted to give the gift of parenthood. He added: ‘I am most proud of the donation I made to a woman who had spent £5,000 through an official clinic. ‘It failed so she came to me and I helped her get pregnant for free.’ Raivich, who has been bailed by . police, told the paper that being a donor was ‘like a hobby or a . charitable act’ and he ‘got satisfaction by helping’. He added: ‘The . first couple I helped were lesbians who were desperate for a baby and I . helped them get pregnant on their first cycle. ‘They were delighted and I shared their joy. ‘They come to these sites because they can’t afford the substantial cost of getting a donor through a clinic. ‘I never ask for money, only travel expenses.’ The Met Police said it was investigating alleged incidents of sexual assault by penetration in two counties. A spokesman said: ‘Two women attended . Holborn police station on February 28 to allege they had been assaulted . between November 2012 and February 2013. ‘A third alleged victim has since been identified by police. A 50-year-old man was arrested on March 1.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","50-year-old sperm donor suspected of assaulting three women who he was going to help become pregnant .

The first big battle Margaret Thatcher faced over the Falklands was not against Argentina but with some of her own MPs, secret documents reveal. While the Conservative Party presented a united front, briefing notes prepared for the Prime Minister show the level of opposition and discontent the Iron Lady faced from within. The papers, released today by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust, reflect the turmoil within the party following Argentina's surprise invasion of the British dependency on April 2, 1982. While some urged instant reprisals, . others, including Ken Clarke, then a junior minister, cautioned against . all-out war in the South Atlantic. Negotiations were continuing at the . United Nations even as Britain assembled a Task Force which 74 days . later would retake the islands. In a briefing note on April 6, the . Chief Whip Michael Jopling wrote to new Foreign Secretary Francis Pym: . 'You may like to have general reaction to events in the Falkland . Islands.' The opinions of Mr Clarke, along with . Sir Timothy Raison, MP for Aylesbury, were described as: 'Hopes nobody . thinks we are going to fight the Argentinians. We should blow up a few . ships but nothing more.' Tory 'wet' Sir Ian Gilmour said: 'We are making a big mistake. It will make Suez look like common sense.' Stephen Dorrell was described as . 'very wobbly – will only support the fleet as a negotiating ploy. If . they will not negotiate we should withdraw.' Five MPs urged Mrs Thatcher to 'keep calm' adding 'we can get away without a fight' while others were 'all taking a hard line' and West Devon MP Peter Mills warned: 'My constituents want blood'. Scroll down for video . Chief Whip's note revealed the divided opinions within the Tory . party over how to respond to the invasion of the Falklands. Reactions . range from: 'My constituents want blood to 'We must try and get away . without a fight' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher meets personnel aboard the HMS Antrim in 1983 during her five-day visit to the Falkland Islands . British PM Margaret Thatcher out for in a Union Jack-flying Challenger tank during maneuvers at NATO training ground near Falling Bostel . The papers show that some of her most . loyal advisers – including John Hoskyns, David Wolfson and Alan Walters . – discussed plans that included selling off the Falklands. Historian . Chris Collins, from the trust – set up to administer Baroness . Thatcher's papers – said: 'These papers reveal how stressful this . situation was, it was a massive undertaking which tested her to the . full. In the early days of the conflict there was great confusion and . doubt. We might have expected her to be breathing fire. She's not. She's . always making the case.' The files contain a strongly-worded letter she never sent to the then-US President Ronald Reagan that showed her frustration at attempts by the Americans and her own Cabinet to offer a ceasefire,  abandoning the principle that the Falkland islanders should choose their own destiny. Margaret Thatcher felt betrayed by close ally Ronald Reagan (pictured here over lunch on June 6, 1982 at the Palace of Versailles) who tried to persuade her to offer a ceasefire . A hand-written note also appears to show Lady Thatcher grappling with how to justify the Duke of York's deployment as part of the task force sent to retake the Falklands amid fears that the Queen’s third child could be killed in action. The note, prepared after April 2, 1982, possibly in preparation for a speech or press conference, shows that she settled on a brief but broadly supportive position. 'If asked about Prince Andrew it is the express wish of The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and of Prince Andrew himself, that if the Invincible sails he sails with her,' she wrote. The . papers also show that Mrs Thatcher barely annotated a Falklands report . by defence chiefs in September 1981– a sign that, six months before the . invasion, she did not sense any problems. This was largely down to the fact . that British intelligence had wrongly informed her that 'the Argentine . government would prefer to pursue their sovereignty claim by peaceful . means.' What's more, . senior defence officials discouraged confrontation, fearing not only the . expense but also the risk of actually losing. A hand-written note by Lady Thatcher appears to show how she grappled with her response to the Duke of York's deployment as part of the Falklands task force . In a secret memo from defence chiefs to the Prime Minister, they said: 'Such a deployment would be very expensive....Their geographical advantage and the relative sophistication of their armed forces would put our own task group at serious risk.' The day after Argentina’s invasion of the remote British territory in the South Atlantic on April 2 1982, 22-pages of notes taken by Lady Thatcher's parliamentary aide Ian Gow, during a meeting with stunned backbenchers, reveal MPs' anger at the Foreign Office who they accused of giving wrong information to the Commons. Cabinet member Sir Humphrey Atkins famously told the House that an attack was not imminent, hours after Argentinian forces had taken Port Stanley. 'How could even an office boy at the FO say this?', the MP John Carlisle asked him to 'prolonged cheers'. The . files reveal how the responsibility of sending forces to the Falklands . weighed heavily on her shoulders, as well as her frustration with  the . BBC's failure to provide balanced reporting. They also contain large . amounts of her personal correspondence. All the files being released can be seen at www.margaretthatcher.org . Mrs Thatcher spent at least half an hour every day with a hairdresser, . even while on foreign trips, and planned her outfits well in advance, . the papers reveal. Staff had spent months planning an opulent banquet in Beijing in late 1982 to smooth diplomatic relations between Britain and China ahead of negotiations over the return of Hong Kong. But that didn't stop Mrs Thatcher trying to keep shark's fin and sea slugs off the menu – apparently for reasons of cost, not squeamishness. The British ambassador intervened to say such local delicacies would be 'conspicuous by their absence', the papers reveal. Sir Percy Cradock accused the PM of 'drastic economies'. Officials also had to convince her to serve champagne and Chinese drinks. Historian Chris Collins said: 'She didn't want to squander public money and could see the headlines back home: “Maggie cuts hospitals but spends a huge amount of public money on a banquet”. But eventually she yields.' However, the PM put her foot down when the Chinese suggested bread, butter and strawberry jam for dessert, demanding fruit salad instead. She also amended her party's in-flight breakfast menu, which initially included caviar. Mrs Thatcher, on her first overseas trip following the Falklands, put a cross next to it and wrote: 'No – much too expensive!'","Five MPs urged her to 'keep calm' adding 'we can get away without a fight'

Police are sending bouquets of flowers to victims of burglaries and muggings – crimes they often have difficulty solving. They claim the gift helps ‘soften the blow’, but it can also be accompanied by a note explaining that officers are closing the case for lack of evidence. The policy has divided opinion among victims – some saying they feel ‘fobbed off’ and others praising the ‘lovely thought’. The Metropolitan and West Mercia police forces are among those who regularly send bunches to victims of burglaries. But rates of detection can be as low as 12 per cent in these areas. The Metropolitan Police and West Mercia Police both send bouquets to victims of burglaries and muggings . Met police officers have given out around 300 bouquets since the initiative began in November. Most have gone to elderly women living alone. Sarah Miller, 55, received a bunch of flowers from Met officers in Barnet following a burglary at her home. She had two laptops, a camera and other valuables stolen two weeks ago and police sent a crime scenes officer to dust for fingerprints the following day. Later that day, they sent a card saying: ‘Sorry you have been a victim of crime, unfortunately in this case there is insufficient evidence to proceed and investigation into your crime will now be closed.’ The following day, a £25 bouquet of flowers arrived by courier along with a voucher for £5 off future purchases from the florist who donated it. Mrs Miller said: ‘It was nice to receive them, but the thought that went into that could have gone into solving the burglary, like putting pictures of the things that were stolen in the local paper in an effort to recover them. ‘I’d rather they’d had sent a community support officer to comfort me after it happened rather than being fobbed off with flowers.’ Some burglary victims said the flowers were a 'lovely thought', while others said would have preferred officers to do more to get back their stolen goods . Last year, there were 3,405 residential burglaries, 12.2 per cent of which were solved by police, or 6,795. The latest Home Office figures show that the national average number of burglaries in England and Wales that are solved is 13 per cent. A spokesman for the Met in Barnet said victims usually took the gifts as a positive gesture. 'Giving someone flowers helps soften the blow and shows we are there to support them,' he said. Police in West Mercia, who have a 24 per cent success rate in solving burglaries, have also been sending bunches of flowers to victims for four years. One couple from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, were given flowers by an officer after they were burgled. Jim and Dorly Whiting, who are both in their 70s, were tricked into letting a man into their house who then stole a wallet with £90 cash inside. Mrs Whiting said: 'The thoughtfulness of the police in helping us in this way is very much appreciated. We really didn't expect them [the flowers] and it was a lovely thought.' The flowers are paid for out of a police community fund which survives on proceeds from the sale of unclaimed property, contributions from staff and donations from the public. A spokesman for West Mercia Police said: 'It brings the force and people much closer together, which is how policing used to be.'","The Metropolitan Police and West Mercia Police both send flowers to victims .

The BBC was forced to apologise last night after its coverage of the Boat Race was marred by repeated swearing. A crew member was clearly heard shouting obscene language during the race which was being broadcast live to millions. Oskar Zorrilla, the 5ft 4in Oxford cox, said f*** at least five times, prompting the commentator to apologise for ‘unsavoury language’, but the BBC failed to turn his microphone down or off. Mr Zorrilla, 25, who is believed to be the first student of Colombian descent to take part in the race, has a distinctive accent and was heard saying ‘Be f***ing tenacious’, ‘That’s the f***ing stuff’ and, as his team crossed the finish line to win the 159th run of the historic race, shouted ‘F***, yeah!’ Viewers took to Twitter and online forums to complain about the foul language and the constant use of the f-word throughout the clash between Oxford and Cambridge universities. Jake Humphrey, a BBC sports journalist, tweeted: ‘What is happening to the world when the F word gets broadcast on something as traditional as the Boat Race?!’ William Lyons tweeted: ‘Was it just me or did the BBC coverage of the Boat Race lack a little charm? Swearing/Shouting cox – does it add anything?’ Others pointed out that the crews swore last year and said that lessons should have been learned at the BBC. On his online television forum James Cridland said: ‘Did the BBC really assume that the coxes weren’t going to swear when they mic’d them up?  And why, after one naughty word, did they keep his microphone live – and up – for another, and then another.’ He added: ‘It turns out that they swore last year, too. So: why weren’t lessons learnt?’ Microphones were installed in 2006 so . viewers could hear the coxes issuing instructions. But five minutes into . the race seven million viewers heard the Oxford cox screaming: ‘Let’s . f*** them’ to his crew. Both teams were warned in 2007 not to swear . during the race. We're Zorri: The BBC was forced to apologise for Zorrilla's 'unsavoury language' as viewers took to social media to complain about the cox's swearing . Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch, said it was ‘unacceptable’ for swearing to be broadcast and questioned why BBC producers failed to intervene. She said: ‘I think it’s a real shame. I accept that in the heat of the moment that’s going to happen, but when it happens a couple of times, it’s the job of the producer to intervene and turn it off.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for any offence caused by the swearing overheard during the Oxford team’s celebrations after winning the 2013 Boat Race. ‘We had spoken with both coxes ahead of the race requesting them to be careful with their language.’ Royal Marines were stationed along the length of the course to prevent a repeat of last year’s disruption when Trenton Oldfield swam between the boats to protest against ‘elitism’.

Clarissa Dickson Wright said visiting the city made her feel like a pariah and an outcast . She is as renowned for her outspoken views as she is for her cooking. So when celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright decided to write about her day out in a multi-cultural part of Leicester, she didn't mince her words. The former star of the BBC's Two Fat Ladies claimed a visit to the city, which has a large Muslim population, was 'the most frightening experience of her life'. Describing parts of Leicester as a 'ghetto', she said seeing so many men in Islamic clothing and women in a burkas left her feeling 'in the middle of my own country, a complete outcast and pariah'. Yesterday her comments provoked fury from Muslim groups and local leaders. But Miss Dickson Wright remained defiant, saying: 'I'm surprised any of the people who might object could read what I wrote as it is written in English.' The 65-year-old, a former barrister who grew up in north London, dedicates a  chapter in a new cookery book, Clarissa's England: A Gamely Gallop Through the English Counties, to each county, discussing their culinary, cultural and historical merits. She describes how she accidentally stumbled upon Leicester's city centre, where one in ten of the population is Muslim, after coming off a ring road to escape a traffic jam and getting lost. She wrote: 'I found myself in an area where all the men were wearing Islamic clothing and all the women were wearing burkas and walking slightly behind them. 'None of the men would talk  to me when I tried to find out  where I was and how to get out of there because I was an English female and they don't talk to females they don't know, while if the women could speak English they weren't about to show it by having a word with me. 'I have many good acquaintances and even some friends among the Muslim community, yet here I was, in the heart of a city in the middle of my own country, a complete outcast and pariah.' She said the positive side was the 'very good selection of Asian restaurants' and added: 'If multiculturalism works, which I have always been rather dubious of, surely it must be multicultural and not monocultural. 'I can only hope that in generations to come there will be a merging of the cultures and not the exclusion zone that is the ghetto.' Ibrahim Mogra, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said the chef's description was 'hurtful'.

Estimates suggest children from white families are now in a minority . in the city, making up only 47 per cent of the under-16 population. Leicester is set to become Britain’s first plural city, where no . ethnic group will form a majority, by 2019, with Birmingham expected to . follow five years later. At the 2001 census, Indians – made up 26 per cent of the population and whites 63 per cent. By 2011, Leicester had seen the highest growth in population in 10 years after London, Manchester and Milton Keynes. Between 2001 and 2011, the number of people went up by 47,100 (almost 17 per cent), from 282,800 to 329,900, according to the latest 2011 Census figures.

It may help sell . books but it is cheap.' And Councillor Manjula Sood, chairman . of Leicester Council of Faiths, said: 'I don't believe that a meeting . with one person on one street should mean you can label a whole city.' When asked to explain herself . following the criticism, the chef, who lives in Edinburgh, said: 'When . you get to 65, you will think back on this conversation and I think you . might find yourself in my frame of mind.' She said that while she had a lot of Muslim friends, her experience of Leicester was 'unpleasant'. 'It scared me and I am not scared . easy,' she said. 'It was part of my country that I was born in and there . are a lot of radical Muslim preachers in this country. 'I was in London when July 7 (2005 . bomb attacks) happened  and this to me was proof for  those people who . have been saying we're getting ghettoisation of  Muslim areas. 'I have never believed that political correctness was a reason not to say what I have experienced.' She added that she had 'done  a lot' for Leicestershire, including campaigning for the protected geographical . status of Melton pork pies and Stilton. In her book Clarissa's England, the chef describes her visit to Leicester. 'I had one of the most frightening adventures of my life there. I turned off the ring road because there had been a car crash and I wanted to avoid being stuck in traffic, and soon found myself lost. I couldn't tell you where I was but it was not terribly far from the city centre. 'As we know, Leicester has a very high Asian Muslim population and I found myself in an area where all the men were wearing Islamic clothing and all the women were wearing burkas and walking slightly behind them.

'Eventually I had to stop at a newsagents and the only way I could discover my location was to buy a map of the city. Somebody, very reluctantly, pointed to where I was and then I had to work out the rest for myself. 'I am not a particular admirer of Islam or indeed, I should add, almost any other religion, but I have many good acquaintances and even some friends among the Muslim community, yet here I was in the heart of city in the middle of my own country a complete outcast and pariah. 'If multiculturalism works, which I have always been rather dubious of, surely it must be multicultural and not monocultural. I just wanted to relate this to you because I think you ought to be aware of such things. 'However, everything has an upside and one of the results of this is that Leicester has a very good selection of Asian restaurants where you can eat excellent curry. 'The city also has a thriving market attended by farmers from the local countryside and quite a number from the Asian community too, who sell not only herbs and spices and Asian vegetables but also delicious ready-made goods.

Four Dutchmen who spent a terrifying day trapped up a tree hiding from a crocodile finally rescued yesterday - luckily with only bites from mosquitoes and sand flies. The construction workers had been crab fishing in Australia when their small tin boat overturned while they were in the country’s remote Northern Territory. They were unable to turn it upright so they swam towards a thick clump of mangrove trees, which grow out of the swampy water. But, unfortunately for the four, who are all aged in their 30s, there was a huge crocodile in the same area. In trouble: The construction workers had been crab fishing in Australia when their small tin boat overturned while they were in a swamp in the country's remote Northern Territory . In fear and desperation, they swam towards mangroves and clambered up on the highest trees they could find. The four were forced to shelter there for 22 hours while they waited to be rescued, spending a sleepless night hanging on to the branches. ‘It was a horrible experience,’ one of the men, covered in thick black swamp mud, told his rescuers. ‘It scared the s*** out of us.’ Crocodile experts in Darwin said if the men had been able to shine a torch into the dark water beneath them there is little doubt they would have seen the reflected red eyes of a number of crocodiles waiting for them to make the mistake of getting back into the water. The mangrove swamps of the Northern Territory are alive with man-eating saltwater crocodiles - ‘salties’, as they are known - and there have been numerous deaths, despite warnings for people to stay out of the water. Big beast: Salt-water crocodile similar to the one that sent the men clambering up a tree . Having seen a large crocodile themselves,  there was no chance of the men getting out of their tree during the night. They told their rescuers that despite their discomfort they agreed they were going to cling to the branches throughout the night. Only when the tide dropped yesterday morning did the men agree to take a chance and swim the short distance back to their boat. They were able to swim under the upturned vessel and retrieve a distress beacon. When the Australian Maritime Safety Authority received the signal, a police launch and a helicopter were despatched to pick up the men. Scary: The incident occurred in Darwin Harbour, known for its large population of salt-water crocodiles . The helicopter reached them first and winched them out of the water and flew them back to Darwin. Their arms and legs were covered in sandfly and mosquito bites and they were suffering from dehydration and lack of sleep. They were also covered in thick black mud. Police experts agreed that if the men had not been able to summon help with their beacon it is doubtful they would have survived their ordeal. Their strength, whether they were still in a tree or clinging to their upturned boat, would have soon drained – and crocodiles would have moved in for the kill. ‘We’ve vowed not to go fishing for a while,’ said one of the men. ‘But we still have to go back out there to help recover the little boat which we had borrowed. ‘This time we’ll make sure we don’t tip over.’","They were crab fishing in Darwin, Northern Territory, when boat capsized .

The scale of one the frauds, in which they tricked a victim into letting one of the gang buy his house for around £40,000 less than it was worth, was described as ‘breathtaking’ by Judge Nicholas Woodward, who said it was like something ‘glamorised by Hollywood films’. Conmen: Mark Dodd (left) and Neil Jones (right) were jailed for fleecing victims out of their life savings . Mark Dodd, 50, Neil Jones, 38, Kevin Sweeney, 37, and Paul Williams, 50, were jailed for ‘fleecing’ four vulnerable victims out of their life savings by gaining their trust and betraying them in the most cynical way, the court was told. Beatrice Price, a frail 80-year old when she was targeted, entrusted the defendant Jones with her finances after he tricked his way into her trust, only to have her accounts siphoned of almost £50,000 of savings. Williams, 50, forged 83-year-old Winifred Owen’s signature in order to write a cheque to his daughter for £14,750 after tricking his way into her home on a bogus visit to check her windows. He also did the same to Mrs Price on a separate occasion. Another victim - retired GP Dr Peter Grant - was tricked into dropping the price of his sister’s bungalow and their former family home, which he was selling for her because she had learning difficulties. Jailed: Kevin Sweeney (left) and Paul Williams (right) also fleeced victims out of their life savings, betraying them in the most cynical way . The property was subsequently bought by Sweeney for a fraction of its true value. Judge Woodward sentenced Dodd to five years, Sweeney to four-and-a-half years, Jones to four years and Williams to 18 months in jail. Andrew Thomas, prosecuting, told the court: ‘The defendants fall to be sentenced for their part in an overlapping series of frauds and thefts with a total value in excess of £600,000. ‘Their victims were private householders who were canvassed by them in relation to dubious building works. In each case, the defendants built a relationship of trust with the victim before using it either to commit fraud or theft.’ Dodd, from Liverpool, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to defraud but was found guilty by a Chester jury on October 1. The court heard Dodd is involved in the conspiracy in respect of building works for Dr Grant with a total value of £445,000. Salesman Neil Jones from Wirral, tried to pass himself off as a financial adviser. He admitted conspiracy to defraud Beatrice Price in respect of building works to the value £49,535. He has also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud Dr Grant in respect of building works to the value of £445,000 and conspiracy to defraud Dr Grant over the sale of the bungalow to the tune of £40,000. The total value of his fraud amounts to more than £534,535, Mr Thomas said. Justice: The conmen were handed jail sentences at Chester Crown Court . Paul Williams, 50, from Tranmere, worked for the other defendants as a self-employed salesman, apparently selling door-to-door, the court heard. Williams pleaded guilty to two offences: theft of £7,840 from Beatrice Price and theft of £14,750 from Winifred Owen. Married couple Kevin and Nicola Sweeney, 37 and 38 respectively, now live at the property formally owned by their victim Dr Grant. Fitter Kevin Sweeney, previously from Huyton, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to the same charges as Neil Jones. Local government worker Nicola Sweeney pleaded guilty to transferring the proceeds of the fraud committed on Dr Grant, worth around £57,000. Judge Woodward sentenced her to ten months in jail, suspended for two years. Judge Woodward branded the defendants ‘conmen’ who took advantage of others who were rendered vulnerable, ‘whether by old age or simple naivety’. 'This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films,' said Judge Woodward. He said their crimes were ‘calculated, deliberate and sophisticated’, adding: ‘You were ruthless in extracting every single penny you could.’ He said the gang carried on fleecing the victims ‘despite the fact you realised you were cheating people out of their accumulated life savings’. Judge Woodward added: ‘These were truly heartless offences and they left your victims both emotionally and financially bereft.’ Addressing the specific fraud on Dr Grant, in which the gang ‘played different characters’ in a bid to get him to lower the price of the house he was selling for his sister, Judge Woodward said: ‘Dr Peter Grant is a very decent man who has spent his life working for the community and helping to care for his disadvantaged sister who is the other victim of this charge. ‘The scale of the fraud on those people is simply breathtaking. This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films. ‘Each of you entered into the scene at different times playing different characters, all of whom appeared to be independent. The reality was, this was a cynical scheme to divest your victims of their life savings.’ He added: ‘This was the unscrupulous targeting of vulnerable victims in an organised and planned way over a long period.’ Dr Peter Grant’s sister, Carol Goldstone, suffers from a learning disability and now lives in supported accommodation, the court heard. Both are in their 60s. The gang carried out unnecessary work not only on the Chester bungalow but also on Dr Grant’s own home in Liverpool. ‘The total loss in respect of the building fraud on Dr Grant is about £445,000,’ Mr Thomas said.","One fraud described by judge as 'breathtaking' and like something 'glamorised by Hollywood films'

Caroline Banana, 40, of Stoke-on-Trent, was given a community order after admitting claiming benefits even after she won a windfall on a game show . A mother who claimed benefits despite winning £95,000 on Deal or No Deal has been ordered to do 215 hours of unpaid work . Caroline Banana, 40, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, continued to receive housing benefit, income support and council tax benefit after winning money. Today she was sentenced to a 12-month community order with the unpaid work and ordered to repay all the money she owed after admitting six counts of fraud ahead of her trial. District Judge David Taylor said: 'Any honest person who acquired £95,000 would do the right thing and say, 'I do not need any state benefit, I have a different life now.' The mother-of-three admitted failing to disclose her windfall to either the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or Stoke City Council, who paid her thousands of pounds worth of benefits she was not entitled to. As a result, she wrongfully received housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support worth a total of £6,147.92, plus free school meals worth £1,120.90. Today Mr Taylor, sitting at North Staffordshire Magistrates' court, ordered her to carry out a 12-month unpaid work order, with supervision by the probation service. He also said she had to repay the Department for Work and Pensions and Stoke City Council everything she owes them, plus £350 costs. He said: 'Any offence of benefits fraud is never victimless: it harms every member of society who works and pays tax.' He said she had 'brought upon herself' the shame of the publicity her case had received, and said her behaviour did 'amount to a deliberate cover-up'. Banana won a life-changing amount when she appeared on Deal Or No Deal in 2011, but still claimed benefits . She spent most of her winnings on a £60,000 holiday home in Turkey while continuing to claim housing benefit . Mr Taylor also said Banana was only due 'minimum credit' for not admitting her guilt until the eve of her trial last week. The rules state that benefit claimants must inform the DWP if their bank balance exceeds £16,000, either due to a windfall or inheritance. However Banana, who appeared on the Channel 4 show hosted by Noel Edmonds in November 2011, did not disclose her winnings. She admitted failing to disclose her windfall separately to both the DWP and Stoke City Council, and admitted failing to declare to them her employment at a chemist, medical surgery and Longton Cottage Hospital. After winning the five-figure sum on Noel Edmonds' game-show, Banana should have declared it to authorities . Banana further admitted making a . false representation on an Income Support application form by not . declaring she was owed her TV gameshow winnings. She also pleaded guilty to wrongly claiming free school meals for three children. In . mitigation, her solicitor David Green said offers of employment for . Banana had been withdrawn when potential employers discovered her case . in the press. 'Whatever happens today cannot outweigh her punishment already,' he said. He . said one of her daughters had been beaten up at school as a result of . Banana’s notoriety, while vandals had targeted the family home. Mr . Green added Banana had begun repaying what she had wrongly claimed and . was going to sell a £60,000 property in Turkey she had bought with the . winnings to help settle the rest of her debt. Caroline Banana, pictured above outside court, admitted six counts of fraud on the eve of her trial . She now has 12 months to settle her over-payments in full. Councillor Paul Shotton, Stoke-on-Trent City Council deputy leader, said Banana’s actions in fraudulently claiming benefit were 'offensive' both to people with genuine claims and to taxpayers who provide the money. He said: 'We are pleased with the court verdict and, as with all of these cases, the money that was obtained fraudulently will now be paid back in full to the council.' He added: 'She’s won a substantial amount of money and failed to declare it, then continued to take money out of the system. 'Like many other councils, we’ve got issues meaning we need to make cuts to services but at least £1 million is fraudulently going out of the council coffers to be spent on people like Caroline Banana. 'We take a serious view of this sort of fraud and will always look to prosecute.'","Caroline Banana, 40, of Stoke-on-Trent, claimed benefits worth £7,268.82 .

These are the fascinating signed handprints of famous names from the 1920s including Albert Einstein. The incredible collection also includes actress and singer Marlene Deitrich, composers Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky and filmmaker Fritz Lang. They were collected by German palmist Marianne Raschig who spent 60 years taking more than 2,000 handprints of around 1,000 leading artists, actors, scientists, musicians and writers in Berlin. Revealing: The handprint of renowned scientist Albert Einstein. Does this give any clue to where his genius came from? Leading lights: Marianne Raschig collected prints from famous names of her time including Albert Einstein and Marlene Dietrich . Hands on: The palm prints of Fritz Lang the film director who was one of the leading lights of German Expressionism . Arts and culture: Director Fritz Lange, left, was a founder of German Expressionist cinema while Igor Stravinksy was a famous composer . Illuminating: The handprint of actress Louise Brooks who was more famous for her bobbed haircut in the 1920s . Raschig collected the handprints between the 1870s and 1930s for a study into what the lines and shapes of hands could reveal about a person's character. Palm readers believe that every person's hands has a series of 'lines' and 'mounts' which reveal their personality traits and even predict their future. Studies of Einstein's prints have suggested they show he was an independent thinker and possibly suffered from Asperger's Syndrome. Telling: Nobel Prize-winning novelist Thomas Mann was one of the leading names in literature of the day when he gave this handprint . Researchers have suggested that people with that people with autism often have a 2D:4D ratio (the distance between the index finger and ring finger) of 0.94mm or less. Einstein's is said to have been 0.93. Each of the lifesized handprints is signed and dated by its subject, then stamped with a mark reading 'M. Raschig's Handarchiv.' Raschig published her study in a 1933 book Hand und Persvnlichkeit (Hand and Personality) which is still used today. The rare collection is tipped to fetch upwards of £90,000 when it goes under the hammer. Einstein's handprints, featuring both hands, are expected to sell for £15,000 on their own. A small collection of 52 handprints auctioned in New York in 2006 sold for £64,000. The handprints are being sold by a member of Raschig's family who bought the collection 30 years ago. Dr . Simon Maguire, books and manuscripts expert at auctioneers Sotheby's, . said: 'Marianne Raschig was a rather serious German lady who conducted a . study of handprints in the early 1930s of the movers and shakers of . culture in Berlin at the time. 'She . spent around years collecting handprints from more than 1,000 people. She was interested in how the lines on people's hands revealed . characteristics about them. 'It was a very significant and influential study, and one that is still being referred to now, 80 years on. 'Never . before had there been such a comprehensive study of handprints . conducted. Her subjects would put their inked hands onto paper and then . sign and date the print. Enlightening: Actress and singer Marlene Dietrich, left, and composer Richard Strauss, right, are included in the collection . Hands of a genius: These prints were created by physicist Max Planck who went on to win a Nobel Prize for his work . 'Einstein's prints showed very strong head and lifelines, and Raschig devoted several pages to her analysis of the great scientist. 'In some cases Raschig would outline the prints in pencil to show where parts of the hand had lifted off the paper. 'There has never been such a comprehensive collection of handprints at auction.' The handprints will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on June 5 and 6.","Collection of more than 2,000 handprints to go on auction .

She was spotted smoking what appeared to be marijuana as she strolled around New York City last month in April. But now the full extent of Amanda Bynes's troubled world has been revealed after the child star opened up the doors to her Manhattan apartment for an impromptu house party the same month. Two men, including a photographer by the name of Giovanni Arnold and another who would go only go by the name of 'Joe', claim to In Touch magazine that they witnessed the actress smoke marijuana as she sat on top of a bare mattress in her bedroom. But Amanda has jumped to her own defense, tweeting on Wednesday night: 'That’s not my bed! Those aren’t my toes! My toes are pedicured!' More troubles: Amanda Bynes's troubled world has been . revealed after the child star opened up the doors to her Manhattan . apartment for an impromptu house party last month . In the photographs, Amanda's Big Apple abode, which they describe as 'filthy', is littered with rubbish and take-out containers and with windows that have been blacked out with spray paint. They also claim and presented photographs of what appeared to be empty drug baggies strewn on the floor. 'Weed was everywhere,' Giovanni told the magazine. 'On the bed, all over the floor.' Erratic: Over the past few weeks, Amanda has continuously displayed erratic behaviour and tweeted bizarre pictures of herself . 'She probably gets so high that sometimes she won't even leave her house,' he added. 'One minute she's cool and down-to-earth,' 'Joe' added to the magazine. 'The next, she's totally different - indecisive and she can't hold a conversation. Mentally, she is all over the place.' In the photographs from In Touch, Amanda is seen sprawled out on her bed, seemingly out of it with a pair of sunglasses covering her eyes. In one snap she has a half burnt roll up in her mouth and her bare feet are covered in nasty cuts and bruises. Almost nude: Last month Amanda took this selfie in her bathroom at her Manhattan home . Wandering around: Also last month, Amanda was spotted wandering around Manhattan smoking a suspicious roll-up cigarette . In the same image an empty plastic baggie sits in the corner next to her spiked Christian Louboutin shoes. 'She'll smoke a joint halfway and then put it out and light a new one. Then she'll relight the half,' 'Joe' told the magazine. The two men said they witnessed Amanda on several outings with pre-rolled joints and claimed that she had a stockpile of the drug in her apartment. Giovanni also claims he saw her do cocaine during their time in the apartment. Past problems: Amanda was photographed in September last year smoking an unknown substance out of a pipe in her BMW whilst she was in Los Angeles . But when questioned by In Touch about the alleged drug use, Amanda strenuously denied the pair's story. 'They're the ones into drugs, so they bring drugs, but I don't do them,' she said. Isolated: Pals say Amanda has totally isolated herself from her friends and family members . Giovanni and 'Joe' told the magazine that Amanda's living conditions were poor, with her house virtually unfurnished. 'Her living room is basically empty: She has two big purple chairs and a little dining room table, that's it,' 'Joe' said. The photographer said that while there is one blind on the window, the rest are half spray painted black. 'It's almost like she couldn't bother to get more blinds,' Giovanni said. During their night at Amanda's, the actress also reportedly obsessed about her weight. 'You can tell that she craves attention, but at the same time, it makes her feel uncomfortable because she is so uncomfortable about her appearance,' 'Joe' told the magazine. 'She talks about losing weight constantly - she's fixated. As weird as she is, she's still very Hollywood: demanding and obsessed with how she looks.' According to several past reports, Amanda's parents have tried desperately to reach out to their daughter but to no avail. Close friends say that they fear for the actress who has completely lost touch with the outside world. Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, who knew Amanda before she started with her erratic behaviour last year, described the situation as 'frightening'. 'She is a totally different person now,' he told the magazine. 'She's effectively isolated herself from her family, friends and loved ones. Her life must be incredibly lonely, confusing and frightening right now.'",Amanda claims the photos are not of her in new tweet on Wednesday night .
"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 16:51 EST, 20 December 2011 . As the fallen leader of one of America's biggest foes, Kim Jong-Il would have been prominent on any U.S. intelligence watch-list. But still North Korea’s ‘dear leader' managed to pass away on a train on Saturday night without the outside world knowing for a whole two days. The remarkable intelligence blunder has left the world pondering the lack of American intelligence on one of the world's most secretive nations. Late reporting: The front pages of selected Shanghai newspapers are seen reporting on the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il on Tuesday . Until a North Korean state TV announcement on Monday, South Korean officials had no idea Kim had died at 8:30pm on Saturday. Cautious U.S. officials were still quoting press reports well into . Monday. The intelligence delay and failure to pick up on any clues shows the level of secrecy in the North Korean regime, reported the New York Times. South Korean officials only found out what happened when North Korean state media reported the news in a 12pm announcement on Monday. 'This shows a big loophole in our intelligence-gathering network on North Korea,' South Korean politician Kwon Seon-taek told the New York Times. Kim, who was aged 69, kept the rest of the world on edge through his nuclear weapons programme after inheriting power from his father in 1994. Reaction: A woman eats a meal near a TV set reporting on the successive North Korean leaders at a restaurant in Guangdong, China, on Tuesday . He frustrated the U.S. and other global . powers with an intermittent approach to talks on giving up nuclear arms . in return for energy. North Korea's news agency reported he . died after having a heart attack and had been treated for cardiac and . cerebrovascular diseases. 'This shows a big loophole in our intelligence-gathering network on North Korea' Kwon Seon-taek . Kim, who reputedly had a taste for cigars and cognac, is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. His son Kim Jong Un has taken over. But he had appeared relatively vigorous in footage from recent trips to China and Russia and in visits around the country seen on state media. His military's repeated threats to South Korea and the U.S. stoked worries that fighting might break out again on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile his long-time pursuit of nuclear weapons raised concerns he might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist movements. Mourners: The body of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is seen as people pay their respects in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Tuesday . The Korean War ended more than 50 years ago in a ceasefire, and the two sides remain technically in a state of war. South Korea has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. Kim often blamed the U.S. for his country's troubles and his regime routinely derides South Korea as a puppet of the Western superpower. ‘Look, Kim Jong-Il is a dangerous person,’ President Bush said in 2005. ‘He's a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps.’","North Korean leader died on Saturday at 20:30 on train .

"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 23:36 EST, 19 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:38 EST, 19 April 2013 . Federal law enforcement is not adequately prepared for a coordinated terror attack in multiple cities, or for an armed, hostage-taking siege at a public place where people congregate. That assessment comes from a Department of Homeland Security veteran who led the agency's top anti-bombing office for eight years, spanning two presidencies. Charlie Payne helped found Homeland Security's Office for Bombing Prevention, and led it from December 2003 through July 2011. He told MailOnline that the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing will wake up some counter-terrorism analysts to how much more horrible the situation could have been if an enemy were better organized. 'Yes, it was the Boston Marathon. We're just lucky it wasn't the Boston Marathon and four other cities at the same time,' Payne said. Charlie Payne (L) led Homeland Security's Office For Bombing Prevention from 2003 to 2011. He warns that backpack-bombers in several cities at once could be more than America is ready to handle . SWAT teams like this one in Watertown, Mass., have received specialized training from the Office for Bombing Prevention, along with funds for tactical equipment. The Obama administration has removed nearly half of that funding . The Office of Bombing Prevention, which he used to lead, has . spread funds around for training, equipment and . inter-agency coordination. But as MailOnline reported, the Obama . administration has cut 45 per cent from its budget, taking dollars away from bomb squads, SWAT teams, K9 handlers and dive teams at the state and local level. That decision should be reversed, he said. 'Look how tragic a situation this is. Imagine the complexity if this had happened simultaneously that day in a number of cities.' Payne explained in a telephone interview that during his more than seven years at the top of Homeland Security's anti-bombing office, a scenario like the one Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev put Bostonians through was his most frequent fear. Only local policing, he said, could prevent it. But without federal dollars for training, the local authorities generally didn't know how. Crowds cheered after authorities captured bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but Payne warns that smarter bombers with a multi-city footprint wouldn't give anyone a happy ending . 'During my time in office, people would ask me, ""When is it going to happen? When is it coming here?"" he said. 'Bombs are a threat. It's going to happen. It's happened already,' he recalled responding, making reference to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, and the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, Georgia. 'And once one happens, it's going to keep happening.' Payne's worst nightmare, however, was a scenario that no one it set up to confront. 'Imagine Tysons Corner Mall,' he said, referring to a popular shopping center in Washington, D.C.'s Virginia suburbs. 'There's IEDs everywhere, it's locked down, hostages are zip-tied in the middle of the place and they're killing one every hour,' Payne imagined. 'How many jurisdictions are prepared to handle that operationally? That's what kept me up at night.' President Barack Obama said Friday night that Americans 'owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement professionals.' But his administration has slashed the budget of the office tasked with helping police prevent attacks like the Boston Marathon bombings . In a January 2013 hostage crisis in Los Angeles, armed robbers held 14 people but later fled the scene after stabbing one hostage and sexually assaulting another. In a terror-motivated hostage scenario, however, escape might not be on the hostage-takers' minds - making specialized SWAT training the only thing that could keep the hostages alive . So Payne worked to equip and train state troopers, sheriffs and local police forces in the practical, tactical operations that the big, lumbering federal law enforcement agencies can't perform everywhere at once. The federal government's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, he observed, are investigative agencies, while local law enforcement tends to directly handle the worst imaginable crises when they happen. This is especially true in rural areas, where the nearest federal agent could be a 10-hour drive away. The JTTF system, Payne said, is an example of how federal agencies can pull together toward a critical national goal, provided that there's a well-funded apparatus to organize and lead them. 'What you see happening right now with the JTTF working, and state and local authorities working together,' he explained, 'is proof positive that there has been a lot of good work done since 9/11. It's clearly paid off.' The FBI manages 100 Joint Terrorism Task Forces, combing regional assets of nearly 3 dozen federal agencies near every FBI field office. Payne says they're a good example of how cooperation can foil bombers and other terrorists .","Charlie Payne says that 'once one happens, it's going to keep happening'

With a combined weight of more than three quarters of a ton - Boris and Marjorie like nothing better than spending their days with their snouts in the trough. But somehow the pigs - thought to be Britain's fattest breeding pair - still manage to find time for love, producing more than 70 piglets between them at Chyvarloe Farm, near Helston, Cornwall during the last two years. At 925lbs, Boris is so heavy he can . easily crush an average-sized female during mating - but Marjorie is big enough to . bear his enormous bulk. Scroll down for video . Porkers: Farmer Paul Parfitt with his pigs Boris (right) and Marjorie at Chyvarloe Farm in Helston, Cornwall. The porkers have a combined weight of three quarters of a ton . Huge: Two-year-old Hettie Parfitt feeds Boris an apple. He and Marjorie have produced an astonishing 70 piglets together . Size: Mr Parfitt reckons Boris and Marjorie are the heaviest breeding couple in the country . The crossbreed Gloucester Old Spot/Large White pigs are so big they could be made into around 10,000 sausages. Boris is around six times bigger than the slaughter weight of the average pig. He is carrying an estimated 112lbs of bacon, which equates to around 3360 . thin rashers of back and streaky bacon. He could also produce a whopping . 54lbs of chops, 72lbs of ham and 32lbs of shoulder. Master butcher Darren Law, of D.T. Law . Butchers said: 'I reckon you'd get about 600 good, thick rashers of . back bacon from the loin. It's a bloody big pig.' Proud owner Paul Parfitt, 37, said: 'Boris is exceptionally fertile. All the lady pigs dote on him.' 'The main problem we have is finding any big enough to avoid getting crushed - but because Marjorie is a beefy pig, she can stomach his weight when they're rutting. Marjorie is Boris' favourite - they've probably had around 70 piglets together.' Boris stays in peak physical condition by scoffing four kilos of rolled barley and wheat per day. 'Boris is a huge but healthy pig,' said Mr Parfitt, who runs the show farm with his wife Charlotte, 29. 'He . hasn't grown this big by eating scraps or junk. His diet is basically a . massive amount of muesli every day plus the odd apple for a treat.' Sausages: The pigs weigh enough together to make more than 10,000 sausages. Marjorie, weighs about 670lbs, but four-year-old Boris tips the scales at a whopping 925lbs . Hefty: Believe it or not Boris has been on a diet over the winter - but he will soon put the bulk back on when he is allowed back into the fields . Marjorie is one of eight breeding . sows at the farm with whom lucky Boris sires a staggering 175 piglets every . year - around 600 in total. Mr Parfitt said Boris 'never throws his . weight around,' despite his giant size. 'He's the most docile, laid back . pig you'll ever meet and he'll happily let 100 school children line up . and stroke him,' he said. Four-year-old Boris tips the scales at . 925lbs, measures more than 7ft from snout to tail, and is well over 3ft . tall. Marjorie, aged three, weighs about 670lbs and is 6ft long and 3ft . 6ins tall. Mr Parfitt said: 'Boris has been on a bit of a diet over the winter - he's been inside so he loses weight, but in the summer he'll put it all back on once he's out in the fields. 'If we weren't to restrict his diet, he'd just get fat, but in the summer, he builds up a lot of muscle. I've heard of pigs that weigh more than 450kg, but I reckon Boris is the podgiest porker in Britain.' Snuggling: The super-sized pair's bulk has not got in the way of their breeding. Boris has sired 175 piglets with the farm's eight breeding sows . Large scale: The crossbred pair are far larger and heavier than average-sized pigs. Boris alone is four times the size of a normal porker . Paul and Charlotte have grown so attached to Boris that he has been saved from the chop. Their initial aim was to buy a few pigs to fatten up and sell on - but they never expected Boris to keep expanding until he was nearly four times heavier than a normal hog. Local butcher Dean Orr reckons Boris alone contains enough meat to make 6,250 sausages - but Paul says his prize pet will never get the chop. He added: 'I remember him as a little piglet. It was only the fact that he developed into such a phenomenal size that we thought we would keep him for breeding.'","Boris and Marjorie have combined weight of over three quarters of a ton .

Dr Das and his wife Nishebita, also a doctor, were asleep when the pair broke into their country home. Prosecutor David Elias said: 'Mrs Das was woken by a man covering her mouth with his hand, saying: ""I won't hurt you, don't shout."" 'He asked her where her husband was and in complete terror she said he was in another bedroom. A pillowcase was put over her head and her hands were tied. 'She heard the sound of her husband being attacked in his bedroom before he was brought into her room. 'The pillowcase was lifted and she could see her husband - his face was covered in blood and there was a knife held to his throat.' The mother-of-two, 64, heard her husband screaming: 'Don't beat me,' as the burglars demanded to know where their valuables were hidden. Mr Elias said: 'She heard him crying out in pain. It was clear he was being assaulted and she thought he was taking his last breaths.' Mrs Das was also forced to watch as Donovan threatened to cut her husband's throat with a knife. The two doctors were left tied to furniture at their home at Catsash, near Newport, South Wales, while Donovan and Gibbons fled in the couple's BMW. The proceeds of their 'horrific' crime was foreign currency, a mobile phone, a gold plated ornamental eagle and jewellery worth in total £100,000. Cardiff Crown Court heard Dr Das suffered bleeding to the brain and is unlikely to recover from his injuries. 'Callous disregard for Dr Das': Rhiannon Gibbons, 27, (left) and Edward Donovan, 51, (right) were jailed for 10 years and 15 years respectively after being found guilty of robbery, wounding and assault . A victim impact statement by Mrs Das said her husband would never be able to practice medicine again. She said: 'He needs constant care and has become a recluse. He is nothing like the man I have lived with for many years. 'He walks with a shuffle and has limited sight. His memory has gone. 'He cannot even remember the names of his two children or his grandchildren. The children get very upset when he asks them: '""Who are you?""' Judge Eleri Rees . Donovan and Gibbons were arrested after a hammer found at one of their homes was stained with the doctor's blood. CCTV cameras also caught the haul from the house being unloaded from the stolen . BMW into one of the accused's flats before it was abandoned and torched. Police also seized Gibbons' mobile phone which showed that inquiries had been made about foreign currency rates and the price of gold. Donovan, and Gibbons, both from Newport, were found guilty of robbery, wounding Prana and assault. Donovan was jailed for 15 years and Gibbons for 10 years. The court heard Donovan has 29 previous court appearances for 87 offences including robbery and aggravated burglary and had recently served a five-and-a-half year sentence. Gibbons had appeared in court 12 times for 29 offences including robbery and had served terms of imprisonment. Recorder of Cardiff, Judge Eleri Rees, said: 'This was a carefully planned robbery carried out with ruthlessness and no regard for the victims. You showed no remorse. 'You showed a callous disregard for the life and health of Dr Das. 'I have no doubt the public need protection from you for a considerable length of time.'","Prana Das, 67, and his wife Nishebita attacked while asleep at their home .

In an attempt to promote its stores North of the Border, Asda decided that a picture of the rolling countryside would help show its commitment to locally sourced produce. But there may be some questioning its 'local' credentials after it emerged the idyllic scene of green hills, dry-stone walls and blue water was actually from the Lake District - 300 miles away in England. The supermarket has admitted using the image to promote its flagship Inverness store. The picture, which was actually taken in Wansfell, near Ambleside in Cumbria, featured in a six-page brochure given away to households near the chain’s new £27million store. Llocal businessman Jo Hunt, who spotted the embarrassing error, said: 'I . recognised the house in the picture because friends of mine lived . there. 'I was surprised to see it but I find it funny rather than anything else.' Lake District National Park spokesman Mick Casey agreed: 'It looks like Wansfell to me, on the way up to Kirkstone Pass Inn.' An Asda spokesman admitted the company made an error and apologised. She said the image was a stock photo and added: We hold our hands up and apologise for this silly mistake – we shouldn’t have used a generic image.

'We should focus on the fact that we are working with local suppliers and we are not coming in being all talk and no trousers - we are walking the walk.' It's another humiliating moment for the . supermarket, which has been fiercely attacked for its part in the milk . scandal which saw dairy farmers protesting that they were not being paid . enough to cover their costs. Only one minor detail spoilt the scene - the photograph was actually taken in the very English Lake District . Dairy farmers were furious about cuts of up to 2p a litre in the amount they receive from major milk processors and many feared the shortfall will force them out of business. Asda, Morrisons and the Co-operative caved in to pressure and announced they would increase the prices they paid to suppliers. All raised their fees, which will be passed on to the dairy producers. A litre of milk costs at least 30p to produce, but many dairy farmers say they are being paid as little as 24p. Most are locked into 12-month contracts so cannot try to get better prices elsewhere. In July Asda raised payments to 27.5p a litre, while Morrisons put its payments up to 31p a litre. The Co-operative Group increased its fee to 29p per litre.","Picture advertising local produce is actually of Wansfell, in the Lake District .

Police are investigating an alleged sex attack on a Premier League player's girlfriend after she claimed a man crept into her hotel bedroom while she was asleep. The suspect apparently sneaked into the WAG's room at the £250-a-night Lowry hotel, in Salford, Greater Manchester, while she was in there alone. Police have arrested a 32-year-old hotel worker on suspicion of sexual assault but he was later released on bail . while police continue to investigate. Sex attack: The Premier League footballer's partner was sleeping at the £250-a-night Lowry Hotel in Salford when she was allegedly attacked . The distraught woman is believed to have returned early from a night out in the city while her footballer boyfriend stayed out. The alleged victim thought the person in the room was her partner as he was lying next to her when she woke up the next morning. She only later discovered that someone else must have been in the room when she asked her boyfriend what time he had returned and found it was much later. Star: The player who's girlfriend was allegedly attacked is an international who has played for a number of Premier League clubs . As part of their investigation, officers . will have seized CCTV footage and electronic records of when people . entered the hotel room in Salford using the keycard. Neither the footballer or his girlfriend can be identified for legal reasons. However, the star has represented his country at international level and has played for a number of Premier League clubs, The Sun reported. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed the alleged sex attack was under investigation. 'Police were called to the Lowry Hotel in Salford following reports a 32-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted. 'A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. He has been bailed pending further enquiries. Enquiries are ongoing.' The alleged attack has similarities with another case in London where a porter let himself into a celebrity guest's room and raped her as she slept. Soby John, 25,used his position as a porter to get a copy of the electronic key to the victim’s room after seeing her stumbling in the corridor. He was jailed for 10 years for the attack. The Lowry Hotel is a favourite hangout for Premier League footballers and it is often used by away teams when they are playing Manchester United and City. Manchester United star Wayne Rooney paid Helen Wood, 23 and Jennifer Thompson, 21,  £1,200 to sleep with them at the hotel in 2010 while his wife was pregnant. Married former England manager Steve McClaren had an affair with a woman who also had a fling with Sven Goran Eriksson after being introduced to her at the hotel. Father-of-three McClaren, 51, met Saima Ansari at the Lowry - the same hotel where Eriksson was first introduced to her. The hotel was engulfed in a food poisoning investigation when 80 guests fell ill after a fundraising dinner at the hotel in 2011. They reported suffering dizziness and vomiting after eating chicken pate at the charity event.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:05 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:43 EST, 29 April 2013 . First Minister Alex Salmond is under growing pressure amid claims the pro-independence campaign is stalling and faces defeat in next year's referendum . Almost two-thirds of people have dismissed Alex Salmond’s plan for an independent Scotland as ‘not convincing’, according to damning new poll. Pressure is mounting on the Scottish National Party leader amid signs his hopes of breaking away from the rest of the UK will be dashed by voters in next year’s referendum. Opponents of independence have set the agenda with a series of interventions, including a warning that Scotland would not be able to use the pound if it voted to go it alone. Mr Salmond and the pro-independence campaign are accused of being ‘dishonest and disorganised’ barely 18 months before voters decide on the future of the 300-year-old Union. The latest opinion poll shows that 62 per cent of people surveyed think the SNP`s case for independence is either ‘not very convincing’ or ‘not convincing at all’. Almost one in four who say they are unimpressed voted for the SNP in recent Scottish and UK parliamentary elections. The poll, carried out by YouGov for Better Together campaign group which wants to keep Scotland in the UK, surveyed a total of 1,038 Scottish adults this week. Just 11 per cent said the case for independence is ‘very convincing', while 19 per cent said it was ‘fairly convincing’. Better Together leader Alistair . Darling said: ‘Whether on Europe, Nato, currency or pensions, the . Nationalists have been exposed as being dishonest and disorganised on . their preparations for independence. ‘The . SNP have no answers on basic questions like which currency we would use . or who would pay for our pensions. Their case is falling apart day by . day.’ Chancellor George Osborne last week used a speech in Glasgow to warn an independent Scotland would end up 'like Panama' with no control over its currency . Today CBI director general John Cridland warned businesses on both sides of the border would suffer if Scotland broke away from the rest of the UK. In a speech to the Scotch Whisky Association, he said: 'Our common laws and regulations make it more efficient to operate across the union, not to mention how they lay a strong foundation for us all to enjoy the benefits of our single market. We would all lose out if it were fragmented.' Last week a devastating 118-page Treasury paper sets out the economic realities of independence. Chancellor George Osborne warned Scotland could end up ‘like Panama’ if it gains independence but keeps the pound. The Chancellor said it was ‘unlikely’ the rest of the UK would want to enter a currency union with a separate Scotland. In . the poll, voters were asked which three issues would be important in . deciding how they vote in the referendum, which is to be held on . September 18 next year. Former chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign, accused nationalists of being 'disorganised and dishonest' while Labour MSP Patricia Ferguson said voters do not trust Mr Salmond . The economy came top, chosen by 59 per cent of people. Tax and spending was named by 39 per cent, while 36 per cent said  pensions and welfare, 30 per cent said health services and 22 per cent mentioned the currency. A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: ‘The evidence is clear that Scotland would be more prosperous as an independent country with the means and the will to be a fairer country too. ‘We will continue to press the positive and optimistic case for an independent Scotland which we firmly believe will win the day on September 18 next year. ‘It makes sense for us to have the powers we need to match our priorities and aspirations while maintaining a strong social union with the rest of the UK.’ But Labour MSP Patricia Ferguson said the poll was a blow for the SNP. She said: ‘It reaffirms that Scots simply don't trust what they hear from Salmond and Sturgeon. ‘The SNP change their mind on the currency question more often than the weather changes. People are rightly questioning whether they're simply making it up as they go along.’","Just 11% of people says case for independence is 'very convincing'

'Very immature': Court dock officer Yasemin Ozyukselen (pictured) has been jailed for ten months after sharing flirty phone calls with a convicted rapist serving at one of Britain's most notorious prisons . A dock officer who shared flirty phone calls with a serving inmate at one of Britain's most notorious prisons was jailed for 10 months today. Serco worker Yasemin Ozyukselen, 24, was contacted almost 60 times by convicted rapist Shahed Ahmed, 22, while he was held at HMP Belmarsh in Woolwich, southeast London. Ahmed bombarded Ozyukselen with calls over a 15-month period in which he called her 'darling', 'gorgeous', 'princess' and 'baby'. He also described her as 'sexy' and they had a discussion about hairstyles, Southwark Crown Court heard. She responded by agreeing to meet him on his release, when he promised he would take her out and 'spoil' her. Ahmed also contacted Ozyukselen's sister during their illicit relationship, between March 29, 2011 and June 29, 2012. She also engaged in inappropriate mobile phone contact with three other prisoners at HMP Pentonville in north London and other jails between November 14, 2011 and January 23, 2012. One of the prisoners had her number stored as 'Sexy Eyes', while another also phoned her sister. Ozyukselen claimed she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a prisoner attempted to escape from a van, leaving her with facial injuries and bruising. She also suffered long-lasting psychological effects, her lawyer claimed. But Judge Andrew Goymer told her: 'You must have known, and I find it impossible to accept that you didn't, that officers such as you must not have personal relationships with prisoners and the reasons for this are obvious. 'These relationships have a corrupting effect on officers, they warp their judgement, they lead them to do things that are in breach of their duties and it puts them and other officers at the risk of being blackmailed. 'You must have known exactly what you were doing and the harm that it would cause. 'Breach of her duties': Ozyukselen, 24, was contacted almost 60 times by convicted rapist Shahed Ahmed, 22, while he was held at HMP Belmarsh (above) in Woolwich, southeast London . 'The relationship with Shahed Ahmed did not become sexual but it was a relationship of rather close emotional involvement that was quite inappropriate. 'I find it completely incomprehensible why you should engage in this sort of behaviour. These offences are so serious I cannot avoid imposing a prison sentence on you for them.' Sporting a 'Croydon facelift' with her hair scraped back into a bun, and wearing a black coat and stripy top, Ozyukselen bit her nails throughout the hearing. She sobbed as the sentence was passed and called out to her mother, who wept in the public gallery as her daughter was led out of the dock. Prosecutor Tetteh Turkson told the court: 'The defendant was employed by Serco as an officer and started her employment transporting prisoners to court and latterly she was involved in being a dock officer and security officer. 'She was in possession on her arrest of two mobile phones. 'These phones showed her to have made contact illicitly with phones held at HMP Pentonville and landlines at HMP Belmarsh.' Judge Andrew Goymer . Ahmed listed her on a 'controlled prison number list' to allow inmates to keep in touch with friends and family, Mr Turkson said. 'He made a call on March 30, 2012, . referring to her as darling, gorgeous, princess and baby. She agreed to . meet him when he gets out and he said he would take her out and spoil . her. 'On April 6, he called her and said she was sexy and they had a discussion about hairstyles. 'She was arrested on June 27, 2012 at Barkingside Magistrates' Court when she had the two mobile phones in her possession.' In interview, Ozyukselen insisted she didn't know Ahmed and denied having any contact with him. She later claimed a 'crazy person' was contacting her but admitted she had not told her superiors. Michael Cogan, mitigating for Ozyukselen, told the court she 'succumbed to the charm' of prisoners and didn't appreciate the trouble her crimes had caused. 'It is abundantly clear she is very, very immature. There is no suggestion she supplied the mobile phones or brought on any form of contraband into the prison. 'If there was such an offence of gross stupidity, this defendant would be guilty of that. But she is not a dishonest person, she is just vulnerable and immature.' Ozyukselen, from Dagenham, east London, admitted two counts of misconduct in a public office. A third charge of misconduct in a public office was left on the court file.","Yasemin Ozyukselen was contacted nearly 60 times by Shahed Ahmed .

The respondents were asked about their satisfaction with check-in ease, cabin-crew service, cabin cleanliness, seating comfort, baggage handling, and in-flight entertainment. Along with JetBlue, Virgin America got flying colors in the area of in-flight entertainment. Even in coach, every Virgin America seat has its own video interface for ordering refreshments, playing games or watching movies, and even chatting with other passengers. Those and other similar comforts were part of what won the airline the highest ranking. No thanks: Readers named Spirit Airlines the worst . ‘The leather seat cushions are so . nice in coach,’ reader Janice Dunn told Consumer Reports. ‘There’s no . reason to fly first class.’ The company also won fans for is . baggage handling. Despite charging $25 each for the first and second . checked bags, it received the top score in the category.

Residents in South Florida spotted something in the horizon that they described 'as orange or red fireballs in the sky' Caught on camera: West Palm Beach resident Amanda Mayer said she noticed the bright flare in the night sky on Sunday and thought it was somebody flashing a light . Likely a meteor: The bright flare that many saw was likely a sporadic meteor, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Sabrina Laberdesque . ‘I was like, 'Wow! That's weird,’ said Mayer. ‘I just started videotaping, and that's when it happened.’ The bright flare that many saw was likely a sporadic meteor, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Sabrina Laberdesque. A sporadic meteor is a rocky object that comes from the asteroid belt, Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society in New York, told NBC News. He said that his organization received 27 reports within about the first two hours of the incident, an unusual amount for what he called a 'common' event. ‘This is a lot of reports to come in quickly,’ Hankey said. Gauging by those reports, the meteor passed somewhere over the ocean, he noted. ‘These fireballs are common,’ Hankey said. ‘It’s rare for any one person to see one more than once or twice in their lifetime. But on any given night, it might happen somewhere in the globe a few times in a day.’ ‘People should not be scared of the sky falling,’ he added. Unusual sight: 'I was like, 'Wow! That's weird,' said Mayer. ¿I just started videotaping, and that's when it happened' Multiple reports: Numerous residents responded to the sighting online . After a meteor exploded over Russia on Friday injuring more than 1,000 people, a growing number of false meteor reports have come in, in many cases mistaking planes and birds for meteors, Hankey said. If the same incident is reported by multiple sources in a short time span then it becomes more likely to be a legitimate meteor sighting, he said. In South Florida, the Coast Guard found that the reported fireball vanished in an instant. Coast Guard officials sent out a helicopter to check out a report of a flare near the MacArthur Causeway in Miami, but found nothing there, Laberdesque said. ‘I was pretty sure it was a meteor because of everything else that's been happening,’ Mayer said. A similar distant meteor sighting took place in Northern California less than 24 hours after the meteor explosion in Russia.

The veterans, most of whom served as pilots, are reuniting at the presidential memorial in Yorbalinda, California to commemorate their return to the U.S. in 1973 after years of torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese. This Friday, the Nixon Library is recreating the star-studded event President Richard Nixon hosted at The White House on May 24, 1973 to celebrate their homecoming - the largest dinner party ever held at the Executive Mansion. Scroll down for video . Homecoming: President Richard Nixon gives a thumbs up as he welcomes an audience of 450 former POWs and their guests to the White House on May 24, 1973 to celebrate their release .

That offensive paved the way for Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to negotiate the January 1973 peace accords that called for a cease-fire and . the release of prisoners, some of whom had been in captivity for nearly six years. In celebration of their freedom, President Nixon splashed on a star-studded bash - the largest dinner party held on the grounds of The White House with 1,300 guests descending on the South Lawn. A giant tent, that was longer and wider than The White House itself, was erected to accommodate the crowd, with 126 round tables set up for the guests. Bob Hope, John Wayne and Sammy Davis .

'He was a hero to us,' retired U.S. Marine Capt. Orson Swindle, who spent six years and four months in Hanoi prison camps, told the Associated Press. 'He will always be revered by us as a group because he got us home, and we didn't know how we were going to get home.'

Crash victim: Laura Farrell, 41, was killed in the car crash in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last year . An angry woman driver who killed a bank worker in a car crash while driving in a 'fast and furious' manner following a screaming row with her boyfriend today faced up to 14 years in prison. Sheri Torkington, 32, denied causing the death of Laura Farrell by dangerous driving but was yesterday found guilty by a jury. Bolton Crown Court heard Torkington was so angry she jumped a red light and hit Mrs Farrell's car who was driving her husband to work in the early hours of the morning. Mrs Farrell, 41, a HSBC bank worker, suffered fatal injuries in the accident in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and died at the scene. Her husband Norman, 52, was left with a broken neck, nine broken ribs, a broken collar-bone, three fractures to his pelvis and a punctured lung. A witness told the court how she awoke at 3am to see Torkington having a row with boyfriend Phillip . Holt. The couple were said to have been 'shouting screaming and yelling' at each other in a row over her ex-lover. Torkington then got into . her Ford Fiesta and was seen to angrily revv up her car engine before . wheel spinning away. She careered through residential streets . in Bolton, Greater Manchester before ploughing into Mrs Farrell’s Ford . Focus at up to 45mph. Torkington - who has since married Mr Holt - showed no emotion as she was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving following only 30 minutes deliberation by the jury. She denied the charge insisting she had only had a 'minor disagreement' with Mr Holt in the run up the crash. She said the traffic lights were on amber when she went through them. Seriously injured: Mrs Farrell's husband Norman, 52, pictured left, suffered a broken neck in the crash.  Torkington, 32, pictured right, denied causing death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury . After the verdict Mrs Farrell’s brother Fraser Robbins, 42, a baker, said: 'We feel relieved this case is over. 'It’s been nearly two years that . we’ve been waiting for some closure. The guilty verdict has gone some . way to help us but whatever the sentence will be it’s not going to bring . Laura back. We were very close, she was my big sister by 10 months and . it was just the two of us. 'She was quite quiet and reserved but . she always had a big smile on her face when we saw her. She was devoted . to Norman and would go to bed at 7pm if she was driving him to work at . 3am. She’d then go and do a full day’s work herself. It’s been a . difficult time for Norman and all the family. 'Remaining calm throughout this trial was difficult, but we are a reserved family and we did it for Laura.' The tragedy on June 29, 2011, began . when witness Joan Haslam, who lives in Tonge Moor Road, Bolton, woke up . and looked out of her window to see Mr Holt, who she knew from the local . cricket club, arguing with Torkington outside for ten minutes. Mr Darren Preston prosecuting said: . 'She heard shouting and screaming coming from outside. She looked out . her window and there she saw a male and a female. 'We say that the female was the . defendant. Mrs Haslam saw her get into the car after Holt walked off and . she drove off at speed. The defendant was angry and aggressive because . of the argument and she drove aggressively and recklessly as a result.' Mrs Farrell had been taking her husband to work at a cheese distribution factory where he worked night shifts in her black Ford Focus. Crash scene: The junction on Turton Street, Bolton with the A666 St Peters Way, where the accident happened . A cyclist saw Mrs Farrell’s . proceeding through a green light - only for Torkington’s car to jump a . red light in to the path of the black Ford Focus. Torkington's car . pushed Mrs Farrell’s vehicle into the crash barrier and then spun into . the middle of the dual carriage way at 3.25am. Mr Farrell, who had been in a . relationship with Laura for 23 years, but were only married for seven . added: 'Laura took the car out of gear, coasting up to the lights which . were on red - we must have been travelling at 10mph. 'The lights started to change as we . were about 10 to15 metres away from the lights. I looked to the right . and by the time I looked left all I could see was grey and a crunching . noise and that’s all I remember.' Mr Farrell woke up in Bolton Royal . Hospital to be told his wife had died in the crash. He sustained a . broken pelvis, neck and collarbone and a collapsed lung and spent two . months in hospital. He now has abscesses on his brain, liver and lung. A victim impact statement revealed he . had had trouble sleeping and has been fed through a tube and a syringe . because of on-going problems with his stomach. Torkington, of Nuffield Close, . Halliwell, Bolton, who only started driving in September 2010, later . denied being angry after her bust up with her partner and denied . speeding through the red light. She said she had watched Mr Holt play . pool at a pub, before heading to another bar. They returned home around . 10.30pm and had a 'minor disagreement' after which she drove him to his . daughter’s house. She left her then 14-year-old son to look after her other children. Giving evidence, Torkington said: 'It . was a minor disagreement. I vaguely remember the disagreement being . about my ex. To me an argument is screaming and shouting at each other.' She added: 'I have a plate in my left . leg, plate in my left arm. I had three broken metatarsals, a torn . spleen, a fractured pelvis. I was cut from front to back. I hit my head . severely. I was in hospital for three weeks.' Torkington was remanded on bail so . could find suitable care arrangements for her four children. She will be . sentenced next week and faces up to 14 years in prison. She was given . interim driving ban and was banned from entering pubs and clubs. She was . placed on a 7pm to 7am curfew.

A benefits cheat who claimed she could barely walk due to crippling arthritis was caught working - as a children's entertainer at a holiday park. Greedy Caroline Hartshorn, 38, claimed more than £5,000 of taxpayers' money in disability allowances on the basis she needed full-time personal care. But the married mum-of-two from Skegness, Lincolnshire, was exposed as a fraud after investigators found she working at a holiday park - as well as three other jobs. She worked as a children's entertainer at The Tavern pub at Mablethorpe Chalet Park during the summer of 2011 and spring of 2012. Between April and June 2011 Hartshorn also worked as a caravan sales assistant, a care assistant and a market manageress. Skegness Magistrates Court heard the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) received an anonymous tip off. The court was told she was overpaid £5,140.35 in Disability Living Allowance between December 2010 and August 2012. Hartshorn, from Skegness, admitted two charges of failing to notify change of circumstances when she appeared at court last Wednesday. JP's gave her a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay £100 in costs. The court heard Hartshorn was born with arthritis and began to claim for her condition in August 1992 with a care element added from 1995. In 2009 Hartshorn filled in a self-assessment form on which said she could only walk ten yards at a time and needed personal care.

Details of the late night incident first emerged days before the local elections in which UKIP made big gains. CPS guidelines state that low-level crimes by first-time offenders can be dealt with out of court using cautions, fines or community service if it is deemed appropriate. Nigel Farage refused to discuss the case, telling reporters: ‘‘I have nothing to say, I have nothing to say, you’re ****ing in the wind with me.’ Mr Farage will receive a conditional caution after the incident near St Paul's Cathedral .

A man was rescued by a father and his daughter after jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and managing to survive the 220-foot plunge. Scott Walecka, 56, of Santa Cruz, was sailing his 38-foot vessel Animal to San Francisco to prepare for Friday's Spinnaker Cup race from the city to Monterey when his daughter, 23-year-old Hilary, said she saw a person jump from the bridge shortly before 2 p.m. on Monday. The duo heard a Coast Guard radio call for a jumper in the water moments later and sailed toward the man after spotting him underneath a California Highway Patrol helicopter. Survived: A man jumped 220 feet off the Golden Gate Bridge lived to be picked up by a father and daughter who were sailing nearby . Eagle-eyed: Hilary Walecka spotted the man plunging into San Francisco Bay as she sailed into port with her father Scott . 'He was alive and wanted to be rescued,' Walecka said. Mr Walecka said the man grabbed a life sling they threw overboard. His legs appeared to be broken, but he was able to grab the sling and pull himself to the back of the boat. He described the man, who authorities said was 31 and homeless, as 'buff' and 'fit.' The man said he was from Alabama, but appeared incapable of saying much else, Walecka said. They sailed to a Coast Guard station in Sausalito accompanied by a Coast Guard vessel. Man overboard: This sailboat, called Animal, is the the very boat on which the unidentified man was pulled onboard . More than 1,600 people have jumped from the Golden gate bridge since it opened in 1937. At least 33 people died by suicide by jumping off the span in 2012. In 2011, 37 people jumped to their . deaths off the bridge. At least 30 have died every year since 2008, . according to the Bridge Rail Foundation, an organization that advocates . for a suicide-prevention barrier on the span. In 2008, the bridge transit district approved plans to build a $50 million suicide-prevention system. However, the system would not be funded with bridge toll revenue, and it currently faces a $45 million shortfall. From there, the man was transferred to Marin General Hospital by fire officials. Southern Marin Fire Protection District Chief Jim Irving said yesterday he did not know the man’s condition. More than 1,500 people have jumped to their death from the span since it opened in 1937, making it one of the world’s most active suicide spots. It’s not clear what prompted the man to jump on Monday, but few people ever survive the plunge. Most jumpers die a grisly death, with massive internal injuries and broken bones, while others simply drown in the frigid waters of San Francisco Bay.

David Davis MP: 'They think we are better off, they think we are toffs' David Cameron and his Cabinet are seen as well-fed toffs living in a different world, David Davis warned last night. In a devastating analysis, the former Tory leadership contender said the Prime Minister needed to ‘get a grip’ in order to convince voters he shared their fears and aspirations. Mr Davis said appearing out of touch could damage the Prime Minister’s prospects, just as sleaze had undermined John Major’s premiership. Although the intervention has angered Tory high command, senior officials admit Mr Cameron is aware of the dangers and will push working-class ministers into the political frontline over the coming weeks. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Davis warned that Budget decisions to cut the top rate of tax while imposing a ‘granny tax’ and a ‘pasty tax’ have created a new class divide and left poor and middle income earners feeling like they have been ‘pushed off the escalator’. He also warned that the decision to cut child benefit had convinced voters that Old Etonian Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ‘don’t know how we feel and work, what our lives are like’. Man of the people? Osbourne may munch a pastry - but can David Cameron keep a grip on his party's image? Mr Davis, who grew up in a council flat, . said: ‘It’s an unfair allegation, but it’s a powerful one, and it works . against us. They think we’re toffs. ‘The truth is, they look at the front bench, they see them all very well . dressed, well turned out, well fed, and perhaps feel that they’re in a . different world to them. Sleaze undermined John Major - could 'being a toff' undo Cameron? The “we’re all in this together” phrase is very . important – but at the moment it’s not working. ‘Governments always have to watch this, that they don’t get stuck with . an impression that plays against them. In John Major’s day it was . sleaze. Today this may be its equivalent. If it sticks it makes almost . everything you do impossible to make work.’ A senior government source indicated that Tories with more humble . backgrounds would now put the case to voters that the Tories are on . their side. Foreign Secretary William Hague is expected to be asked to undertake . more media appearances, along with Communities Secretary Eric Pickles . and party chairman Baroness Warsi. ‘Take a step back and look at people like William Hague, Eric Pickles, . Patrick McLoughlin (chief whip) and Sayeeda Warsi,’ the source said. ‘People don’t care about the Prime Minister’s background. What they care about is that he is competent and he has got a grip.’ But Tory MP Mark Pritchard, secretary of the backbench 1922 Committee, . warned the best option was a ministerial reshuffle to get ‘greater . representation of people from all sorts of backgrounds’ on the front . bench.’ John Redwood: Happy to represent the pasty eaters . He said: ‘Those people that perhaps have struggled at some point in . their life to pay the electric bill or have perhaps arrived in school in . a Morris Minor rather than a Jaguar are more likely to have empathy . with those people who are currently struggling.’ Doubts were also expressed about George Osborne’s chancellorship and his . prospects of succeeding Mr Cameron. ‘George is no longer fit to be . prime minister,’ one junior minister told the Mail. Mr Cameron faced fresh embarrassment over the ‘pasty tax’ last night after his main justification for the raid collapsed. He has claimed it was simply ironing out a loophole that has existed since Nigel Lawson imposed VAT on hot fast food in 1984. But Labour last night released a letter written by Lord Lawson from that year showing he had never intended pasties to be hit. The letter said: ‘It does not apply to food and drink which has cooled . to room temperature by the time it is sold, or to things like pies and . pastries which are sold warm because they happen to be freshly baked.","Former party leader challenger Davis warns Cameron to 'get a grip' on Radio 4 .

'Kidnapper': Ariel Castro kept three dogs in his home - perhaps as pets for his three captives . Three dogs found at Ariel Castro's home could have served as pets for his three captives and were apparently in better condition than the women he imprisoned, it has emerged. A Chihuahua was found in the car with Castro the night he was arrested for allegedly holding three women captive for a decade, while two terrier poodle mixes were found in his Cleveland home. Ohio-based reporter Ed Gallek spoke with Piers Morgan about the animals, and said there was 'some talk' among officers that may have been pets for Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus. 'I am told that the dogs were in reasonably good health,' he said on CNN, adding that the only concerns about their upkeep was that they had matted hair from not enough grooming. He said the role of the dogs was unclear but that an 'R.I.P' message found scrawled on the wall of the basement is believed to have referred to a pet. He added: 'There's some talk in law enforcement circles in recent days about the dogs being pets for the women... That is something that we're still looking into, but that is another possibility.' Morgan added that perhaps the animals had been used as 'noise shields' for what was going on inside the house. Found: These two dogs belonging to Castro were found after he was found to have kidnapped three women . Pet: A third dog was also found in the house where the three women were locked for a decade . The animals have now been taken to animal rescue kennels in Cleveland but police are waiting to see if any of the victims want to keep them before they are put up for adoption. If they do not, the three dogs will be placed in foster homes, Gallek said. They were seized following Castro's arrest on kidnapping and rape charges. He is accused of chaining the women up in his home and assaulting them for years. The good health of the dogs came despite the horrendous treatment the three women allegedly endured at the hands of Ariel Castro after they were snatched from the streets. Michelle Knight was subjected to numerous beatings and treated like 'a punching bag,' a family friend of one of the victims has told CNN. Miss Knight, who vanished in August . 2002, was often hit hit with hand weights and other objects and treated . like a 'punching bag' for 11 years, the friend said. Her relatives say that she is deaf in . one ear, and may need facial reconstruction surgery. She was released . from a hospital on Friday. Held captive: Amanda Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were found living in appalling conditions . Tragic: Michelle Knight was allegedly brutalized by Ariel Castro and beaten so badly that she needs facial reconstruction surgery . Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left. Michelle told CNN in a statement: 'I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time.' She told police that her alleged captor repeatedly raped her and caused her to miscarry at least five times over the years by starving her and punching her in the stomach. It has also emerged that Michelle Berry and Gina DeJesus will require long-term therapy for . injuries such as hearing loss and joint and muscle damage due to the . severe abuse they were subjected for more than a decade. Their injuries were compared to those . suffered by prisoners of war and sources said there were chains coming . from the wall in the basement and dog leashes attached to the ceiling. The women were restrained with them and duct tape in 'stress positions' for long periods that left them with bed sores and other injuries, . according to two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. Evil inside: A 10-foot fence has been erected around Ariel Castro's now-boarded up house on Seymour Avenue . Other reports said that Amanda Berry was saved from the worst of the abuse because she was a favorite of Castro's. 'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one . of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight. Amanda was photographed . smiling immediately after the dramatic rescue. In contrast, DeJesus wore a hooded sweat-shirt covering her head when . she first went home last week, and Knight was hospitalized for days, and . has stayed out of public view. The sources said DeJesus and Knight were gaunt and had closely cropped hair when they were freed. See below for video .","A Chihuahua and two terrier poodle mixes lived at the Cleveland home .

Honour: The crew of HMS Edinburgh were cheered by crowds as they paraded along the Royal Mile in the Scottish capital . Turned away: Staff at the Ensign Ewart pub in Edinburgh refused to serve the sailors granted the Freedom of the City that very day - because they were wearing uniform. The pub is named after Charles Ewart, who single-handedly captured the standard of the French 45th Regiment at the Battle of Waterloo . Around 250 officers and other service personnel from the Type 42 destroyer had marched through the city, led by a Navy brass band. They were then granted the Freedom of the City to applause from the crowd. Years of service: HMS Edinburgh, seen set to depart Ocean Terminal in Leith earlier this week, is on a farewell tour .

The pub is named after Charles Ewart, a Sergeant in the Royal North British Dragoons, who single-handedly captured the standard of the French 45th Regiment at the Battle of Waterloo. A Royal Navy spokeswoman said the servicemen were not breaking any rules. She said normally crew would not be allowed to go out and drink wearing their uniforms but they had been given approval because of the parade. A spokeswoman for the pub claimed staff had followed licensing regulations, which she said made it illegal to serve people in full dress uniform. 'We work within the confines of licensing laws,' she said. But City of Edinburgh Council officials said there were no licensing laws banning people in military uniform from being served alcohol. A previous ban had applied to policemen, but that law was no longer in force,the authority said. HMS Edinburgh is on a farewell trip around the UK and will enter her base in Portsmouth for the final time on May 31.

Media mogul Alexander Lebedev faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of politically-motivated hooliganism . A witness at media tycoon Alexander Lebedev’s trial yesterday said she was  giving evidence against him ‘by accident’. Natalia Parkhomenko told how she went to see the Russian  version of the FBI – the Investigative Committee – on a separate matter and was told they needed people to testify against Mr Lebedev, the owner of the Evening Standard and The Independent newspapers. Mr Lebedev faces up to five years in jail in Russia after he punched a property mogul during a TV talk show. In recent weeks, several witnesses have refused to testify for the state. But Miss Parkhomenko did – albeit unwittingly. ‘I am here totally incidentally,’ she said. ‘I came to the Investigative Committee on a completely different matter and was asked, “By the way, did you watch that show? We need witnesses”. So I am here.’ She told the court she could ‘hardly remember’ the verbal dispute and ensuing punch which was aired on a Russian TV channel 20 months ago. ‘I got a call that I must come today or they will force me to come. I gave up an exam I was due to take today.’ Miss Parkhomenko told the court she found the incident ‘extraordinary’ when she watched it on TV, adding: ‘I don’t remember anything like this.’ But she also said that Sergei Polonsky – the man Mr  Lebedev struck – had verbally provoked the media owner. ‘I want to say I do not see Lebedev’s guilt in it. I think both are to blame here,’ she said. The case turns on whether Mr Lebedev was ‘politically motivated’ in twice striking Mr Polonsky, an accusation he strongly denies. A similar charge of ‘politically motivated hooliganism’ was brought against two Pussy Riot singers who were jailed for two years for a cathedral protest against president Vladimir Putin. Charge: Alexander Lebedev is accused of politically-motivated 'hooliganism' after punching Sergei Polonsky on Russian television . On trial: Alexander Lebedev, right, talks to his lawyer Genri Reznik, centre, alongside his wife Elena Perminova, left, during a break in proceedings . Testimony: A witness told the court she had been ordered to give evidence by the Russian secret service . Mr Lebedev, 53, was in court yesterday, accompanied by his wife Elena Perminova, a 26-year-old Siberian-born model. Two cameramen were also called as . witnesses for the prosecution. One, Oleg Tikhomirov saying that Polonsky . ‘did say something rude to Lebedev – or something abusing’ before the . strike. Farce: Lebedev and his lawyer quizzed two cameramen who were called in to give evidence at his trial . Mr Lebedev quizzed him directly and asked if either he or Mr Polonsky were politicians. ‘For me, you are a politician but in the best meaning of this word,’ said Mr Tikhomirov. ‘I also appreciate you as a donor who . helps clinics and museums – unfortunately, I have not heard anything of . this sort about Polonsky, on the contrary.’ Mr Lebedev asked: ‘Did I ever use rude . language?’ Mr Tikhomirov replied: ‘I don’t think so. I am really . sympathetic to you. But Polonsky did say something like “somebody who . does not have a million can go to you know where”.’ At this point, the judge stopped the . exchange and asked the other cameraman, Mikhail Shirokov: ‘Do you . remember Lebedev and Polonsky discussing something political – such as . laws being adopted?’ He said: ‘No, I can’t remember anything like this.’ Another prosecution witness revealed . that she had been randomly approached to give evidence against Mr . Lebedev after stepping off a No 75 bus in Moscow. Sociologist Yulia Kamashina, a mother . of three in her late 30s, was asked directly in court by Mr Lebedev how . she came to be taking part in the trial. ‘Somebody approached me in the street,’ she replied. Celebrity backing: Both Keira Knightley and Sir Elton John have sent letters in support of Lebedev . ‘I was asked: ‘Did you watch that . political show? Are you ready to talk about it and sign the statement? I . thought about it and agreed. ‘There are not that many bright events like this on our TV, so I recalled it and agreed.’ Mr Lebedev said earlier that with an . acquittal rate of 0.4 per cent in Russian courts, he does not expect to . win but that the accusation against him was ‘trumped up’. Mr Polonsky was not in court. The trial continues.

Health officials investigating a cluster of mysterious illnesses in Alabama closed their investigation on Thursday after determining the illnesses were unrelated and were caused by the same viruses that cause flu. The investigation involved 10 people who became sick and were admitted to hospitals in Dothan and Luverne in southeast Alabama. Two died, six remained hospitalized Thursday, and two had been released, state Health Officer Don Williamson said. The 10 range in age from 24 to 87. A cluster of mysterious respiratory illnesses that alarmed southeast Alabama turned out to be nothing more sinister than ordinary cold and seasonal flu . Williamson said health officials took . extraordinary caution due to the emergence of two viruses, including . the new H7NP, in other countries. Southeast Alabama is home to a military base and several aircraft plants that have frequent international travel . 'We looked extremely hard. This represents the way the system is supposed to work,' Williamson said. Testing at a state lab and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed different groups of pathogens were present. Four of the patients had a rhinovirus, the same family of germs that causes the common cold. Three had bacterial-based pneumonia and others had influenza A and H1N1. All seven adults had been admitted to hospitals with symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath . Although it was not known whether the . sufferers had gotten flu shots, the types of illnesses that were . contracted were covered by this year's vaccine. Williamson said the flu pandemic of 2008-09 showed that flu cases are present in Alabama throughout the year. It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for small outbreaks to occur in the spring and summer, he said. Mysterious illnesses are always unnerving, but the cluster report came at a particularly sensitive time. Health officials have been monitoring . two deadly new illnesses that recently surfaced in different parts of . the world - one a deadly form of bird flu that has appeared in China, . the other a SARS-like coronavirus that seems to have originated in the . Middle East. The bird flu has caused 131 illnesses . and 32 deaths since the beginning of the year, according to the World . Health Organization. The SARS-like virus (called MERS) has been identified as the cause of 44 illnesses, including 22 deaths, the WHO said. Neither seems to be highly contagious so far, and neither illness has been reported in the United States. But in a world of daily international . air travel, it's always possible that a new germ of concern will . hitchhike on an infected globetrotter and enter this country. The CDC tested the Alabama patients . for MERS, for different forms of flu and for more than a dozen other . illnesses, the agency spokeswoman said. Dr. Mary McIntyre, head of infectious . diseases for the state public health agency, said the precautions taken . by Alabama were worthwhile. She said using the same protocol, a . pediatrician in north Alabama last year observed a new Coxsackie virus, a . type of hand, foot and mouth disease in children. By identifying the new strain, the disease was able to be slowed and children treated in other states.","Alabama state health officer: 'There is no evidence of any new or unexpected virus circulating'

Found: Convicted killer Phillip Westwater, 44, who went missing from St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle has been found by police and returned to the hospital . Blundering police allowed a convicted killer, dubbed the 'Black Dog Strangler' to remain at large for 12 hours after he escaped a secure mental institution and spent the afternoon drinking in a gay bar, before finally being reported by members of the public. Phillip Westwater, 44, was . detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after paralysing a gay man . during a pub fight in 1989. A year later he killed a gay man who was a fellow inmate at Liverpool’s Ashworth . Hospital with his dressing gown cord, later claiming he was convinced his victim had turned him . into a black dog. But on Januray 1, this year, he left his clothes in a pile at St Nicholas Hospital, Newcastle, after asking to use the toilet during an escorted visit before disappearing. Incredibly it took three hours after the initial report of his escape for officers to change his status to 'unlawfully at large' and still no photograph was released until about 10 hours after he had fled. An inquiry into the botched hunt for the twice-married Westwater, found officers had failed to adequately assess the risk he . posed to the public. Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, Vera Baird, has published the findings of her investigation into the police’s response to Westwater’s escape, that happened on January 2 this year. In it she says the police were 'lulled away from recognising Westwater’s status as an escapee' as they often receive reports of voluntary patients going missing. The reports says that it took three hours after the initial report for the police to change his status to 'unlawfully at large' but even then no risk assessment was done and no photograph was released until about 10 hours after he had fled. 'Mr Westwater was recognised by a member of the public less than two hours after a photograph was issued and was arrested with no difficulty,' the report says. 'It is of note that he, the killer of one gay man and who had slashed another’s throat in licensed premises, was found drinking in company, in a renowned gay bar. Drinking: The murderer apparently spent most of the afternoon in The Bank gay bar before finally being found by police . 'It seems likely that had the police . not been lulled away from recognising Westwater’s status as an escapee, a . timely risk assessment would have led to circulation of fuller . information including a photograph and perhaps to his earlier . recapture.' But Ms Baird concludes the report by reassuring the public that the force has been in the process of correcting their failings. 'My principal concern is to reassure . the public that insofar as any aspect of the Northumbria Police role in . this event fell short of what the public would expect, it has either . been or is in the process of correction, principally through the force’s . own internal efforts,' she said. This has included staff being trained . in risk assessment and to understand the difference between voluntary . psychiatric patients and those committed by the courts. Performer: Drag artist Penny Arcade was on stage at the time Westwater was arrested . Staff at The . Bank said Westwater could have spent all afternoon in the bar, adding . that he did not seem to stand out despite being 'a bit vacant'. Penny . Arcade, the drag artist who was performing at the time, described the . moment the killer was taken away by police: 'He had been in there all . night - he was chatting to one of the regulars who was buying him . drinks. 'He was just sat drinking a pint, nothing unusual, which was why it was so unexpected. 'Ten or 12 policemen came in and went up to the smoking terrace. There was no scuffle, he was just led away. 'It . was all over within about five minutes. As they took him out of the bar . he came right past the DJ booth, but he didn't have much of an . expression - he just looked as if he had resigned himself to the fact he . was going to be taken back.' 'One . of the group he was with saw the picture the police had put out on . Facebook and recognised his tattoos,' Penny added. 'He called the . police. 'There was . quite a crowd outside because people had seen the police vans and there . was a buzz for a while, everyone was talking about it.' A manager of the company which owns The Bank said Westwater could have been caught earlier if the photograph had been available. 'Although he looked a little different, his distinctive tattoos gave him away,' Cris Howe said. 'He had been drinking in the bar most of the day, but as his photo wasn't released till late at night no one knew who they were looking for. I can't believe that it wasn't put out more quickly.' Officers . said they had concerns for Westwater's welfare as he is diabetic. He . has a pump fitted and police said he has enough insulin to last three . days. He has previously been detained at high security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, joining high profile detainees such as Ian Brady. Escape: St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle, where convicted killer Phillip Westwater escaped on Wednesday after pretending that he needed to use the toilet . Westwater has also been detained at Rampton Secure Hospital, Nottinghamshire. His life in detention has not . been without incident. He married fellow patient Susan Scott at high . security hospital Broadmoor but they divorced in 2000. Westwater . then began a secret romance with a nursing assistant Claire Dudley who . worked on his ward at Rampton high security hospital in Nottinghamshire. The pair reportedly wed at a social club in the hospital in November 2008. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said the right to marry was enshrined in the 1988 Human Rights Act.

The boss of BT received a pay package worth almost £10million last year after the company’s share price soared. Ian Livingston saw his bundle of pay and perks rise 23 per cent compared to the previous year, after a host of lucrative reward schemes paid out. The telecoms boss has been at the company for 16 years, and has been chief executive since 2008.Mr Livingston, 48, last year received basic pay of £925,000 as well as a cash bonus of £1.2million. Pay rise: Ian Livingston, chief executive of BT, has seen his overall pay packet jump up 23 per cent in a year . His package also included payments worth £270,000 in lieu of pension contributions, as well as £21,000 in other benefits such as a company car and a complimentary BT landline. Even though his £2.4million basic pay was less than the £2.5million he received last year, the majority of his package is made up in company shares – which have risen some 54per cent in value over the past 12 months. These are set out in the company’s annual report, which was released yesterday. He received shares worth almost £1million from an incentive scheme designed to encourage managers to stay with the business. These shares were given to him in 2009 but were only released during the year. Dividends from similar share pots given to him in 2010, 2011 and last year were re-invested on his behalf, and are worth £282,000. He was also given 665,000 shares, worth £2.1million, that he will be able to collect free of charge if he is still employed by BT in 2015. Strong performance: Livingston, who has been at the company for 16 years, was rewarded by BT's share prices doubling in market value over the past year . Under another scheme Mr Livingston received 1.9million shares, which are worth £6million at yesterday’s share price. This was a scheme that only paid out because the group hit performance targets. The 1,000 most senior BT managers are in the reward plan, and shared a total pot of shares worth £38million. More dividends worth £280,000 were reinvested on Mr Livingston’s behalf from the scheme. The group stressed that the only reason his package had risen in value was because of the rise in the company’s share price over the year. Dividends: Despite having his pay frozen at his own request, Mr Livingston has still made more money than ever through his shares . His salary has also been frozen for the coming year – the third time in five years his basic pay has not increased at Mr Livingston’s request. A company spokesman said: ‘BT has performed strongly over the past three years and this is reflected in the share price which has more than doubled during this time. ‘The turnaround at BT will see more than a thousand BT employees receive large numbers of shares after helping to transform the company.’ He added: ‘BT’s remuneration policy is based on reward for success. ‘The company has more than one million shareholders and they have benefited from healthy dividends, as well as a share price which has more than doubled over three years.’ The company last year saw its annual profits hit £2.5billion. The group is planning to take on key rival BSkyB with its own Sports channel, which will show Premiership football games. The company has bought the rights to show 38 games during the football season, and will make the service available to its broadband internet customers for free in a direct blow to Sky’s prominence in the pay-TV market.","Ian Livingston's earnings have jumped from £7.7m to £9.1m in a year .

'At this time, the heads out and I'm . like ""Oh gosh let's get moving"",' Mr Gibbs told ABC30. 'I ran a couple of red lights.' As soon as their son was born, Mrs Gibbs says she 'scooped him up in my arms and put him up against my chest'. The couple arrived at the emergency room a few minutes later. Racing driver: Sam Gibbs was rushing his wife to hospital when she gave birth to their son in the car . On the road: Warner's birth certificate states his place of birth as Route 168 . 'I just had such an adrenaline rush,' Mrs Gibbs said. I was so scared that he wasn't going to be OK. I didn't . even think about the pain.' Her unusual labor has not put the first-time mother off, however. 'Once we got to the hospital I told Sam this . wasn't too bad I could do this again,' she said. Although every pregnancy is different, labor usually lasts between 10 and 20 hours for a first-time mother. When a labor lasts three hours or less, it is known as precipitous or rapid labor. While it is more common in women who have had children already, a precipitous labor is unusual for for first-time mothers. Too late: By the time the couple reached Clovis Community Hospital their baby had already been born . Warner, who was born two weeks early, arrived so quickly that at first the couple's family did not believe he had arrived in 48 minutes. 'When I called my mom when we were in . the hospital a couple of hours later and it was said and done she said, ""No you're lying, stop it."" And I finally had to tell her eight, or nine . times that no, we had a baby in 48 minutes,' Mr Gibbs said. After Warner's dramatic entrance on May 13, the couple are now looking forward to moving down a gear and getting to know their new son. Warner will also have a lasting reminder of his unusual entrance. On his birth certificate, under place of birth, it lists 'Automobile, Route 168', according to ABC30.","Birth certificate lists place of birth as Route 168 .

Three dogs seized from the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro, the man charged with holding three women captive and raping them over a decade, will remain in foster care until the women decide if they want to adopt them. The women may have bonded with the dogs during their captivity, and it's possible the animals could help the women as the acclimate to freedom, said John Baird, chief Cleveland animal control officer. ‘It kind of makes sense, maybe that there were three dogs, three women,’ he told The Associated Press. The dogs found at Ariel Castro's house included two terrier poodle mixes and a chihuahua . One of three dogs taken from the home of Ariel Castro peers out from its cage at the city kennel in Cleveland . ‘They may have bonded with these dogs. and we would like for them to have a shot at them if they want them, just because it was something they could attach themselves to.’ Dogs Unlimited Rescue will care for the dogs until Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight make a decision. The dogs include a Chihuahua and two terrier-poodle mixes. The rescue group said the animals had matted hair, but otherwise appeared to be in good health. The dogs have since been groomed and spayed and neutered. ‘The animals aren't very shy, so that's usually a sign that they've been cared for at least in some way,’ Baird told local Cleveland station WOIO. When the dogs were first found they had matted hair which has since been cut . The Chihuahua was found in the car with Castro the night he was arrested for allegedly holding three women captive for a decade, while two terrier poodle mixes were found in his Cleveland home. Ohio-based reporter Ed Gallek told CNN last week that the animals were apparently in better condition than the women. He said there was 'some talk' among officers that may have been pets for the women. 'I am told that the dogs were in reasonably good health,' he told CNN. He said an 'R.I.P' message found scrawled on the wall of the basement is believed to have referred to a pet. He added: 'There's some talk in law enforcement circles in recent days about the dogs being pets for the women... That is something that we're still looking into, but that is another possibility.' Morgan added that perhaps the animals had been used as 'noise shields' for what was going on inside the house. Since Ariel Castro's arrest the animals have been cared for by Dogs Unlimited Rescue in Cleveland . The animals have now been taken to animal rescue kennels in Cleveland but police are waiting to see if any of the victims want to keep them before they are put up for adoption. If they do not, the three dogs will be placed in foster homes, Gallek said. They were seized following Castro's arrest on kidnapping and rape charges. He is accused of chaining the women up in his home and assaulting them for years. The good health of the dogs came despite the horrendous treatment the three women allegedly endured at the hands of Ariel Castro after they were snatched from the streets. Michelle Knight was subjected to numerous beatings and treated like 'a punching bag,' a family friend of one of the victims has told CNN. Her relatives say that she is deaf in . one ear, and may need facial reconstruction surgery. She was released . from a hospital on Friday. Held captive: Amanda Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were found living in appalling conditions . Tragic: Michelle Knight was allegedly brutalized by Ariel Castro and beaten so badly that she needs facial reconstruction surgery . Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left. Michelle told CNN in a statement: 'I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time.' She told police that her alleged captor repeatedly raped her and caused her to miscarry at least five times over the years by starving her and punching her in the stomach. It has also emerged that Michelle Berry and Gina DeJesus will require long-term therapy for . injuries such as hearing loss and joint and muscle damage due to the . severe abuse they were subjected for more than a decade. Their injuries were compared to those . suffered by prisoners of war and sources said there were chains coming . from the wall in the basement and dog leashes attached to the ceiling. The women were restrained with them and duct tape in 'stress positions' for long periods that left them with bed sores and other injuries, . according to two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. Evil inside: A 10-foot fence has been erected around Ariel Castro's now-boarded up house on Seymour Avenue . Other reports said that Amanda Berry was saved from the worst of the abuse because she was a favorite of Castro's. 'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one . of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight. Amanda was photographed . smiling immediately after the dramatic rescue. In contrast, DeJesus wore a hooded sweat-shirt covering her head when . she first went home last week, and Knight was hospitalized for days, and . has stayed out of public view. The sources said DeJesus and Knight were gaunt and had closely cropped hair when they were freed. See below for video .","A Chihuahua and two terrier poodle mixes lived at the Cleveland home .

Phthalates are found in everything from car dashboards to shower curtains while bisphenol A is used in regular items such as till receipts, tin cans and sunglasses . Household chemicals blamed for everything from cancer to obesity should face stricter controls, leading scientists say. A declaration signed by almost 89 experts, many of them from the UK, warns the existing regulation of phthalates and bisphenol A is ‘entirely inadequate’. They say the gender-bending chemicals contribute to ‘high and rising serious levels of disease’ by interfering with key hormones. Phthalates are found in everything from car dashboards to shower curtains while bisphenol A is used in regular items such as till receipts, tin cans and sunglasses. Earlier this year, a report from the World Health Organisation declared the chemicals a ‘global threat that needs to be resolved’. The latest declaration, presented to European Union commissioners, says the increase in many hormone-related illnesses is too great to be explained away by lifestyle and genetics. Examples given include the ‘dramatic’ rise in breast cancer in eastern and southern Europe, the ‘strong’ rise in prostate cancer in almost all EU countries and the spread of diabetes and obesity. The signatories of the 2013 Berlaymont Declaration, including many from London’s Brunel University, says EU members must subject these chemicals to more stringent testing. The argue that some damage may be permanent, yet cheap and effective tests exist but are not used. They also warn that for some chemicals, there may be no safe level of exposure and say that the existing regulations are ‘entirely inadequate. Examples given include the 'dramatic' rise in breast cancer in eastern and southern Europe, the 'strong' rise in prostate cancer in almost all EU countries and the spread of diabetes and obesity . Professor Susan Jobling, of Brunel University, said: ‘I and my colleagues are calling on the European Commission to implement a regulatory regime for endocrine-disrupting chemicals that is based on sound scientific principles.’ The campaign group CHEM Trust accused the EU of listening too much to the chemical industry and said the UK is in favour of some of the laxest controls. CHEM Trust director Elizabeth Salter Green (CORR) added: ‘This flies in the face of the most up-to-date research that indicates that our widespread exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals is impacting our health. ‘Men’s sperm quality is deteriorating and hormone-related cancers are increasing – to name just two major health issues that are now strongly associated with exposure.’ The call comes as the EU reviews the way it regulates the substances.","Phthalates and bisphenol A  contribute to rising serious levels of disease’

The sister of the eight-year-old boy killed in the Boston Marathon bombings was finally released from hospital on Thursday, some 39 days after she lost her leg in the attack. Jane Richard's family revealed in a statement that the brave seven-year-old had been discharged from Boston Children's Hospital after undergoing 12 surgeries since the April 15 blasts, which killed her brother Martin, 8. The parents, Bill and Denise Richard, said that they were still heartbroken over the loss of their son but Jane's determination to get better was getting them through. 'While we remain devastated over Martin’s death and all that has happened to us, Jane's determination for getting better is an inspiring source of strength for the entire family,' they wrote. Torn apart: The Richard family has revealed that Jane, 7, (pictured front) has awoken from surgery and was told that her brother Martin (right) was killed in the Boston bombings on April 15 . Denise, 42, suffered head injuries in . the attack, while her husband Bill, 42, was hit by shrapnel. Only their . eldest child, 12-year-old Henry, escaped without injury. The parent said Jane was in good . spirits and was 'looking forward to beginning the next phase of her . recovery,' which will take place at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital . and involve rehab to regain her strength, balance and stamina. The family said they all shared 'very . emotional goodbyes' with the doctors, nurses and staff at the . Children's hospital who 'have taken such good care of not only Jane, but . all of us.' 'Jane and her body will ultimately . dictate the timeline for her stay at Spaulding,' they wrote. 'Jane's . stay will serve as a bridge to what will be the ""new normal"" for Jane . and our family going forward.' The family are holding a Mass in . Martin's memory at a church in their home of Dorchester on June 9, 2013, . which would have been his ninth birthday. Victim: Martin was one of three spectators killed when two bombs detonated at the marathon . Victims: Jane, left, is recovering from the blast that claimed her leg and killed her big brother Martin, right . Earlier this month, the Richard . family revealed the heartbreaking moment their daughter awoke two weeks . after the attack and learned her brother had died. In a statement, the family revealed Jane had 'difficult questions that . needed to be answered.' 'There are not words to describe how hard . sharing this heartbreaking news was on all of us,' it read. Amid the tragedy, the family was . celebrating the progress of little Jane, who has braved a dozen . surgeries to close the wound on her left leg and to eventually prepare . it for a prosthesis. She also battled infections in hospital. 'While she has more trips to the O.R. ahead of her, last night's operation marked an important milestone,' the May 9 statement read. 'If things go well, Jane could be ready to transition to the rehabilitation stage of her recovery in the next few weeks.' Bill . is recovering from his shrapnel wound and is hopeful that he will . regain hearing he lost from the blast, while Denise is recovering from . her surgeries, but is still missing sight in one eye. Henry has returned to school, 'which gives him a needed sense of routine and normalcy', the statement, which was uploaded to the family's website, said.

'We . want to thank the people who quickly got to Jane and addressed her . injury in the street because they saved her life,' it read. 'We also . salute those who stood guard over Martin's body so he was not alone. Those officers will never know how comforting that was in our very . darkest hour.' Jane .

I'll never forget them - that little girl, she was so brave.' The bombs, described by experts as makeshift anti-personnel devices, were made from pressure cookers packed with shrapnel and ball bearings to cause the maximum injuries to bystanders. Police believe they were planted by brothers Dzhokhar, 19, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26. After their images were released by the FBI, Tamerlan was killed in an ensuing gunfight with police. His younger brother was found hiding in a boat outside a home hours later and was treated in hospital for an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck.

Doctors yesterday accused Jeremy Hunt of ‘spouting rubbish’, after he said their controversial contracts had led to worse services for patients. The head of the British Medical Association’s GP committee said doctors were being made the ‘whipping boys’ for wider problems in the NHS. Dr Laurence Buckman said it was unfair to blame doctors for the increased pressure at accident and emergency departments. The war of words has escalated in recent weeks, with the Health Secretary insisting family doctors must once again take ultimate responsibility for round-the-clock care. Mr Hunt has angered GPs by suggesting the out-of-hours arrangements introduced in 2004 are partly to blame for the A&E crisis, and he stepped up his criticism by condemning the scandal of out-of-hours services where ‘you speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam’. He acknowledged that the causes of the A&E crisis were ‘complex’, and partly explained by Britain’s ageing population, but said doctors could take more ‘responsibility’ for their patients. He said: ‘We need to have a clinician accountable for those people when they are outside hospital just in the same way a consultant is responsible for them when they are inside hospital, if we are going to give them the kind of care we all want the NHS to do. It’s a big change and I think the GP contract is part of the problem.’ Personal service: Patients should know that one family doctor (file picture) is responsible for them, and even if their GP is not on call it will be clear that 'the buck stops' with them, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insists . Accusing Mr Hunt of ‘spouting . rubbish’ on the issue, Mr Buckman said: ‘He does not want to bother with . the facts when he can have a bash at those of us who on his own . admission are overworked and strained beyond endurance. ‘GPs are not prepared to shore up a . system that has been rendered unsafe by political meddling.’ Mr Buckman . said the ‘botched’ introduction of the non-emergency 111 phone line had . left people ‘confused’ about where to go for care. He added: ‘People who go to A&E . are not going because of GPs. There is no doubt some of it is because . people are confused about how to get access to out-of-hours services and . some of it is because NHS 111 is sending people there. ‘But some of it is about a rapid rise in demand. We are seeing more people than ever before.’ Mr Hunt, who wants to introduce a new Chief Inspector of GPs, said . reform was urgently needed. He insisted many GPs were keen to make . changes that would allow them to devote more attention to their . patients. Mr Hunt insisted the Labour government's 2004 contracts for GPs were in part to blame for problems being seen now . Mr Hunt said he did not want to . return to the days of GPs getting calls directly from patients at 2am, . adding he acknowledged they worked extremely hard. ‘What I question is . whether we are allowing them to do the things they went into general . practice to do. ‘What we make them do on the contract . is make them tick lots and lots of boxes. I want to change that. I . think the current GP contract is fundamentally flawed by removing . responsibility for out-of-hours services from GPs.’ Mr Hunt added that the ‘buck should . stop’ with GPs for out-of-hours care. While family doctors shouldn’t . have to personally deliver such care for their patients, they should . have to ‘sign off’ to confirm that they are pleased with the service . that is providing care, he said.","Dr Laurence Buckman says GPs are not to blame for A&E crisis .

Police, who have not revealed the child’s age or sex, said the victim told parents that the attack took place last week. The arrested men were all ‘either  working at or having access to’ three Montessori day care centres, police said. Investigation: Detectives today raided three nurseries and arrested five male nursery workers after a toddler claimed to have been sexually assaulted. This is the Bright Eyes nursery in Droitwich . None of the suspects are parents of any of the children there. They were arrested at different sites of the Bright Eyes Montessori nurseries in Worcestershire. The nurseries at Redditch, Bromsgrove and Droitwich have closed voluntarily while police investigate. West Mercia Police stressed that the arrests relate to a single alleged incident by one person on a single child. The child attends one of the nurseries but staff move between the three sites, as do some of the children. It is thought that police expect to . eliminate some of the men quickly, and there is nothing to suggest a . paedophile ring was in operation. At a press conference yesterday, . Superintendent Kevin Purcell said: ‘We do not suspect a ring of . offenders, but we felt it was appropriate to arrest five men. Allegations: Officers from West Mercia Police swooped on three branches of the privately-run Bright Eyes Nurseries in Bromsgrove, Redditch and Droitwich . ‘We are seeking only one perpetrator but based on the available information we have now made five arrests. ‘We are looking for someone with . access to the nurseries, either as an employee or some other . association. Some are staff, others are associates, none are strangers . to the nurseries.’ He added: ‘The incident is alleged to have been relatively recent, we were informed last Thursday. ‘It can be difficult to interview a young victim so officers with  special training have been working with the child.’ Held: Five men have been arrested over an allegation of a child being sexually assaulted at a day nursery. Officers have been searching this premises in Bromsgrove as well as two others . The force said the complainant was a . ‘very young child’. The Bromsgrove nursery cares  for 67 children aged . up to five, and the Redditch site for 36. It is unclear how many children attend the Droitwich nursery. Montessori schools and nurseries have a less academic approach, favouring learning through play. Police have been searching all three nurseries, along with three other properties. Superintendent Purcell said they were taking the child’s disclosure ‘extremely seriously’. He added: ‘Our primary concern is their welfare as well as that of the other children who attend the nurseries. ‘We fully understand how concerning . this disclosure will be to those people whose children attend Bright . Eyes Nurseries, as well as the wider community.’ Parents attending the nurseries were given letters by police officers explaining their activities. This is a file picture of a West Mercia police officer . The men were in custody yesterday at Worcester and Kidderminster police stations. Nobody from the nurseries, which cost parents around £157 a week, was available to comment. Ofsted inspectors rated early years provision at the three sites ‘good’ in their most recent visits. Outside the Bromsgrove site . yesterday, one parent with a child at the nursery said: ‘It’s very . worrying. You expect to send your child to school and be completely . safe. ‘It makes you feel sick to your stomach. I can’t believe what has happened.’ Police said a meeting will be held with parents today to allay fears. The Montessori approach to  education . was founded by Maria Montessori, an Italian medical graduate who . believed in learning through movement. It is thought the three nurseries are not connected to any other Montessori nurseries.

They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks - but you can teach a sea lion to dance, scientists in California have proved. Not only is Ronan the sea lion thought to be the first non-human mammal capable of keeping a beat, she has also turned out to be something of a Backstreet Boys fan. Marine scientists successfully taught Ronan to bob her head in time to music - a skill previously thought to exist only in animals capable of vocal mimicry, such as cockatoos, and parrots - including the boy band's smash hit Everybody (Backstreet's Back). Scroll down for video . She's got rhythm: Scientists have taught Ronan the sea lion to bob her head in time to music . Earth, Wind and Fire: Video footage shows Ronan enjoying the hits of the Backstreet Boys and classic disco tracks from the 1970s . Incredible - and comical - video footage shows Ronan bobbing her head in perfect time with the track. She has also displayed a fondness for 1970s disco classics, particularly Boogie Wonderland by Earth, Wind and Fire. Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, trained the three-year-old sea lion to move in time to a hand signal, which was later replaced by a simple, non-musical sound signal. Ronan was rewarded with a fish everytime she bobbed her head to the varying rhythmic sounds. The team varied the type and speed of the sounds they used to confirm that Ronan was actually following the beat. Researchers used two computer-generated ticks - similar to a metronome - to establish that Ronan wasn't simply bobbing her head in response to the previous beat. Ronan followed the beat even when a continuous metronome was replaced with one that skipped a beat, scientists said. VIDEO  Ronan has a penchant for the Backstreet Boys' music... Bobbing: Scientists at the University of Santa Cruz in California say their study may change our understanding of how rhythm is acquired . The team then introduced Ronan to . musical 'dance' lessons, starting her off with a simplified section of Down On The Corner by Creedence Clearwater Revival, before introducing some pop into the . mix with the Backstreet Boys and Earth, Wind and Fire. Without any prior exposure to the . tracks, Ronan stunned scientists by bobbing to the beat of all of the . songs over the course of multiple trials. The musically-inclined mammal could . also keep time with five different tempos of Boogie Wonderland, . according to the study, which was published yesterday in the American . Psychological Association's Journal of Comparitive Pyschology. Not only did Ronan's bobbing skills . improve markedly over the course of the trials, they have lasted beyond . the experiment, with the sea lion passing follow-up tests a few weeks . after the final session with flying colours. Peter Cook, a doctoral candidate at the Long Marine Lab at UCSC, said: 'Dancing is universal among humans, . and until recently, it was thought to be unique to humans as well. 'When some species of birds were found to have a similar . capability for rhythmic movement, it was linked to their ability to . mimic sound. Now we're seeing that even mammals with limited vocal . ability can move in time with a beat over a broad range of sounds and . tempos.' Study co-author Colleen Reichmuth, . PhD, who is based at the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC, said: . 'Understanding the cognitive capabilities of animals requires carefully . controlled, well-designed experiments. 'This study is particularly rigorous . because it examines, step-by-step, the learning conditions that . supported the emergence of this complex behaviour.' Peter Cook: The doctoral candidate who led the study said it disproved the theory that dancing is unique to humans . Fan: The Backstreet Boys' track Everybody (Backstreet's Back) is among Ronan the sea lion's favourites . In 2011 footage of Snowball the cockatoo bobbing up and down and shaking its feet to pop music swept the internet. The antics of the then 13-year-old bird - which was seen grooving to tracks by the likes of Queen, Lady Gaga, and - just like Ronan - the Backstreet Boys - was hailed by scientists as proof that humans are not the only creatures with a sense of rhythm. While many animals had been known to respond to music, Snowball was the first documented case of an animal with the ability to keep to a rhythm. Ronan the sea lion was rescued from Highway 1 in San Luis Obispo, and now calls the university's Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory home.","Incredible footage shows Ronan bobbing her head in time to music .

An NFL star and gays rights supporter claims he is in talks with a number of football stars about revealing their homosexuality and that up to four are considering coming out at the same time. Brendon Ayanbadejo, who played for last season’s champs The Baltimore Ravens and is an outspoken supporter of gay marriage, told the Baltimore Sun that by coming out together the move would take the pressure of any one player to have to handle being the NFL’s first openly gay star. ‘I think it will happen sooner than you think,’ Ayanbadejo told the newspaper. Ex-Baltimore Ravens and gay rights supporter Brendon Ayanbadejo has said that four NFL players are considering making an announcement about their sexuality at the same time . ‘We're in talks with a handful of players who are considering it. There are up to four players being talked to right now, and they're trying to be organized so they can come out on the same day together. 'It would make a major splash and take the pressure off one guy. It would be a monumental day if a handful or a few guys come out. ‘Of course, there would be backlash. If they could share the backlash, it would be more positive. It's cool. It's exciting. We're in talks with a few guys who are considering it. 'The NFL and organizations are already being proactive and open if a player does it and if something negative happens. We'll see what happens.’ Divisive issue: There has never been an openly gay active player in football's nearly 100-year history . Activists: Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, left, and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, right, have emerged as outspoken LGBT advocates in the NFL . A 10-year veteran, the 36-year-old . Ayanbadejo played primarily on special teams with the Super Bowl . champion Ravens. He had a career-high 30 tackles from scrimmage last . season, a sack and 14 stops on special teams. Ayanbadejo made the Pro Bowl in his first season with the Ravens after also making it twice while with the Chicago Bears. The revelation follows a report last month by CBS sportswriter Mike Freeman that a player is reportedly preparing to make a public announcement about his sexual orientation before the 2013 season . He wrote: 'I'm told that a current gay NFL player is strongly considering coming out publicly within the next few months - and after doing so, the player would attempt to continue his career.' Freeman did not say who the player is or any specifics about when his announcement would be made. Openly gay former player Scott Fujita told Freeman: 'I honestly think the players of the NFL have been ready for an openly gay player for quite some time now. Homophobia: Both Chris Clemons, left, and Chris Culliver, right, have made anti-gay comments in recent months . He added: 'Trust me, the coming out of a player would create much bigger waves outside the locker room than inside.' But on the opposite end of the spectrum are opponents and a culture of homophobia. Last month Seattle Seahawks defensive end Chris Clemons tweeted: 'Who on God's earth is this person saying he's coming out of the closet in the NFL?' He said a player revealing that they are gay would be a 'selfish act' by somone 'just trying to make themselves bigger then the team.' Days before the Super Bowl, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was asked about the prospect of gay players in the locker room during a radio interview. Culliver shot back: 'I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that.' When asked if he believed there were any gay players on the 49ers roster, Culliver responded: 'No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do.'

A debate about gay players in the NFL . was sparked anew in the Manti Te'o 'fake girlfriend' hoax, where the . former Notre Dame football star claimed that he was the victim of a . prankster who was posing as a woman and later faked her death. It was alleged that Te'o was gay and had invented the online persona in an attempt to cover it up. He denied he was behind the scam - as well as being gay - in an interview with talk show host Katie Couric. At the NFL scouting combine last month, Te'o - as well as several other players - were reportedly asked about their sexual orientations. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called such a line of questioning 'unacceptable,' and the New York attorney general has urged the league to investigate. Michigan quarterback-turned-receiver Denard Robinson, Colorado tight end Nick Kasa and Michigan State running back Le'Veon Bell indicated they were asked about their sexual orientation at the combine last month in Indianapolis.

The National Institute for Health . Research will start 175 recruiting patients for a £1.9m UK trial of the drug, minocycline, next month. The study comes after a chance observation in Japan caused researchers to test the drug in patients with schizophrenia first in Japan itself, and then all over the world. Trials have already been held in Israel, Pakistan and Brazil where schizophrenic patients treated with the drug showed significant improvement. Before and after: The National Institute for Health Research will start recruiting patients for a £1.9m UK trial of minocycline next month. Pictured, a brain soon after schizophrenia diagnosis (left) and five years later. - (Courtesy of Paul Thompson/UCLA School of Medicine) Scientists believe schizophrenia and other mental illnesses including depression and Alzheimer's disease may result from inflammation in the brain. Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects which could account for the positive findings. The first account of the antibiotic's positive effects appeared in 2007, when a 23-year-old Japanese man was admitted to hospital suffering from persecutory delusions and paranoid ideas. The subject had no psychiatric history and blood tests and brain scans showed nothing unusual. He was started on halperidol a powerful anti-psychotic drug, but it had no effect. However when he developed severe pneumonia a week later and was prescribed the antibiotic the infection was cleared and the psychosis resolved within two months. However, minocycline does not work as a cure. Effective treatment? Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects . When the patient stopped taking the drug, his psychiatric symptoms got worse again. But another treatment with minocyline made him better again. The UK trial will recruit patients recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, Jeremy Laurance, a member of the Schizophrenia Commission, told The Independent. Half the patients will take minocycline with their standard anti-psychotic treatment, the other half will take a placebo. Brain scans will be carried out at the beginnning and end of the year-long trial to compare loss of grey matter which is an effect of schizophrenia. Tests will also measure inflammatory markers in the blood. Paul Jenkins, CEO of the charity Rethink Mental Illness told MailOnline:  'We welcome the early promise shown by minocycline in treating psychosis in people with schizophrenia. 'Nowhere near enough time or money currently goes into to researching treatments for schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses, which cause pain and suffering for many thousands of families across the UK.'","Link was discovered after man suffering from paranoia was also treated with antibiotics for pneumonia .

The man accused of murdering five-year-old April Jones in a sexually motivated attack today told a jury he put her body 'somewhere where it has not been found'. Mark Bridger, 47, claims he cannot remember what he did with the schoolgirl after she died because he was suffering from memory loss. Elwen Evans QC, prosecuting, told Mold . Crown Court that after April’s disappearance police mounted the biggest . search in British history for her. Accused: Mark Bridger, in the blue shirt, is cross examined by Elwen Evans QC (left) as April Jones' mother and father (top left) look on from the public gallery . She said police had 'looked everywhere', and asked Bridger: 'Where did you put the body?' Bridger replied: 'I can’t recall. I still believe I have placed her somewhere.' The former slaughterhouse worker claims April died when she was accidentally hit by his car. He said he cannot recall what happened to her afterwards because of the combined effects of alcohol and panic. Victim: April Jones, five, who Bridger claims died when she was accidentally hit by his car . Miss Evans said April's body has not been found because Bridger was trying to cover up what he had done. She said: 'Why has April’s body, not any a part of it, been found?' The defendant replied: 'I have put her somewhere where it hasn’t been found.' Bridger denied putting the body somewhere 'carefully chosen'. Miss Evans said: 'It’s just one of those things? That wherever you have put her was just a search site that the police never looked? Is that what you are saying?' Bridger replied: 'You are asking me to speculate here and I can’t do that.' He said he told police at the time about the places he had been and walked, including caves and rivers. Miss Evans said police had been 'up hill and down dale, down mine shafts and not found her anywhere'. Bridger told the jury he had a recollection of 'holding' April and placing her on the floor in front of the fireplace in his living room at his cottage, Mount Pleasant. Asked about the presence of saws, hacksaws and knives in his living room, which the prosecutor described as 'weaponry', Bridger told the court they were 'tools' for outdoor activities. Grief: April's parents Paul and Coral Jones arrive at Mold Crown Court today where they heard Mark Bridger say he put the schoolgirl's body 'somewhere where it has not been found' 'I love my bushcraft,' he said: 'They are tools I have used - saws for cutting wood, hacksaws for making knife handles and walking stick handles - all of which I do in my living room.' Earlier, Miss Evans asked Bridger whether he had been 'sexually frustrated' on the day April disappeared. He said: 'No, not at all.' She asked if he had looked at indecent images of children on his laptop that day. The defendant replied: 'I can’t remember if I looked at it, I clicked on a picture.' Questioned about the indecent images . of children which were found on his laptop, Miss Evans asked the . defendant: 'Are you a paedophile?' 'No', Bridger said. Court: Mark Bridger outside Mold Crown Court where he has been giving evidence under cross examination about the death of April Jones . Accused: Mark Bridger denies murder at Mold Crown Court . The barrister continued: 'Why do you have indecent images of children on your computer?' Bridger replied: 'A lot of them were . for looking into the development of my son and daughter. Some I didn’t . even know were there. Others I put aside to complain.' Miss Evans said that was 'absolute nonsense' adding: 'You deliberately saved each and every one of those pictures.' Questioned about a search for, . 'naked five-year-old girls', he said: 'That’s a mistake I made on that . one, it should have been 15. 'This was all to do with my daughter’s development. 'It was a mis-type.' Bridger told the court that he would be 'happy' to show one of the pornographic images found on his laptop to his son or daughter when they were 'learning' about sex. Miss Evans said: 'So you would be happy to show your children that image?' He replied: 'At the right time. If my son came to me and asked me about sexual things. How things work. That would be a picture I would not be frightened to show him.' Bridger also described another one of the images, which showed a picture of young girl, aged 10 or 12, with a snake as 'beautiful'. He said the picture was from a 'non-sexual nudism' site. The court was shown a picture of a clothed six year old girl that was saved in Bridger’s ZO file, which the prosecution say he saved his pornography on. Miss Evans asked why he had a picture of the child in that folder. Bridger said: 'I don’t know why. This is not a sexy pose. She’s a friend of my daughter’s. She’s six years old.' The defendant, of Ceinws, mid-Wales, denies abduction, murder and intending to pervert the course of justice by disposing of, concealing or destroying April’s body. The schoolgirl disappeared on October 1 last year. The prosecution say the defendant snatched and murdered her in a sexually motivated attack. Bridger says he accidentally killed . April when he ran her over and accepts he must have got rid of her body, . but cannot remember how. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 05:34 EST, 23 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:32 EST, 23 May 2013 . Psychotic: Dale Pipe stabbed a fellow fitness enthusiast 16 times with an axe and kitchen knife . A psychotic bodybuilder obsessed with Batman's arch nemesis the Joker has admitted carrying out a terrifying unprovoked axe attack on a stranger in a public gym. Former chef Dale Pipe asked 'Why so serious?' - the phrase uttered by Heath Ledger's character in The Dark Knight - immediately after attacking a fellow leisure centre user. The deranged 20-year-old had armed himself with an axe as well as kitchen and craft knives, before targeting a 22-year-old man at Belle Vue Leisure Centre in Consett, County Durham, in January. The victim, who was using a urinal when he was attacked, suffered 16 wounds to the head, neck and chest. Pipe was overpowered by leisure centre staff who bundled him into a changing room toilet and called police. Meanwhile, Pipe, barricaded inside the toilet, used his mobile phone to post the chilling words: 'Why So Serious!!! Hahahahaha' in a macabre reference to the maniac Joker, who used a blade to lethal effect in the hit movie. Weeks earlier, Pipe, who previously worked at the Derwent Manor Hotel, near Shotley Bridge, also revealed online he had completed the violent Batman computer game Arkham City and said it was '100 per cent the best game I've ever played'. Police said the case had disturbing similarities to last summer's Colorado cinema massacre in the US when 24-year-old James Holmes shot dead 12 people and injured dozens more while dressed as the Joker. Are you serious? Pipe wrote the Joker's catchphrase from The Dark Knight. He had also been playing the franchise's computer game just weeks before . Attack: The incident at Belle Vue Leisure Centre, Durham, barricaded Pipe into a toilet as they waited for the police to arrive . Inspector Chris Davis, of Consett Police, told The Northern . Echo that 'Why So Serious?' is: 'What the Joker says. If it not about the film what other . connection could you make to it? Details of the case are reminiscent of the mass-murder of 12 . people in Colorado last summer by 24-year-old James Holmes, who told police he . was the Joker.' On July 20 2012 a mass shooting took place at a midnight showing of new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado. The gunman, believed to be James Eagan Holmes, threw tear gas into the crowd and opened fire. Seventy people were shot or wounded in what is the deadliest shooting in the state.Ten people died at the scene and two died later in hospital, including six-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. A 12-gauge Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun was used. Holes was apprehended behind the cinema, near his car, just before 1am. According to reports he had died his hair red and called himself The Joker. On November 16, 2012, the Aurora Victim Relief Fund announced each claimant will receive $220,000. When asked about the Colorado shootings Insp Davis added: 'That would be my thoughts. Obviously, it . bears comparisons to the American case, doesn’t it? 'If you look at Pipe’s Facebook page you will be aware of . the references to Batman and his gaming.' Appearing at Newcastle Crown Court, Pipe, of Thornfield Road, The Grove, Consett, admitted attempted murder as well as three charges of possessing an offensive weapon. The court heard his mental condition is being assessed to see if it is appropriate for him to be sent to Rampton Secure Hospital, in Nottinghamshire, after sentencing on June 24. His solicitor, Stephen Thornton said: 'Professor Don Grubin concluded he was highly psychotic at the time and remains so.' Pipe, who appeared via videolink from Durham Prison, was remanded into custody. Judge James Goss, Recorder of Newcastle, said: 'This is a case where the pressing matter is a proper investigation into his mental health. 'I am not in a position to take this case further today because significant medical investigation has to be undertaken.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Dale Pipe, 20, asked 'Why so serious?' after stabbing victim 16 times .

When asked to rank organisations they believe have their interests at heart, religious institutions came out on top for a very modest 17 per cent of people – exactly the same as the omnipresent internet search engine. Reason to celebrate: Chief executive Eric Schmidt's company Google is as trusted as religious institutions . And in a world where more people go shopping than to church on a Sunday, it seems that many now place their faith in supermarkets, as the big chains such as Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s were held up as most trustworthy by 19 per cent. Uphill struggle: New Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will have to find a way to reconnect with the British public . The figures may well alarm the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Rt Rev Justin Welby, who faces an uphill struggle in reconnecting with the concerns of ordinary Britons. The study asked more than 2,000 people to rank the top three institutions they trusted the most. Overall, the NHS came out highest on 37 per cent, ahead of the police on 26 per cent and big charities on 21 per cent. As well as revealing which organisations the public relies on, the Future Of Britain report, published today, aimed to lift the lid on how the rising cost of living and economic crisis has imposed lifestyle changes – and it claims to reveal a nation in survival mode. It said: ‘We are highly pessimistic about our economic future. Most Britons – 73 per cent – envisage at least two more years of economic misery. Within this, 11 per cent think it’s permanent, 21 per cent believe it could last five to ten years and 41 per cent two to five years.’ But the report added: ‘Rather than being defeatist, in many ways the slump is bringing out British qualities last seen during World War Two, such as prudence, self-reliance, self-confidence, personal responsibility, flexible attitudes to work and mobility and a greater interest in local communities.’","For public trust the church only ranked on a par with Google .
